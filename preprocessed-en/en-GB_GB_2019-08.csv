It has the capacity to exceptionally change the way that humans interact not only in the digital world, but also with each other, through their work and surroundings institutions. Some years ago, the area of AI was restricted to technology and corporations, but now it has proven to be a valuable asset in health, medicine, finance, ecommerce and a variety of other industries. AI reflects abundant opportunities to create new jobs, new industries and new ways of connecting and AI is beginning to help with how the real estate industry operates in Bangladesh. AI has been playing an important role in real estate industry through e-commerce property portals. At first international e-commerce property portal themove.com created history with the introduction of robot named 'Amy' created by AI. Following this, many companies are now starting to utilise AI to give an efficient and pleasant experience to their customers. In recent years, AI is also making vital changes in Bangladesh's real estate sector. Historically, people who want to buy property had no other option but to visit places and find property individually. Today however they can easily see thousands of property just by clicking on their mobile anytime, anywhere through companies such as Bproperty.com. AI is then playing a vital role in how consumers view properties.
