Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are already prompting calls for teaching to be automated, learner-driven and ‘teacher-proof’. While these technologies might still require non-specialised&amp;nbsp;classroom&amp;nbsp;facilitators and&amp;nbsp;technicians, the&amp;nbsp;role&amp;nbsp;of the highly trained expert teacher is coming under increasing threat.&amp;nbsp;There&#039;s&amp;nbsp;a growing sense that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/the-deconstruction-of-the-k-12-teacher/388631/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we don’t really need teachers in the same way any more&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Put bluntly, the entire premise of ‘the teaching profession’ faces an impending challenge. In a future where&amp;nbsp;education&amp;nbsp;can be reliably provided by machines, why&amp;nbsp;continue to&amp;nbsp;invest millions of dollars in&amp;nbsp;training human experts&amp;nbsp;to do the job?&amp;nbsp;Given the likely trajectory of technological developments over the next few decades, is there anything&amp;nbsp;that an expert teacher does&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;machines&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;be able to do?&amp;nbsp;As an education researcher and teacher, I&#039;d like to think that there is!&amp;nbsp;Here, then, are&amp;nbsp;six&amp;nbsp;aspects of expert human teaching that are getting overlooked in the current rush toward automating the classroom:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers have learned&amp;nbsp;what they know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is clear benefit from being with someone who can pass on knowledge, especially someone who&#039;s&amp;nbsp;previously&amp;nbsp;been in the&amp;nbsp;position of having to learn&amp;nbsp;that knowledge.&amp;nbsp;This latter qualification is a uniquely human characteristic. When a learner learns with an expert teacher, they&#039;re not simply gaining access to the teachers’ knowledge, but also benefiting from the teachers’ memories of&amp;nbsp;learning it themselves. Technology can be pre-loaded with content of what is to be learned. Yet, no AI technology is going to ‘learn’ something exactly the way a human learns it, and then help another human learn accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;make cognitive connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A human is uniquely placed to sense&amp;nbsp;what another human is cognitively&amp;nbsp;experiencing&amp;nbsp;at any moment, and respond accordingly.&amp;nbsp;In this sense, face-to-face&amp;nbsp;contact with a teacher offers learners a valuable opportunity to engage in the process of thinking&amp;nbsp;with another human brain. On one hand, there is something thrilling about witnessing&amp;nbsp;an expert&amp;nbsp;who&#039;s modelling the process of&amp;nbsp;thinking things through. Conversely, a human teacher is also able to make a personal ‘cognitive connection’ with another individual who is attempting to learn.&amp;nbsp;As David Cohen&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674051102&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;, teachers are uniquely able to “put themselves into learners’ mental shoes”. Despite the best efforts of computer science, many aspects of&amp;nbsp;thinking cannot be detected and modelled by machines in this way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; data-caption=&quot;&quot; data-guid=&quot;159fb126-a4c7-4364-9a39-87b26363fe15&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/cognitives/image/upload/v1529022213/zbemnz0tb8gyblleqr16.jpg&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100% !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;make social connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teaching is a mutual obligation between teachers and learners. No teacher can stimulate the learning process without the cooperation of those who are learning.&amp;nbsp;Good teachers make personal connections with their students, helping them gauge what might work best at any particular time. Before attempting to intellectually engage with a group,&amp;nbsp;teachers&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leseprobe.buch.de/images-adb/65/5b/655b3cd2-0fa7-4600-8948-276ca758c857.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will&amp;nbsp;“take a mental pulse of students’ demeanours”&lt;/a&gt;. Teachers work hard to establish this&amp;nbsp;mutual commitment to learning, as well as sustaining engagement through motivating, cajoling and enthusing individuals. All of these are interpersonal skills that come naturally to people rather than machines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;talk out loud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is something transformative about being in the presence of an expert teacher talking about their subject of expertise. Listening to an expert talk can provide a real-time, unfolding connection with knowledge. A good speaker doesn&#039;t stick rigidly to a written text, but refines, augments and alters their argument according to the audience&amp;nbsp;reactions.&amp;nbsp;A teacher speaking to a group&amp;nbsp;of learners therefore engages&amp;nbsp;in a form of spontaneous revelation. Key to this is the teacher’s role in leading and supporting learners to engage in active listening. As&amp;nbsp;Gert&amp;nbsp;Biesta&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00131857.2015.1041442&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt;, being addressed by another person interrupts&amp;nbsp;one’s&amp;nbsp;ego-centricism&amp;nbsp;– drawing&amp;nbsp;an individual out of themselves&amp;nbsp;and forcing them into sense-making.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good teachers make personal connections with their students, helping them gauge what might work best at any particular time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers perform with their bodies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bodies of human teachers are an invaluable resource when engaging learners in abstract thought.&amp;nbsp;Teachers use their bodies to energise, orchestrate and anchor the performance of teaching.&amp;nbsp;Many subtleties of teaching take place through movement – pacing around a room, pointing and gesturing.&amp;nbsp;Teachers make use of their ‘expressive body’&amp;nbsp;– &amp;nbsp;lowering&amp;nbsp;their voice, raising an eyebrow or directing their gaze. Crucially, a human will respond to the&amp;nbsp;living biological&amp;nbsp;body of another human in a completely different&amp;nbsp;way to even the most realistic simulation. Being&amp;nbsp;looked in the eye&amp;nbsp;by another person is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;qualitatively different&amp;nbsp;experience&amp;nbsp;than being&amp;nbsp;looked&amp;nbsp;at by&amp;nbsp;a 3D humanoid robot,&amp;nbsp;let alone a 2D cartoon agent on a screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;improvise and ‘make do’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A key part of good teaching is the human capacity to improvise. Rather than sticking tightly to a pre-planned script,&amp;nbsp;teachers&amp;nbsp;will adjust what they do according to the circumstances. Like most&amp;nbsp;performative&amp;nbsp;events, teachers approach a session with a rough plan or structure. However, thereafter they improvise their way around these aims and objectives. Teaching requires acts of creativity, innovation and spontaneity – akin&amp;nbsp;to dancing or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may07/vol64/num08/Teaching-as-Jazz.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;playing jazz&lt;/a&gt;. Teachers and learners feel each other out, find common ground and build upon it.&amp;nbsp;Teaching also demands a tolerance for imprecision, messiness and not knowing. Most human actions involve a degree of guesswork, bluff and willingness to ‘make do’.&amp;nbsp;These are processes of which computer systems are largely incapable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As these examples illustrate, an&amp;nbsp;expert human teacher is able to support learning in ways that can&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;be fully replicated through technology.&amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, these qualities remain largely unrecognised, even by teachers themselves. Many educators consider teaching to be an&amp;nbsp;‘unconscious’ act that is&amp;nbsp;difficult to pin down and articulate. Yet such coyness does little to dispel the technology-driven arguments currently being made&amp;nbsp;against&amp;nbsp;the teaching profession. Teachers need to speak up&amp;nbsp;and make an irrefutable case for the continued presence of expert professionals at the forefront of classrooms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An&amp;nbsp;expert human teacher is able to support learning in ways that can&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;be fully replicated through technology.&amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, these qualities remain largely unrecognised, even by teachers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how can we&amp;nbsp;rehabilitate&amp;nbsp;human teachers in the minds of their detractors?&amp;nbsp;The uphill battle in countries such as Australia is to revitalise schools and classrooms to allow teachers to work in the ways just outlined.

Teachers need to&amp;nbsp;speak&amp;nbsp;forcibly&amp;nbsp;about these qualities – among&amp;nbsp;themselves, within their professional associations, with parents, politicians, pundits&amp;nbsp;and anyone else with&amp;nbsp;influence.&amp;nbsp;Teachers also need to&amp;nbsp;argue directly against the tech industry and&amp;nbsp;corporate reformers looking to replace them with machines. There is obvious value in the human expert teacher.
