Jonathan Berry took part in a Brussels discussion last week on AI regulation including MEP Axel Voss, rapporteur on the EU’s AI Act, which is now close to being agreed. While the UK is still not close to enacting similar legislation, and has instead told existing regulators to draw up rules on AI, Berry said the two sides should work with each other and trade information as the technology evolves. “I think there are really valuable opportunities for shared learning here,” he told the event, held on 15 February, co-hosted by Voss and the UK’s EU mission. In common with the EU’s AI Office, which is being set up to help member states enforce the act, “the UK’s approach also has a central function, seeking to monitor and evaluate risks, spot regulatory gaps, and ensure cohesive governance. I am certain that we can learn a great deal from each other,” Berry said. Berry’s comments appear to be part of a broader warming of relations between the EU and UK on science and technology, which have been bedevilled since 2021 by acrimonious, stalled negotiations over UK membership of the EU’s Horizon Europe research programme. Last September, UK association was finally agreed following a higher-level breakthrough over the status of Northern Ireland in the post-Brexit settlement.  Since then, relations have warmed, with research commissioner Iliana Ivanova last week visiting the UK to drum up interest among British businesses for the programme. Science love-in During his visit to Brussels Berry also met EU research ministers as part of an informal session of the bloc’s competitiveness council. A spokesperson for the UK’s EU mission described his trip as part of a “global science love-in”. “Areas such as AI are the ones that is probably most critical for us to develop a new relationship on,” said Lindsay Appleby, the UK’s ambassador to the EU, speaking at the AI event. “They're not the kind of areas where you can simply reach for a rule book”. This cooperation matters because although the EU has written the world’s first comprehensive legislation on AI, the UK is on most measures far ahead of any EU member state in actually creating the technology, and often second only to the US and China.  Last year, the UK’s AI companies attracted around the same amount of investment as the entire EU. The UK had more AI unicorns, private start-ups valued over $1 billion, than Germany, France and Switzerland put together. “There is a lot we can do together to advance responsible AI globally,” said Berry. He is open to sharing risk registers with the EU as both map out the potential hazards of AI. “To be honest, a risk register that only talks about the risks inherent in one country is […] not useless, but it's more useful the more you share it,” he said. Common copyright Berry said the UK would also likely take a similar approach to the EU by making sure that creators are renumerated if their work is used in the training of AI models. Journalists and writers have long complained that big AI companies have hoovered up their work without asking. The New York Times, for example, is currently suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright violations. A recent UK House of Lords committee report warned that AI companies were exploiting copyrighted material “without permission or compensation”. “There's probably a landing zone, reasonably close actually, to what our friends in the EU are doing,” said Berry of the UK’s AI copyright approach. “It is absolutely crucial anybody coming up with a product of the mind can expect to be rewarded for that in just the same way, regardless of whether AI exists or doesn't exist,” he said.  “And that's so important for our society. That's what makes us who we are.” Evolving circumstances Despite promises to cooperate with Brussels, the UK is still taking a more hands-off approach on AI regulation. Earlier this month, London confirmed it is still not ready to put forward legislation on AI, a reluctance that has annoyed some MPs. “We are going to take our time to get this right – we will legislate when we are confident that it is the right thing to do,” the government said. Instead of legislation, the UK has given its existing regulators five principles to incorporate into their remits, and insisted that it will remain “strongly pro-innovation.” Berry described the UK’s approach as “trying to build our system out of Lego rather than out of concrete” that was “adaptive to evolving circumstances with fast moving tech”. But the challenge the UK faces in trying to set standards for AI regulation is that companies might instead align with EU rules to gain access to a much bigger market. Asked about this “Brussels effect” in AI policy, Berry said that the creation of AI was currently “truly global”, and it was near impossible to develop a model just in one country. “So I think they will all have to use the different regulations of the different markets they're in,” he said. “And that's going to be complicated.”","UK offers EU cooperation on artificial intelligence policy and copyright The UK’s artificial intelligence minister has offered to work with the EU on regulation, and said that London would likely take an approach to copyright in AI that was “reasonably close” to Brussels.

While the UK is still not close to enacting similar legislation, and has instead told existing regulators to draw up rules on AI, Berry said the two sides should work with each other and trade information as the technology evolves. “I think there are really valuable opportunities for shared learning here,” he told the event, held on 15 February, co-hosted by Voss and the UK’s EU mission. In common with the EU’s AI Office, which is being set up to help member states enforce the act, “the UK’s approach also has a central function, seeking to monitor and evaluate risks, spot regulatory gaps, and ensure cohesive governance. I am certain that we can learn a great deal from each other,” Berry said. Berry’s comments appear to be part of a broader warming of relations between the EU and UK on science and technology, which have been bedevilled since 2021 by acrimonious, stalled negotiations over UK membership of the EU’s Horizon Europe research programme. Last September, UK association was finally agreed following a higher-level breakthrough over the status of Northern Ireland in the post-Brexit settlement.  Since then, relations have warmed, with research commissioner Iliana Ivanova last week visiting the UK to drum up interest among British businesses for the programme. Science love-in During his visit to Brussels Berry also met EU research ministers as part of an informal session of the bloc’s competitiveness council. A spokesperson for the UK’s EU mission described his trip as part of a “global science love-in”. “Areas such as AI are the ones that is probably most critical for us to develop a new relationship on,” said Lindsay Appleby, the UK’s ambassador to the EU, speaking at the AI event. “They're not the kind of areas where you can simply reach for a rule book”. This cooperation matters because although the EU has written the world’s first comprehensive legislation on AI, the UK is on most measures far ahead of any EU member state in actually creating the technology, and often second only to the US and China.  Last year, the UK’s AI companies attracted around the same amount of investment as the entire EU. The UK had more AI unicorns, private start-ups valued over $1 billion, than Germany, France and Switzerland put together. “There is a lot we can do together to advance responsible AI globally,” said Berry. He is open to sharing risk registers with the EU as both map out the potential hazards of AI. “To be honest, a risk register that only talks about the risks inherent in one country is […] not useless, but it's more useful the more you share it,” he said. Common copyright Berry said the UK would also likely take a similar approach to the EU by making sure that creators are renumerated if their work is used in the training of AI models. Journalists and writers have long complained that big AI companies have hoovered up their work without asking. The New York Times, for example, is currently suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright violations. A recent UK House of Lords committee report warned that AI companies were exploiting copyrighted material “without permission or compensation”. “There's probably a landing zone, reasonably close actually, to what our friends in the EU are doing,” said Berry of the UK’s AI copyright approach. “It is absolutely crucial anybody coming up with a product of the mind can expect to be rewarded for that in just the same way, regardless of whether AI exists or doesn't exist,” he said.  “And that's so important for our society. That's what makes us who we are.” Evolving circumstances Despite promises to cooperate with Brussels, the UK is still taking a more hands-off approach on AI regulation. Earlier this month, London confirmed it is still not ready to put forward legislation on AI, a reluctance that has annoyed some MPs. “We are going to take our time to get this right – we will legislate when we are confident that it is the right thing to do,” the government said. Instead of legislation, the UK has given its existing regulators five principles to incorporate into their remits, and insisted that it will remain “strongly pro-innovation.” Berry described the UK’s approach as “trying to build our system out of Lego rather than out of concrete” that was “adaptive to evolving circumstances with fast moving tech”. But the challenge the UK faces in trying to set standards for AI regulation is that companies might instead align with EU rules to gain access to a much bigger market. Asked about this “Brussels effect” in AI policy, Berry said that the creation of AI was currently “truly global”, and it was near impossible to develop a model just in one country. “So I think they will all have to use the different regulations of the different markets they're in,” he said. “And that's going to be complicated.”",uk offer eu cooperation artificial intelligence policy copyright uk artificial intelligence minister offered work eu regulation said london would likely take approach copyright ai reasonably close brussels jonathan berry took part brussels discussion last week ai regulation including mep axel voss rapporteur eu ai act close agreed uk still close enacting similar legislation instead told existing regulator draw rule ai berry said two side work trade information technology evolves think really valuable opportunity shared learning told event held february cohosted voss uk eu mission common eu ai office set help member state enforce act uk approach also central function seeking monitor evaluate risk spot regulatory gap ensure cohesive governance certain learn great deal berry said berry comment appear part broader warming relation eu uk science technology bedevilled since acrimonious stalled negotiation uk membership eu horizon europe research programme last september uk association finally agreed following higherlevel breakthrough status northern ireland postbrexit settlement since relation warmed research commissioner iliana ivanova last week visiting uk drum interest among british business programme science lovein visit brussels berry also met eu research minister part informal session bloc competitiveness council spokesperson uk eu mission described trip part global science lovein area ai one probably critical u develop new relationship said lindsay appleby uk ambassador eu speaking ai event kind area simply reach rule book cooperation matter although eu written world first comprehensive legislation ai uk measure far ahead eu member state actually creating technology often second u china last year uk ai company attracted around amount investment entire eu uk ai unicorn private startup valued billion germany france switzerland put together lot together advance responsible ai globally said berry open sharing risk register eu map potential hazard ai honest risk register talk risk inherent one country useless useful share said common copyright berry said uk would also likely take similar approach eu making sure creator renumerated work used training ai model journalist writer long complained big ai company hoovered work without asking new york time example currently suing openai microsoft copyright violation recent uk house lord committee report warned ai company exploiting copyrighted material without permission compensation probably landing zone reasonably close actually friend eu said berry uk ai copyright approach absolutely crucial anybody coming product mind expect rewarded way regardless whether ai exists exist said important society make u evolving circumstance despite promise cooperate brussels uk still taking handsoff approach ai regulation earlier month london confirmed still ready put forward legislation ai reluctance annoyed mp going take time get right legislate confident right thing government said instead legislation uk given existing regulator five principle incorporate remit insisted remain strongly proinnovation berry described uk approach trying build system lego rather concrete adaptive evolving circumstance fast moving tech challenge uk face trying set standard ai regulation company might instead align eu rule gain access much bigger market asked brussels effect ai policy berry said creation ai currently truly global near impossible develop model one country think use different regulation different market said going complicated
