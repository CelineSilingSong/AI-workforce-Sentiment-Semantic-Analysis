However, we can largely agree that it can affect jobs known as 'donkey works,” he said.</p><p>According to him, staying in the comfort zone was a large challenge, calling on citizens to adapt to the ongoing global changes and demands.</p><p>Mr Katambi said it is important to continue safeguarding country foundations, which will help to move forward and accomplish significant tasks.</p><p>He mentioned the government's investment priorities including infrastructure and technological capabilities; education, skill development, and present legal systems.</p><p>""We should have a system that starts with the formulation of good policies and laws. We have our own laws and penal code on cyber matters. We have made changes, despite the ongoing technological growth,” he said.</p><p>The Information Communication Commission director general, Dr Moses Mwasaga, emphasised the need to balance AI and employees in the workplace.</p><p>“A combination of a robot or AI with a smart employee can boost productivity by up to twenty times,” said Dr Mwasaga, stressing the importance of employers ensuring their employees acquire new skills to thrive in the changing world.</p><p>“We need AI assistants, professionals who develop and use the systems ethically, machine learning trainers, chatbot designers and robot coordinators. Creating our systems is crucial; we can’t rely solely on external solutions,” he elaborated.</p><p>ATE’s chief executive officer, Ms Suzanne Doran said events taking place in recent decades including the Covid-19 outbreak, climate change, wars, and technological advancements have significantly impacted the world of work.</p><p>“The future of work will continue to be influenced by innovation to meet challenges brought by advanced technology, including digital growth. AI will play a crucial role in enhancing and advancing the performance in different sectors,” she explained.</p><p>Ms Doran urged employers to focus on increasing performance, skills, and efficiency at workplaces, noting that the advent of AI necessitates guidelines to promote economic development, efficiency, and productivity, noting that reskilling and upskilling workers are essential for job protection.</p><p>Reflecting on the past, the Trade Union Congress of Tanzania (TUCTA) secretary general, Mr Henry Mkunda, drew parallels between today’s technological changes and the Industrial Revolution when workers protested against job losses due to machines.</p><p>“Once again, the landscape is shifting, with AI now poised to take over. The lessons from the Industrial Revolution's technological changes can guide us in navigating the current scenario,” he shared.</p><p>As AI continues to advance, preparing for its impact on the workplace is crucial, saying through strategic planning, skill development, and collaborative efforts, Tanzania can harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its challenges.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",ai tanzania workplace friend foe rise artificial intelligence ai workplace doubleedged swordwhile concern job displacement valid expert believe ai augment enhance employee capability replace entirelythis central theme highlevel annual conference artificial intelligence future work exploring tanzania readiness held association tanzania employer ate thursday june deputy minister state prime minister office labour youth employment people disability mr patrobas katambi said replacing human being impossible despite technological advancementat agree term wouldisplace area replacement impossible example judiciary artificial intelligence understand hypothetical situation judgment need collaborative evidence interpretation based reality take time ai explainedfurthermore mr katambi said ai work without fed data programmed human beingstherefore area ai need human tuning replacement might work well however largely agree affect job known wouldonkey work saidaccording staying comfort zone large challenge calling citizen adapt ongoing global change demandsmr katambi said important continue safeguarding country foundation help move forward accomplish significant taskshe mentioned government investment priority including infrastructure technological capability education skill development present legal systemswe system start formulation good policy law law penal code cyber matter made change despite ongoing technological growth saidthe information communication commission director general dr moses mwasaga emphasised need balance ai employee workplacea combination robot ai smart employee boost productivity twenty time said dr mwasaga stressing importance employer ensuring employee acquire new skill thrive changing worldwe need ai assistant professional develop use system ethically machine learning trainer chatbot designer robot coordinator creating system crucial cant rely solely external solution elaboratedates chief executive officer m suzanne doran said event taking place recent decade including covid outbreak climate change war technological advancement significantly impacted world workthe future work continue influenced innovation meet challenge brought advanced technology including digital growth ai play crucial role enhancing advancing performance different sector explainedms doran urged employer focus increasing performance skill efficiency workplace noting advent ai necessitates guideline promote economic development efficiency productivity noting reskilling upskilling worker essential job protectionreflecting past trade union congress tanzania tucta secretary general mr henry mkunda drew parallel today technological change industrial revolution worker protested job loss due machinesonce landscape shifting ai poised take lesson industrial revolution technological change guide u navigating current scenario sharedas ai continues advance preparing impact workplace crucial saying strategic planning skill development collaborative effort tanzania harness benefit ai mitigating challenge

<p>The Department of Teacher Education, Section for English and Foreign Languages, offers a full-time, 3-year position as a Ph.D. candidate to take part in the project “Climate Change, Language Education, and AI” in cooperation with<a href=""https://www.ntnu.no/ilu/forskning/nted-digit/nted"" target=""_blank""> the research group on technology and learning in education: NTED-DIGIT</a>. The project leaders are <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/tom.nurmi"" target=""_blank"">Associate Professor Tom Nurmi</a>, <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/fredrik.rokenes"">Associate Professor Fredrik Mørk Røkenes</a>,  and <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/han.han"" target=""_blank"">Postdoctoral Researcher Han Han</a>.</p>

<p>Although AI has the potential to be a tool in climate modeling and remediation efforts, its extractive resource and supply chain costs, e-waste pathways, and carbon footprint actively contribute to pollution and global warming. This project examines how language education can be a site of critical information literacy around environmental climate research and the cost/benefits of AI technologies. The “Climate Change, Language Education, and AI” project explores how AI ed-tech (e.g., text-to-image generators DALL-E/MidJourney) influences students’ epistemic beliefs about environmental climate research and (mis)information in English in the school while also investigating the pedagogical potential of current trends in AI-climate-related natural sciences and humanities projects (e.g., biodiversity monitoring, pollution detection, AI in eco-literature, etc.).  </p>

<p>For a position as a Ph.D. candidate, the goal is to complete a doctoral education and obtain a doctoral degree. The Ph.D. candidate will be affiliated with the research group New Technologies and Educational Design (NTED-DIGIT) and connected to the group’s research activities (seminars, workshops, conferences, etc.). NTED-DIGIT’s main objectives are to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>develop new knowledge about emerging technologies, formative design, and learning processes at all levels of education.</li>
	<li>investigate the use of information and communications technology for teaching and learning using diverse methodological approaches.</li>
	<li>explore the development of teachers’ professional digital competence across subject disciplines and educational contexts.</li>
	<li>identify the impact of digitalization on processes related to teaching and learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The successful candidate will contribute to the project with individual and collaborative research to explore AI’s influence on perspectives about controversial scientific topics, such as environmental climate research, which is an emerging area of research in language education that presents challenges and opportunities for students’ epistemic beliefs. The use of generative AI tools to generate and influence online information and manipulate perceptions is expanding, especially in English, thus increasing the importance of developing students’ critical literacy in language education.  The successful candidate will contribute to the project with individual and collaborative research about how (mis)information in environmental climate research and artificial intelligence (AI) in language education in different language education contexts, including (but not limited to) primary and secondary school and teacher education. The candidate should pursue practices with emerging AI-powered technologies (for instance, popular science texts and resources about climate research influenced by content creation tools such as ChatGPT or DALL-E/MidJourney) and study how student knowledge is relevant to the design of language teaching. This research will contribute to the discourse of environmental humanities, language education, and AI technologies in education.</p>

","PhD Candidate in Environmental Humanities, Language Education and Artificial Intelligence job with NORWEGIAN ... <p><strong>About the job</strong></p>

<p>The Department of Teacher Education, Section for English and Foreign Languages, offers a full-time, 3-year position as a Ph.D. candidate to take part in the project “Climate Change, Language Education, and AI” in cooperation with<a href=""https://www.ntnu.no/ilu/forskning/nted-digit/nted"" target=""_blank""> the research group on technology and learning in education: NTED-DIGIT</a>. The project leaders are <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/tom.nurmi"" target=""_blank"">Associate Professor Tom Nurmi</a>, <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/fredrik.rokenes"">Associate Professor Fredrik Mørk Røkenes</a>,  and <a href=""https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/han.han"" target=""_blank"">Postdoctoral Researcher Han Han</a>.</p>

<p>Although AI has the potential to be a tool in climate modeling and remediation efforts, its extractive resource and supply chain costs, e-waste pathways, and carbon footprint actively contribute to pollution and global warming. This project examines how language education can be a site of critical information literacy around environmental climate research and the cost/benefits of AI technologies. The “Climate Change, Language Education, and AI” project explores how AI ed-tech (e.g., text-to-image generators DALL-E/MidJourney) influences students’ epistemic beliefs about environmental climate research and (mis)information in English in the school while also investigating the pedagogical potential of current trends in AI-climate-related natural sciences and humanities projects (e.g., biodiversity monitoring, pollution detection, AI in eco-literature, etc.).  </p>

<p>For a position as a Ph.D. candidate, the goal is to complete a doctoral education and obtain a doctoral degree. The Ph.D. candidate will be affiliated with the research group New Technologies and Educational Design (NTED-DIGIT) and connected to the group’s research activities (seminars, workshops, conferences, etc.). NTED-DIGIT’s main objectives are to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>develop new knowledge about emerging technologies, formative design, and learning processes at all levels of education.</li>
	<li>investigate the use of information and communications technology for teaching and learning using diverse methodological approaches.</li>
	<li>explore the development of teachers’ professional digital competence across subject disciplines and educational contexts.</li>
	<li>identify the impact of digitalization on processes related to teaching and learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The successful candidate will contribute to the project with individual and collaborative research to explore AI’s influence on perspectives about controversial scientific topics, such as environmental climate research, which is an emerging area of research in language education that presents challenges and opportunities for students’ epistemic beliefs. The use of generative AI tools to generate and influence online information and manipulate perceptions is expanding, especially in English, thus increasing the importance of developing students’ critical literacy in language education.  The successful candidate will contribute to the project with individual and collaborative research about how (mis)information in environmental climate research and artificial intelligence (AI) in language education in different language education contexts, including (but not limited to) primary and secondary school and teacher education. The candidate should pursue practices with emerging AI-powered technologies (for instance, popular science texts and resources about climate research influenced by content creation tools such as ChatGPT or DALL-E/MidJourney) and study how student knowledge is relevant to the design of language teaching. This research will contribute to the discourse of environmental humanities, language education, and AI technologies in education.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>The Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) at New York University Abu Dhabi invites applicants to apply for the open Postdoc position in the Project Collaborative Multi-Robot Swarms in Unknown Environments.</p>

<p>CAIR invites qualified applicants with a doctorate degree in the areas of electrical, or computer, or mechanical engineering, or related field to apply. A strong publication record is encouraged and previous experience in areas such as Distributed control and optimization, Swarms, Autonomous Robots, Embedded systems development, Collaborative and adversarial control, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is desired. The position is open to PhDs with background in robotics, controls, AI, and/or computer vision. The candidate is expected to work in a highly collaborative multi-disciplinary environment with other post-doctoral associates, PhD and undergraduate students, as well as faculty members. It is expected that applicants have a strong publication record in the aforementioned areas.  The applicants are also expected to have strong analytical, communication, and writing skills.</p>

<p>The successful applicant will work on several projects including development of distributed multi-agent autonomous systems and related technologies. This will include development of distributed monitoring algorithms enabling agents in a multi-agent swarm to autonomously locate other agents in its neighborhood, analyze their behavior, and probabilistically predict future motions/behaviors. As part of this work, the successful applicant will work on sensor data processing and data fusion, dynamics modeling and estimation, multi-agent collaboration algorithms, and inter-agent distributed introspection of agent behaviors to detect behavioral modifications (e.g., due to malfunctions and/or attackers). The algorithmic development will need to take into account various uncertainties and possible adversarial elements wherein some agents in a swarm have been modified by an adversary. The work will include algorithm design, prototype implementation (e.g., in Matlab/Python), deployment (to the agents’ autopilots using the Robot Operating System), and experimental testing (on unmanned vehicle swarms).</p>

<p>A solid competency with the standard implementation tools used in autonomous robots and embedded systems (e.g., C, C++, Linux, MATLAB, Python, Robot Operating System, Ardupilot, Solidworks, Gazebo Physics Engine Simulator) is required.</p>

<p>The terms of employment are very competitive and include housing and educational subsidies for children. Applications will be accepted immediately and candidates will be considered until the position is filled. For consideration, applicants need to submit a cover letter, curriculum vitae with full publication list, degree transcript, statement of research interests, and at least two letters of reference, all in PDF format. If you have any questions, please email Professor Antonios Tzes at <a href=""mailto:anthony.tzes@nyu.edu"">anthony.tzes@nyu.edu</a>, or Professor Farshad Khorrami at <a href=""mailto:khorrami@nyu.edu"">khorrami@nyu.edu</a> .</p>

<p><strong>About CAIR:</strong></p>

<p>The Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) is a leading research center led by Profs. Tzes, Khorrami, and LeCun as Director and Co-Directors, respectively. Its mission is to develop cutting edge technologies in robotics and AI (Autonomous Robots, SLAM, Navigation, Perception, Human-Brain Interface, Deep Learning and their Security, etc.).
