Using India as a case study, the manuscript outlines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics affect women’s opportunities in developing countries. Women in developing countries, notably in South Asia, are perceived as doing domestic work and are underrepresented in high-level professions. They are disproportionately underemployed and face prejudice in the workplace. The purpose of this study is to determine if the introduction of AI would exacerbate the already precarious situation of women in the developing world or if it would serve as a liberating force. While studies on the impact of AI on women have been undertaken in developed countries, there has been less research in developing countries.

As humans struggle to learn 21st-century skills, employers are increasingly turning to the mind-bending capabilities of AI software and increasingly humanlike robots to fill in the gaps in the workforce. There is no question that new technologies are automating a range of tasks that people are tired of performing. Many people have found they no longer want to do the boring, repetitive work that makes them feel like robots. And employers are relentlessly employing technology to “free up” people from that leaden kind of work. The truth is, robots and software don’t take away jobs. They simply automate tasks; it is ultimately a human’s decision if a job gets taken away. That is why we need to embrace human-centric work. Your human ability to solve new problems, to continually adapt, to use creativity and to empathise with others – these are all unique skills that technology won’t replace for a very long time.  That doesn’t mean that many jobs won’t be lost. Manual work has been on the decline since the 1950s, when, in the US, for instance, more than 1 million people worked in clothing factories, almost 1.5 million in the railway system, and more than 500,000 in coal mining. Technology replaced many of these roles, improving the quality and efficiency of output, but displacing workers. The pre-pandemic numbers weren’t very encouraging, either. A 2017 study by the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that 73 million jobs would be automated worldwide by 2030. The pandemic created some temporary labour shortages that in some cases means jobs won’t go away as quickly. But in other cases, it has dramatically accelerated automation to fill unmet demand. Robots are now making pizzas, cleaning skyscraper windows, harvesting food and many other formerly human tasks. Robotic process automation software, which uses AI to learn quickly how a repetitive human task is performed and then repeat it automatically, is being used in white-collar settings in jobs once the sole domain of humans. Of course, humans have worried about job-stealing technologies for centuries. At the dawn of the industrial revolution in Britain, a group of workers known as the Luddites demanded higher wages and destroyed textile machinery. The relentless march of technology will inevitably continue to erode work. But it can also create a huge amount of new work, if we make sure three important things happen.   First, we need to shift the attention of startups and investors from simply automating human tasks, to empowering people to learn new skills and solve new problems more effectively. In this way, AI can not just create more jobs, it can create better ones. As we move forward, new roles are being created every day, each of which requires a new skillset. Consider that a few short years ago, a role like social media manager didn’t even exist – and now that job is everywhere. New exponential technologies can breed exponential opportunity. Second, each of us needs to commit to continually learning new skills. As the shelf life of information continues to decay, we need to increasingly focus on “flex” skills, which are often (and unfortunately) called soft skills. In the future, an increasing number of skills will no longer be sector-specific, but will be applicable across all industries, such as problem-solving, adaptability, creativity and empathy – what I refer to as PACE. In fact, a recent Deloitte Australia report found that almost two thirds of occupations will be based on such skills by 2030. We need to be lifelong learners to continually stay ahead of robots and AI. Finally, employers must do their part. They need to develop and buy those technologies that help to empower humans. They need to commit to training and job design that ensure that workers are continually employed. Laying off workers whose skills are no longer required is an “old rule” of work. As the rate of technological change only increases, no specific job title will remain the same for long. That is why organisations should empower their employees not only to constantly learn but to learn how to learn, baking skills development into the day-to-day work of every employee. If we fail to do this, we’ll continue to have the dramatic mismatches that characterise our work markets today – plenty of jobs available, but fewer people trained to do them. But if we commit to co-creating these “next” rules of work together, the workplace of tomorrow will be far more humane, and we’ll ensure that no human is left behind.",Comment - Opinion,https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/D2XRU4ZWKZUUONTLZJHOJ7SDPQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=f61d89f9f0bdc17b08cc4758fd9a674398bde88e4635c94c8acef0e7d93474eb&width=400&height=267,[None],[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He sat behind a steering wheel and pedals that transmitted commands to the forklift thousands of miles away; large screens offered views in front, behind, and to the sides of the vehicle.
The vehicle relies on limited artificial intelligence to avoid obstacles and safely come to a stop if the connection between France and the US were to fail. But the AI isn’t yet clever enough to let the robotic forklift navigate on its own through an unfamiliar warehouse or take on a new task.
The work was surprisingly easy, McCarter says, although he found it a little tricky to keep track of the vehicle’s position relative to nearby obstacles. “It's definitely challenging to operate in a facility that you've never physically set foot in,” he says.
McCarter works for a company called Phantom Auto. He was testing the company’s remote technology that lets a driver operate a forklift without physically sitting in the vehicle. Two major logistics companies, ArcBest and NFI, plan to begin using the tech later this year, hoping to tap a wider pool of forklift drivers who live far from a specific warehouse. The warehouse and transportation industry had a record 597,000 job openings in November, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Many office workers have gone remote during the pandemic, with some firms making the shift indefinite. But the continued challenges posed by the virus and a deepening labor shortage—combined with advances in technologies such as AI and virtual reality—are allowing a small but growing number of physical jobs to go remote as well.
“There's just no way this isn't going to explode as a category,” says Matt Beane, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara who studies human-robot workplace collaboration. As industrial machines become more capable and connected, Beane says, the number and variety of these jobs will grow.
Beane says new forms of remote physical work may involve supervising multiple autonomous machines, similar to how one person oversees several AI chatbots simultaneously. Chatbots can handle many common questions but will lose the thread when the conversation veers off topic or becomes complicated, annoying users.
The approach can help companies find new workers and create more efficient processes, but it could be less positive for workers. Some remote jobs are handled by lower-paid workers overseas. And some companies see remote human labor as a temporary way to train AI algorithms that will eventually replace them.
For now, people are essential because of the limits of AI and automation. AI has made impressive leaps over the past decade thanks to cheaper and more capable hardware and progress in machine learning, which lets computers learn from examples. But the messy physical world still often confounds algorithms. Robotic arms struggle to pick up and manipulate objects they’ve never seen before, for instance, and self-driving cars cannot make sense of scenes that differ from those in their training data.
Some companies see remote human helpers as a stopgap. This week Ocado, a UK-based retail and technology company, revealed new robots capable of picking items from bins more efficiently. Ocado is one of several companies that use machine learning to train robots to grasp objects from bins. The AI can struggle, because the items are ever changing, making it hard to know how to grab one out of a pile. So human operators help show the robots how to grab when they get stuck. James Matthews, CEO of Ocado’s technology division, said at a Wednesday event that the company has teams of robotic pilots in Mexico and the Philippines who can remotely suggest the best way to grasp new products. The lessons help the algorithms improve, perhaps to the point when humans may not be required.
ArcBest, which uses Phantom Auto’s technology, has developed AI software that lets its forklifts perform some operations on their own, like driving from one point to another. Still, people are needed for more complicated work such as unloading trucks or stacking pallets.
Phantom Auto has sold its remote driving technology to companies working on self-driving cars and delivery robots. These vehicles can handle many situations on the road autonomously but struggle with unusual situations, poor weather conditions, or instrument anomalies, requiring a person to step in and help.
Another company that is hiring remote workers for traditionally physical jobs is Einride, a Swedish maker of self-driving trucks. Currently, Einride’s remote drivers operate only in limited situations, such as moving goods around a large factory in Kentucky that makes General Electric appliances. But CEO Robert Falck says there’s no reason why the drivers couldn’t help drive trucks on real roads. “It's been very obvious that you need to combine remote control with autonomous operation to create a robust and reliable transport setup,” Falck says.
The range of remote work offered on job boards appears to be growing, especially in sectors where AI is being adopted. A number of companies that use drones to inspect or scan work sites or farmland also rely on a combination of autonomy and remote operation.
Travis Deyle, CEO of Cobalt Robotics, which sells robotic security guards to patrol office buildings, says humans are a small but important part of the setup. The robots can navigate around a building autonomously, but humans help when they get stuck or come across something odd. Remote human operators can speak through a microphone if the robot comes across a stranger.
Human teleoperation is “a thinly veiled trade secret” for companies that are working on advanced robotics and automation, says Beane of UCSB. He says that as AI improves, remote operators will no longer be needed for some tasks but says new remote tasks may emerge in other areas.
Beane says one of his research projects shows that the way companies choose to design these roles may make them either dull and simple or interesting and more skilled. He believes this has implications for the future opportunities of those workers. “People have in mind this exploitative picture, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessary,” he says.
Updated, 1-27-22, 12:15pm ET: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Einride's remote drivers move goods around a General Motors factory in Michigan.

Online food delivery. 3D printing. Smart robots. Autonomous vehicles. Genome engineering. The proof of spectacular innovation and transformation is all around us, and while it is transpiring at a meteoric speed, it is also creating a host of new job roles that demand an unprecedented set of skills.



The Fourth&nbsp;Industrial Revolution, also known Industry 4.0, is disrupting and will continue to disrupt the way we live, learn and work. While certain jobs will fade away, others will flourish, and jobs that don’t even exist today will become more commonplace. The coronavirus pandemic has probably accelerated that timeline substantially. What is clear is that the future workforce will need to match its skillset to the relentless pace of technology.



According to the “Future of Jobs 2020” report by the World Economic Forum, the dual impact of automation and Covid-19 will displace 85 million jobs by 2025. However, among the jobs that are likely to stay, 50 percent will require reskilling. The current disparity between the skills possessed by today’s youth and what the market needs is at risk of widening even further as Industry 4.0 revolutionises businesses and job roles faster than people can keep up.



Both the youth and professionals of today need to build future resilient skills that will help them adapt and thrive.



The Skills in Demand





So, what are these key skills that will help candidates face the wave of the fourth industrial revolution?



•&nbsp;Soft skills:&nbsp;The ability to interact, communicate and work together with a range of people, such as co-workers, clients and leadership, is what makes up soft skills. As people increasingly work beside robots,





Data science experts are desired in almost every field, from logistics and e-commerce to health-care and banking. Millions of companies and government entities depend on big data to succeed and better serve their customers.





essential human skills – such as creativity, complex problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, emotional intelligence and people management – will be irreplaceable by machines. No robot can replace the perfect worker, or oversee a team, or play the role of a leader. Hence, leadership and managerial skills will continue to be integral. Communication skills will also remain crucial as employers will still need people to engage and build relationships both internally and externally. With the current emphasis on company culture and teamwork, emotional intelligence will continue to be a crucial element in building high performing teams and increasing motivation in the workplace. Social skills are equally important too, especially when it comes to building friendships and strong networks, which in turn is needed for personal development and career growth.



• Technical skills: Technical or “hard” skills such as computer programming, coding, project management, financial management, scientific tasks, and technology-based skills represent the knowledge and capabilities required to perform job-specific tasks. As new job opportunities are being created due to technology, so is the demand for skilled professionals who possess industry-specific technical skills and targeted training. It is obvious that a strong set of technical skills will continue to be critical. It is, hence, crucial to determine and understand what the industry-specific demands are so that job-seekers are better prepared for the demands of these roles.





• Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurship is the knowledge, the mind-set, and the ability to transform a potential work or business idea into a reality that includes not only those who set up a new business but also those who are described as self-starters within their work environment. As the gig economy grows, more and more young people will take the initiative to launch new ventures enabled by entrepreneurial skills such as innovation,





In the future, more and more industries will be depending on artificial intelligence and machine learning, which will lead to an incredible growth in the job market for talented AI and ML specialists.





creativity, diligence, resourcefulness, resilience, curiosity, optimism, risk appetite, courage, and business acumen. Hence, people who possess entrepreneurial skills would be better placed to navigate the changing job environment, and would be more likely to be resilient towards future challenges.



Jobs of the Future



As technology rapidly evolves, the above combination of skills could help job-seekers chase the top careers of tomorrow. So, what will be the most in-demand job roles in the future?



• Data Analysts and Data Scientists:&nbsp;Data science experts are desired in almost every field, from logistics and e-commerce to health-care and banking. Millions of companies and government entities depend on big data to succeed and better serve their customers. Data science careers are already soaring in demand and this trend will continue. Degree programmes in both data science and data analytics have been designed to develop the skills that employers are seeking and provide students with the opportunity to build hands-on experience prior to graduating. Deriving real business value from data needs a unique blend of technical skills, numerical knowledge, storytelling, and intuition.



• Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) Specialists: AI is destined to create some of the most significant and disruptive innovations of this century. Autonomous cars, chat bots, and smart home devices are all the applications and creations of an evolving AI era that will redesign the way we live and work. In the future, more and more industries will be depending on artificial intelligence and machine learning, which will lead to an incredible growth in the job market for talented AI and ML specialists. No matter what the new AI economy means for the future workforce, young students and professionals will undoubtedly benefit from entering this growing field.





• Digital Marketing Specialists: Digital marketing has taken over. Today’s consumers have become extremely dependent on digital platforms for various purposes such as online shopping and telehealth. The field of digital marketing is booming and as the significance of online media grows, so does that of digital marketing. An accomplished digital marketer needs strong analytical thinking, a knack for creativity, and a data-informed decision-





As a society, we need to consider how existing roles will change and how people with at-risk jobs can shift to roles where they work in tandem with technology and go on to add value on top of it.





making approach. This is important because data now allows us to deploy marketing campaigns that provide Internet users with personalised products, communications, and suggestions. A career in digital marketing means a fast-paced environment where something new is just beyond the horizon. Digital marketers need to stay updated about new tools and changing guidelines governing the various channels; so lifelong learning is certainly a unique part of this field.



• Internet of Things (IoT) Experts:&nbsp;International Data Corporation, a global market intelligence firm known as IDC, predicts that by 2025 there will be 55.7 billion connected devices worldwide, 75 percent of which will be connected to an IoT platform. Such an expansion will require the talent of IoT developers with the relevant set of skills to power these devices with functional software, which means higher demand and more jobs for IoT specialists. IoT is multilingual — it speaks many programming languages and needs experience with a wide variety of frameworks. Being able to operate at only one layer of an IoT architecture (which includes the device layer, the communication layer, the data management layer, the data analytics layer, and the user communication layer) is adequate to begin a successful career in IoT.



• Cybersecurity Specialists:&nbsp;Cybersecurity vacancies are high in number. Cyberattacks are growing by the day, and although we mainly hear about attacks of high-profile entities in the news, no organisation or individual with an online presence is completely protected from such attacks. Moreover, due to the continuously evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, continuous professional development is incredibly important in the field of cybersecurity.



Upskilling and Reskilling



As a society, we need to consider how existing roles will change and how people with at-risk jobs can shift to roles where they work in tandem with technology and go on to add value on top of it. Besides the economic repercussions of the pandemic, the current times have brought us an opportunity to relook at education, training, and skills development.
