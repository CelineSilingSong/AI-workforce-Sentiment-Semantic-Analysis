AI leverages data from specific problem domains to generate diverse models for effective decision-making. For example, today&#039;s banks can accurately predict customers likely to default on loans, thereby preventing NPAs and expensive recovery processes. Retailers can utilize real-time store traffic data to make pricing decisions while customers are still in the store. Logistics companies optimize transportation routes with real-time traffic information, and healthcare product companies plan their offerings based on a deeper understanding of population health issues. These are merely a fraction of the vast array of AI applications, with novel use cases emerging daily. The increasing use of AI has had a huge impact on the MBA sector, requiring it to adapt to the changing corporate landscape. Business schools have started to incorporate AI-focused content into MBA programs over the last decade, recognizing the requirement for graduates who are adept in both business strategy and technical advancements. This modification teaches students how to use AI-driven insights for better decision-making and operational excellence, bridging the gap between traditional practices and current approaches. The Gartner report 2023 accentuates&nbsp;a significant shift&nbsp;in the MBA landscape, with AI-enabled productivity and efficiency gains altering the skill set required of graduates. As artificial intelligence (AI) tools grow more prevalent in positions such as marketing, finance, and business research, MBA programs have incorporated AI-focused coursework to provide graduates with the skills needed to extract useful insights from complicated data. This keeps MBA graduates competitive in a job environment where AI literacy is becoming increasingly important. Business schools have incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as Tableau for data visualization, IBM Watson for analytics and natural language processing, Salesforce Einstein for customer relationship management, Google Analytics for understanding customer behavior, RapidMiner for predictive analytics, and programming languages such as Python and R for data analysis, demonstrating how AI improves decision-making and business strategies in MBA programs. The report emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between business acumen and technological competency, highlighting the necessity for MBA graduates to capitalize on AI&#039;s revolutionary potential in order to flourish in emerging markets. Beyond the accolades, the impact of Generative AI transcends traditional boundaries. Financial giants like Goldman Sachs have projected that the widespread adoption of Gen AI will contribute significantly to the global economy, with an estimated boost to the global GDP by an impressive 7%. This projection underlines the far-reaching economic implications that Generative AI can bring forth. Impact on Education The rapid adoption of AI raises the question: what is its impact on B-school education?&nbsp; The following points may be worth pondering: AI as a part of the MBA curriculum: As business operations get transformed by AI, it is imperative for budding managers to learn how to use AI for their roles. An MBA with a strong understanding of AI will have a natural advantage over one who doesn’t – they will be able to make decisions better and faster. So B-school faculty worldwide are including AI in their MBA curricula in a big way – to discuss what data can be used for solving a particular problem, which AI models can be used, and how to interpret the results.&nbsp; Growing Business AI Integration: Businesses are increasingly embracing AI to streamline operations, improve decision-making, and gain a competitive advantage. As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become more common and accessible, MBA graduates will be required to have a comprehensive understanding of AI&#039;s uses and implications in many business tasks. Data-Driven Decision Making: AI analyses and generates decisions based on tremendous quantities of data. MBA graduates who are skilled in AI may use data-driven insights to make informed and strategic business decisions, resulting in increased performance and growth. AI and Marketing: AI is important in marketing because it enables personalized consumer experiences, targeted advertising, and efficient lead generation. MBA graduates with AI expertise can develop creative marketing strategies that connect with customers and propel businesses forward. AI-Driven Innovation: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a catalyst for innovation, allowing firms to develop new products, services, and business models. MBA graduates who understand the potential of AI will be at the forefront of creating disruptive change and identifying new growth possibilities. Enhanced Efficiency and Cost Savings: AI can automate repetitive jobs and optimize processes, resulting in increased corporate efficiency and cost savings. MBA graduates with AI experience may assist organizations in streamlining operations, optimizing resource utilization, and increasing profits. AI in financial and Investments: From robo advisors to fraud detection and anti-money laundering, AI is transforming the financial industry. The emergence of blockchain as a shared, immutable ledger offers another new application for AI. MBA graduates who are well-versed in AI can traverse this changing terrain, making smart financial decisions and leveraging AI-powered portfolio management solutions. AI in Operations and Supply Chain: AI, coupled with Internet-of-Things (IoT), has the potential to improve supply chain operations by providing automated warehouses, improved vehicle tracking and transportation, intelligent demand forecasting, and logistics. MBA graduates with AI skills can help to improve supply chain processes and customer satisfaction. AI and Business Strategy: Future business leaders must understand the impact of AI on company strategy. MBA graduates with AI skills can develop strategy strategies that leverage AI technologies and produce long-term competitive advantages. AI for Customer Relationship Management: Artificial intelligence-powered chatbots, sentiment analysis, and customer analytics are revolutionizing customer relationship management. MBA graduates who understand AI can create powerful customer-centric strategies that drive brand loyalty and happiness. Addressing Ethical and Social Implications: As AI becomes pervasive, businesses face ethical and social challenges. MBA graduates with AI proficiency can address these concerns, ensuring responsible AI adoption and building sustainable and ethical business practices. Human issues surrounding AI: Although AI is celebrated for its numerous groundbreaking applications, it does raise a set of concerns, with job loss being a primary worry. However, it is important to acknowledge that AI will also generate new employment opportunities or reshape existing jobs by incorporating AI elements. An illustrative example is the transformation of the cab driver&#039;s role, where they now follow GPS-prescribed routes and charge fares determined by the AI system. The &quot;new age&quot; MBA will possess the acumen to envision innovative applications of AI as the technology advances and its capabilities expand. For instance, a business analyst overseeing requirements for a retail website will be adept at identifying AI features that can enhance personalization and offer improved recommendations. AI is also overly reliant on the quality of the input data for learning, which leads to issues such as inaccuracies, fakes, biases, etc.&nbsp; Also ReadLexicon Institute of Media and Animation unveils ‘Media Bytes with Lexicon IMA’ Podcast Series Another huge issue is its potential to aid unethical work – there are always debates around the profiling of customers or users based on their data. As a business school revolves around human-centric principles, it becomes an ideal forum for addressing and deliberating on such issues as an integral part of the curriculum and pedagogy. These constructive discussions play a crucial role in nurturing the minds of young managers in a comprehensive manner. In conclusion, the growing role of AI in business across various domains makes it imperative for MBA graduates to acquire AI skills. A solid understanding of AI will empower them to drive innovation, efficiency, and growth, making them highly sought-after professionals in the dynamic and AI-driven landscape of the future.

This unforeseen, rapid escalation not only stirs a sense of marvel but also a shadow of apprehension, particularly regarding the professional landscapes. 

From self-driving cars to customer service chatbots, the manifestations of AI are clear and impactful, leaving no industry untouched by its calculated 'hands.' As AI boldly infiltrates industry after industry, automating tasks that were once strictly human, a pressing question casts a pall over the workforce: ""Will my job be next?""

However, instead of worrying about an AI takeover, it's a wake-up call to harness our uniquely human traits—our empathy, our creativity, and our critical thinking—qualities that no algorithm can replicate. As we stand on the brink of this transformative era, here are a few roles that AI cannot surpass (yet). 
6 Jobs Immune to AI Takeover
Medical professionals
Even though AI has entered the healthcare industry, it cannot replace roles like surgeons or physicians. AI-powered virtual bots can assist in telemedicine, diagnosis or drug discovery. However, so far, AI doctors or machines do not seem feasible as they cannot make critical decisions in real-time. 
Teachers
According to the Future of Jobs Report 2023 released by the World Economic Forum, the number of people in teaching jobs will increase by 10%, by 2027. AI tools like ChatGPT can simplify tough concepts for students but teachers do more than instruct. They provide emotional support, understand subtle social cues, and can adapt responsively to a student's emotional state. While AI can follow programmed instructions, it cannot replicate the nuanced decision-making and real-time adaptability of a skilled teacher.
Software developers 
Although AI can be equipped to automate certain coding tasks it won't be able to replace developers entirely. Software development is an inherently creative process, involving original thought, problem-solving, and the ability to respond to unanticipated complications in real-time. Something that would be very difficult for AI to replicate. 
Marketing managers and creative professionals
While marketing campaigns can be improved by AI, marketing managers are safe from getting their roles taken by AI. Marketers thrive on building narratives that resonate on a deeply human level, understanding the consumer psyche, and forging authentic connections that algorithms simply cannot duplicate.
Psychologists and mental health workers
Mental health professionals like psychologists have in-depth knowledge of human behaviour, emotions and it;s clinical significance. They can identify the key pain points of patients with empathy and guide them to live a better life. 

AI on the other hand can assist mental health doctors in diagnosing a patient, and analysing their health conditions but falls short of providing complete treatment without human intervention. 
Farming and agriculture
The Future of Jobs Report 2023 also highlighted that roles in this sector could see an increase of up to 30% in the upcoming 5 years. Agriculture demands a depth of understanding and decision-making based on variables that AI tools can't fully grasp, such as soil health, ecosystem balance, and local weather patterns. 

In an era where technology is rapidly evolving, it's comforting to know there are roles that still require the irreplaceable nuances of human touch.

<p>Throughout the conference, several presentations referred to Gartner's overall predictions about AI's impact on jobs. Through 2026, the firm predicts that the global jobs impact from AI will be neutral but by then over 100 million people will use robo-colleagues (""synthetic virtual colleagues"") to contribute to their work. By 2033, Gartner expects that AI solutions will result in over a half billion net new human jobs.</p><p>Perhaps. Difference sessions tried to lay out how this may happen, dealing with the relationships between humans and AI or robots, how AI may fit into the team, how it will impact the future of work, and offering different scenarios for the development of AI.</p><h2 id=""the-human-machine-relationship"">The Human-Machine Relationship</h2><p>Gartner's <a href=""https://www.gartner.com/en/experts/mary-mesaglio"" target=""_blank"" title=""(Opens in a new tab)"">Mary Mesaglio</a> expounded on one of the main themes from her <a href=""https://www.pcmag.com/articles/gartner-we-shape-ai-ai-shapes-us"" target=""_self"">opening keynote</a>, saying that the era of generative AI will shift human-machine relationships.</p><p>To get the relationship between machines and humans right, she said we need both machine experts and human experts.

<p>Mesaglio said we have tended to think of machines as tools, but with generative AI, we also need to think of them as teammates, able to do things like teach, and even decide things for us. Most of the audience was happy with the idea of machines doing things like financial audits, but not comfortable with the idea of machines doing things like performance evaluations.</p><p>She said we'll need ethicists, behavioral scientists, anthropologists, and sociologists to help us better understand how we react to machines. We tend to anthropomorphize machines and she suggested several design concepts we need to keep in mind.</p><p>She noted that we're seeing ""digital disinhibition"" where people behave differently with a machine than they would with a person&mdash;which can be bad, as with the worst things on social media&mdash;or good, such as machines acting as therapists for people who wouldn't otherwise seek therapy. She also talked about universal expectations, where if one machine can do something, we expect all machines to be able to do this. Finally, she discussed ""algorithmic aversion,"" where we have different standards for a machine, such as treating a car accident differently if it happens to be a self-driving vehicle.</p><p>Mesaglio talked about a Japanese chatbot that has been successful in doing things like convincing people not to commit suicide. When it started to make too many suggestive comments, the company toned it down, but was faced with a torrent of complaints from users, who said they gave it a ""lobotomy.""</p><p>Going forward we'll have to consider how we want to treat machines, and what regulations and policies we'll need to control them, she said.

<p>The theme of changing relationships with machines was echoed in a lunch session presented by Kate Darling of the MIT Media Lab, which focuses on human-robot interactions.</p><p>Humans have always tended to anthropomorphize things. She noted how people relate to stuffed animals, as we are born to recognize faces. But we also respond to movement, and she claimed that 85% of Roomba owners give those robotic vacuum cleaners names.</p><p>She went back to an experiment referenced in the opening keynote, in which researchers spent an hour playing with Pleo, a robotic toy dinosaur. After groups of researchers spent time with the toy and gave it a name, they were handed a hammer and knife and told to destroy it. All refused. She&rsquo;d seen similar things with other robots and says we respond on cue to lifelike robots. ""People treat these things differently than other devices,"" she said.</p><p>Darling discussed how people react to humanoid robots, telling some of the same stories as Mesaglio did in her talk, including talking about how people react to robots in hospitals and other settings.</p><p>She believes we should take people like Blake Lemoine&mdash;the Google engineer who said <a href=""https://www.pcmag.com/news/a-google-employee-thinks-the-company-created-a-sentient-ai"" target=""_self"">he thought Google's AI system was &ldquo;sentient&rdquo;</a>&mdash;more seriously. What matters is that people treat some robots as if they were sentient. She noted that such robots have already served as a substitute for animal therapy.</p><p>In the future we have the choice as to how to deal with social robots, and how to integrate them into our lives responsibly and effectively.

<p>AI is now a permanent fixture in our organizations, and we should get used to that, Brethenoux said, reiterating the difference between ""everyday AI"" and ""game-changing AI."" Everyday AI includes projects that organizations are doing today within established boundaries with slight augmentations. We're all already in the AI game, with AI applications on our phones and GPS systems. These are things ""within boundaries"" such as in productivity applications.</p><p>These account for 80% of AI initiatives, usually with a time horizon of a few months or a year. But these applications don't need to be mundane, such as writing notes to parents of sick children.</p><p>Then, there is ""game-changing AI"" that are ""pushing boundaries (17% of applications) usually challenging applications with a deadline of about 18 months that cross functions, that can cost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Examples include software that can beat humans at Go.</p><p>Finally, he said there are 3% of applications that are ""breaking boundaries"" where AI achieves some sort of agency, usually with a time frame of 24 months or more. These are expensive and can cost in the low teens of millions of dollars. Examples he mentioned include producing chemical compounds and medicines and an investment system that can learn from how it does (with the problem of overconfidence).</p><p>The further you go, Brethenoux said, the greater the potential reward, but the greater the potential risk, and the larger the need to keep AI fair, reliable, and sustainable.</p><p>But at every level, failure should be an option, because ""the risk of doing nothing has never been higher."" Risk is a part of any IT priorities, and he said, ""breaking boundaries is the safest way to compete.""</p><p>He suggested companies name an AI lead to orchestrate ideas and promote innovation in AI, including setting up an AI literacy program in the company. Brethenoux pushed for AI as ""augmented intelligence.""</p><h2 id=""how-will-generative-ai-impact-the-future-of-work"">How Will Generative AI Impact the Future of Work?</h2><p>In a session on how generative AI will impact the future of work, <a href=""https://www.gartner.com/analyst/48901"" target=""_blank"" title=""(Opens in a new tab)"">Gartner's Helen Poitevin</a> pointed out that generative AI is just a subset of AI, and that all the companies she talked to were thinking about the broader view of AI. She shared the results of a survey that showed that workers who thought AI could replace their jobs were 27% more likely to intend to leave those jobs in the next year. At an average organization of 10,000 employees, this decrease in intent to stay costs $53 million per year in total costs and lost productivity. Employers can change this by demystifying some of the thoughts about AI and work. Intent to stay can increase significantly by training and upskilling employees.</p><img src=""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20432'%3E%3Crect%20fill='%23f7f7f7'%20/%3E%3C/svg%3E"" class="""" data-image-loader=""https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-6.jpg"" data-lazy-sized alt=""(Myths About AI and Work)"" data-image-path=""articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-6.jpg"">

<p>Poitevin then spent some time debunking what she said were many myths about AI and work.</p><p>We think humans will keep doing the jobs that they do better than AI, but that may not always be the case. She cited a story where an employer picked ChatGPT over a human, even though the human did a better job.</p><div class=""py-4"" data-parent-group=""related-stories"">

<p>She said studies about which tasks humans do better and what AI does better miss the point because they ignore the new tasks and roles that will develop as jobs change and evolve.</p><p>We think we'll have to manage a bot workforce, but for the most part, AI and automation will work alongside humans, with humans using AI as a tool.</p><img src=""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20432'%3E%3Crect%20fill='%23f7f7f7'%20/%3E%3C/svg%3E"" class="""" data-image-loader=""https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-7.jpg"" data-lazy-sized alt=""(Degree of Disruption Through AI Investments)"" data-image-path=""articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-7.jpg"">

<p>She suggested a matrix of how AI might impact jobs by looking at different kinds of roles for AI and the demand for various kinds of tasks.</p><p>For the kinds of roles, she followed the &ldquo;pushing boundaries&rdquo; and &ldquo;breaking boundaries&rdquo; framework Brethenoux covered in his session (above). In the first case, we see shifting roles in existing work patterns, which tend to evolve slowly over multiple years. In the second, where we are creating new ways of creating and delivering goods and services, we often need many of the same skills but redesigned. In the final category, where we have &ldquo;game-changing&rdquo; rules, we might have new roles and new opportunities.</p><p>More important than what AI can do is how we choose to use it, she said. We might choose to use AI even if humans could do it better, or vice versa.</p><p>Then she talked about the various workforce planning items, explaining how all businesses manage a portfolio of different services and the people who deliver these. People make these decisions on a portfolio level, not a task level, as people do multiple tasks.</p><p>Poitevin showed some examples of picking a project and putting it into a category based on the type of change or the level of service. For instance, AI for customer service reps&mdash;a common example&mdash;fits within boundaries and is a stable or core service, so is likely to see more shifting of roles; if there is a decrease in employees, it will take multiple years. For generative AI for software development, it is within boundaries, but deals with increasing demand, so AI helps you meet the demand. But the productivity expectations are unrealistic, and burnout is a real issue, so you may still want to hire more. In a pushing boundaries example, she talked about delivering counseling services to more people, in which AI could decrease costs and increase access to licensed therapists, but with other impacts.</p><p>Overall, she thinks job displacement is most likely to happen with projects that are within boundaries, while new jobs and roles are likely to emerge in applications that are pushing or breaking boundaries.</p><p>Poitevin said we should work on ""getting people less fearful about the work being lost and more excited about the work they can contribute to in building these new capabilities.""</p><h2 id=""four-possible-futures"">Four Possible Futures</h2><img src=""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20432'%3E%3Crect%20fill='%23f7f7f7'%20/%3E%3C/svg%3E"" class="""" data-image-loader=""https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-8.jpg"" data-lazy-sized alt=""(Four Seasons of AI)"" data-image-path=""articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-8.jpg"">

<p>Frank Buytendijk shared thinking from the <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gartner-futures-lab-podcast/id1676524260"" target=""_blank"" title=""(Opens in a new tab)"">Gartner Future Labs podcast</a> about four possible futures for AI.</p><p>In an AI spring, we will see new paradigms such as composite AI, which combines deep learning and knowledge graphs, while the computing power required for AI goes down. In this scenario, companies should focus on specific use cases where AI creates value, adopt responsible AI practices, and manage realistic expectations on the practical use of AI.</p><p>In an AI summer, AI benefits from a massive increase in computing power, or we have things like artificial general intelligence or brain-machine interfaces. In this scenario, we may have AI gaining its own ""bill of rights"" and the income tax replaced with a productivity tax because of robotization. In this scenario, organizations need to instigate an AI-first culture, but beware of a breakneck pace with the risk of stumbling and losing control of AI. If this happens, we shouldn't underestimate the potential shock effects that AI as an actor may have on society.</p><p>In an AI fall, there would be massive job replacement, with AI becoming part of a massive arms race, and privacy protection is under threat. In this scenario, AI continues to innovate, but remains expensive, giving additional power to a few mega-vendors. To deal with this, he suggests creating awareness about AI threats and vulnerabilities within the organization and establish control measures to mitigate potential encroachments on control. And you'll want to spread your bets to avoid single vendor lock-in with AI.</p><p>The worst scenario, and one he didn't really talk much about, was an AI winter, caused by a financial market crash or other disaster; by the lack of enough reliable data, leading to a halt in deep learning; or by a deep lack of trust in AI. In this case, organizations should improve protection against hidden or negative uses of AI, and maintain AI competencies concerning cybersecurity, misinformation, and fraud.</p>",2023-10-23T17:37:51+00:00,,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-1..v1698080183.jpg', 'height': 900, 'width': 1600}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-2..v1698080376.jpg', 'height': 1062, 'width': 1922}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-3..v1698080376.jpg', 'height': 729, 'width': 1278}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-4..v1698080376.jpg', 'height': 3072, 'width': 4080}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-5..v1698080376.jpg', 'height': 711, 'width': 1316}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-6..v1698080376.jpg', 'height': 720, 'width': 1291}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-7..v1698080376.jpg', 'height': 718, 'width': 1285}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02PdGp7OwlXIzFLjyMK8FRI-8..v1698080376.jpg', 'height': 721, 'width': 1289}]",,https://www.pcmag.com/articles/gartner-how-ai-will-impact-work,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Michael J.

Venture capital firms have been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into AI startups, and companies across industries are looking to beef up their own AI strategies in an effort to cash in on the hype.That means more jobs in the generative AI space, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Netflix hiring employees to work on their AI initiatives and listing six-figure salaries.But it's not just tech companies seeking AI talent. Employers across a range of sectors — from law to education to healthcare — have been looking to hire workers familiar with tools like ChatGPT, and some were hiring prompt engineers to fine-tune their own AI chatbots.So how do you start a career in AI and land a job?To understand what recruiters look for in applicants, Insider spoke to four hiring leaders at IBM, Nvidia, Hugging Face, and Jasper for their advice on how to land an AI-related job at their respective companies.Here are 4 tips from hiring leaders on how to increase your chances of landing a job in AI.Before submitting your job application, make sure your résumé includes the skills and projects needed for the role.When reviewing applications, Nvidia, the chip giant hiring for technical roles related to machine learning and AI, looks for ""critical skills"" related to math proficiency, programming, deep learning, algorithms, data handling, and AI infrastructure like utilizing graphic processing units, Lindsey Duran, the vice president of global recruiting at Nvidia, told Insider.IBM, the tech giant currently hiring AI engineers, AI application consultants, and AI research scientists, also requires applicants to have strong math and coding skills, as well as an understanding of APIs and other technical concepts, Chris Foltz, the chief talent officer at IBM, told Insider.Demonstrating your technical expertise by showing examples of previous work is a plus, Flavien Coronini, the talent acquisition lead at Hugging Face, an AI company behind tools like text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion, told Insider.Since Hugging Face is an open source company, Coronini said he looks for GitHub links to their projects when reviewing resumes. By reviewing their projects, Coronini said he can gauge how much impact the applicant could bring to Hugging Face — whether that's the ability to solve a problem or make a program run faster — and can identify if their vision aligns with the company's mission.When making hiring decisions for less-technical roles like sales and product management, the three recruiters said they look for ""soft skills"" like strong communication, the ability to collaborate, and adaptability to change.If you're lucky enough to land an interview, be prepared to talk about your interest in generative AI.Alex Shapiro, the chief people officer at Jasper AI, an AI marketing and writing software that Shapiro said recently completed its ""key hiring"" over the last three years, said she expects job candidates to show that they've ""done their homework"" and ""understand the technology."" For instance, she said that candidates for engineering roles should be able to differentiate between a ""model layer"" and an ""app layer.""For technical and non-technical roles alike, interviewees can stand out if they can articulate how they've been playing around with generative AI tools like ChatGPT. This especially applies to those interviewing for client-facing roles like customer service as it shows ""whether or not people have dived into this industry,"" she said.""For a new field, I think what helps us to differentiate people is just how much curiosity they've had about the space and what work they've done to learn more about it,"" Shapiro told Insider.Foltz, the chief talent officer at IBM, would agree with Shapiro. He said that applicants who read AI research papers, follow AI forums, and explore AI-related online courses stand out from the pool because it shows they are genuinely curious about AI and have a ""desire to continuously learn.""Using AI tools like ChatGPT can be useful when writing your résumé and cover letters. But make sure you double-check the AI-generated documents for accuracy before submitting them.Shapiro acknowledged that using ChatGPT can be ""great"" in helping applicants ""brainstorm verbs"" and ""bring a level of polish"" to their applications. However, she urges applicants to make sure their AI-generated documents accurately reflect their qualities.She said there's been times when Jasper recruiters interviewed candidates and discovered that there's a skill in their resume they didn't intend to be there, or a characterization they're not familiar with, which she said could lead to problems down the line.In fact, ChatGPT can actually hurt an applicant's chances of moving forward in the hiring process if the chatbot is used irresponsibly.Duran from Nvidia said there's been instances where recruiters at her company caught candidates using ChatGPT during interviews to answer questions, which she said is prohibited. Coronini from Hugging Face has even seen cover letters that include prompts like ""Insert a cover letter in order to explain why my background is a good fit for this role"" used to generate them — which he calls a"" ""really bad"" practice.""For me, this is a showstopper, because it doesn't really show your motivation to join,"" he said.Many AI job listings may require applicants to have college or higher level degrees in computer science and engineering. But all the recruiters who spoke to Insider said they wouldn't rule out applicants who have less conventional backgrounds.Foltz said that IBM focuses on ""prioritizing skills and experiences"" over ""traditional degrees"" if they can demonstrate a ""foundational understanding of AI, whether that's knowing how to apply AI to their workflows, or taking ""industry-recognized"" online courses on AI and machine learning.Beyond education and AI experience, Duran said applicants from non-traditional backgrounds can shine if they can ""clearly communicate what makes them stand out"" by emphasizing their career milestones, leadership capabilities, and the impact of their previous projects.In some cases, Shapiro said workers with less conventional backgrounds may have more to offer than those with technical degrees. She said that Jasper hired employees who completed skills-based boot camps and believes that applicants who are career changers can be more equipped for particular roles than those with technical degrees — if they take the initiative to keep up with everything that's happening in generative AI.""It's really valuable to have people come in from different perspectives,"" she said.",2023-10-19T16:08:39Z,2023-10-19T16:08:39Z,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.insider.com/6528567755f52b01b35e6857?width=1136&format=jpeg', 'width': 1136, 'height': 852, 'caption': 'Alex Shapiro of Jasper.ai (L), Chris Foltz of IBM, Lindsey Dugan of Nvidia, and Flavien Coronini of Hugging Face share tips on how to get a job in AI.

Robots were going to make humans redundant in manufacturing.And yet, here we are in 2023, with unemployment in the US at 3.8%, and an estimated 9.6 million jobs available. So what happened?That's an especially important question to ask now as AI emerges as the next big transformative technology, impacting everyone from customer service agents to coders.The answer can offer lessons for the future.Simply put, technology creates more jobs than it takes away. Morgan Stanley addressed this in a recent report:David Autor, a leading economist who's followed automation and technology in the workplace, also wrote about this dynamic in an important 2015 paper that asked: Why are there still so many jobs?He wrote then:There are a few ways this plays out. In one scenario, the adoption of technology can increase the need for a specific role.For example, there were fears that the advent of ATMs would put bank tellers out of work. And sure enough, a few years after the adoption of the ATM, there were fewer bank tellers per branch.But the ATMs also reduced the cost of operating a branch. Banks responded by opening more branch offices, and bank teller employment continued to increase.Here's economist James Bessen speaking on a podcast about his research on this topic:In a second scenario, tech might reduce the need for one specific professional, but help create new roles in adjacent professions.In a recent article, I offered the example of Microsoft Excel. Spreadsheets reduced the need for bookkeepers, but massively increased the need for financial managers and accountants, creating many more new jobs than were lost.Here's Morgan Stanley:Technology then creates jobs overall. That's why there are still so many of us employed at a time of historic technological advancement.But the diffusion of technology does have the potential to disrupt a labor force in ways that negatively impacts workers.Charter, the workplace-focused media and consultancy company, cites the example of women who worked as telephone operators in the early 1900s.Mechanical switching made that role redundant, forcing women to find work elsewhere. And they did. This new technology did not reduce employment among young women.But, per a 2020 working paper from the National Association of Economic Research (NBER), the disruption may have led to those women earning less in the future. From the NBER paper:There's a second way this can play out. I wrote earlier this year about white-collar workers facing their own Uber moment. This refers to the introduction of Uber to London, where taxi drivers were previously required to pass an intensive exam, capping the supply of taxi drivers.Suddenly, with Uber, every driver with a cellphone could compete for business. This put downward pressure on taxi-driver incomes.""Suddenly, knowing the name of each street in London was no longer valuable expertise, so that anybody with a drivers license could drive a taxi,"" Professor Carl Benedikt Frey, the director of future of work at the Oxford Martin School, told me earlier this year. ""The result was more competition for incumbent taxi drivers who saw their incomes fall by around 10%.""Technology typically creates new jobs and industries, more than offsetting any jobs that are lost as a result of the technology's implementation.There is still lots of work to go around, as is true today.But there's no guarantee that the individual worker impacted by a new technology will get the new job that's being created, or that others won't see their incomes fall as a result of fresh tech-enabled competition.So it's less a question of whether we'll have work to do in the future, and more a question of what that work is, and what it will pay. There are fears that AI will exacerbate income inequality.This puts a huge emphasis on how the technology is implemented, who gets to participate in its upside, and what happens to those workers who do find themselves disrupted.AI is already at the heart of union negotiations in Hollywood. Morgan Stanley has predicted the rise of generative AI will create ""unprecedented demand for reskilling.""In a policy memo updated in September, Daron Acemoglu, Autor, and Simon Johnson wrote: ""Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) will surely impact inequality, but the nature of that effect depends on exactly how this technology is developed and applied. Nothing about the path of this (or any) technology is inevitable.""",2023-10-17T19:00:34Z,2023-10-18T18:40:21Z,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.insider.com/652ec734211def8ed83766b3?width=1136&format=jpeg', 'width': 1136, 'height': 852}",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-ai-job-creation-risks-abound-2023-10'}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Matt Turner', 'sameAs': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/author/matt-turner'}",,"{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Insider', 'legalName': 'Insider Inc.', 'foundingDate': '2007', 'url': 'www.businessinsider.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness', 'https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/businessinsider', 'https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderBusiness'], 'founder': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Henry Blodget'}, 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/structured-data.png', 'width': 305, 'height': 60}}",,"[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.content-lock-content'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tech was supposed to take everyone's job.

The AI chatbot made a lot of headlines for its human-like answers, that left people surprised. Before ChatGPT, people hadn&#039;t seen an AI chatbot, interacting with humans and answering questions in a simplified manner. Gradually, people asked the AI chatbot to compose music, write poetry, proofread essays, come up with content ideas, and what not. After ChatGPT&#039;s launch, Google came out with its own AI chatbot called Bard. And while a section of people were awestruck by the emerging tech, others were concerned about its negative effects and began talking about how AI could replace them at their jobs. Almost a year after ChatGPT&#039;s launch, the debate of AI taking over human jobs goes on. And a Google executive recently expressed his views about it. Google exec on AI taking human jobsAccording to a Business Insider report, Philip Moyer, the vice president of Google Cloud&#039;s global AI business says that generative AI tools will boost employees&#039; job satisfaction and will help them in being more productive. This is because AI will take care of &quot;mundane&quot; tasks and the rest can be managed by humans. &quot;I think satisfaction and proficiency is where AI is actually going to have the most profound impact,&quot; he said. Moyer added that 80 to 90 per cent people, as per studies, feel that AI has boosted their job satisfaction. &quot;If you look at people&#039;s job satisfaction when using generated AI, the studies that are coming out of companies that are trying it, almost 80-90% of people are consistently saying yes. This has made my job better,&quot; he told Business Insider. Cred CEO on AI taking human jobsLast month, Cred CEO Kunal Shah, in a conversation with CNBC-TV18, said that we are not &#039;realising the risk of AI&#039;. He added that he is confident about 90 per cent of people will lose their jobs in the next 10 years.&quot;We are not realising the risk of AI. I can tell you with confidence that 90 percent of people, who have jobs right now may not have their jobs relevant 10 years from now,&quot; he had said. He also disagreed with people saying that they can keep their jobs by upskilling and learning how to master the use of AI. Shah expressed that according to him, it isn&#039;t possible for humans to upskill so quickly and that it is going to be a &#039;real challenge&#039; unless someone is a &#039;very curious compounding person&#039;.&quot;The time to upskill is going to be a real challenge. Unless you are a very curious compounding person, everybody&#039;s job is at risk,&quot; he said.Published By: Divyanshi SharmaPublished On: Oct 23, 2023ALSO READ |  90 per cent people could lose their jobs to AI in next ten years, says Cred CEO Kunal ShahALSO READ |  Godfather of AI says AI could be a threat to humanity in future, might manipulate peopleALSO READ |  Google is cutting more jobs after eliminating hundreds of employees last month",2023-10-23T12:09:20+05:30,2023-10-23T12:09:17+05:30,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'representativeOfPage': 'http://schema.org/True', 'contentUrl': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202310/google-162921521-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=bhwuRt1t30m8xM8VINccftnv5gtnkTSm?size=1200:675', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202310/google-162921521-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=bhwuRt1t30m8xM8VINccftnv5gtnkTSm?size=1200:675', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'description': ''}",,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-executive-says-ai-will-make-your-job-better-over-80-per-cent-people-agree-2452532-2023-10-23,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Divyanshi Sharma', 'url': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/author/divyanshi-sharma'}",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'India Today', 'sameAs': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/mediamanager/itlogo.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'representativeOfPage': 'http://schema.org/True', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202310/google-162921521-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=bhwuRt1t30m8xM8VINccftnv5gtnkTSm?size=1200:675', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'description': ''}","[{'@type': 'Article', 'headline': 'Google executive says AI will make your job better, over 80 per cent people agree - India Today', 'url': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-executive-says-ai-will-make-your-job-better-over-80-per-cent-people-agree-2452532-2023-10-23', 'datePublished': '2023-10-23 12:09:20+5:30', 'author': {'@id': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/author/divyanshi-sharma'}}]",,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/mediamanager/itlogo.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}","{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'FC-8, Ecity Bioscope Rd, Film City', 'addressLocality': 'Sector 16A, Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301', 'telephone': '0120 480 7100'}",,"['https://www.facebook.com/IndiaToday', 'https://twitter.com/indiatoday', 'https://www.youtube.com/Indiatoday', 'https://www.instagram.com/indiatoday/']",,1200,675,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'India Today', 'url': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/'}","{'@id': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/author/divyanshi-sharma', '@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Divyanshi Sharma'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""When was the last time you've seen a company that says, 'Oh, we are doing so much better; let's hire fewer people?'""Netzer compared AI to the introduction of ATMs to the banking industry. While this change meant that manual bank-teller jobs largely vanished, it also became cheaper to open a branch, and demand for branches increased, which created tons of new jobs.Moyer told Insider that generative AI would transform industries such as finance, invoicing, and medicine that require large amounts of administrative work, and said that it was inevitable that companies would adopt the technology because employees are now ""waiting for AI to show up.""""I don't know a single person that if you offered to take out 20% of their work, they wouldn't be happy,"" he said. ""Quite frankly, I don't see organizations going, 'Well, we're just not going to do anything with this anymore.'""Google has launched a huge range of new AI products this year as it scrambles to catch up with rivals such as OpenAI and Microsoft.But it has faced questions over the accuracy of generative-AI tools such as its Bard chatbot, which like its rival, ChatGPT, is prone to ""hallucinating"" wildly false information.Google plans to launch a new AI model, Gemini, in the coming months, which reportedly has advanced ""multimodal"" capabilities that rival OpenAI's flagship GPT-4 model.Moyer told Insider that Google's future models would see some ""great breakthroughs"" in ""really hard multimodal problems,"" enabling them to interpret multiple types of data at once.But for now, he said that generative AI was in its ""management"" stage as tech companies try to root out accuracy issues and bring down the enormous cost of running models.""I tell people that the next roughly three years or so of the industry is going to be about getting models accurate, getting models lower cost, and getting companies and organizations on board,"" he said.""So this is going to be a management era, and then I expect as you look over the horizon, that's where you'll start to get into reasoning and the really advanced problems in this multimodal era,"" he added.",2023-10-22T07:59:02Z,2024-03-01T00:08:02Z,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.insider.com/65337f9796f7540cd0625e6c?width=1136&format=jpeg', 'width': 1136, 'height': 852, 'caption': 'Workers in a Japanese office'}",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-job-interesting-bored-job-satisfaction-google-2023-10'}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Tom Carter', 'sameAs': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/author/tom-carter'}",,"{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Insider', 'legalName': 'Insider Inc.', 'foundingDate': '2007', 'url': 'www.businessinsider.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness', 'https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/businessinsider', 'https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderBusiness'], 'founder': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Henry Blodget'}, 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/structured-data.png', 'width': 305, 'height': 60}}",,"[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.content-lock-content'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bored at work?

With such a rush of manufacturers and sprouting of green infrastructure providers, is it any wonder that demand for workers with &lsquo;green&rsquo; skills has skyrocketed?The Global Green Skills Report 2023 by LinkedIn has shown that India already beats several other countries when it comes to the acquisition of green skills among automotive industry workers. India has trumped the USA, Mexico, Canada and several European countries, showing a 40% jump in the past five years in the number of automotive industry workers with at least one EV skill.            (Source- Global Green Skills Report 2023 by LinkedIn)The demand for workers with green skills is expected to move further up in the coming years. Estimates differ, with different industry leaders pegging job creation in the EV sector at different levels, but everyone seems united in the view that millions of new roles are getting created.Sanjay Shetty, Director, Professional Search &amp; Selection, Randstad India, told ETAuto that by 2030, up to 10 million direct jobs will be created in the EV sector and another 50-55 million indirect job opportunities will arise. Manu Sharma, AVP HR at Hero Electric says that to build up scale, the EV industry will immediately need between 50,000 to 1 lakh people. &ldquo;This is across the electric mobility industry in India, not limited to just OEMs but also component manufacturers, service providers etc&rdquo;.  Sameer Aggarwal, CEO and Founder at Revfin, said that about 20 million jobs will be created by 2030, encompassing a wide range of roles, from research and development to manufacturing, charging infrastructure deployment and skilled technical positions, thereby cultivating a diverse and robust employment landscapeSuch a rapid increase in demand for workers with green skills has naturally led to a widening demand-supply mismatch and skills shortage. Maxson Lewis, founder and MD of the EV solutions company Magenta said, &ldquo;EV technology is pure science. It is a mix of several branches of engineering - mechanical, electrical, electronics and even telecom. But even today, there are no courses which encompass all the knowledge needed to combine these science subjects for imparting necessary skills in the EV space. So there definitely is a supply side issue.&rdquo;Besides, technology for the EV ecosystem is also evolving quite rapidly, making skill upgradation a tough ask. Lewis says frequent and fast changes in battery technology, for example, create shortage of skilled workforce in the industry. &ldquo;For the next three years at least, supply will always follow demand,&rdquo; he said.Shetty of Randstad said that the domestic EV market is poised for 45-50% growth by 2030. &ldquo;We expect annual EV sales in India to surpass 10 million units and this will contribute to the creation of around 8-10 million direct and 50-55 million indirect job opportunities.&rdquo; He said that in the near term, there is an increasing demand for skilled professionals and around 1.5-2 million employees. He also referred to the talent crunch. &ldquo;The EV industry is grappling with a substantial talent crunch, particularly in the domains of software, artificial intelligence, connected technologies, electric vehicle development, shared mobility solutions, and safety standards. Companies are confronted with the challenge of a rapidly expanding production pace that outpaces the time required to skill the workforce adequately,&rdquo; Shetty said.Skill shortageAshish Deswal, Founder, EarthtronEV, an EV charging company, points to two specific areas where there is a skills shortage: EV charging engineering and EV charging operations. Earthtron has found a novel solution for this problem. Deswal said, &ldquo;Our strategy has always been to look for talent in industries which are similar to our industry. Employees in the power industry have certain skills and knowledge that can be relevant to our operations. We then take the initiative to skill them up and make them proficient with our line of work. ""Industry wide, there is a significant shortage of technicians and engineers trained in EV charging infrastructure. Installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting EV charging stations require a unique skill set which is not widely available. Besides, professionals skilled in customer service and technical support, specifically tailored to EV charging stations, are also in short supply. Altigreen Propulsion Labs , a Bengaluru-based manufacturer of commercial electric vehicles for the last mile segment, has not identified the specific areas where the skill gap is wide. The company has begun in-house training and handholding of professionals to bridge this gap. Girish Lobo, who has considerable experience in the automotive industry and is now the HR head of Altigreen, said that hiring for the sales and marketing functions is not difficult in the EV sector since fundamentally, skills needed for ICE vehicles and EVs in these job roles remain similar. Besides, there is eagerness from applicants to transition to the EV sector in these roles, making the hiring process easier. &ldquo;But there is a huge gap in skills needed for job roles in the embedded software function, which manages the functioning of electronic parts of EVs. People come from an ICE vehicle point of view here &hellip;We get the required candidates but then they need six to eight months of training to become proficient,&rdquo; he said.Sharma of Hero Electric said that companies often encounter skill gaps in battery thermal management, energy density improvement and safety enhancement; and in charging station design, grid integration functions.There is also some struggle to hire the right people for data and AI application functions. Lobo of Altigreen said, &ldquo;The industry for these skills is not very mature till now so sometimes do not get ideal fits. We look for those who are eager to work in the EV industry and then devise a learning and working model under experts. A mid-level professional still needs about six months of skilling and this could stretch to nine months for an entry level candidate.&rdquo;And just as there is a crunch of talented professionals in specific EV industry roles, the quantum of salary jump for specific roles can be as high as 50% or more from the current pay package. Lobo said, in R&amp;D functions, for example, the salary increase is anywhere between 40% and-50% but for niche skills like data science and AI, the hikes are over 50%.Read alsoSIAM organizes Green Plate EV Rally to promote sustainable mobility, enhance customer confidenceEurope is looking to fight the flood of Chinese electric vehicles, but Europeans love Chinese EVsGreaves Electric offers to pay INR 125 cr for flouting FAME subsidy normsKarnataka expects INR 15,000 cr new investment in electric vehicle segment: Industry Minister",2023-10-19T15:17:25+05:30,2023-10-20T11:43:29+05:30,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-104551790,width-1200,height-900,resizemode-4/.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 900}]",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/millions-of-jobs-coming-up-in-ev-sector-data-ai-roles-to-get-maximum-hikes/104551790'}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sindhu Bhattacharya', 'url': 'https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/author/479262896/sindhu-bhattacharya'}, {'@type': 'Thing', 'name': 'ET Auto', 'url': 'https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com'}]",,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'ETAuto', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679565869-et-auto-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679565869-et-auto-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@etauto.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AI is built from data. Data comes from humans. Humans, unfortunately, are far from perfect. And we know, especially in our field, that significant bias and barriers exist in hiring. In the US, an estimated 42 million Americans live with disabilities, 70 million lack a four-year college degree, and 77 million have a criminal record. That means that the majority of people in the 168 million-person civilian labor force face barriers to employment.While AI has the potential to contribute to bias and inequality, at the same time, we see a promising path forward. Indeed has made a significant commitment to responsible AI practices, which can ultimately help reduce inequalities in hiring.The main concern, probably not surprisingly, is the near-certain impact of AI on jobs. ""A whole bunch of people who thought their jobs were safe from automation are getting the existential sweats as ChatGPT excels at these feats of supposedly human intelligence,"" Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, said.In the long run, it does seem clear that technology has had a positive impact on humanity. Today, we work fewer hours in safer conditions, and by nearly all measures enjoy a higher quality of life than ever before. But, each individual cycle of disruption means the loss of livelihood for individual human lives —  and these cycles of disruption are only getting faster.But, despite those concerns, there is plenty to be excited about. Recent advancements in AI have been breathtaking. In just the past few years, we have seen farmers use AI to combat pests and disease; an AI-powered brain implant that helped a paralyzed man walk using his thoughts; and just last month, AI helped India's historic Chandrayaan-3 mission land safely on the south pole of the moon.And of course, AI helps people get jobs: At Indeed, it has helped power extraordinary improvements in matching job seekers to jobs.Though AI has powered Indeed job searches from the very beginning, it's now matching employers and job seekers in new and exciting ways.Today, AI is everywhere at Indeed. When a job seeker views a posting, Indeed uses hundreds of millions of salary data points to estimate the pay for that job and helps the job seeker view how that pay matches their expectations. When employers post a job, that same AI leverages data about every listing and job seeker on Indeed to help them see how many applications they're likely to get — and recommends the right budget to meet their hiring needs.Now, when a job seeker visits Indeed, they don't even need to search. Indeed's recommendation AI delivers each job seeker a personalized feed of the best matches. Job seekers love this feature, and are 55% more likely to apply to an AI recommendation than a job they see in search results.We're not just recommending matches to job seekers, though. When an employer posts a job on Indeed, our AI automatically recommends candidates that match the requirements before they even see the listing. Employers can choose the candidates that are the best fit and invite them to apply with a single click. We are combining the power of AI with the incredible power of human judgment — the power of you. It's smart, it's fast, and it's incredibly effective.For many years, we've heard from employers that the most difficult and time-consuming task in hiring is writing job descriptions. It's hard to find a talent professional who says they love writing job descriptions, or even one who feels confident in the descriptions they write. Indeed has spent the past two years building and fine-tuning an AI-powered job description generator that is incredibly simple and effective.It begins with a job title and a location. We automatically recommend relevant requirements, licenses, and skills that can be selected with just a few clicks. Employers can specify pay, and our AI will compare that pay with local listings and job seeker preferences to recommend competitive pay ranges. Once generative AI creates a job description from all of that information, employers can use, edit, or even regenerate it to see more options. The key is that our AI is recommending job descriptions that are most likely to attract job seekers.This can take writing a typical job description from two hours down to just about five minutes. Jobs that use our AI Job Description Generator on average get 16% more applications. This is available today, and it's completely free.Matched candidates have not been available for jobs that are on employer's applicant tracking system — until now.With this new development that we're unveiling, you'll be able to claim any job from your own Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and see the same exact AI-powered matches instantly. We also have brand new AI-powered features that are going to do even more coming very soon. As employers review each match recommendation, they can see AI-generated candidate highlights that will summarize key skill and experience matches — and potential gaps.Once employers find the right candidate, they can use our AI-powered Smart Message feature. This uses generative AI to automatically compose a personalized message to the job seeker, explaining why their job is right for them. Employers can use AI to customize the message further to make it shorter, longer, more formal or more casual.AI is an extraordinarily powerful technology, and there are certainly reasons to be concerned, but there are also many to be excited. At Indeed, responsible AI means that we are focused on keeping humans at the center of everything.""We're not trying to build a recruiting robot to replace humans,"" Hyams said. ""What we're really trying to do is partner with AI to generate better job descriptions and send personalized messages that are more effective.""This is what we believe the power of humanity and AI can bring together. Helping people get jobs is about seeing humanity in one another. This is our commitment to you — to partner with you to keep humanity at the heart of hiring. Together, we can help build a better future of work.Learn more about Indeed here.This post was created by Indeed with Insider Studios.",2023-10-24T15:52:31Z,2023-11-28T18:32:22Z,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.insider.com/65296ff568f1d46f52b13dec?width=1136&format=jpeg', 'width': 1136, 'height': 852}",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/indeed-is-embracing-ai-to-power-the-future-of-work'}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sponsor Post', 'sameAs': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/author/sponsor-post'}",,"{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Insider', 'legalName': 'Insider Inc.', 'foundingDate': '2007', 'url': 'www.businessinsider.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness', 'https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/businessinsider', 'https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderBusiness'], 'founder': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Henry Blodget'}, 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/structured-data.png', 'width': 305, 'height': 60}}",,"[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'cssSelector': '.content-lock-content'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,How Indeed is using AI to better match employers and job seekers while keeping humans at the center of hiring,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Asia London Palomba'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A video of the conversation was published by Welt TV, part of Germany's Die Welt newspaper.Axel Springer is the parent company of both Insider and Die Welt.Since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, the potential of AI has loomed large, threatening to replace humans in some jobs, particularly white-collar ones, Insider previously reported.Jobs in technology, media, law, market research analysis, education, trade, graphic design, accounting, and customer service are among those most at risk of being replaced by AI, experts previously told Insider.Kissinger, who is 100, said he was concerned AI could become so powerful in the long run that it leads to the sci-fi-esque outcome of humans serving machines — not the other way around.""I think it can be avoided, but only by understanding the essence of this intelligence, which will also be able to generate its own point of view,"" he said.Kissinger co-wrote a book on artificial intelligence, ""The Age of AI and Our Human Future,"" in which he, along with former Google CEO Eric Schmitt and computer scientist Daniel Huttenlocher, explored how AI may change our relationships with knowledge, politics, and society.He is in the process of writing a second book on the topic.Whether AI will replace humans, he says, is the ""question of our lifetime.""""It's the big challenge of our future, and on that level, it's in the interest of China and other advanced countries and eventually all countries to join it because otherwise they're in the hands of machinery that they don't understand,"" he said.Kissinger's main fear is generative AI — algorithms, like ChatGPT's, that create content from simple prompts and context — and the process by which it acquires and generates knowledge.""Once these machines can communicate with each other, which will certainly happen within five years, then it becomes almost a species problem of whether the human species can retain its individuality in the face of this competition,"" he said.Kissinger said he has begun trying to bring well-intentioned scientists together in order to advance the causes of freedom and coexistence in the world.""It must be done,"" he said, adding: ""It isn't being done because it [artificial intelligence] is not understood yet.""",2023-10-24T15:04:49Z,2023-10-24T15:04:49Z,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.insider.com/6537c6c3356802a56be1e803?width=1136&format=jpeg', 'width': 1136, 'height': 852, 'caption': 'Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger speaking in October 2023,  2023, in an interview about artificial intelligence.'}",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-could-replace-humans-in-the-next-5-years-henry-kissinger-2023-10'}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Thibault Spirlet', 'sameAs': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/author/thibault-spirlet'}",,"{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Insider', 'legalName': 'Insider Inc.', 'foundingDate': '2007', 'url': 'www.businessinsider.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness', 'https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/businessinsider', 'https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderBusiness'], 'founder': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Henry Blodget'}, 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/structured-data.png', 'width': 305, 'height': 60}}",,"[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.content-lock-content'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"AI is the 'biggest challenge of our times' and humanity could be replaced by machines in 5 years, Henry Kis...",,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kieran Corcoran'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This accounts for over 3% of the company’s global workforce. This move comes on the heels of another major round of layoffs earlier this year in May, which saw the elimination of 716 jobs and the closure of its Chinese app, InCareer. Why It Matters: The AI WaveThis decision is part of a broader restructuring aimed at integrating artificial intelligence more deeply into LinkedIn's services. Earlier this month, the company unveiled a host of new AI-powered features, including AI-assisted candidate discovery for recruiters and AI-driven coaching for its premium subscribers. The workforce reduction can thus be seen as an effort to streamline operations and allocate resources more efficiently towards these new technological priorities.Financial Stability Despite Job CutsDespite these job cuts, LinkedIn’s financial health seems robust. The company crossed $15 billion in annual revenue for the first time in its last fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2023. Furthermore, the user base has been growing consistently quarter-over-quarter for the past two years, now boasting 950 million users across more than 200 countries.Future Outlook: Navigating the AI LandscapeWhile LinkedIn frames these layoffs as a difficult but necessary step in evolving their business model, it brings up questions about the broader implications of automating services in the professional networking space. The company assures that it is continuing to invest in strategic priorities to deliver value to its users. However, the shift toward AI does cast a spotlight on what roles will remain indispensable as the firm transitions into a more automated landscape.",2023-10-17T12:36:12+05:30,2023-10-17T12:36:12+05:30,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.tnn.in/thumb/msid-104489469,thumbsize-33470,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/104489469.jpg', 'height': 720, 'width': 1280, 'caption': 'LinkedIn Trims Workforce by 3% Amidst AI Pivot'}",,https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/linkedin-layoffs-ai-shift-2023-article-104489057,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'TN Tech Desk', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/author/tn-tech-desk-479257193'}]",,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Times Now', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com', 'ethicsPolicy': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/info/privacy-policy', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/Timesnow', 'https://twitter.com/timesnow', 'https://www.instagram.com/timesnow', 'https://www.youtube.com/TimesNow', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Now'], 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.tnn.in/photo/msid-88317169/88317169.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.tnn.in/photo/msid-88317169/88317169.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}","{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Plot No-FC 6, Second Floor, Film City, Noida Sector 16A,', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91 – 0120 – 6634600', 'contactType': 'Customer Service', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'@type': 'OpeningHoursSpecification', 'opens': '09:00', 'closes': '18:00'}}","['https://www.facebook.com/Timesnow', 'https://twitter.com/TIMESNOW', 'https://www.instagram.com/timesnow/', 'https://www.youtube.com/timesnow', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Now']","[[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'SiteNavigationElement', '@id': 'https://www.timesnownews.com#table-of-content', 'name': 'Latest News', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news'}], [{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'SiteNavigationElement', '@id': 'https://www.timesnownews.com#table-of-content', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment-news'}], [{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'SiteNavigationElement', '@id': 'https://www.timesnownews.com#table-of-content', 'name': 'India', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/india'}], [{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'SiteNavigationElement', '@id': 'https://www.timesnownews.com#table-of-content', 'name': 'Sports', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/sports'}], [{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'SiteNavigationElement', '@id': 'https://www.timesnownews.com#table-of-content', 'name': 'Business', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy'}], [{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'SiteNavigationElement', '@id': 'https://www.timesnownews.com#table-of-content', 'name': 'World', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/world'}], [{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'SiteNavigationElement', '@id': 'https://www.timesnownews.com#table-of-content', 'name': 'Lifestyle', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/lifestyle'}], [{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'SiteNavigationElement', '@id': 'https://www.timesnownews.com#table-of-content', 'name': 'Health', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/health'}], [{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'SiteNavigationElement', '@id': 'https://www.timesnownews.com#table-of-content', 'name': 'Education', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/education'}], [{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'SiteNavigationElement', '@id': 'https://www.timesnownews.com#table-of-content', 'name': 'Viral', 'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/viral'}]]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While traditional hiring methods have long been the cornerstone of blue-collar recruitment, they have inherent limitations. Manual processes, paperwork, lack of transparency, and lengthy onboarding and verification procedures translate into a time-consuming and costly ordeal.

Moreover, reliance on human judgement alone introduces biases in the recruitment process, leading to potential hires falling through the cracks, increased time-to-hire, missed opportunities, security, and diversity challenges.
Complexities of blue-collar recruitment
Certain challenges associated with blue-collar recruitment stem from the nature of the work, the characteristics of the workforce, and the ever-evolving job market. Let’s first talk about the key challenges in blue-collar recruitment and then the role of AI in navigating these challenges:

1. High turnover rates: Blue-collar jobs often have higher turnover rates than white-collar jobs. Factors such as physically demanding work, limited career advancement opportunities in some job functions, and seasonal employment tend to intensify these challenges. Frequent hiring of blue-collar workers that too seamlessly and efficiently, necessitates a robust AI-powered onboarding solution.

2. Geographical challenges: Some industries require blue-collar workers to be located in specific regions, such as construction workers needed at different construction sites. Some blue-collar workers, such as truck drivers or field technicians, may work remotely. This complicates in-person onboarding and identity verification of documents (Aadhaar, PAN, DL, etc.), work permits, and certifications for blue-collar workers.

3. Security concerns: Ensuring workplace safety is crucial for blue-collar jobs, and it adds an extra layer of complexity to the recruitment process. During onboarding, it’s imperative to meticulously verify whether the employees possess the requisite skills and exhibit a clean workplace conduct record. This diligence helps businesses prevent financial, reputational, and operational risks, and ensures compliance with industry-specific regulations and standards.

4. Regulatory compliance: Blue-collar recruitment often involves navigating complex labour laws and regulations, such as minimum wage laws and safety standards. Failure to comply with these regulations can lead to legal issues and penalties.

5. Communication barriers: Language and communication barriers can be significant challenges, especially in industries with a diverse workforce. Provide multilingual support, offer translated documents, and employ interpreters when necessary to ensure effective communication.

AI-driven tools and platforms have been helping organisations to stay at the forefront of innovation. Whether conducting real-time identity/document verification, large-scale remote onboarding, screening criminal/court records seamlessly, or staying compliant with ever-evolving regulations, AI is becoming the core tool in the organisations’ arsenal to navigate the blue-collar recruitment challenges. 
AI's role in conquering challenges
AI addresses onboarding/verification challenges right from the outset. During the initial stage of document submission, facial technology can help perform a real-time face match of the worker with the document’s photo. The state-of-the-art OCR engines can scan and extract information from identity documents such as Aadhaar, PAN, driver's license, etc., into machine-readable data for POI and POA verification in seconds.

The use case of AI/ML-enabled solutions also extends to criminal/court records verification conducted from proprietary databases built using authentic public sources of national criminal and civil court records. For accurate and faster criminal record search, utilising AI/ML-enabled text match, name match, and address match algorithms becomes key in overcoming security and theft risks.

Moreover, businesses stay on top of the compliance game with comprehensive reports and maintain audit trails to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Regarding speed and scalability, AI processes thousands of applications within seconds, optimising efficiency—eventually translating into substantial cost savings in the long run.
AI with human intelligence
AI is not a replacement for human judgement or vice versa; rather, it should be a complementary force. Combining AI’s data analysis and pattern recognition prowess with human expertise in assessing cultural fit can lead to the most effective hiring outcomes. That's why we have meticulously developed a comprehensive methodology that synergises the power of AI with human expertise to ensure seamless verification and onboarding of blue-collar workers.

Looking ahead, AI in blue-collar recruitment holds immense promise. Adopting AI in blue-collar recruitment represents a significant step forward in our quest for efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and fairness. By addressing ethical concerns and championing human-AI collaboration, we can unlock AI's full potential in shaping the workforce's future.

He predicts that only 6% of the workforce is at risk of having their job replaced by AI.""Now, over five years, are you saying we can't re-train 6 per cent of the working public?"" We need more people in healthcare, elderly care, teaching children, IT and cyber. That demand far exceeds the 6%.""#AI is projected to enhance human productivity and unlock an astounding $16T in value by 2030.

At @IBM, we believe smart regulation should be based on 3 core tenets: https://t.co/MUGoI4mU8K pic.twitter.com/O5nQsE16TgIn May, IBM halted hiring for 7,800 jobs that could be replaced by AI. The jobs were primarily non-customer-facing roles in departments such as human resources. Current staff will not be fired, but Krishna told Bloomberg he believed 30% of the department would be replaced by AI and automation in the next five years.There's still little clarity over how jobs will be affected by the widespread adoption of AI.Many fear AI will replace them in the workplace. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predicted that if AI lives up to its promised capabilities, it would impact 300 million full-time jobs, causing ""widespread disruption"" in the global labor market.But others see it as the great new technological leap forward and a tool for innovation that will generate more jobs. Goldman Sachs found that AI could raise global GDP by 7% over a 10-year period.While the IBM CEO is not worried about the threat to jobs, Krishna told the Sunday Times that other fears surrounding AI are more well-founded.National security – ""people misusing AI for terrorism, attacks on infrastructure, cyberattacks,"" – and misinformation being used to interfere with democracy are the two greatest threats in his view.""I don't get paranoid, but I do think a lot of those fears are well founded,"" he told the newspaper.IBM is sending a delegation to the world's first AI Safety Summit being next month at Bletchley Park, near London.

But, being a brilliant software developer is no longer enough. As large language models and AI permeate financial services, the kinds of people Citadel Securities needs to work on its electronic trading platform is changing. 

""The days of 'I'm a good programmer' are becoming numbered,"" /news/2023/10/ken-griffin-citadel, Citadel Securities' founder, told the/news/2023/07/citadel-interns there this summer, according tohttps://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-a-job-citadel-securities-engineering-tech-2023-10?r=US&IR=TNow that large language models can create code, it's less about translating problems into code than about solving problems themselves. Those problems can be ambiguous, and they often have commercial constraints.

Costas Bekas, a technologist who heads up Citadel Securities' research platform, told Business Insider that cloud platforms, for example, can be cumulatively expensive and that people need to be aware of this and to ""become owners of what they do.""

/myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletterAs developers increasingly rely upon AI to do coding work, Damien Neff, Citadel Securities's head of systematic trading technology, said it's simultaneously becoming more difficult to find people who can still do the really low level coding that's needed to interact with hardware and to process trades in the fastest possible way.  AI means that technologists see things at a ""high level"" said Neff, and they're losing this really low level coding ability. 

If you want to get a technology job at Citadel Securities in the age of AI, therefore, you either need to be excellent at solving problems in a commercial way, and communicating about that, or you need to be deep in the machine code weeds. The latter is probably harder to replicate. A previous generation of machine code veterans are nearing retirement - in 2019, Citadel hired /news/2019/06/technology-jobs-citadel, a veteran scientist from Bell Labs and creator of the first Fortran compiler, to advise its CEO on CTO on coding on the metal. Feldman is still there and by our reckoning he's approaching his 60s now. 

Separately, if you were hoping that the recent spate of IPOs signalled a recovery in deals and an improvement in the /news/2023/10/investment-banking-jobs-outlook, then bad luck. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-22/deals-rebound-crashes-into-a-new-world-of-risk-to-end-the-year?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-bloomberguk&utm_content=bloomberguk&utm_campaign=socialflow-organicreports that war in the Middle East, surging treasury yields, and a series of underwhelming IPOs are all putting the brakes on the new issuance rebound. There's some expectation that the IPO window might reopen from March '24. In the meantime, the most excited people are in convertible debt, which should thrive in a world where rates are higher for longer.
