Qualified AI professionals in the country are commanding as much as a 40-80% salary premium compared to traditional IT roles, experts and staffing firms told ET.Roles such as AI research scientist, AI marketing specialist, chatbot specialists, cybersecurity AI, computer vision engineer, robotics engineer along with AI ethics specialist are high in demand as companies scramble to fill new and specialised roles in AI. Other in-demand roles include prompt engineer, AI solutions architect, AI product manager, ML engineer, data scientist, AI governance policy analyst and chief AI officer (CAIO), which is a CXO role. Teamlease Digital, the technology staffing services firm estimates that overall demand for generative AI roles in India has soared ninefoldsince January. Data from four leading job portals show that there are more than 45,000 AI-related job openings inIndia currently, according to Quess IT Staffing. Experts say businesses are paying hefty salaries for AI talent recognising the need to rapidly adopt AI in their daily operations.“We talk about AI replacing jobs, but actually in our tech industry, we have a talent gap, a capacity gap,” said Paul Mariott, president – Asia Pacific and Japan, SAP. “Right now, the gap is not closing fast enough. The gap actually potentially could get bigger if we don’t keep accelerating the investment into the universities to bring that long term talent supply into the marketplace.”India’s second largest software services firm Infosys has trained close to 80% of its workforce in GenAI and the company is pivoting to a AI first model.“In the AI-first approach, we are building our own capabilities and we are ready to train even more people as we bring them onboard,” said Infosys CEO and MD, Salil Parekh. On being asked if India will lose its talent edge with the kind of roles getting automated, Parekh said, that they don’t see there will be reduction in talent demand from India.“Yes, Generative AI will have benefits, but we will also need to make sure it works across all the areas of the companies (and for that you will need people).”     111072712Aye Aye AIA 2024 study by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Access Partnership found that Indian workers with AI skills and expertise could see salary hikes of over 54%, with workers in IT (65%), research and development (62%), sales and marketing (59%), business operations (59%), and finance (59%) enjoying the highest pay bumps. Further, small and medium enterprises are willing to pay at least 56% more for AI-skilled talent, six percentage points higher than large-sized firms. “Generative AI offers an unprecedented opportunity to transform businesses across India,” said Amit Mehta, head of AWS Training and Certification, AWS India.Top skills employers in India demand currently and in five years’ time is AI/ML development, the study found. But while hiring AI-skilled talent is a priority for more than 9 in 10 (96%) employers, 79% said they cannot find the AI talent they need.Jobs of the future“We’re hiring for jobs today that didn’t exist as recently as last year,” said Deepak Pargaonkar, vice president, solution engineering, Salesforce India. While AI takes over repetitive jobs, it frees up human potential to do other value added and creative jobs, he added. “While the jobs of the future will fundamentally be around AI architecture, design and innovation, at the same time, a whole new world around AI engineering, AI instructors, AI trainers, data capabilities, as well as AI ethics specialists will open up,” said Pargaonkar. India has the second-highest installed AI talent base, with 420,000 employees. Yet, there is a significant demand-supply gap of 51%, requiring 600,000 professionals, Krishna Vij, business head of Teamlease Digital said. Globally, the demand for these roles is higher, especially in the US, China, and Europe, which lead in AI adoption and innovation. WhileIndia is rapidly catching up, the global demand remains higher due to more established AI infrastructures and investments in these regions, she added.Do or die “The situation currently is as profound as it was in the late 90s, when the Internet burst onto the scene, and gave rise to unforeseen applications and fundamental new innovations,” said Arvind Thakur, former vice chairman and MD, NIIT Technologies. For some industries, reskilling can be do or die.For instance, Ganesh Natarajan, former CEO of Zensar Technologies and executive chairman, 5F World, said with advances in AI, the IT industry can be transformed, accelerated or eliminated.“Over the next five years, 80% of the current role holders will have to either reskill themselves to use AI, or they’ll be eliminated,” Natarajan said, as most IT services roles can be automated. He added that people who would be protected from this churn would includethose doing intelligent consulting work, building information architectures, designing user experiences, and designing AI for organisations.IT businesses can probably make do with 40% less people or experience, as AI enhances productivity, Natarajan said. And while employees who are at the top of the AI skills pyramid could be paid about 20-30% more, those at the bottom would become cheaper, with overall improvement in costs of about 20%. The human factor, however, will remain front and centre. “As we look towards the future of work, AI technology emerges not merely as a tool, but as a transformative force… In this AI-enhanced landscape, the key is not to compete with AI, but to complement it,” said Vineet Nayar, former CEO, HCLTech and chairman, Sampark Foundation.","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111072613,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-52550,overlay-ettech/photo.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 900}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Annapurna Roy'}","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Economic Times', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76939477,width-600,height-60,quality-100/economictimes.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",https://schema.org/False,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'https://schema.org/False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Economic Times', 'productID': 'prime.economictimes.indiatimes.com:prime'}","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the interview, Gates expressed his belief that AI will not replace software engineers in the near future, despite its potential to revolutionise many sectors.""The amazing thing about this technology is that we know it can help in key areas, and we know it can create educational tutors. We have seen several projects in India and the US that are showing great results. The potential is incredible if we knew that all it did was make jobs more productive,"" Gates said during the interview, highlighting the positive impact AI can have on education and other crucial fields.When asked about the concerns surrounding AI potentially taking away jobs from software engineers, Gates dismissed such worries as ""alarmist."" During the interview, he emphasised, ""We still need those software engineers as we are not going to stop needing them."" This statement comes as a reassurance to those in the software engineering industry who may fear job displacement due to advancements in AI technology.However, Gates did acknowledge the possibility of AI reaching a point where it could potentially replace all jobs, but he believes this scenario is unlikely to occur within the next two decades. ""Although I am not sure of that,"" he added with a smile, suggesting that predicting the long-term impact of AI is not an exact science.Bill Gates on his relationship with IndiaGates fondly recalled his company's early relationship with India, saying, ""I've had a fabulous relationship with India starting with the Microsoft experience where we hired some very smart IT graduates, and brought them to Seattle."" He praised current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who is of Indian origin, and noted that while India is ""first class in so many ways,"" it still faces challenges such as poverty and a backlogged legal system. ""Believe me, the legal things done in the US won't apply here. But, just imagine, if you could make everybody in the legal system four times more productive, that changes justice because right now the backlog is kind of nightmarish,"" Gates remarked.","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-111014938/111014938.jpg', 'width': 1280, 'height': 720}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'TOI Tech Desk', 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-TOI-Tech-Desk-479263800.cms'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Times Of India', 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-92877370/92877370.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111014938,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1302621,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/111014902'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The meeting included someone from HR, his manager, and upper management—and ultimately resulted in the sudden end to his job as a web support associate with Microsoft.
Microsoft reportedly laid off some 1,000 people in early June, pulling from its mixed reality and Azure cloud departments, and also Damigos’ consumer sales division. An email to employees from Jason Zander, executive vice president of strategic missions and technologies at Microsoft, leaked to Business Insider, blamed a pivot to invest in artificial intelligence: “Our clear focus as a company is to define the AI wave and empower all our customers to succeed in the adoption of this transformative technology. Along the way, we make decisions that align with our long-term vision and strategy while ensuring the sustainability and growth of Microsoft.”
Damigos, who lives in Tacoma, Washington, says he wasn’t told that a push for AI directly led to the end of his job specifically, which involved helping customers understand how to use Microsoft products. But it’s clear that Microsoft, the largest backer of OpenAI, is all in on the tech. “I think the shift toward AI work has unfortunately led to the deprioritization of some essential customer-facing roles,” says Damigos, who has been chronicling his layoff journey and showcasing his skills on TikTok. “I helped people understand how to effectively use and understand the products.” He adds that he felt his team had “a lot of potential” to make a better customer experience for Microsoft—but ultimately, the company moved to make investments elsewhere.
Microsoft did not confirm the authenticity of Zander’s emails. “Organizational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business,” says Craig Cincotta, a Microsoft spokesperson. “We will continue to prioritize and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners.”
No one knows yet quite how AI will impact work in the long term, but many experts largely agree that AI will not replace most workers anytime soon. “AI will reshape the labor market,” says Nick Bunker, director of economic research at the job board Indeed. “It’s just not clear how it will reshape it.” Some predict that it will create more jobs—but some workers are currently training their own AI replacements. But the layoffs happening now show that AI hype, not futuristic AI colleagues, can cause thousands of people to lose their jobs.
Microsoft isn’t alone. Dropbox announced 500 layoffs in April 2023, and CEO Drew Houston acknowledged that AI had played a role. “In an ideal world, we’d simply shift people from one team to another. And we’ve done that wherever possible,” Houston’s statement said. “However, our next stage of growth requires a different mix of skill sets, particularly in AI and early-stage product development.”
Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg made similar statements about cutting jobs to invest in AI earlier this year, saying in a post in February: “A major goal will be building the most popular and most advanced AI products and services,” as Meta left its “year of efficiency,” which resulted in downsizing the company.
Google, too, has funneled money into its Anthropic AI developments, and its CEO, Sindar Pichai, warned of continuous cuts throughout 2024, which began in January. That comes despite Google reporting strong growth. “We’re responsibly investing in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,” says Bailey Tomson, a Google spokesperson. In 2023 and 2024, several Google teams “made changes to become more efficient and work better,” Tomson says. “Through this, we’re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers.”
This pivot-to-AI narrative echoes past moves by tech companies, like outsourcing workers, which led to poor working conditions for some contracted workers in other countries. “It feels less like there’s a real connection between investment in AI and trade-offs having to be made in other parts of the workforce, but really that this is a narrative shift being used to package a shift that predates the move to AI,” says Parul Koul, president of the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA, which represents some employees from the companies affected by recent layoffs. But because workers don’t receive a lot of transparency about whether their layoffs are tied to AI, it’s still hard to tie some job cuts directly to the tech, Koul says.
The next step, naturally, would be to see the AI that these companies invest in further disrupt their own workplaces. But for now, that doesn’t seem to be happening. AI-fueled layoffs are making up a small portion of job cuts across industries. More than 5,000 jobs were cut between May 2023 and April 2024 where companies cited AI as the reason—but this was either due to companies shifting focus to developing AI tech or because they used AI tools to take over tasks and roles, according to a report from outplacement services firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas.
In the tech world alone, there have been nearly 100,000 layoffs in 2024, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts in the tech industry. Still, specific types of jobs are beginning to bounce back. Openings for AI roles or those that require AI skills made up 12 percent of all tech job offerings in May—the largest percentage in six years—according to CompTIA, a nonprofit trade association for the US IT industry. But AI doesn’t exist in a silo, says Tim Herbert, CompTIA’s chief research officer, and its adoption will likely create adjacent jobs needed to support the new technology. “AI will probably spur investment in other areas,” he says.
The AI reshuffle may not be the great AI takeover, but if AI is the next big opportunity for companies like Alphabet, the lack of efforts to up-skill and train employees to work in those divisions is troubling, Koul says. “There are ways in which the existing workforce can be kept whole or treated with dignity and respect through this process,” Koul says. “A lot of my coworkers, a lot of our union members, work here because they are mission-driven, they believe in the utility of the products they are working on. More opportunities for retraining and moving people to other divisions would be very welcome.”","[""https://media.wired.com/photos/666c7ad24d64eaede289c781/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/AI-Hype-Alone-is-Already-Taking-People's-Jobs-Business-GettyImages-1672366501.jpg"", ""https://media.wired.com/photos/666c7ad24d64eaede289c781/4:3/w_2132,h_1599,c_limit/AI-Hype-Alone-is-Already-Taking-People's-Jobs-Business-GettyImages-1672366501.jpg"", ""https://media.wired.com/photos/666c7ad24d64eaede289c781/1:1/w_1204,h_1204,c_limit/AI-Hype-Alone-is-Already-Taking-People's-Jobs-Business-GettyImages-1672366501.jpg""]","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Amanda Hoover', 'sameAs': 'https://www.wired.com/author/amanda-hoover/'}]","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'WIRED', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/newsletter-signup-hub.jpg', 'width': '500px', 'height': '100px'}, 'url': 'https://www.wired.com'}",True,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'WIRED'}",,N/A,N/A,N/A,"https://media.wired.com/photos/666c7ad24d64eaede289c781/2:3/w_1066,h_1599,c_limit/AI-Hype-Alone-is-Already-Taking-People's-Jobs-Business-GettyImages-1672366501.jpg",,https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-coming-for-big-tech-jobs-but-not-in-the-way-you-think/,Companies aren’t replacing workers with AI yet.

But, according to a new report from Citigroup researchers, ""finance will be at the forefront of the changes."" ""What a bank or financial firm looks like in the mid-2020s, be it retail or wholesale finance, looks very different to the mid-1980s, or the mid-1940s,"" the report said. ""AI will repeat this cycle, possibly speeding it up.""While general-purpose technologies, or GPTs, create new opportunities for innovation and can improve quality of life, ""they also destroy existing ways of doing things,"" the report added. ""And as such, they also create losers, especially in the short term.""With data pulled from Accenture Research and the World Economic Forum, Citi's researchers said that about 67% of banking jobs have ""higher potential"" to be automated or augmented by AI. That means ""banking jobs"" (which the report didn't narrowly define) have the highest potential for AI-led job displacement.However, according to Citi, a decline in head count may be partially or completely offset by an increase in AI-related compliance managers and ethics and governance staff.One upside Citi pointed out, however, is that they estimate the profit pool for the 2023 global banking sector ""could increase 9% or $170 billion from the adoption of AI, rising from just over $1.7 trillion to close to $2 trillion.""The Citi researchers believe the ""pace of implementing modern AI tools in financial services, in particular, GenAI, will be relatively slow when compared to other sectors,"" they said in the report, in part because of the ""highly regulated nature of the sector and lack of 'ready to go globally aligned rules.'""""A regulatory landscape is evolving in some jurisdictions, but it is a challenging road ahead for financial services firms when it comes to implementation because countries are moving to different speeds, taking different approaches towards regulation and in some cases changing their position on whether to regulate,"" it said. In an interview featured in the report, Shameek Kundu, the head of financial services and chief strategy officer at TruEra, weighed in on the same point.""I would describe traditional AI adoption in financial services as: widespread, shallow, and inconsequential,"" said Kundu.Kundu explains that there are ""a large number of enterprises experimenting with AI across different use cases,"" yet ""limited scale of AI adoption across use cases"" and a ""limited perceived impact of AI system failures on critical business operations.""He cited a 2022 Bank of England survey, which found that ""72% of firms reported using or developing machine learning applications,"" yet the ""median number of ML applications for mainstream UK financial institutions to be just 20-30"" and ""less than 20% of the already few AI use cases were critical to business.""","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://i.insider.com/667337392efa138e0330ffa3?width=919&format=jpeg', 'width': 919, 'height': 689}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Emmalyse Brownstein', 'sameAs': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/author/emmalyse-brownstein'}","{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Insider', 'legalName': 'Insider Inc.', 'foundingDate': '2007', 'url': 'www.businessinsider.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness', 'https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/businessinsider', 'https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderBusiness'], 'founder': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Henry Blodget'}, 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/structured-data.png', 'width': 305, 'height': 60}}",False,"[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.content-lock-content'}]",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,"More than half of banking jobs could be automated by AI — but banks will be slow to adopt, Citi report says","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/', 'name': 'Business Insider'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/finance', 'name': 'Finance'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/artificial-intelligence', 'name': 'AI'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-could-automate-more-than-half-of-banking-jobs-citi-2024-6', 'name': 'More than half of banking jobs could be automated by AI — but banks will be slow to adopt, Citi report says'}}]",,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Michelle Abrego'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the topics was the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment, with a proposal for a “robot tax” to reskill displaced workers, ToI reported.Also Read: Economists bat for capex push, fiscal prudence and more jobs at pre-Budget meetThe discussion with the finance minister covered various critical areas, including measures to push private investment, job creation, maintaining fiscal prudence, and managing debt levels and food inflation. One notable topic was the increased use of artificial intelligence and its potential impact on employment. An economist suggested exploring the idea of a “robot tax,” which could fund the reskilling and rehabilitation of workers affected by AI-driven displacement.The recommendation for a “robot tax” aligns with a paper by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which, while acknowledging that AI can enhance employment and wages overall, also warned of the possibility of significant job losses for extended periods, making the transition painful for many workers. Although the IMF paper advised against implementing a “robot tax,” it highlighted the need to reassess labor policies and social protection mechanisms.The IMF paper suggested a stronger focus on skilling and sector-based training alongside expanding unemployment insurance coverage and considering wage insurance. It also recommended that countries review their current corporate tax systems to see how they incentivize investments in automation.In a recent interview, IMF first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath emphasized the significant challenge AI poses for developing countries, which often lack extensive social safety nets.“If you look at the fraction of young people who are neither in school, nor working or in any kind of training, that number is much higher than in advanced economies. Which means that their ability to either benefit from the transition or adapt to the transition is going to be more difficult. These are areas where developing countries will have to invest more in trying to provide a stronger digital infrastructure, more education and training so that they can also benefit from this technology,” she said.Economists noted the uncertain full impact of AI technology but acknowledged its potential for significant productivity gains. They also recognized that AI might create new types of jobs, although the government should prepare for related challenges. While it is not confirmed if AI-related steps will be included in the upcoming Budget, the technology may be mentioned in the Economic Survey, which will be presented before next month's Union Budget.The conversation between economists and the finance minister reflects ongoing efforts to balance technological advancement with economic stability and social welfare. The discussions underscore the importance of strategic planning in addressing the implications of AI on the labor market and broader economic policies.(with ToI inputs)","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111134318,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-101516,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 900}","{'@type': 'Thing', 'name': 'ET Online'}","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Economic Times', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76939477,width-600,height-60,quality-100/economictimes.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",https://schema.org/False,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'https://schema.org/False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Economic Times', 'productID': 'prime.economictimes.indiatimes.com:prime'}","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was no different on Wednesday when most of the discussion with FM Nirmala Sitharaman saw proposals to push private investment, job creation, sticking to the path of fiscal prudence, while also keeping an eye on the overall debt, and managing food inflation.Like most discussions these days, artificial intelligence too came up during the meeting, with at least one economist referring to its increased use and the impact that it can have, especially on employment. Another economist, while referring to it, is said to have suggested the possibility of exploring “robot tax”, which can be used to reskill and rehabilitate workers who are displaced.The recommendation comes days after a paper by the IMF, while noting that AI can boost overall employment and wages, argued that it can “put large swaths of the labour force out of work for extended periods, making for a painful transition”. While it spoke against the imposition of “robot tax”, it suggested reassessment of labour policies and social protection mechanisms.It suggested greater focus on skilling and sector-based training, apart from broadening the coverage and generosity of unemployment insurance and considering some forms of wage insurance. The paper recommended that countries can reconsider the design of current corporate tax systems in how they incentivise investments in automation.In an interview on Tuesday, IMF first deputy MD Gita Gopinath suggested that challenges for developing countries may be bigger as they do not have large social safety nets.“If you look at the fraction of young people who are neither in school, nor working or in any kind of training, that number is much higher than in advanced economies. Which means that their ability to either benefit from the transition or adapt to the transition is going to be more difficult. These are areas where developing countries will have to invest more in trying to provide a stronger digital infrastructure, more education and training so that they can also benefit from this technology,” she said.Economists said the full implication of how the technology plays out is still unclear and it will result in large productivity gains for the economy. Besides, they said it may lead to the creation of new kinds of jobs, although govt may have to prepare to deal with the challenges. While any steps in the Budget may not necessarily be taken this time, AI may find a mention in the Economic Survey, which is due to be tabled ahead of next month’s Union Budget.","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-111122808/111122808.jpg', 'width': 1280, 'height': 720}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sidhartha', 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Sidhartha-19875.cms'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Times Of India', 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-92877370/92877370.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111122808,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-26848,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/111122813'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative artificial intelligence is poised to change how fashion works, but whether that’s good news or bad news might depend on what job you’re doing.
If you’re in control of budgets, AI offers opportunities to cut headcounts or reallocate resources more profitably. However, if you’re starting out in a career, AI could reduce opportunity, particularly in starter roles.
As tasks become faster and easier, brands see an opportunity to shift some manual tasks from humans to machines. First up for streamlining: human-led and often time-consuming roles, such as copywriting, coding, customer service, clienteling, photo editing and 3D design and illustration.
Brands are already utilising the power of AI to cut production and operations costs. In May, LVMH awarded its 2024 Innovation Award to Chinese startup FancyTech, a platform that is collaborating with LVMH brands. FancyTech uses generative artificial intelligence to produce videos from 3D product models and creative briefs. A separate prize went to Blng, an LA-based company that uses AI to convert sketches of jewellery into visualisations. Meanwhile, AI investment from the likes of LVMH-owned Sephora is focused on improving chatbots to supercharge the customer experience online.
The Estée Lauder Companies is using generative AI to measure customer sentiment, aid in writing copy and make product recommendations; a new innovation lab, with Microsoft, is developing tools that help internal teams identify and respond to trends, such as an internal chatbot that helps brands source products that identify specific problems. Revolve has tested it for generating new product designs, while Adore Me is enabling customers to customise their own bra and panty sets. Adore Me also uses generative AI to inform SEO-optimised product descriptions, but VP of strategy Ranjan Roy says that, ultimately, any copy customers end up seeing is approved and finalised by human employees.
AI provides opportunities in the fashion and retail sectors across multiple categories, according to Lamees Butt, CEO and founder of Riser, an AI-powered career matchmaking app for brands — “from the way trends are consumed and created to the retail customer journey”. It will “profoundly impact” the workforce, particularly in roles related to design, marketing and customer service, Butt says.
Some businesses have moved fast to maximise the opportunity. Swedish e-commerce payment company Klarna says AI has contributed to 37 per cent of its cost savings, equating to $10 million annually, for tasks related to external marketing, image production and general company efficiency.
A study from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), released in January, suggests that almost 40 per cent of employment worldwide is exposed to AI. Advanced economies are most exposed, while also being better positioned to leverage its benefits.
Roles such as retail specialists and store managers will “take the heat more than others”, says Adam Jackson, founder and CEO of AI recruiting app Braintrust, but he sees change everywhere. “AI is automating tasks like trend prediction, inventory management, and even churning out creative clothing patterns.”
Talented employees or applicants need not worry, he assures. “Many retailers are deploying AI to their advantage, focusing on hiring the right talent, as opposed to collecting the most résumés,” he says.
The ability to work with AI is becoming an essential skill to add to the average CV. Fashion job boards are introducing roles that require AI competency, such as data governance managers at LVMH or data scientists at Estée Lauder Companies — roles that require candidates to be comfortable with the “implementation of AI capabilities”.
Mindful implementation
As fashion and retail hurries to implement generative AI solutions, experts warn of the risks of moving too fast.
For all its potential, AI could prompt a knee-jerk response from overexcited business leaders. Partha Gopalakrishnan, president of Brane Group, a consultancy specialising in AI solutions, and a former senior executive at Infosys, has noted “a spate of layoffs, teething errors in retailers’ systems and even big firms ceasing working with creative agencies and freelancers”.
Gopalakrishnan is concerned that the human factor may be neglected by fashion executives prioritising quick-win opportunities. “Fashion and retail executives need to take a step back and rethink their approach. [The industry] needs to invest in talent, culture and training first, and then it can start to fold AI into its operations,” he says.
He suggests that retailers should be looking to employ “highly adaptable candidates” with the ability to unlearn and relearn, complemented by the introduction of comprehensive internal training and upskilling.
In the interim, some governments are stepping in to alleviate concerns around the impact. Last autumn, for example, the US Biden administration issued an executive order calling for support when it comes to job training, with hopes to mitigate job displacement.
Some companies, already in this mindset, have invested in training programmes to help employees gain AI and data analysis skills. Nike, for example, deploys AI-powered tools that provide its senior leadership team with access to custom analytics tailored to support decision-making. Tapestry-owned Coach has an internal dashboard that provides relevant data to all employees, enabling staff to understand trends and make more informed recommendations. German-based Hugo Boss has worked with external consultancy Metyis to build out what it describes as a “dedicated data science campus”.
Upskilling
Momentum is building in upskilling teams. Estée Lauder and Microsoft have collaborated on creating an AI innovation lab to upskill Estée Lauder employees. The company is able to use Microsoft’s tech expertise to develop in-house solutions that are specific to its business, and therefore didn’t require additional employees to build out these efforts.
Altava Group, a fashion-tech company that emerged from LVMH’s La Maison des Startups business accelerator, has launched a proprietary generative AI tool for accessible 3D fashion design. The business is upskilling its team and hiring employees with specific skill sets relating to machine learning and AI, says founder and CEO Andy Ku. “We are upskilling our team in distributed computing, blockchain and data learning — considering [the development of] our AI engine and our [new] target vertical, which includes 3D asset and item creation using data from our experience in luxury fashion use cases.”
Riser’s Butt advises brands to use AI tools that keep human connection and creativity — known to be key drivers of success — front of mind. “People and purpose are the most powerful parts of any brand,” says Butt. “The companies that will win are those open to embracing new solutions that blend technology with a human-centric approach, ensuring that AI enhances — rather than replaces — the unique value that only people can bring.”

Nevertheless, an increasing number of people are becoming worried regarding potential implications on employment associated with its fast progress. This is because when used to replace people from various job positions, AI can have a huge impact..The Impact of AI on Various Industries: AI and Job Displacement.The impact of artificial intelligence on the job displacement differs greatly from one sector to another. For example, in manufacturing, AI-operated robots and automated systems are being introduced on assembly lines and warehouses, thus replacing human workers.These innovations simplify the manufacturing process, minimize the rate of errors, and boost effectiveness with a simultaneous decrease in manual labor demand.The financial sector is changing due to a wide range of AI algorithms which operate by automating common activities including data analysis, risk assessment, and fraud detection. It implies that the functioning of analysts, traders, as well as financial advisors will never be the same again as their routine responsibilities are gradually being influenced by factors such as changing job requirements and competencies.The transportation industry is changing in big ways due to self-driving cars. While they offer safer and more effective ways of moving from one point to another, they end up taking over the work of people who drive vehicles such as lorries and cabs and bring parcels to clients..The Multifaced AI Impact: Jobs Displacement or Creation?.One can concede that artificial intelligence contributes to the current discourse on whether it eliminates jobs or generates them. The shift between people and robots could lead to the loss of about 85 million jobs by 2025, as stated by the Future of Jobs 2020 report but the opening of 97 million new positions would also take place.AI technologies are very good at performing tasks that involve routine, repetition, and large amounts of data, thereby being more efficient than any human beings in freeing people from the chains of boring activities and enabling them to concentrate on creative and intricate matters.At this point where AI and job displacement is debatable, the remarkable transfer of repetitive responsibilities onto AI systems has led to incredible surge of efficacy, considerable savings and enhanced customer experiences in manufacturing, logistics and customer service industries.""I do feel that technological progress cannot be stopped, but its antagonistic effect on human labour should be regulated.""&nbsp;- Mahatma Gandhi.Redirecting AI on Jobs and Socio-Economic Platform.Using AI can have effects on jobs and socio-economic platforms and they are:.Potential job losses for automation:.AI could cause some jobs to be replaced by automated systems, as it has the ability to automate tasks that are repetitive and monotonous movies in no time at all. Hence, this point addresses the displacement of AI and job displacement. AI Jobs that can be programmed for robots to do, would include those that could be broken down into simple commands or tasks.For instance, in manufacturing, AI making flexible robots can be used for replacing humans while it comes to assembly lines. In customer service, chatbots that are increasingly talented are designed to process elementary questions..The Alterations in Work: AI and Job Displacement.AI is causing job loss, but let's remember that over time, technology has transformed the nature of jobs rather than totally getting rid of them.When ordinary tasks are automated, newly created job vacancies are generated that demand exceptional human capabilities, including creativity, problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and adaptability.Furthermore, AI can improve human abilities, allowing employees to concentrate on advanced tasks based on complicated judgment and critical deliberations..Talented and adaptation.With the wide spread usage of AI technologies, there has been need to have a workforce that has complimentary and leveraged skills to these advancements. The demand for data analysis skills, machine learning, programming, and AI system management continues to rise because routine and repetitive tasks are done by AI.Upgrading of skills and new training programs are necessary to control possible job losses initiated by AI. It is important for all stakeholders, educators’ employers as well as policymakers, among others, to ensure collaboration, which would provide room for an education system that moves with market trends, thereby offering trained manpower in such growing fields.Thus, job possibilities will increase as more individuals get reschooled as these changes take place.It is advised that employees in danger of being replaced by AI ought to seek alternate skills by themselves and find a way of adjusting as jobs transform. Educating oneself now to discover why doing so can prepare one for lifelong employment in a world based on these machines is important. Especially, if one prescribes to self-directed learning or continuous professional development..Socio-economic implications.There are far-reaching and multi-faceted socio-economic implications of job displacement by AI. High levels of vulnerability are associated with low-skilled labor forces, which usually involve tasks that can be automated. Consequently, failure to take appropriate measures will lead to even greater income disparities and social disparities.AI poses socio-economic challenges that must be grappled with by governments and policy-makers. This can be done, for example, by coming up with job retaining programs, systems for ensuring income during transitions, as well as measures leading to all-encompassing economic growth.The change toward AI-powered economies forces one to reconsider labor market operation and social protections. The necessary factors for mitigating negative automation impact on the workforce include policies that enhance employment growth within AI-related sectors, promote entrepreneurship as well as guarantee equitable opportunity approaches..The Future Outlook on AI and Job Displacement.The ongoing development of AI presents both challenges and prospects for the job industry. As new careers emerge in the AI sector, these may be a real stimulus for technological development.The number of vacancies for artificial intelligence specialists, machine learning software engineers, data scientists, and cybersecurity specialists is growing at a fast pace. These jobs need specifically skilled personnel to create and support artificial intelligence systems, marking a change of direction in today’s job market focusing on technology drive.In addition, AI technologies promises to improve performance, creativity, and competition within various fields. If robotic technology performs repetitive duties, it leads to human capital being directed on creative or strategic activities, hence enhancing a more energetic workforce..Ethical Considerations.AI and job displacement should be considered carefully for the deployment of responsible AI. The promising potentials of AI in enhancing efficiency and realization of economic benefits notwithstanding, ethical issues are raised pertaining to fairness, transparency, and ethics in automating the process of making decisions.To promote trust and responsible AI adoption, it is essential that guidelines, as well as frameworks that prioritize human rights, fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI development, be established. These ethical solutions must require collaboration among stakeholders that includes technology developers, policymakers, businesses, and civil society organizations..Conclusion.To sum up, artificial intelligence is certainly transforming the future of work, offering opportunities and difficulties for various worldwide sectors, laborers, and communities. The speed at which artificial intelligence is being taken up, in addition to technological evolution, calls for well-thought-out means of dealing with job losses, improving employees’ skills, and prompting growth that benefits everyone.It is essential that different players work together in order to use AI’s potential in the labor market and solve problems caused by job technology. The stakeholders include schools, employers’ organizations, government bodies such as ministries of education or labor affairs, as well as any other relevant organization that can contribute towards this objective of saving jobs through collaboration.The future of work has been redefined as industries adopt AI technologies- who will take part in this process while some will innovate it? These are some questions raised by embracing them in a thoughtful way that incorporates everyone so that we may all take advantage of such an opportunity that has never existed before, one where creativity flourishes alongside increased levels of efficiency, leading to human health improvement..FAQs.1.

Good evening.

The IMF today joined a growing list of organisations to warn about the implications of generative AI, arguing that it raised “profound concerns about massive labour disruptions and rising inequality”.

Governments needed to do more to prepare workforces such as improving unemployment insurance, the IMF said, pointing out that, unlike the disruptive technologies of the past, higher-skilled occupations were also at risk.

Generative AI — the ability of computers to generate text or images from human prompts — first came to mass attention with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022, fuelling a boom in global tech stocks.

The question of how the technology is regulated has also been rising up the agenda, kick-started by the EU’s AI Act and initial responses in the US, which are provoking a fierce response from Big Tech. Silicon Valley is particularly upset over California’s AI safety bill, which calls for a “kill switch” to turn off powerful AI models.

Big Tech’s AI dealmaking is also under fire from US antitrust authorities, which are concerned that the transformative technology is being concentrated among a few deep-pocketed companies. The likes of OpenAI meanwhile are upping their lobbying efforts.

Governments at the same time are vying for a piece of the action. We report today on how India is offering incentives to Big Tech to spend billions on infrastructure to transform the country into a major consumer and exporter of AI. Argentina meanwhile is trying a different tack, offering itself as a low-regulation AI hub for companies hampered by restrictions in the US and EU.

The impact on the labour market has been at the forefront of concerns. The IMF estimated in January that AI would affect almost 40 per cent of jobs around the world, while Goldman Sachs said AI could replace 300mn full-time jobs, while creating others and boosting productivity.

If organisations are successful in retraining workers for the AI world in skills such as “prompt engineering” — the process of writing the most effective text prompts to generate the desired response from an AI application — the productivity gains could be immense. One AI software company says global productivity improvements from generative AI could be worth $1.75tn a year by 2033.

Moreover, sweeping predictions of a job apocalypse (see Elon Musk’s assertion that AI would make all jobs obsolete) are rather overdone, writes FT innovation editor John Thornhill.

Such dystopian forecasts ignore our past experience with new technologies, often confusing technological feasibility with economic viability, Thornhill writes. And while it is easy to see the jobs that will be disrupted by AI, it is hard to imagine those that will be created: many of today’s jobs did not exist just a few decades ago — in medicine, software, or solar power, for example.

It will still be incumbent on governments however to take an “agile” approach that prepares them for “highly disruptive scenarios”, the author of today’s IMF report argues. And because of the global reach of AI, “it’ll be really important more than ever for countries to work together,” the author concludes.

Rachel Reeves, the UK’s new chancellor should Labour win the general election, told the FT she would seek to improve UK-EU trade terms. In an interview outlining her preparations for government, Reeves said she wanted to secure billions of pounds of investment via an early international summit.

Oil and gas chiefs said Labour’s pledge to axe North Sea tax allowances threatened their investments in the basin, with several projects already put on hold. While Labour’s plan to stop issuing new licences was expected by the industry, several companies told the FT they were now unsure about the profitability of projects they already have licences for.

The big question for many people of course is: will the election leave me better off? FT writers examine the party manifestos to see which will have the biggest impact on your personal finances.

A European Central Bank official dismissed the idea of using emergency powers to intervene in the French bond market after the announcement of a snap parliamentary election caused a debt sell-off. French stocks have just had their worst week since 2022 over fears of a populist poll win.

China opened an anti-dumping investigation into EU pork imports, increasing trade tensions just a few days after Brussels said it would impose tariffs on electric vehicle shipments from China. Fresh data underlined the challenges facing Chinese policymakers as growth in industrial output slowed and property prices fell sharply.

Australia’s trade with China meanwhile has hit record levels, despite wider tensions in the region, as relations between the two countries recovered after a damaging dispute sparked by the pandemic.

Pakistan, the fourth-largest exporter of rice, is selling record amounts to global markets as it profits from trade restrictions introduced last year by India, the world’s biggest. The windfall is sorely needed in a country beset by weak economic growth and double-digit inflation.

Global defence companies are hiring at the fastest rate since the end of the cold war as order books overflow, according to an FT survey. Governments around the world have ramped up military spending since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and amid widespread geopolitical tensions

US bosses’ pay is rising at the fastest rate in 14 years, according to official data which critics say risk worsening social inequality. A key example is last week’s victory by Tesla chief Elon Musk in securing a $56bn package of stock options — the largest in US history.

Chilean state-owned Codelco, the world’s biggest copper miner, said it could reverse a severe production slump that has hit 25-year lows just as global demand surges. The head of Freeport, the third-biggest copper producer, said oil and gas-style industry consolidation was vital for the clean energy transition.

Japan’s TDK claimed a breakthrough in its small solid-state batteries. The Apple supplier said new material provided an energy density — the amount that can be squeezed into a given space — about 100 times greater than its current battery.

Companies have been busy trumpeting their enlightened approach to mental health in the workplace. A new report however suggests fear of discrimination means many workers are still nervous about revealing the nature of their problems.

One of the drivers of mental ill health is excessive working hours, especially in sectors such as banking, where senior and junior staff alike are feeling the burden of rising workloads and demands amid intense competition.

Could discrimination against working class accents when it comes to Britain’s top jobs finally be on the way out? Big banks and City law firms are among those employers attempting to address the problem,

Business leaders are stepping up efforts to manage Gen Z workers, a cohort, according to a new survey, that is more engaged with social and political causes.

Ever thought of WFH (working from hairdressers, that is)? Salons are busy installing power sockets and creating quiet areas for remote working in a bid to draw back customers.

Today is World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought. Amid dire warnings about the state of the planet, there is however a glimmer of hope: sustainable sources of energy, including solar and wind power, can help reverse the process, the UN says.","{'@type': 'ImageObject', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F071372cf-d457-4b76-b79e-d64f76672455.png?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1', 'width': 1400, 'height': 787}","[{'@type': 'Person', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'name': 'Darren Dodd', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/darren-dodd', 'worksFor': {'@type': 'Organization', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'name': 'Financial Times', 'legalName': 'The Financial Times Ltd.', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'url': 'https://im.ft-static.com/m/img/masthead_main.jpg', 'width': 435, 'height': 36}, 'url': 'https://www.ft.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.twitter.com/FT', 'https://www.facebook.com/financialtimes', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/financial-times', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/FinancialTimesVideos', 'https://www.instagram.com/financialtimes']}}]","{'@type': 'Organization', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'name': 'Financial Times', 'legalName': 'The Financial Times Ltd.', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'url': 'https://im.ft-static.com/m/img/masthead_main.jpg', 'width': 435, 'height': 36}, 'url': 'https://www.ft.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.twitter.com/FT', 'https://www.facebook.com/financialtimes', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/financial-times', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/FinancialTimesVideos', 'https://www.instagram.com/financialtimes']}",False,,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Financial Times', 'productID': 'ft.com:subscribed'}",,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,IMF warns of massive labour disruption from AI,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Economy', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/economy'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'World', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/world'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Global Economy', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/global-economy'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FT.com,,,,1290.0,,,,,,,,,,,

More than half (61%) of large US firms plan to use AI within the next year to automate tasks previously done by employees, according to a survey of finance chiefs released Thursday. Those tasks include everything from paying suppliers and doing invoices to financial reporting, said the survey conducted by Duke University and the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond. That’s in addition to creative tasks for which some businesses are already relying on ChatGPT and other AI chatbots to assist, including crafting job posts, writing press releases and building marketing campaigns. The findings show companies are increasingly turning to AI to cut costs, boost profits and make their workers more productive. “You can’t be running an innovative company without seriously considering these technologies. You run the risk of being left behind,” Duke finance professor John Graham, academic director of the survey, told CNN in a phone interview. The CFO Survey, a collaboration of Duke and the Atlanta and Richmond Fed banks, found that nearly one in three (32%) firms — large or small — plan to use AI in the next year to complete tasks once done by humans. Why bosses are deploying AI Some of this is already happening — especially among larger firms that have the financial firepower to experiment with AI. Nearly 60% of all companies (and 84% of large companies) surveyed said that over the past year they have already leaned on software, equipment or technology including AI to automate tasks employees previously did. The survey was conducted between May 13 and June 3. Bosses are turning to AI for a variety of reasons, including to trim what they are spending on human workers. The CFO Survey found that companies say they are using automation to increase product quality (58% of firms); increase output (49%), reduce labor costs (47%) and substitute for workers (33%). Still, the good news for workers is that some experts don’t believe AI will cause mass job loss, at least not right away. “I don’t think there will be a lot of job loss in the year,” said Graham. “In the short run, this will be more about plugging some holes and possibly not hiring someone they would have otherwise — but not laying someone off. In part that’s because this is all-brand new.” AI co-pilots on the way? Yet workers will feel the impact of AI adoption, if they aren’t already. “This could give humans more time to prioritize what is most important and rewarding,” said Graham. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire investor and co-founder of LinkedIn, told CNN that AI will likely disrupt some jobs but not in the immediate future. “Years, not decades, but years, not months,” Hoffman said, referring to the timing of AI displacing humans. “I believe in three to five years, we’ll all have kind of an agent co-pilot that’s helping us with anything from how we cook dinner…to doing your job and writing and so forth.” Hoffman, who last year wrote a book called “Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI” with the assistance from ChatGPT-4, stressed that for a number of years it will be a co-pilot, not a pilot. “It’s job transformation. Human jobs will be replaced — but will be replaced by other humans using AI,” he said. “The whole ideas is to be the human who is using AI, to learn it, to do it, to make it happen.” AI and inflation For now, bosses and employees remain concerned about the cost of living and inflationary pressures. The CFO Survey found that inflation is the No. 2 concern for the next year among US chief financial officers – behind only the related concern of interest rates and monetary policy. Most CFOs (57%) expect the price of their products to increase this year at a faster-than-normal pace. However, there was a divergence in the inflation outlook based on technological adoption. The survey found that companies that implemented automation over the past 12 months expect slower price hikes than those that hadn’t. Graham, the Duke professor, said that AI could eventually help moderate price increases but isn’t optimistic it will be a major force to easing inflation right now. “It doesn’t feel like it will be the cure in the next year,” he said. ‘Significant risks’ The CFO survey shows how fast companies are turning to AI — even as safeguards and regulatory frameworks are still being cobbled together. The rapid adoption of AI in some industries like finance has concerned some. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in a speech earlier this month that the use of AI by financial companies poses both “tremendous opportunities and significant risks.” A report issued last week by Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, found that exiting regulation “insufficiently addresses” how hedge funds are already using AI. The report warned that there are “no regulations or requirements” mandating “when and whether a human must be involved in decision making, including related to trading decisions.” Graham, the Duke professor, said it would be wise for companies in all industries to have strong risk management systems and redundancies in place as they experiment with AI. “There has been rapid adoption of AI,” he said. “I hope it’s being done with a grain of salt. There will be some situations where companies have embarrassing products or supply chain situations because they moved a little too fast.”","[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1460688324.jpg?c=original', 'sourceOrganization': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Getty Images'}, 'width': '2000', 'height': '1333', 'creditText': 'Maria Korneeva/Moment RF/Getty Images', 'dateCreated': '2022-11-08T05:00:00.000Z'}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1460688324.jpg?c=original', 'caption': 'More than half of large firms surveyed say they plan to use AI in the next year to do the work previously done by humans.', 'sourceOrganization': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Getty Images'}, 'width': '2000', 'height': '1333', 'creditText': 'Maria Korneeva/Moment RF/Getty Images', 'dateCreated': '2022-11-08T05:00:00.000Z'}]","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Matt Egan', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/profiles/matt-egan'}]","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'CNN', 'logo': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61', 'foundingDate': '1980-06-01', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/cnn/', 'https://twitter.com/CNN', 'https://www.instagram.com/cnn/', 'https://www.youtube.com/cnn']}",False,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.article__content'}",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1460688324.jpg?c=original,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,903.0,P0Y0M0DT0H4M0S,,,,,,,,,,

As businesses increasingly adopt AI to improve efficiency, certain jobs are more vulnerable to automation. Here are five fields at risk from AI.Data Analysts and BookkeepersJobs that involve data analysis, bookkeeping, and basic financial reporting are highly susceptible to automation. These roles, which focus on repetitive administrative tasks, are prime candidates for AI-driven efficiency improvements.Read more: Best Accounting Software""When thinking about the implications for specific jobs, these tools are more likely to replace tasks than jobs, which may mean that you need fewer people to do the work or it could mean that more people are needed because the productivity is much higher with all the low value work is being done by machines,"" Carter Price, senior mathematician at the RAND Corporation think tank, told Newsweek.Customer Service RepresentativesThe customer service sector is already experiencing significant changes due to AI. Chatbots and AI-powered assistants are increasingly handling customer inquiries, reducing the need for human agents.According to a study by Gartner, by 2025, 80 percent of customer service and support organizations will be applying generative AI technology in some form.This trend is already visible, with companies like IBM and British telecommunications giant BT Group citing AI as a reason for job cuts&#8203;&#8203; and hiring slowdowns.""We have already seen the deployment of these technologies in customer service roles either as chatbots or as chatbots hooked up to text to voice systems,"" Price said.""An LLM can quickly search all the relevant manuals or other text documentation to find the relevant information.""However, this still is likely to need human supervision and complex cases will need to be handled by humans,"" he added.LLM stands for large language model&mdash;a type of AI algorithm capable of drawing on vast quantities of data to generate content.Media Content CreationAI's ability to read, write, and understand text-based data puts media jobs at risk, including roles in advertising, content creation, technical writing, and journalism.""LLMs, in their most basic form, have a tenuous relationship with the truth but are facile with written text,"" Price explained. ""The transformer, the core technology behind LLMs, was originally developed for machine translation back in 2017. However, transformers proved so effective with text generation that they are being used as generalized tools for examining and producing text, images, sounds, and other data forms.""The AI tools we interact with today have been augmented and are better with the truth but still make suggestions like eating rocks [...].""There is a lot of ongoing work to make these tools more reliable and we can expect significant improvements in the coming months and years,"" he added.Legal Assistants and ParalegalsThe legal industry is not immune to the impacts of AI. Roles such as paralegals and legal assistants, which involve consuming large amounts of information and synthesizing it into legal briefs or opinions, are particularly vulnerable.AI can replicate many of these tasks, although complete automation is unlikely due to the need for human judgment.""Many paralegal tasks require sifting through large data sets of text which is something that LLMs excel at. However, these jobs also require careful attention to language and accuracy [...]. Thus, it is very important for a human to oversee the work just as a senior attorney will review the work of a paralegal or associate,"" said Price.Financial AnalystsFinancial analysts and personal financial advisors are also at risk. These professionals handle significant amounts of numerical data, identifying trends and making investment recommendations.Read more: The Best Investing Apps for Any Type of InvestorAI can analyze data, highlight investment trends, and forecast better investment mixes more efficiently than humans.""For [...] financial analysts, a lot of data analysis the tasks can and have been automated even before LLMs by the people in these jobs themselves.

The report, a collaborative effort by various organisations and led by Microsoft Research and the University of Pretoria, highlights both the opportunities and challenges that AI presents for Africa's workforce and economy. A key focal point is the potential for AI to revolutionise various sectors, such as agriculture, healthcare, and finance. There is an emphasis on the importance of developing AI solutions that are specifically tailored to African context and takes the continent's unique linguistic and cultural diversity into account. This is expressed in a general conclusion that ""AI applications must be developed with African realities in mind”. The white paper also dives into the potential impact of AI on jobs and skills in Africa, with researchers pointing out that while AI could create new job opportunities, it may also disrupt existing ones. There emerged a need for a nuanced examination of this issue, considering factors like gender, education, and location. This goes in partnership with the need for upskilling and reskilling initiatives to prepare the African workforce for the subsequent shift in the job landscape. “We see a significant role for generative AI to not only transform work environments, but also foster opportunities for the youth to create jobs, innovate and help drive economic growth and stability across the continent,” says Ravi Bhat, chief technology and solutions officer at Microsoft Africa. High potential While technology companies like Microsoft’s partner OpenAI have stoked enthusiasm about the potential of AI, they have done little to are ease concerns about job losses and the need for affordable access to technology in developing economies. The report stresses the importance of involving workers in the development and implementation of AI solutions to ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed. According to the whitepaper, many expect generative AI to drastically change knowledge worker jobs, especially in terms of the type of work done, the skills required, and the outputs produced. McKinsey research shows that generative AI could enable labour productivity growth of up to 0.6% annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology adoption and the redeployment of worker time into other activities. To get ahead of this acceleration, the report proposes a series of recommendations for policymakers, businesses, and individuals to smooth the transition to an AI dominated workplace that includes investing in infrastructure and education, developing inclusive AI policies, focusing on human-centred design, and prioritising African-centric solutions. By taking a proactive and collaborative approach, Africa can harness the power of AI to drive economic growth, empower its workforce, and create a more equitable and prosperous future for all. The cost of AI In a follow-up discussion with Bizcoommunity the authors shed light on the challenges and opportunities associated with building African large language models (LLMs). Vukosi Marivate, Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria, acknowledged the high cost of compute as a significant barrier to entry. “On the question on the cost barrier to compute, it is a lot,” he said. Marivate has personal experience with this problem in his capacity as a team member at Lelapa AI. ""At Lelapa, we're looking at both sides – so, building models that are much easier to deploy that are smaller, but then also, at the same time, Lelapa is building African language LLMs as well."" However, he also highlighted the efforts of organisations like Microsoft to incentivise development in this area through partnerships, grants, and investments in sustainable data centres and lower-cost computing solutions. ""We are very conscious of the requirement for Africa-centric AI to be built here by Africans on the continent for African needs, and that requires compute,"" said Jacki O'Neill, Director at Microsoft Research Africa. The AI revolution in Africa is no longer just a possibility; it is already underway, and by its participation in this research, Microsoft, generative AI’s biggest investor, is signalling that it is open to working alongside individuals, governments, partners and stakeholders across the continent to prepare for a future where AI is intricately woven into the fabric of work and society in Africa. “Technology alone cannot solve the challenges that our youthful continent faces,” concludes Bhat. “We need to create policies and practices to ensure that GenAI, and AI in general, is deployed responsibly with AI-related labour being valued and dignified.

For those looking to enter what could be a highly lucrative career in AI, a new study by software development firm Vention shows which U.S. colleges are offering bachelor&apos;s degrees with the best chance of landing a job fresh out of school &#x2013; and the potential for the biggest paychecks.  Vention analyzed the latest graduation data from the U.S. Department of Education and found that of the 1,790 degrees nationwide related to computer science, 294 produced graduates who were employed both a year and four years after finishing school.&#xA0; AI JOBS WITH SALARIES WORTH $900K ARE HERE: REPORT The researchers discovered only 23 of those schools had median earnings data available for the fourth year after graduation, ranking them from highest to lowest to reveal the best-paying degrees for an AI career with 100% employability.   Cal Poly&apos;s San Luis Obispo campus took the top spot on the list, blasting all other schools out of the water with graduates&apos; median salary coming in at $181,838 four years after completing their studies.  Coming in second was Wake Forest University in North Carolina, where the median salary four years after graduating is $114,622.  AI JOBS WITH MIND-BLOWING PAYCHECKS OF $375K A YEAR  Trinity University in San Antonio landed in third place with a median salary of $108,840 with their computer science-related degrees after four years.  New York&apos;s Clarkson University offers the fourth-highest paying degrees for AI careers, with grads earning a median salary of $104,005.

Fresh research from LinkedIn also shows career challenges facing women in artificial intelligence, who remain the minority and hold fewer jobs higher up the ranks. The findings come after the World Economic Forum&apos;s Global Gender Gap Index revealed a slim 0.1 per cent improvement, predicting women would not achieve workforce parity for another 134 years. LinkedIn&apos;s research surveyed more than 31,000 people in 31 countries, studying the growing workplace use of AI and the representation of women. It found more than four in five knowledge workers in Australia were using AI tools, and the number of people listing AI skills on their LinkedIn profiles had soared since 2023. Positive and negative trends were identified for women in AI roles, with the number employed in AI engineering climbing 171 per cent since 2016. Similar roles for men rose more slowly at 126 per cent over the same period. Yet women made up only 27 per cent of workers creating AI technology, which represents a rise of 3.5 per cent since 2016. While the growth was positive, employers should carefully consider how they offered on-the-job AI training to provide greater gender balance, says LinkedIn Australia and New Zealand country manager Matt Tindale. &quot;We are reaching a pivotal moment as generative AI starts to impact the labour market with a recalibration of the skills employers value most,&quot; he said. &quot;Employers must ensure they apply a gender lens to their approach in up-skilling to establish the future workplace in a fair and equitable way.&quot; The LinkedIn research also found more women were being hired for leadership positions, from 34 per cent in 2016 to 41 per cent in 2024, and the rate was higher in Australia than the US, UK, and France. But representation of women fell as roles progressed from manager (39 per cent) to director (36 per cent) and vice-president (23 per cent). Systematic changes would be needed to address the workplace imbalance, the study found. Among them are skills-based approaches to hiring, inclusive hiring practices, mentorship schemes and equitable training in fields including artificial intelligence. The World Economic Forum report released earlier in June found the gender gap now stands at 68.6 per cent across 146 countries. Iceland led the index for gender balance followed by Finland, Norway, and New Zealand. Australia ranked 24th, with a gender gap of 78 per cent.

<p>Citigroup's AI Predictions for the Banking Sector</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Citigroup has issued a stark forecast regarding the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the banking industry. According to a new report released on Wednesday, AI is expected to displace a greater proportion of jobs in banking than in any other sector. The bank predicts that around 54% of jobs across the banking sector have a high potential to be automated. Additionally, about 12% of roles could be augmented with AI technology. This shift is anticipated as AI advances in consumer finance and increases worker productivity. Over the past year, major banks worldwide have started experimenting with AI, driven by its promise to enhance staff efficiency and reduce operational costs .</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JPMorgan Chase has followed Goldman Sachs in eliminating the cap on bonuses for its London staff, potentially allowing top bankers to earn bonuses up to ten times their base salary. This move comes after the UK government lifted local pay restrictions for bankers last year. Previously, the maximum bonus was capped at twice the base salary. This change signifies a substantial shift in compensation structure for high-performing bankers in London, aligning with the broader deregulation trends in the UK's financial sector .</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A new study by CDP reveals that companies are not producing adequate plans for combating climate change quickly enough. Among over 23,000 firms examined, only 2% have committed to a 1.5°C-aligned plan that meets all necessary criteria for effective emissions reduction. This percentage drops to less than 1% when considering all companies that report environmental data. Despite an increase in the number of companies reporting climate plans, the pace of credible climate-transition planning remains insufficient .</p>

That is the future of employment using AI and automation. While certain duties will be automated, new opportunities will arise. Consider artficial intelligence to be a super helper that assists physicians in illness diagnosis and attorneys in case research. The majority of employment will evolve rather than perish. To work with AI, we'll need to master new talents such as problem solving and creativity. The trick is to stay versatile and continue to learn; exciting times are coming in the workplace.
How AI And Automation Impact the Future of Work
The tides are shifting in the workplace, fueled by the tremendous waves of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation. While some see a gloomy future dominated by robots, the truth is considerably more intriguing. Yes, AI will automate several activities, particularly those that are repetitive and data-driven. Consider industrial assembly lines humming with robots or self-driving trucks speeding along roads; these are just a few examples.

This partnership will transform many existing jobs. Consider physicians employing artificial intelligence for faster and more accurate diagnoses, or attorneys using AI to analyse massive amounts of legal papers. AI will become a strong helper, allowing humans to concentrate on activities that demand our distinct strengths: creativity, critical thinking, and social intelligence.
Sectors That Will Be Impacted By Automation
Robots are already making an impact in manufacturing, logistics, and customer service. Advances in machine learning are allowing AI to automate jobs that were previously assumed to need human intellect, such as data analysis, content production, and financial trading.

Here's a breakdown of several areas that are severely affected by automation:
Manufacturing
Industrial robots are transforming production lines by completing jobs more precisely, quickly, and efficiently.
Logistics and Transportation
Self-driving trucks and delivery drones are set to revolutionise the transportation industry by optimising delivery routes and decreasing human error.
Client Service
Natural language processing (NLP)-powered chatbots are increasingly managing client requests, offering 24/7 help, and simplifying customer service processes.
Office Work
AI-powered solutions automate administrative duties like as data entry, scheduling, and document processing, freeing up human workers to focus on more strategic operations.
The Evolution of Existing Jobs: Humans and Machines, Side-by-Side
While certain jobs may disappear totally as a result of automation, the majority will likely evolve into hybrid roles that combine human and machine talents. Here's how artificial intelligence will probably change current jobs:
Augmented Professionals
Artificial intelligence may be a great tool for professionals from many industries. AI may help doctors with diagnosis and treatment planning, attorneys with legal research and document analysis, and marketers with audience segmentation and targeted advertising.
Shifting Skill Sets
The future of employment will require a different set of abilities. While technical skills such as data analysis and coding will become more valued, soft skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, and communication will remain essential.
Adaptability and continual Learning
The ability to adjust and a commitment to continual learning will be critical to future employment success. To remain competitive, workers must be comfortable acquiring new skills and adapting to change.
The Rise of New Jobs With AI: A Brave New World of Work
AI changes current sectors, new possibilities arise. These new employment will most likely include the creation, deployment, and administration of AI systems. Here's a look at some of the occupations that AI may create:
AI Developers and Engineers
The future will require a skilled workforce to design, develop, and maintain AI systems. Roles like robotics engineers, machine learning specialists, and data scientists will be in high demand.
Ethicists and Policymakers
As AI becomes more ubiquitous, ethical considerations will rise in prominence. Jobs in artificial intelligence ethics, responsible development, and policy formulation will be crucial.
Artificial Intelligence Trainers and Explainers
Machines learn on data, therefore guaranteeing data quality and creating trust in systems is critical. Job opportunities will include data curation, AI training, and explaining AI judgements to humans.
Human-Machine cooperation Specialists
As people and machines coexist, experts will be required to create effective processes, optimise communication, and enable seamless cooperation between human and machine intelligence.

Beyond these specific roles, entirely new industries might emerge based on breakthroughs in AI, further diversifying the job market.","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/11AI-Prediction-illo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'width': 1600, 'height': 900}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Nayab Khan', 'url': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/author/nayab/'}","{'@id': '#Publisher', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'PhoneWorld', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Retina.png'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/phoneworldmag', 'https://twitter.com/PhoneWorldpk', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/phoneworld-magazine/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYmUMGu44oZJnXUYB8HZiTw', 'https://www.instagram.com/phoneworldpk/']}",,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'Article', '@id': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/ai-and-automation-reshaping-the-future-of-jobs/#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/ai-and-automation-reshaping-the-future-of-jobs/'}, 'author': {'name': 'Nayab Khan', '@id': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/#/schema/person/7da1714656fda32c9b116ef3b0c8e28e'}, 'headline': 'AI and Automation: Reshaping the Future of Jobs', 'datePublished': '2024-06-19T11:16:24+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-06-19T13:53:04+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/ai-and-automation-reshaping-the-future-of-jobs/'}, 'wordCount': 716, 'commentCount': 0, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/#organization'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/ai-and-automation-reshaping-the-future-of-jobs/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/11AI-Prediction-illo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'keywords': ['AI and jobs', 'AI jobs', 'Automation trends'], 'articleSection': ['Featured', 'News'], 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'CommentAction', 'name': 'Comment', 'target': ['https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/ai-and-automation-reshaping-the-future-of-jobs/#respond']}]}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/ai-and-automation-reshaping-the-future-of-jobs/', 'url': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/ai-and-automation-reshaping-the-future-of-jobs/', 'name': 'AI and Automation: Reshaping the Future of Jobs - PhoneWorld', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/ai-and-automation-reshaping-the-future-of-jobs/#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/ai-and-automation-reshaping-the-future-of-jobs/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/11AI-Prediction-illo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'datePublished': '2024-06-19T11:16:24+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-06-19T13:53:04+00:00', 'description': 'AI and automation are transforming the future of work.
