Although the demand still exists, it has become more complex and specialised. Thomas Frey, who advises companies on future trends, says every job will be a technology job going forward. “Emerging technology will provide a lot more opportunities, where every job will have a technology element to it. It will not be about humans versus artificial intelligence, but about working with them.People, however, need to be taught how to do this and enhance their skills,” the famed futurist and celebrity speaker said.The Indian IT industry is at the crossroads. It needs to take strategic decisions to remain relevant in the future.Individuals will need to upskill to ensure career longevity even as automation takes over certain jobs.Careers in vogue right now may not even exist a decade later.Blockchain, cryptocurrency, robotics and autonomous vehicles —all emerging technologies — will become mainstream over the next decade, requiring thousands of specialists.Anil Talreja, partner, Deloitte India, says that people who can design and engineer apps and new use cases for technology will always remain in high demand. We will also have access to vast amounts of data going forward.“There will be huge demand for people who can analyse and structure this data such that it can be useful. While management consultants may not be needed, we will need data analysts, designers and engineers who can create algorithms to retrieve and structure this data,” he said.So, what will the technology jobs of the future look like?ET asked a few thought leaders and compiled a list of the most likely roles.Data DriversSolutions based on Artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things will become commonplace. This, in turn, will require an army of people to manage the data they generate.“As we leverage the human machine interface and as AI implementation increases, we will need a lot more people to work on data tagging and cleaning and labelling, creating millions of new jobs,” said Debjani Ghosh, president of IT industry lobby Nasscom. “We will need people to work with machines to do it and if India can build skills, then we can do it. This would solve an existing problem, plus create jobs.”Designing systems that can analyse and parse this data, while meeting ever evolving privacy norms across borders will be another requirement that will emerge across industry verticals.By 2030, 500 billion devices are expected to be connected to the internet. The data from many of these sensors are of importance to businesses, which require data scientists to analyse and help take business decisions. It also would throw up an opportunity for people who design these sensors, apart from implementing them across newer industries and finding new use cases.Cybersecurity ExpertsIn the future, the world will be even more connected than it is today. Personal devices, machines, appliances, automobiles, everything will be connected to the internet, and emerge as a a potential target for cyber criminals. This will need far more people than today to anticipate the potential threats and create solutions for them. The electricity grid, the water supply system and the traffic lights will all be connected and any disruption could potentially create chaos in cities. India will require thousands of security experts who design systems that can constantly monitor threats, but also prevent attacks. Already, we see cyber criminals becoming more sophisticated in terms of the attack methodologies. These are still restricted primarily to computers but it is only a matter of time before all connected devices are under threat.In addition to cyber security firms, these professionals would also be employed by device manufacturers and designers, to build in security features at the core of the deviceEvery Job will be a Tech JobLawyers and doctors will exist in the future, too, but those jobs will morph into tech jobs. “Roles like HR which are currently non-tech will become tech jobs. These will require a tech bent of mind,” said Shekhar Sanyal, country head, The Institution of Engineering and Technology, India. Robotic process automation and bots will thrive in the workplace and HR professionals will need to understand technology and business to understand their implications. Within consumer products, too, things will change.The world buys close to 1.5 billion pairs of shoes a year. In the future, we will be able to slice and dice this depending on usage, and embed the required technology to enhance its functionality, such as a smart golfing shoe or to manage an injury. Gig workers will be the norm, experts say, moving across domains on the basis of their expertise in a specific technology area. What this will require is a change in how certain skills are taught in universities, with some basic tech skills being taught as part of the core curriculum, irrespective of the stream.Traffic Monitoring JobsDrones for delivery and driverless cars will spur mini-industries of their own. Control rooms of the future will require traffic management skills that include operating drones, managing autonomous cars, besides regular vehicles. Beyond command centre operators, designers, programmers and cybersecurity experts will be needed to ensure smooth functioning.Personal robots will also start replacing human assistants, in healthcare assistance or in customer service roles. This will require a dedicated ecosystem to build these robots and apps and maintain them, while keeping privacy and customer care at the core.From UI/UX skills to creating specialised program architecture, maintaining and keeping these robots secure will require a dedicated fleet of developers.Healthcare WorkersIt is estimated that there will be 300 million more people over the age of 65 in 2030, compared to the number in 2014. Spends on healthcare will increase, but healthcare as we know it today would have changed.Debjani Ghosh said health workers enabled by machines providing care would become more prevalent.“If this is done in a structured way, then millions of jobs could be created. There is strong government support for skilling initiatives,” she said. When AI and robotics move to implementation stage, it will create opportunities across industries. The way doctors and nurses do their jobs will be greatly impacted by how technology evolves. Personal care robots will be ubiquitous, need ing a dedicated set of tech workers to run and maintain them. These would function in collaboration with healthcare professionals. Digitisation of personal health and preventive healthcare will turn into a separate industry, driven almost entirely by data and tech professionals, and not healthcare workers.Space Tech JobsIndia’s space programme looks at tapping the private sector to build satellites and rockets to launch them from its spaceports. As Isro focuses on outer space missions to the Moon, Mars, Venus and the Sun and plans its first human space flight in the next two years, it will increasingly depend on the private sector to build and launch communication and remote sensing satellites. It also is looking to make India a hub to build small satellites and launch them from Indian soil, an industry, which officials say, has potential to replicate the country’s software industry. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has made people rethink space travel and exploration, according to Thomas Frey. Space tourism will create a mini industry of tech experts. Mission planning, launch management and experience design will have to be looked at through a tech lens, creating thousands of jobs requiring specialised skills.","{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'https://schema.org/False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Economic Times', 'productID': 'prime.economictimes.indiatimes.com:prime'}","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",,,,,,,,,

As they gaze at each other, there’s that inevitable moment when they understand each character as equal and yet diabolically separate forms of intelligence (remember Sigourney Weaver and her drooling counterpart in Ridley Scott’s Alien?).

The image came to my mind as I read economist Daniel Susskind’s new book, A World Without Work: Technology, Automation and How We Should Respond, which argues that we are headed very quickly (within decades) to a time in which most human work will be displaced by machines.

In chapter four, “Understanding Machines”, Susskind retells the now fairly well-known story of AlphaGo, the computer program developed by Google’s AI subsidiary DeepMind, which beat the world champion in the ancient Chinese game of Go. It won not by playing better than the human, but by playing in a way that was inhuman.

“Almost as remarkable as its overall victory was a particular move that AlphaGo made — the 37th move in the second game — and the reaction of those watching,” writes Susskind. “Thousands of years of human play had forged a rule of thumb known even to beginners: early in the game, avoid placing stones on the fifth line from the edge. And yet, this is exactly what AlphaGo did in that move.” One expert watching called the move “beautiful”. Another said it made him feel “physically unwell”.

Those reactions encapsulate the common and diametrically opposed views of a world in which machines will do most of what human workers do today. Netscape founder and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has famously quipped that “software is eating the world” and that in the end, there will be only two types of people left: those who program the machines, and everyone else.

Susskind goes further, arguing that we are on the verge of a new era in which the machines could come up with entirely new ideas about how to program themselves.

Susskind’s core thesis — that we are heading towards a world in which human work will become obsolete — is built on his supposition that most of the conventional notions about AI learning have been wrong.

“Economists had thought that to accomplish a task, a computer had to follow explicit rules articulated by a human being — that machine capabilities had to begin with two-down application of human intelligence.”

But Susskind believes that wisdom was false, and has led us to vastly underestimate the depth and breadth of the labour-disrupting effects of AI. According to him, many machines are “now deriving entirely new rules, unrelated to those that human beings follow. This is not a semantic quibble, but a serious shift. Machines are no longer riding on the coattails of human intelligence.”

This is, of course, the starting point of many other science fiction tales, such as Terminator. But in reality, it requires a big leap of faith. Not all technologists or economists agree that AI will be nearly as disruptive to human labour as Susskind posits (veteran venture capitalist and Cambridge university fellow Bill Janeway recently told me he thought that a large chunk of what companies call “AI” is marketing spin).

Still, there are plenty of people in the post-work world camp, including many of those at the top of the tech food chain. The parts of Susskind’s book that are most interesting and useful are those that grapple with how society should respond to that world.

Susskind makes a good case that technology is going to put Thomas Piketty’s views on steroids. Not only will the returns to capital continue to rise relative to labour, but the amount of labour itself will decrease, and eventually, disappear. Inequality, unhappiness and social unrest are the inevitable result.

We can’t educate ourselves out of the problem, at least not as we currently envision it. Neither bolstering STEM skills nor pushing liberal arts really addresses the bigger issue, which is that we need an education system that isn’t geared up to teach people how to enter the world of work, but rather how to make leisure productive. It’s a paradigm shift but, as he points out, the human race has been here before; in ancient Sparta, education was about training for war, not work. The solution most often offered by Silicon Valley — universal basic income — has possibilities, but only if tied to outcomes. As any number of interesting historical scenarios Susskind cites (1930s factory workers on benefits, Native Americans who receive government funding) prove, just giving people money doesn’t work — you have to give them meaning, too.

In Susskind’s view that will require both curbing Big Tech and, more importantly, empowering a Big State. Such a state would have to grapple with not only the challenges of redistributing a pie that, just as Keynes foretold, is big enough yet not well distributed, but also how to create meaning and assign value to citizens’ contributions in a post-work world. He summarises and expands on many of the good ideas circulating about how to do that, from creating digital sovereign wealth funds to attributing economic value to work that is currently unpaid.

There is one gaping hole in the book: China. Only three paragraphs explicitly address the fact that the Middle Kingdom is ground zero for all the changes Susskind explores — from robots replacing cheap and even higher-end labour, to the promise and perils of AI, to the ability of the state to buffer them. If there’s one place where science fiction is already reality, it is the Middle Kingdom. And the Big State is here already — it’s just headquartered in Beijing.

Companies are willing to pay nearly ₹20 lacs per annum for employees with three years of experience.According to Randstad Insights Salary Trends Report 2019, the IT industry is the highest paymaster. Their salaries ranges from ₹4 lacs to ₹35 lacs per annum. Data science jobs have witnessed nearly 37% growth over the last three years, as per LinkedIn.The demand for digital literacy is at an all time high. It is hence no surprise that there is cutthroat competition to hire technology professionals with skills in — AI, data science and machine learning. This has also led to a significant rise in their remunerations. AI and data science are the most dynamic fields of all — which explains the exceptional rise in demand for digitally-equipped professionals. “You don’t have to wait for 10 years to be at a level in the field of data science. For those having upto three years of experience, companies are willing to pay nearly ₹20 lacs per annum on an average,” Ashish Malhotra, director at bitgrit Japan — a global data science community, told Business Insider. And it can go as high as $15,000 (over ₹1 million) per annum for experienced data scientists in the global markets like the US, he added.According to Randstad Insights Salary Trends Report 2019, the IT industry is already the best paying sector. Their employee salaries range from ₹4 lacs to ₹35 lacs per annum. “The renewed demand for professionals with digital skills — cloud, product management, analytics, AI and automation — could be the major factors for the sector’s strong showing this year,” said the report. Data science expertsThe experts in the field, called data scientists adopt techniques and tools to draw insights and derive solutions for real-time problems. This includes data mining, statistical modeling, pattern recognition and data visualization.Mathematics and analytical bent of mind are core to a data science career. As per LinkedIn, India ranks among the top three countries poised to lead the world in AI skills with robotic process automation, compliance, and integration as the fastest growing skills. Data science jobs have witnessed nearly 37% growth over the last three years. The sectors which are wooing away the most data scientists are the usual suspects - healthcare, banking and financial services, insurance, retail and telecom.“Talent with the ‘right-fit’ skills commands a significant premium over their peers and companies are not constrained by bell curves and averages when it comes to the salary structure for professionals with in-demand skills,” said Paul Dupis, MD &amp; CEO, Randstad India.Future of data scienceBig data is unstructured, but holds immense potential to improve performance and efficiency of the systems. In India, the data science market is pegged at $11 billion — which is anticipated to hit $326 billion by 2025.The more India automates, more will it need experts who can facilitate it. As per LinkedIn, India is estimated to have less than 10% of data scientists available globally — which explains the rise in demand.

Such concerns have been aired many times over the centuries and they have always been wrong. But they are not intrinsically absurd. In 1979, the economist Wassily Leontief pointed to the fate of the horse. Horses had long been of vital economic importance, but faded in the second half of the 20th century as the internal combustion engine became the dominant source of horsepower.

Horses still have a niche, but will never outcompete engines, no matter how cheap oats become. Might large numbers of human workers go the way of the horse? In 2003, the economists David Autor, Frank Levy and Richard Murnane published a study of the economics of technological change that made two influential observations.

First, they pointed out (correctly) that it is misleading to talk of robots — or any other technology — taking jobs. Instead, machines perform tasks, a narrower unit of work. Since most jobs involve many different tasks, robots do not take jobs, but they may radically reshape them. A robot accountant is not C-3PO; it’s Excel or QuickBooks. As with the horse, there is no wage at which human calculators can compete with a computer at the task of adding up a spreadsheet. Still, human accountants exist in large numbers. Their jobs simply look very different today.

Second, argued Profs Autor, Levy and Murnane, the tasks that machines took on were best described not as “skilled” or “unskilled” but as “routine” or “non-routine”. Recalculating a spreadsheet is a skilled but routine task, easily automated. Cleaning a toilet requires little skill — even I can do it — but is non-routine and therefore hard to automate.

This way of looking at the world proved very useful. It explained why technology could disrupt our jobs without destroying them. And why both the low-paid and high-paid ends of the labour market were proving robust, while the middle, packed with skilled-yet-routine tasks, was hollowed out.

But in a new book, A World Without Work, Daniel Susskind argues that the second part of the Autor-Levy-Murnane perspective is proving more questionable. He observes that the boundaries of the “routine” are blurring fast.

Consider, for example, CloudCV, a system that answers open-ended questions about images. Upload an image and ask any question you like. One photograph showed some 20-somethings sitting on a sofa with white wine and cans of Kronenbourg lager in front of them, with one fellow standing in a dramatic pose.

“What are they doing?” I asked the computer. “Playing Wii,” it replied, correctly. “What are they drinking?” Probably beer, it said. “How’s the weather?” I asked of an outdoor snapshot. “Cloudy.” It was. The system gives accurate answers to informally phrased questions about random photographs. Is that task routine? Hardly.

Neither is the performance of Alpha Zero, the game-playing algorithm developed by DeepMind, a sister company of Google. In 2017, AlphaZero trained itself in a few hours to thrash the best chess-playing engine and the best Go program, both of which easily beat the best humans. Some claim this performance is less impressive than it first appears — but 10 years ago the mere idea that a computer could beat a human at Go seemed implausible. What DeepMind’s supercomputers can do today will be achievable on laptops and phones by 2030.

In task after task, the computers are overtaking us. In the Visual Question Answering challenge that CloudCV attempts, humans score 81 per cent. The machines were at 55 per cent as recently as 2016; by the summer of 2019 they were at 75 per cent. It’s only a matter of time before they do a better job than us — just as AlphaZero does.

The Artificial Intelligence Index project, based at Stanford University, tracks a wide variety of benchmarks. The machines are making rapid progress at symbolic achievements — such as playing poker — but also at translation, speech recognition, and classifying diseases such as skin cancer (from images of moles) and diabetes (from images of retinas).

These achievements are real. And despite the fact that there are many things computers cannot do, when an algorithm does a narrow task cheaply and well, we humans end up contorting ourselves to unleash the new capability while sweeping up the tasks the software leaves behind. Just look at the self-checkout at your local supermarket.

So — will the machines take all the jobs in the coming decade? No, and that remains an unhelpful way to phrase the question. Machines encroach on tasks, and we reorganise our jobs in response, becoming more productive as a result.

But there is good reason to believe that such reorganisations will be wrenching in the decade to come, and also that some people will be permanently unable to contribute economically in the way they would have hoped and expected.

Above all, it is likely that our political institutions will be unable to adapt to the challenge.

Automation is constantly being heralded as the reason for job losses in various industries &#8211; but one expert believes there is a silver lining.
Rich Walker, the company director of robotics firm Shadow Robot Company, has gone on the record to say the introduction of artificial intelligence into the workplace will free up workers to take on &#8216;more interesting&#8217; jobs.
Speaking to Express.co.uk, Mr Walker explained that current working practices are not as efficient as they could be. In some areas &#8211; specifically manufacturing &#8211; adding in smart robots would allow humans to take on more complex tasks.
&#8216;Most people in manufacturing industries spend most of their time picking things up and putting them down again,&#8217; he told the site.
&#8216;They do this over and over again all day every day. Even in an automated production line, there will be lots of people giving it parts.&#8217;

&#8216;This isn’t a very efficient way for people to work,&#8217; he said.
&#8216;Most of the companies we talk to that do that say we have lots of people, all those people know how we work as an organisation and we have much better jobs for them to do.
&#8216;But we can’t get them to do those better jobs because we actually have to have people standing here all day picking things up and giving them to machines or picking them up and putting them down.
&#8216;So if we can just make that next bit something that machines can do then that frees up people to do far more interesting jobs.&#8217;
However, other thinkers don&#8217;t necessarily share the same viewpoint.
A recent report from the Institute for Public Policy Research reckons that without policy intervention, automation is likely to exacerbate existing inequality rather than improve it.
And the GMB union said &#8216;old&#8217; jobs are being subsumed to automation faster than new jobs and are being created after reporting 600,000 job losses in manufacturing in the last decade.

But last year the World Economic Forum (WEF) seemed to agree with Walker&#8217;s viewpoint.
‘Despite bringing widespread disruption, the advent of machine, robots and algorithm could actually have a positive impact on human employment,&#8217; it stated.
However, if automation is going to free up workers from menial tasks then there will be a challenge for employers to reskill and redeploy their workers elsewhere.",,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['/html/head/title', ""/html/head/meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",,,"['https://www.facebook.com/metrouk', 'https://www.twitter.com/metrouk', 'https://uk.pinterest.com/metrouk', 'https://www.instagram.com/metro.co.uk']",,,,,"[{'@type': 'Thing', 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence', 'sameAs': 'https://metro.co.uk/tag/artificial-intelligence/'}, {'@type': 'Thing', 'name': 'Robots', 'sameAs': 'https://metro.co.uk/tag/robots/'}]",
