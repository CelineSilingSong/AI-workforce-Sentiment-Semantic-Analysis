AbstractThe emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and its progressively wider impact on many sectors requires an assessment of its effect on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Using a consensus-based expert elicitation process, we find that AI can enable the accomplishment of 134 targets across all the goals, but it may also inhibit 59 targets. However, current research foci overlook important aspects. The fast development of AI needs to be supported by the necessary regulatory insight and oversight for AI-based technologies to enable sustainable development. Failure to do so could result in gaps in transparency, safety, and ethical standards.

IntroductionThe emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) is shaping an increasing range of sectors. For instance, AI is expected to affect global productivity1, equality and inclusion2, environmental outcomes3, and several other areas, both in the short and long term4. Reported potential impacts of AI indicate both positive5 and negative6 impacts on sustainable development. However, to date, there is no published study systematically assessing the extent to which AI might impact all aspects of sustainable development—defined in this study as the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets internationally agreed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development7. This is a critical research gap, as we find that AI may influence the ability to meet all SDGs.Here we present and discuss implications of how AI can either enable or inhibit the delivery of all 17 goals and 169 targets recognized in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Relationships were characterized by the methods reported at the end of this study, which can be summarized as a consensus-based expert elicitation process, informed by previous studies aimed at mapping SDGs interlinkages8,9,10. A summary of the results is given in Fig. 1 and the Supplementary Data 1 provides a complete list of all the SDGs and targets, together with the detailed results from this work. Although there is no internationally agreed definition of AI, for this study we considered as AI any software technology with at least one of the following capabilities: perception—including audio, visual, textual, and tactile (e.g., face recognition), decision-making (e.g., medical diagnosis systems), prediction (e.g., weather forecast), automatic knowledge extraction and pattern recognition from data (e.g., discovery of fake news circles in social media), interactive communication (e.g., social robots or chat bots), and logical reasoning (e.g., theory development from premises). This view encompasses a large variety of subfields, including machine learning.Fig. 1: Summary of positive and negative impact of AI on the various SDGs.Documented evidence of the potential of AI acting as (a) an enabler or (b) an inhibitor on each of the SDGs. The numbers inside the colored squares represent each of the SDGs (see the Supplementary Data 1). The percentages on the top indicate the proportion of all targets potentially affected by AI and the ones in the inner circle of the figure correspond to proportions within each SDG. The results corresponding to the three main groups, namely Society, Economy, and Environment, are also shown in the outer circle of the figure. The results obtained when the type of evidence is taken into account are shown by the inner shaded area and the values in brackets.Full size imageDocumented connections between AI and the SDGsOur review of relevant evidence shows that AI may act as an enabler on 134 targets (79%) across all SDGs, generally through a technological improvement, which may allow to overcome certain present limitations. However, 59 targets (35%, also across all SDGs) may experience a negative impact from the development of AI. For the purpose of this study, we divide the SDGs into three categories, according to the three pillars of sustainable development, namely Society, Economy, and Environment11,12 (see the Methods section). This classification allows us to provide an overview of the general areas of influence of AI. In Fig. 1, we also provide the results obtained when weighting how appropriate is the evidence presented in each reference to assess an interlinkage to the percentage of targets assessed, as discussed in the Methods section and below. A detailed assessment of the Society, Economy, and Environment groups, together with illustrative examples, are discussed next.AI and societal outcomesSixty-seven targets (82%) within the Society group could potentially benefit from AI-based technologies (Fig. 2). For instance, in SDG 1 on no poverty, SDG 4 on quality education, SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation, SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy, and SDG 11 on sustainable cities, AI may act as an enabler for all the targets by supporting the provision of food, health, water, and energy services to the population. It can also underpin low-carbon systems, for instance, by supporting the creation of circular economies and smart cities that efficiently use their resources13,14. For example, AI can enable smart and low-carbon cities encompassing a range of interconnected technologies such as electrical autonomous vehicles and smart appliances that can enable demand response in the electricity sector13,14 (with benefits across SDGs 7, 11, and 13 on climate action). AI can also help to integrate variable renewables by enabling smart grids that partially match electrical demand to times when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing13. Fewer targets in the Society group can be impacted negatively by AI (31 targets, 38%) than the ones with positive impact. However, their consideration is crucial. Many of these relate to how the technological improvements enabled by AI may be implemented in countries with different cultural values and wealth. Advanced AI technology, research, and product design may require massive computational resources only available through large computing centers. These facilities have a very high energy requirement and carbon footprint15. For instance, cryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin are globally using as much electricity as some nations’ electrical demand16, compromising outcomes in the SDG 7 sphere, but also on SDG 13 on Climate Action. Some estimates suggest that the total electricity demand of information and communications technologies (ICTs) could require up to 20% of the global electricity demand by 2030, from around 1% today15. Green growth of ICT technology is therefore essential17. More efficient cooling systems for data centers, broader energy efficiency, and renewable-energy usage in ICTs will all play a role in containing the electricity demand growth15. In addition to more efficient and renewable-energy-based data centers, it is essential to embed human knowledge in the development of AI models. Besides the fact that the human brain consumes much less energy than what is used to train AI models, the available knowledge introduced in the model (see, for instance, physics-informed deep learning18) does not need to be learnt through data-intensive training, a fact that may significantly reduce the associated energy consumption. Although AI-enabled technology can act as a catalyst to achieve the 2030 Agenda, it may also trigger inequalities that may act as inhibitors on SDGs 1, 4, and 5. This duality is reflected in target 1.1, as AI can help to identify areas of poverty and foster international action using satellite images5. On the other hand, it may also lead to additional qualification requirements for any job, consequently increasing the inherent inequalities19 and acting as an inhibitor towards the achievement of this target.Fig. 2: Detailed assessment of the impact of AI on the SDGs within the Society group.Documented evidence of positive or negative impact of AI on the achievement of each of the targets from SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 16 (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/). Each block in the diagram represents a target (see the Supplementary Data 1 for additional details on the targets). For targets highlighted in green or orange, we found published evidence that AI could potentially enable or inhibit such target, respectively. The absence of highlighting indicates the absence of identified evidence. It is noteworthy that this does not necessarily imply the absence of a relationship. (The content of of this figure has not been reviewed by the United Nations and does not reflect its views).Full size imageAnother important drawback of AI-based developments is that they are traditionally based on the needs and values of nations in which AI is being developed. If AI technology and big data are used in regions where ethical scrutiny, transparency, and democratic control are lacking, AI might enable nationalism, hate towards minorities, and bias election outcomes20. The term “big nudging” has emerged to represent using big data and AI to exploit psychological weaknesses to steer decisions—creating problems such as damaging social cohesion, democratic principles, and even human rights21. AI has been recently utilized to develop citizen scores, which are used to control social behavior22. This type of score is a clear example of threat to human rights due to AI misuse and one of its biggest problems is the lack of information received by the citizens on the type of analyzed data and the consequences this may have on their lives. It is also important to note that AI technology is unevenly distributed: for instance, complex AI-enhanced agricultural equipment may not be accessible to small farmers and thus produce an increased gap with respect to larger producers in more developed economies23, consequently inhibiting the achievement of some targets of SDG 2 on zero hunger. There is another important shortcoming of AI in the context of SDG 5 on gender equality: there is insufficient research assessing the potential impact of technologies such as smart algorithms, image recognition, or reinforced learning on discrimination against women and minorities. For instance, machine-learning algorithms uncritically trained on regular news articles will inadvertently learn and reproduce the societal biases against women and girls, which are embedded in current languages. Word embeddings, a popular technique in natural language processing, have been found to exacerbate existing gender stereotypes2. In addition to the lack of diversity in datasets, another main issue is the lack of gender, racial, and ethnic diversity in the AI workforce24. Diversity is one of the main principles supporting innovation and societal resilience, which will become essential in a society exposed to changes associated to AI development25. Societal resilience is also promoted by decentralization, i.e., by the implementation of AI technologies adapted to the cultural background and the particular needs of different regions.AI and economic outcomesThe technological advantages provided by AI may also have a positive impact on the achievement of a number of SDGs within the Economy group. We have identified benefits from AI on 42 targets (70%) from these SDGs, whereas negative impacts are reported in 20 targets (33%), as shown in Fig. 1. Although Acemoglu and Restrepo1 report a net positive impact of AI-enabled technologies associated to increased productivity, the literature also reflects potential negative impacts mainly related to increased inequalities26,27,28,29. In the context of the Economy group of SDGs, if future markets rely heavily on data analysis and these resources are not equally available in low- and middle- income countries, the economical gap may be significantly increased due to the newly introduced inequalities30,31 significantly impacting SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), and 10 (reduced inequalities). Brynjolfsson and McAfee31 argue that AI can exacerbate inequality also within nations. By replacing old jobs with ones requiring more skills, technology disproportionately rewards the educated: since the mid 1970s, the salaries in the United States (US) salaries rose about 25% for those with graduate degrees, while the average high-school dropout took a 30% pay cut. Moreover, automation shifts corporate income to those who own companies from those who work there. Such transfer of revenue from workers to investors helps explain why, even though the combined revenues of Detroit's “Big 3” (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) in 1990 were almost identical to those of Silicon Valley's “Big 3” (Google, Apple, and Facebook) in 2014, the latter had 9 times fewer employees and were worth 30 times more on the stock market32. Figure 3 shows an assessment of the documented positive and negative effects on the various targets within the SDGs in the Economy group.Fig. 3: Detailed assessment of the impact of AI on the SDGs within the Economy group.Documented evidence of positive or negative impact of AI on the achievement of each of the targets from SDGs 8, 9, 10, 12, and 17 (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/). The interpretation of the blocks and colors is as in Fig. 2.  (The content of of this figure has not been reviewed by the United Nations and does not reflect its views).Full size imageAlthough the identified linkages in the Economy group are mainly positive, trade-offs cannot be neglected. For instance, AI can have a negative effect on social media usage, by showing users content specifically suited to their preconceived ideas. This may lead to political polarization33 and affect social cohesion21 with consequences in the context of SDG 10 on reduced inequalities. On the other hand, AI can help identify sources of inequality and conflict34,35, and therewith potentially reduce inequalities, for instance, by using simulations to assess how virtual societies may respond to changes. However, there is an underlying risk when using AI to evaluate and predict human behavior, which is the inherent bias in the data. It has been reported that a number of discriminatory challenges are faced in the automated targeting of online job advertising using AI35, essentially related to the previous biases in selection processes conducted by human recruiters. The work by Dalenberg35 highlights the need of modifying the data preparation process and explicitly adapting the AI-based algorithms used for selection processes to avoid such biases.AI and environmental outcomesThe last group of SDGs, i.e., the one related to Environment, is analyzed in Fig. 4. The three SDGs in this group are related to climate action, life below water and life on land (SDGs 13, 14, and 15). For the Environment group, we identified 25 targets (93%) for which AI could act as an enabler. Benefits from AI could be derived by the possibility of analyzing large-scale interconnected databases to develop joint actions aimed at preserving the environment. Looking at SDG 13 on climate action, there is evidence that AI advances will support the understanding of climate change and the modeling of its possible impacts. Furthermore, AI will support low-carbon energy systems with high integration of renewable energy and energy efficiency, which are all needed to address climate change13,36,37. AI can also be used to help improve the health of ecosystems. The achievement of target 14.1, calling to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, can benefit from AI through algorithms for automatic identification of possible oil spills38. Another example is target 15.3, which calls for combating desertification and restoring degraded land and soil. According to Mohamadi et al.39, neural networks and objective-oriented techniques can be used to improve the classification of vegetation cover types based on satellite images, with the possibility of processing large amounts of images in a relatively short time. These AI techniques can help to identify desertification trends over large areas, information that is relevant for environmental planning, decision-making, and management to avoid further desertification, or help reverse trends by identifying the major drivers. However, as pointed out above, efforts to achieve SDG 13 on climate action could be undermined by the high-energy needs for AI applications, especially if non carbon-neutral energy sources are used. Furthermore, despite the many examples of how AI is increasingly applied to improve biodiversity monitoring and conservation40, it can be conjectured that an increased access to AI-related information of ecosystems may drive over-exploitation of resources, although such misuse has so far not been sufficiently documented. This aspect is further discussed below, where currently identified gaps in AI research are considered.Fig. 4: Detailed assessment of the impact of AI on the SDGs within the Environment group.Documented evidence of positive or negative impact of AI on the achievement of each of the targets from SDGs 13, 14, and 15 (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/). The interpretation of the blocks and colors is as in Fig. 2. (The content of of this figure has not been reviewed by the United Nations and does not reflect its views).Full size imageAn assessment of the collected evidence on the interlinkagesA deeper analysis of the gathered evidence was undertaken as shown in Fig. 1 (and explained in the Methods section). In practice, each interlinkage was weighted based on the applicability and appropriateness of each of the references to assess a specific interlinkage—and possibly identify research gaps. Although accounting for the type of evidence has a relatively small effect on the positive impacts (we see a reduction of positively affected targets from 79% to 71%), we observe a more significant reduction (from 35% to 23%) in the targets with negative impact of AI. This can be partly due the fact that AI research typically involves quantitative methods that would bias the results towards the positive effects. However, there are some differences across the Society, Economy and Environment spheres. In the Society sphere, when weighting the appropriateness of evidence, positively affected targets diminish by 5 percentage points (p.p.) and negatively affected targets by 13 p.p. In particular, weighting the appropriateness of evidence on negative impacts on SDG 1 (on no poverty) and SDG 6 (on clean water and sanitation) reduces the fraction of affected targets by 43 p.p. and 35 p.p., respectively. In the Economy group instead, positive impacts are reduced more (15 p.p.) than negative ones (10 p.p.) when taking into account the appropriateness of the found evidence to speak of the issues. This can be related to the extensive study in literature assessing the displacement of jobs due to AI (because of clear policy and societal concerns), but overall the longer-term benefits of AI on the economy are perhaps not so extensively characterized by currently available methods. Finally, although the weighting of evidence decreases the positive impacts of AI on the Environment group only by 8 p.p., the negative impacts see the largest average reduction (18 p.p.). This is explained by the fact that, although there are some indications of the potential negative impact of AI on this SDG, there is no strong evidence (in any of the targets) supporting this claim, and therefore this is a relevant area for future research.In general, the fact that the evidence on interlinkages between AI and the large majority of targets is not based on tailored analyses and tools to refer to that particular issue provides a strong rationale to address a number of research gaps, which are identified and listed in the section below.Research gaps on the role of AI in sustainable developmentThe more we enable SDGs by deploying AI applications, from autonomous vehicles41 to AI-powered healthcare solutions42 and smart electrical grids13, the more important it becomes to invest in the AI safety research needed to keep these systems robust and beneficial, so as to prevent them from malfunctioning, or from getting hacked43. A crucial research venue for a safe integration of AI is understanding catastrophes, which can be enabled by a systemic fault in AI technology. For instance, a recent World Economic Forum (WEF) report raises such a concern due to the integration of AI in the financial sector44. It is therefore very important to raise awareness on the risks associated to possible failures of AI systems in a society progressively more dependent on this technology. Furthermore, although we were able to find numerous studies suggesting that AI can potentially serve as an enabler for many SDG targets and indicators, a significant fraction of these studies have been conducted in controlled laboratory environments, based on limited datasets or using prototypes45,46,47. Hence, extrapolating this information to evaluate the real-world effects often remains a challenge. This is particularly true when measuring the impact of AI across broader scales, both temporally and spatially. We acknowledge that conducting controlled experimental trials for evaluating real-world impacts of AI can result in depicting a snapshot situation, where AI tools are tailored towards that specific environment. However, as society is constantly changing (also due to factors including non-AI-based technological advances), the requirements set for AI are changing as well, resulting in a feedback loop with interactions between society and AI. Another underemphasized aspect in existing literature is the resilience of the society towards AI-enabled changes. Therefore, novel methodologies are required to ensure that the impact of new technologies are assessed from the points of view of efficiency, ethics, and sustainability, prior to launching large-scale AI deployments. In this sense, research aimed at obtaining insight on the reasons for failure of AI systems, introducing combined human–machine analysis tools48, are an essential step towards accountable AI technology, given the large risk associated to such a failure.Although we found more published evidence of AI serving as an enabler than as an inhibitor on the SDGs, there are at least two important aspects that should be considered. First, self-interest can be expected to bias the AI research community and industry towards publishing positive results. Second, discovering detrimental aspects of AI may require longer-term studies and, as mentioned above, there are not many established evaluation methodologies available to do so. Bias towards publishing positive results is particularly apparent in the SDGs corresponding to the Environment group. A good example of this bias is target 14.5 on conserving coastal and marine areas, where machine-learning algorithms can provide optimum solutions given a wide range of parameters regarding the best choice of areas to include in conservation networks49. However, even if the solutions are optimal from a mathematical point of view (given a certain range of selected parameters), additional research would be needed to assess the long-term impact of such algorithms on equity and fairness6, precisely because of the unknown factors that may come into play. Regarding the second point stated above, it is likely that the AI projects with the highest potential of maximizing profit will get funded. Without control, research on AI is expected to be directed towards AI applications where funding and commercial interests are. This may result in increased inequality50. Consequently, there is the risk that AI-based technologies with potential to achieve certain SDGs may not be prioritized, if their expected economic impact is not high. Furthermore, it is essential to promote the development of initiatives to assess the societal, ethical, legal, and environmental implications of new AI technologies.Substantive research and application of AI technologies to SDGs is concerned with the development of better data-mining and machine-learning techniques for the prediction of certain events. This is the case of applications such as forecasting extreme weather conditions or predicting recidivist offender behavior. The expectation with this research is to allow the preparation and response for a wide range of events. However, there is a research gap in real-world applications of such systems, e.g., by governments (as discussed above). Institutions have a number of barriers to the adoption AI systems as part of their decision-making process, including the need of setting up measures for cybersecurity and the need to protect the privacy of citizens and their data. Both aspects have implications on human rights regarding the issues of surveillance, tracking, communication, and data storage, as well as automation of processes without rigorous ethical standards21. Targeting these gaps would be essential to ensure the usability and practicality of AI technologies for governments. This would also be a prerequisite for understanding long-term impacts of AI regarding its potential, while regulating its use to reduce the possible bias that can be inherent to AI6.Furthermore, our research suggests that AI applications are currently biased towards SDG issues that are mainly relevant to those nations where most AI researchers live and work. For instance, many systems applying AI technologies to agriculture, e.g., to automate harvesting or optimize its timing, are located within wealthy nations. Our literature search resulted in only a handful of examples where AI technologies are applied to SDG-related issues in nations without strong AI research. Moreover, if AI technologies are designed and developed for technologically advanced environments, they have the potential to exacerbate problems in less wealthy nations (e.g., when it comes to food production). This finding leads to a substantial concern that developments in AI technologies could increase inequalities both between and within countries, in ways which counteract the overall purpose of the SDGs. We encourage researchers and funders to focus more on designing and developing AI solutions, which respond to localized problems in less wealthy nations and regions. Projects undertaking such work should ensure that solutions are not simply transferred from technology-intensive nations. Instead, they should be developed based on a deep understanding of the respective region or culture to increase the likelihood of adoption and success.Towards sustainable AIThe great wealth that AI-powered technology has the potential to create may go mainly to those already well-off and educated, while job displacement leaves others worse off. Globally, the growing economic importance of AI may result in increased inequalities due to the unevenly distributed educational and computing resources throughout the world. Furthermore, the existing biases in the data used to train AI algorithms may result in the exacerbation of those biases, eventually leading to increased discrimination. Another related problem is the usage of AI to produce computational (commercial, political) propaganda based on big data (also defined as “big nudging”), which is spread through social media by independent AI agents with the goals of manipulating public opinion and producing political polarization51. Despite the fact that current scientific evidence refutes technological determinism of such fake news51, long-term impacts of AI are possible (although unstudied) due to a lack of robust research methods. A change of paradigm is therefore needed to promote cooperation and to limit the possibilities for control of citizen behavior through AI. The concept of Finance 4.0 has been proposed52 as a multi-currency financial system promoting a circular economy, which is aligned with societal goals and values. Informational self-determination (in which the individual takes an active role in how their data are handled by AI systems) would be an essential aspect of such a paradigm52. The data intensiveness of AI applications creates another problem: the need for more and more detailed information to improve AI algorithms, which is in conflict with the need of more transparent handling and protection of personal data53. One area where this conflict is particularly important is healthcare: Panch et al.54 argue that although the vast amount of personal healthcare data could lead to the development of very powerful tools for diagnosis and treatment, the numerous problems associated to data ownership and privacy call for careful policy intervention. This is also an area where more research is needed to assess the possible long-term negative consequences. All the challenges mentioned above culminate in the academic discourse about legal personality of robots55, which may lead to alarming narratives of technological totalitarianism.Many of these aspects result from the interplay between technological developments on one side and requests from individuals, response from governments, as well as environmental resources and dynamics on the other. Figure 5 shows a schematic representation of these dynamics, with emphasis on the role of technology. Based on the evidence discussed above, these interactions are not currently balanced and the advent of AI has exacerbated the process. A wide range of new technologies are being developed very fast, significantly affecting the way individuals live as well as the impacts on the environment, requiring new piloting procedures from governments. The problem is that neither individuals nor governments seem to be able to follow the pace of these technological developments. This fact is illustrated by the lack of appropriate legislation to ensure the long-term viability of these new technologies. We argue that it is essential to reverse this trend. A first step in this direction is to establish adequate policy and legislation frameworks, to help direct the vast potential of AI towards the highest benefit for individuals and the environment, as well as towards the achievement of the SDGs. Regulatory oversight should be preceded by regulatory insight, where policymakers have sufficient understanding of AI challenges to be able to formulate sound policy. Developing such insight is even more urgent than oversight, as policy formulated without understanding is likely to be ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst.Fig. 5: Interaction of AI and society.Schematic representation showing the identified agents and their roles towards the development of AI.

In this representation, technology affects individuals through technical developments, which change the way people work and interact with each other and with the environment, whereas individuals would interact with technology through new needs to be satisfied. Technology (including technology itself and its developers) affects governments through new developments that need appropriate piloting and testing. Also, technology developers affect government through lobbying and influencing decision makers. Governments provide legislation and standards to technology. The governments affect individuals through policy and legislation, and individuals would require new legislation consistent with the changing circumstances from the governments. The environment interacts with technology by providing the resources needed for technological development and is affected by the environmental impact of technology. Furthermore, the environment is affected either negatively or positively by the needs, impacts, and choices of individuals and governments, which in turn require environmental resources. Finally, the environment is also an underlying layer that provides the “planetary boundaries” to the mentioned interactions.Full size imageAlthough strong and connected institutions (covered by SDG 16) are needed to regulate the future of AI, we find that there is limited understanding of the potential impact of AI on institutions. Examples of the positive impacts include AI algorithms aimed at improving fraud detection56,57 or assessing the possible effects of certain legislation58,59. Another concern is that data-driven approaches for policing may hinder equal access to justice because of algorithm bias, particularly towards minorities60. Consequently, we believe that it is imperative to develop legislation regarding transparency and accountability of AI, as well as to decide the ethical standards to which AI-based technology should be subjected to. This debate is being pushed forward by initiatives such as the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) ethical aligned design60 and the new EU (European Union) ethical guidelines for trustworthy AI61. It is noteworthy that despite the importance of an ethical, responsible, and trustworthy approach to AI development and use, in a sense, this issue is independent of the aims of the article. In other words, one can envision AI applications that improve SDG outcomes while not being fully aligned with AI ethics guidelines. We therefore recommend that AI applications that target SDGs are open and explicit about guiding ethical principles, also by indicating explicitly how they align with the existing guidelines. On the other hand, the lack of interpretability of AI, which is currently one of the challenges of AI research, adds an additional complication to the enforcement of such regulatory actions62. Note that this implies that AI algorithms (which are trained with data consisting of previous regulations and decisions) may act as a “mirror” reflecting biases and unfair policy. This presents an opportunity to possibly identify and correct certain errors in the existing procedures. The friction between the uptake of data-driven AI applications and the need of protecting the privacy and security of the individuals is stark. When not properly regulated, the vast amount of data produced by citizens might potentially be used to influence consumer opinion towards a certain product or political cause51.AI applications that have positive societal welfare implications may not always benefit each individual separately41. This inherent dilemma of collective vs. individual benefit is relevant in the scope of AI applications but is not one that should be solved by the application of AI itself. This has always been an issue affecting humankind and it cannot be solved in a simple way, since such a solution requires participation of all involved stakeholders. The dynamicity of context and the level of abstraction at which human values are described imply that there is not a single ethical theory that holds all the time in all situations63. Consequently, a single set of utilitarian ethical principles with AI would not be recommendable due to the high complexity of our societies52. It is also essential to be aware of the potential complexity in the interaction between human and AI agents, and of the increasing need for ethics-driven legislation and certification mechanisms for AI systems. This is true for all AI applications, but especially those that, if they became uncontrolled, could have even catastrophic effects on humanity, such as autonomous weapons. Regarding the latter, associations of AI and robotics experts are already getting together to call for legislation and limitations of their use64. Furthermore, associations such as the Future of Life Institute are reviewing and collecting policy actions and shared principles around the world to monitor progress towards sustainable-development-friendly AI65. To deal with the ethical dilemmas raised above, it is important that all applications provide openness about the choices and decisions made during design, development, and use, including information about the provenance and governance of the data used for training algorithms, and about whether and how they align with existing AI guidelines. It is therefore important to adopt decentralized AI approaches for a more equitable development of AI66.We are at a critical turning point for the future of AI. A global and science-driven debate to develop shared principles and legislation among nations and cultures is necessary to shape a future in which AI positively contributes to the achievement of all the SDGs. The current choices to develop a sustainable-development-friendly AI by 2030 have the potential to unlock benefits that could go far-beyond the SDGs within our century. All actors in all nations should be represented in this dialogue, to ensure that no one is left behind. On the other hand, postponing or not having such a conversation could result in an unequal and unsustainable AI-fueled future.MethodsIn this section we describe the process employed to obtain the results described in the present study and shown in the Supplementary Data 1. The goal was to answer the question “Is there published evidence of AI acting as an enabler or an inhibitor for this particular target?” for each of the 169 targets within the 17 SDGs. To this end, we conducted a consensus-based expert elicitation process, informed by previous studies on mapping SDGs interlinkages8,9 and following Butler et al.67 and Morgan68. The authors of this study are academics spanning a wide range of disciplines, including engineering, natural and social sciences, and acted as experts for the elicitation process. The authors performed an expert-driven literature search to support the identified connections between AI and the various targets, where the following sources of information were considered as acceptable evidence: published work on real-world applications (given the quality variation depending on the venue, we ensured that the publications considered in the analysis were of sufficient quality); published evidence on controlled/laboratory scenarios (given the quality variation depending on the venue, we ensured that the publications considered in the analysis were of sufficient quality); reports from accredited organizations (for instance: UN or government bodies); and documented commercial-stage applications. On the other hand, the following sources of information were not considered as acceptable evidence: educated conjectures, real-world applications without peer-reviewed research; media, public beliefs or other sources of information.The expert elicitation process was conducted as follows: each of the SDGs was assigned to one or more main contributors, and in some cases to several additional contributors as summarized in the Supplementary Data 1 (here the initials correspond to the author names). The main contributors carried out a first literature search for that SDG and then the additional contributors completed the main analysis. One published study on a synergy or a trade-off between a target and AI was considered enough for mapping the interlinkage. However, for nearly all targets several references are provided. After the analysis of a certain SDG was concluded by the contributors, a reviewer was assigned to evaluate the connections and reasoning presented by the contributors. The reviewer was not part of the first analysis and we tried to assign the roles of the main contributor and reviewer to experts with complementary competences for each of the SDGs. The role of the reviewer was to bring up additional points of view and considerations, while critically assessing the analysis. Then, the main contributors and reviewers iteratively discussed to improve the results presented for each of the SDGs until the analysis for all the SDGs was sufficiently refined.After reaching consensus regarding the assessment shown in the Supplementary Data 1, we analyzed the results by evaluating the number of targets for which AI may act as an enabler or an inhibitor, and calculated the percentage of targets with positive and negative impact of AI for each of the 17 goals, as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, we divided the SDGs into the three following categories: Society, Economy, and Environment, consistent with the classification discussed by Refs. 11,12. The SDGs assigned to each of the categories are shown in Fig. 6 and the individual results from each of these groups can be observed in Figs. 2–4. These figures indicate, for each target within each SDG, whether any published evidence of positive or negative impact was found.Fig. 6: Categorization of the SDGs (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/) into the Society, Economy, and Environment groups.(The content of this figure has not been reviewed by the United Nations and does not reflect its views).Full size imageTaking into account the types of evidenceIn the methodology described above, a connection between AI and a certain target is established if at least one reference documenting such a link was found. As the analyzed studies rely on very different types of evidence, it is important to classify the references based on the methods employed to support their conclusions. Therefore, all the references in the Supplementary Data 1 include a classification from (A) to (D) according to the following criteria:References using sophisticated tools and data to refer to this particular issue and with the possibility to be generalized are of type (A).Studies based on data to refer to this particular issue, but with limited generalizability, are of type (B).Anecdotal qualitative studies and methods are of type (C) .Purely theoretical or speculative references are of type (D).The various classes were assigned following the same expert elicitation process described above. Then, the contribution of these references towards the linkages is weighted and categories (A), (B), (C), and (D) are assigned relative weights of 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively. It is noteworthy that, given the vast range of studies on all the SDG areas, the literature search was not exhaustive and, therefore, certain targets are related to more references than others in our study. To avoid any bias associated to the different amounts of references in the various targets, we considered the largest positive and negative weight to establish the connection with each target. Let us consider the following example: for a certain target, one reference of type (B) documents a positive connection and two references of types (A) and (D) document a negative connection with AI. In this case, the potential positive impact of AI on that target will be assessed with 0.75, while the potential negative impact is 1.Limitations of the researchThe presented analysis represents the perspective of the authors. Some literature on how AI might affect certain SDGs could have been missed by the authors or there might not be published evidence yet on such interlinkage. Nevertheless, the employed methods tried to minimize the subjectivity of the assessment. How AI might affect the delivery of each SDG was assessed and reviewed by several authors and a number of studies were reviewed for each interlinkage. Furthermore, as discussed in the Methods section, each interlinkage was discussed among a subset of authors until consensus was reached on its nature.Finally, this study relies on the analysis of the SDGs. The SDGs provide a powerful lens for looking at internationally agreed goals on sustainable development and present a leap forward compared with the Millenium Development Goals in the representation of all spheres of sustainable development, encompassing human rights69, social sustainability, environmental outcomes, and economic development. However, the SDGs are a political compromise and might be limited in the representation of some of the complex dynamics and cross-interactions among targets. Therefore, the SDGs have to be considered in conjunction with previous and current, and other international agreements9. For instance, as pointed out in a recent work by UN Human Rights69, human rights considerations are highly embedded in the SDGs. Nevertheless, the SDGs should be considered as a complement, rather than a replacement, of the United Nations Universal Human Rights Charter70.

","{'headline': 'The role of artificial intelligence in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals', 'description': 'The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and its progressively wider impact on many sectors requires an assessment of its effect on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Using a consensus-based expert elicitation process, we find that AI can enable the accomplishment of 134 targets across all the goals, but it may also inhibit 59 targets. However, current research foci overlook important aspects. The fast development of AI needs to be supported by the necessary regulatory insight and oversight for AI-based technologies to enable sustainable development. Failure to do so could result in gaps in transparency, safety, and ethical standards. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more common in people’s lives.

Student Interest in A.I., Machine Learning is Accelerating

Across the U.S., more and more students are enrolling in introductory A.I. and machine learning classes, according to The A.I. Index 2019 Annual Report (PDF) produced by Stanford University. That’s good news for students everywhere, because it means that more schools will inevitably begin offering this sort of coursework.   
It’s also good for employers desperate for A.I. and machine learning specialists, because it means that pool of talent will likely expand over the next few years as these students enter the workforce.  
At Stanford itself, enrollment in the school’s “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” course has grown “fivefold” between 2012 and 2018, according to the report. That’s not even the most rapid uptake: At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an “Introduction to Machine Learning” course grew twelvefold between 2010 and 2018, with the largest part of that spike occurring after 2015.

Self-directed online learning in A.I.-related subjects has also picked up; the report draws information from Udacity, one of those online learning platforms, which found rising enrollment in five A.I./machine learning classes over the past two years.  
As you might expect, the number of PhD students specializing in A.I. and machine learning has also accelerated over the past few years. “AI is the most popular PhD specialization for computing PhD grads and continues growing the fastest,” the report adds. “In 2018, over 21 percent of graduating computing PhDs specialize in Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning.”  
Moreover, many of these PhD grads are going directly to private companies, rather than staying in academia: “The percent of graduating AI PhDs going to industry increased from 21% in 2004 to over 62% in 2018.”   
And why wouldn’t a hefty portion of newly minted PhDs move to the commercial realm, given the salaries and perks on offer to those A.I. and machine learning experts with the right mix of skills? For example, LinkedIn’s 2020 Emerging Jobs Report (PDF) puts “Artificial Intelligence Specialist” as its number-one emerging job, with 74 percent annual growth over the past four years.  
A.I. jobs are, as you might expect, pretty lucrative and increasingly available. Burning Glass, which analyzes millions of job postings from across the U.S., projects that jobs involving A.I. will grow 40.1 percent over the next decade. While the median salary for these positions is $105,007 (for those with a PhD, it drifts up to $112,300), many who work in A.I. obviously make much more.   
As A.I. and machine learning become more ubiquitous, the need for A.I. education will only increase. No matter what your role, getting familiar with the concepts behind A.I./ML will only help you in the years ahead. “Our analysis shows that A.I. will be a significant factor in the future work lives of relatively well-paid managers, supervisors, and analysts,” read a recent report from the Brookings Institution on the impact of A.I. on jobs. “Also exposed are factory workers, who are increasingly well-educated in many occupations as well as heavily involved with A.I. on the shop floor. A.I. may be much less of a factor in the work of most lower-paid service workers.”

So far, much of the attention has focussed on blue-collar work, as factory assembly lines and warehouses have adopted automated processes more quickly and visibly than other industries. Automation on a factory floor evokes a simple image: robotic arms assembling parts into Tesla cars; mobile robots driving pallets of goods through Amazon distribution centers. In either scenario, the impact on human workers is easy to see. What is harder to visualize is how similar technology might find its way into the aspects of human labor that are invisible and not as easily routinized, such as complex decision-making, strategic planning, and creative thought.Until recently, the consensus among researchers seemed to be that workers with higher levels of education would be less affected by automation than those lower down on the economic hierarchy. Now, though, new research suggests that higher-educated, white-collar workers may be facing significant disruption, as well. In a study published in November by the Brookings Institution, researchers found that certain higher-wage occupations might be more deeply intertwined with A.I. technology in the future than previously thought. “The big takeaway is that manufacturing professions and occupations will be heavily affected,” one of the study’s co-authors, Mark Muro, told me recently. “But so will white-collar jobs—managerial and office activity.” Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program, who specializes in economic development and technology and who wears spectacles that lend him a bookish air, noted that whether these jobs are likely to be replaced by A.I. or simply changed by it is still unclear; in some cases, A.I. may end up assisting human workers rather than doing their jobs for them. Either way, the uncertainty is likely to cause alarm in some circles.One of the challenges of studying the effects of artificial intelligence on white-collar employment is that the integration of algorithms into office work happens slowly, and often imperceptibly. As a starting point, Muro and his co-authors tried to narrow their task by focussing on machine learning, a form of A.I. that uses algorithms to analyze huge amounts of data, find patterns, and then use those patterns to make predictions. “When most people talk about A.I., they’re talking, in many respects, about this,” Muro said. “When they talk about the radiologists reading a scan enhanced by A.I., they’re talking about machine learning.”Video From The New YorkerSurfing on Kelly Slater’s Machine-Made WaveAfter they defined what they were looking for, another challenge presented itself: how to figure out what new kinds of machine-learning applications were likely to be introduced in the coming years. For this, the researchers employed a method developed by Michael Webb, a graduate student in the economics department at Stanford University, who created an algorithm to analyze A.I. patents that had been filed and cross-reference them with tasks performed in various jobs. Webb examined a pool of approximately sixteen thousand patents that contained verb-object pairs such as “diagnose disease” and “predict prognosis,” which correlated with descriptions of occupations used by the Department of Labor. “Patents are a reflection of the things that inventors think are going to be important innovations that will make money in the future,” Webb told me. “The reason you patent something is that you think you could make some money off of this innovation, and you want the right to create that product and not have other people do it instead.”As a way of testing the effectiveness of this research method, Webb looked back at the previous thirty years or so of patents in software and industrial robotics, to see if the predictions about employment and wage decline one would have found then had panned out. They had: software patents often referred to “recording,” “storing,” and “producing information,” while robot-related patents talked about “cleaning,” “moving,” “welding,” and “assembling.” The words correlated most strongly with the tasks of packers and packagers, hoist and winch operators, machine operators, and those who worked in warehouses—for example, people driving forklifts. “It turns out that the jobs that were highly exposed to those technologies experienced declines in employment and in wages over the next thirty years,” Webb said. That, to him, suggested that software and industrial robots were replacing human labor in those fields (although there were other forces in effect, as well, such as the offshoring of factories).Webb then analyzed A.I. patent filings and found them using verbs such as “recognize,” “detect,” “control,” “determine,” and “classify,” and nouns like “patterns,” “images,” and “abnormalities.” The jobs that appear to face intrusion by these newer patents are different from the more manual jobs that were affected by industrial robots: intelligent machines may, for example, take on more tasks currently conducted by physicians, such as detecting cancer, making prognoses, and interpreting the results of retinal scans, as well as those of office workers that involve making determinations based on data, such as detecting fraud or investigating insurance claims. People with bachelor’s degrees might be more exposed to the effects of the new technologies than other educational groups, as might those with higher incomes. The findings suggest that nurses, doctors, managers, accountants, financial advisers, computer programmers, and salespeople might see significant shifts in their work. Occupations that require high levels of interpersonal skill seem most insulated. (Notably, jobs at the very top of the earning scale, such as C.E.O., are not shown to be deeply changed.)When I asked Muro what he thought the implications of his research might be, he told me about a tweet that someone had written in response to the paper’s findings. The author had expressed concern that his work might “muddy the water about the underemployed and vulnerable,” Muro said, by taking attention away from the truck drivers and factory workers who are already being displaced from their jobs, often with less of a financial cushion to fall back on. “There’s no doubt the white-collar part of the story involves some of the most capable, resilient workers in the economy,” Muro said. “For someone in the eightieth percentile of income, they’re probably well trained by, and are being invested in by, their employers.” That kind of investment, Muro added, “doesn’t flow to those at the lower end.” But he noted that the danger of automation coming for white-collar jobs might help make the issue more real for those in charge of policy decisions. “I think maybe this widens the scope of concern,” he said. “This suggests that it isn’t just somebody else’s problem, namely, a black or brown worker in a factory. . . . We’re all going to be contending with tremendous flux and change in the labor market and our work.”",,Could New Research on A.I. and White-Collar Jobs Finally Bring About a Strong Policy Response?,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Business', 'item': 'https://www.newyorker.com/business'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence', 'item': 'https://www.newyorker.com/tag/artificial-intelligence'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Could New Research on A.I. and White-Collar Jobs Finally Bring About a Strong Policy Response?'}]","Until recently, the consensus among researchers seemed to be that workers with higher levels of education would be less affected by automation than those lower down on the economic hierarchy.

Accelerated machine learning and the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) have given rise to worker dread with the overwhelming fear that, someday, a robot or algorithm may take your job. But what is the true impact of AI on workforces? Can the benefits of automation outweigh the potential negative consequences? NYU Stern Professor Robert Seamans and Stern Ph.D. student Michael Impink, along with James Bessen and Lydia Reichensperger of Boston University, recently conducted a survey to study these questions and concluded that despite growing angst among workers, there is little evidence of job loss associated with AI so far.

 In “The Business of AI Startups,” the co-authors administered a survey and collected responses from 179 AI firms and machine learning companies to explore the effects that AI had on their own businesses and their customers. Although there has been considerable commentary touting the concerns about machines replacing jobs, the researchers concluded that AI applications today are more geared toward enhancing human capabilities than they are about replacing humans. 

 Key findings from the survey include:

Using AI in a business doesn’t simply eliminate jobs or create jobs, but rather shifts the work from some occupations to others.
98% of survey respondents agreed that AI products enhanced human capabilities, instead of eliminating them. 
AI affects employment differently across varied industries.

“If so many jobs were really at risk, we would see evidence of substantial job loss associated with emerging AI applications today. This survey makes clear that is not the case right now,” said the co-authors. This research suggests that fears of robots or algorithms taking human jobs are overblown, and instead highlights that AI can augment workers in their jobs in many cases.

Home to one-sixth of the world's population, India is bound to play a leading role in determining the global success of the SDGs. By 2030, India will have the largest number of young people in the globe, a population size which will be a boon only if these young people are skilled enough to join the workforce. The recently launched SDG Index 2019-2020 by Niti Aayog assigned a composite score of 58 to India under the SDG on Quality Education, with only 12 states/UTs having a score of more than 64. The current government expenditure on education is less than 3% of the GDP and the pupil-teacher ratio for elementary school stands at 24:1, lower than that of comparable countries such as Brazil and China. Further, with the rapidly increasing population and dwindling resources, it would not be possible to match the demand for teachers.
There is a need for a bottom up approach - the SDGs will have to be localized at the grass root level. As we enter the last decade to achieve the targets set by the UN, there is a need to propel the progress towards these goals and a key step to achieve the same would be monitoring their indicators on a real time basis. The 'Transformation of Aspirational Districts' programme has shown how monitoring and tracking the targets to rank the districts can promote healthy competition among the districts, encouraging each of them to achieve the set mandates. The momentum needed to accelerate the progress towards these goals will be provided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) that will be a gamechanger in converting these aspirations into achievements. The unprecedented availability of data points in the second-most populous country of the world coupled with access to heavy computational power could potentially make India one of the strongest beneficiaries of the AI wave. Once initiated and operationalized, the AI-powered systems are only going to get better as they learn more and more data is available.
One of the targets under the agenda of Quality Education says that by 2030, our nation must substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers. While it may not be possible to fill the large demand-supply gap that exists, it is possible that the teachers be made more efficient. Here are some ways AI can do so:
Real-time text to speech and text translation systems can be used to disseminate information seamlessly in the regional language, in line with the Draft National Education Policy 2019 that has encouraged learning of mother-tongue languages. These translation systems can be integrated with DISKHA, Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing, the digital infrastructure that has been set up by MHRD or with e-PATHSHALA, (initiatives under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan). For example, if a textbook on E-PATHSHALA is available only in Hindi, text translation services can make it available in other regional languages and make it more accessible. Because of these language translation systems, the language barrier could be removed and the inter-operability of teachers across states can be achieved, helping meet the demand better than previously.
Biometric authentication: Mundane and support tasks of the teacher – attendance and other administrative tasks- can be taken over by AI. For example, biometric authentication for the students can be introduced and integrated with UDISE+ (Unified District Information System for Education) – an application that is one of the largest Management Information Systems on School Education. The biometric attendance records could also be used as a proxy for inclusiveness of the education in the district/state/block and can be easily tracked, helping monitor the national indicators such as participation rate of youth and adults and proportion of male-female enrolled in higher education, technical and vocational education. This can help monitor the quality of education in the school.
Chatbots: In a country as diverse as India, integration of chatbots in the digital infrastructure or availability via IVRS system education domain could be transformational – they could be trained on subject matter and a good percentage of doubts of the students could be answered instantly, thereby reducing current workload of teachers who could focus on more creative tasks. Mobile penetration would not be a hindrance here as it is being driven by rural India, the number of internet users in Rural India is expected to reach 290 million by the end of 2019.
Automated grading: With Draft National Education Policy 2019 prioritizing online learning in its agenda, machine learning methods such as Natural Language Processing could be used for automated grading of assessments on a large scale on platforms such as DIKSHA, E-PATHSHALA and SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) - not just objective questions but subjective ones as well. Automated creation of content is another field where AI can intervene – given large sources of information on the internet, NLP techniques will be able to use Automatic Text Summarization to create crisp content and publish them on these e-learning websites. The standard unified curriculum created by ML-based methods will be in line with the nationally defined learning outcomes (MHRD has designed a 70 indicators-based matrix called Performance Grading Index (PGI) to grade the states and UTs) and will objectively help evaluate indicators on the percentage of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level.
Personalization: When such content is in place on these e-learning platforms, personalized feedback and recommendations at a large scale could be possible: Currently, it is not possible to provide individual attention to every student. However, when content is created and graded by AI, it would ensure personalized avenues of learning for the children by identifying pain points for the students and providing recommendations accordingly. Essentially, educational infrastructure powered by AI would give each student of India a personalized tutor.
Supervised classification models to reduce drop-out rates: When AI systems provide personalized feedback, we can curb the all India drop-out rates that stand at 4% at the primary level but rise to 20% in higher education. As these personalized tutors continue to collect data points at each juncture in the child's education journey, classification ML models could be used to predict the children at risk of dropping out and proper redressal mechanisms can be put in place. A culmination of these activities would help a higher education enrolment ratio and make sure a substantial proportion of adults achieve literacy, mandates in line with targets under this SDG.
Pattern detection to increase Inclusiveness: Targets revolving around elimination of gender disparities in education and inclusion of persons with disabilities can be influenced positively with the use of AI – not only are Apple's Siri and Amazon' Alexa becoming pronounced among the urban section of the society, allowing the visually impaired users to be more participative, but near real-time text to speech systems are allowing the mute to have active information exchange. To support Inclusive Education for Children with Special Needs (CWSN) Children under the Samagra Shiksha program of MHRD, children affected with autism, Parkinson's disease or any other disease that results in a speech disorder could benefit by integration of machine learning models in the e-learning websites that detect speech patterns, augment the speech by correcting mispronunciations or broken words and then output the same in an audio or a text format.  Additionally, in today's system, certain educational institutions may have inherent implicit biases, knowingly or otherwise, such as selecting more students of one gender or having policies inhibiting equal opportunities for certain indigenous groups. However, machine learning algorithms can be set up to aid and monitor enrolment and be explicitly programmed to get rid of such biases. For example, selection criteria for jobs can involve a screening by such AI systems to ensure the process is just, a system that will become a precursor to inclusive education.
To conclude, the education sector in India has opened and will continue to open multiple avenues of AI intervention. It could be a difficult road for the nation to achieve the targets under the SDG on Quality Education without harnessing this superpower, often believed to be the new electricity for the 21st Century. A skilled workforce will be crucial if India must become a US$ 5 Trillion economy by 2024.

The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in recent years and across different industries has greatly disrupted production and labour processes. 
AI has the potential to create large productivity gains, specially in low-skilled sectors, which could improve the work and lives of people in developing regions across Southeast Asia.
Compared to the main AI global hubs – the US and China – ASEAN states still lag markedly behind. However, Singapore has shown strong commitment to the development of the technology and is currently at the forefront of countries in the region in AI implementation.
 
 
 













 
 

In November, the city-state launched its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy and committed over S$500 million (c. US$370 million) to fund activities related to AI under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 Plan.

Malaysia and Vietnam are also showing early signs of AI development, although adoption rates remain low. Many of these countries are aware of the potential the technology has to offer but lack the critical infrastructure to properly capitalise on the benefits.
Dr Chris Marshall, associate VP for data, analytics and AI, at IDC, explains that in the region, with the exception of a few digital native enterprises that have embedded analytics and AI into their business models from the start, only a handful have really deployed these technologies at scale throughout the enterprise.
 
 
 













 
 

“There are many reasons for this, such as a lack of skilled resources, lack of data, lack of coordination between key stakeholders, lack of imagination as to what the technology can do. But perhaps the most important issue is the need for a long term perspective and commitment to analytics and AI,” he says.
Businesses need to manage expectations at every level to achieve success, he says. They must also show patience, embedding the technology into business processes to achieve real business value.
This is undoubtedly an area where CIOs can offer their expertise and knowledge.
 
 
 













 
 

Here, we take a look at the impact artificial intelligence is having across seven industries in ASEAN countries.

Financial services
Achim Granzen, principal analyst at Forrester, says that AI-infused process automation in the financial services industry (FSI) will streamline customer facing processes, reducing cost and providing a better customer experience. This, continues Granzen, is crucial for traditional FSI players to compete with new digital banks who have adopted AI earlier.
Singapore is leading the technological charge in this arena, but the rest of the ASEAN bloc has been slow on the uptake when it comes to some of the more advanced uses for artificial intelligence.
 
 
 













 
 

Financial institutions throughout America and China have already started to develop AI that can be applied to functions such as credit scoring and investment predictions.
Some argue that emerging technology on that level is best left to the fintech startups that the region is continuing to attract.
Singapore based startup CashShield, for example, uses real-time high-frequency algorithms with biometric analysis and pattern recognition to help companies manage the risk of fraudulent accounts and payments.
 
 
 













 
 

Claiming to be the world’s only fully automated fraud management system, its algorithm trains itself in real time, functioning without the need for any data scientist or fraud analyst.
However, not every country in the bloc is as technological savvy as Singapore, with businesses elsewhere needing to accelerate basic digitisation efforts; streamlining their data collection, management and analytics processes before they can start feeding the information into complex AI algorithms.
Ultimately, most of the AI developments in financial services will emerge from fintech startups. It’s up to the established institutions throughout the region to keep up with these developments or risk losing their business to digital disruption.
 
 
 













 
 

Travel
In the view of James Chua, general manager of Singaporean travel agency Global Travel, the role of AI has evolved dramatically within the travel industry over the past decade.
“AI is now used in a myriad of applications to increase efficiencies and save resources – from automated chatbots to product recommendations and cyber defence,” he says. “Cybersecurity, in particular, provides the most promising use case of enterprise AI in the real world.”
A rise in data breaches incidents in the region has evidenced Southeast Asia’s weakness in the areas of cybersecurity and data compliance. Major breaches in Singapore Airlines and Malaysia’s Malindo Air show that the travel industry is particularly vulnerable.
 
 
 













 
 

Global Travel has deployed artificial intelligence to protect confidential traveler information, including passport data and travel plans. Using Darktrace’s cyber AI they are now able to identify and stop cyberthreats on a 24/7 basis. The technology is able to neutralise attacks across the enterprise before they can cause damage.

Chua sees the potential of AI in the travel industry so great that he goes as far as to claim that AI “is no longer a ‘nice to have’, but a necessity for the travel industry in fighting back against tomorrow’s adversary.”
Transport
Ride-hailing startup Grab and the National University of Singapore (NUS) launched an AI laboratory in 2018, aiming to develop solutions that can transform urban transport and prepare for “smarter” cities in Southeast Asia.
 
 
 













 
 

The ‘Grab-NUS AI Lab’, which has been set up with a joint initial investment of S$6 million (US$4.5 million), is Grab’s first major AI laboratory and NUS’s first AI laboratory with a commercial partner.
Through the use of AI algorithms, Grab is using data from its rides to build richer maps, understand passengers’ preferences, model of traffic conditions, analyse driver behaviour and detect real-time traffic events.
By combining this data with NUS’s AI expertise, the Grab-NUS AI Lab will map out traffic patterns and identify ways to improve mobility and livability in cities across Southeast Asia.
 
 
 













 
 

Healthcare
Healthcare in Southeast Asia varies by country but typically combines state-funded care with private, insurance-led options. One of the biggest healthcare insurers in Singapore, NTUC Income, is using IBM Watson to digitally process almost 15,000 monthly claims.
Private medical group Parkway Pantai has been using AI since November 2018 to generate accurate hospital bill estimates. Using AI and machine learning algorithms from Singapore-based startup UCARE.AI, four of its hospitals are now able to generate personalised bill estimates based on parameters such as the patient’s medical condition and medical practices. It also takes into account the patient’s current age, revisit frequency and existing conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes.
The uses of AI have also been embraced by the government in Singapore, with one state agency using the technology to analyse patient data that has been inputted from a number of different healthcare systems. The system should help to improve diagnostic outcomes and generate greater insights into potential treatments.
 
 
 













 
 

Healthtech startups are also flourishing in Malaysia, with many of these emerging companies developing AI-based solutions to help improve the access people have to healthcare professionals. Getdoc, Door2Door Doctor, Teleme, HomeGP, Healthmetrics, and BookDoc are all Malaysian healthcare startups that use AI algorithms to help predict your medical needs, customise your healthcare plan and increase your access to medical advice.
However, similar to the financial services industry, the majority of healthcare institutions throughout Southeast Asia still rely heavily on legacy systems and are often unable to cope with the data demands needed to successfully implement AI technologies.

Education
AI chatbots and classroom assistants are proving useful in the education sector, removing some of the pressure from teachers and allowing them to focus more on the job of teaching and less on monotonous and repetitive tasks.
 
 
 













 
 

In the field of AI analytics, universities in Singapore and Malaysia have started to experiment with predictive algorithms designed to reduce the number of school dropouts by allowing for earlier interventions.
For some countries in the ASEAN bloc though, where there is variability in IT infrastructure quality, improving internet access must come before a move to AI.
Retail
Retail is big business in Southeast Asia. Ecommerce alone is expected to reach US$53 billion by 2023. Like their counterparts in Europe and the US, both online and offline retailers in ASEAN are keen to move with the times and offer their customers a new shopping experience that reflects the digital age we now live in.
 
 
 













 
 

A growing number of consumers are turning to their phones for help, instead of seeking out a real person. Smart phones now come fully equipped with AI assistants and every retailer from Starbucks to supermarkets now use chatbots to engage with their customers.

“In retail, AI will be all about enhancing customer experience and shopping experiences, whether it’s browsing, selecting, or paying for goods,” says Granzen. “Poorly implemented, however, there is a risk of backfiring, when there is no value to the shopper besides the novelty, or their privacy is threatened.”
Gartner says that retailers require AI capabilities as a foundation of digital business strategy and execution to remain viable in the market.
Within the retail sector, AI can personalise purchasing recommendations for customers whilst helping retailers to optimise pricing and discount strategies, alongside demand forecasting.
 
 
 













 
 

For example, Lazada (a Singaporean online marketplace that is Southeast Asia’s answer to Amazon) uses an AI driven app that takes away the emphasis from pre-set categories and instead uses machine-learning algorithms to show off products that the user might be interested in based on purchase and viewing history.
HR
AI-powered tools can help enhance HR functions such as recruiting, payroll or reporting.
In Singapore, startup Evie.ai has created Evie, an AI recruitment coordinator that helps with interview scheduling and coordination “while keeping the human touch”. Among the tasks that Evie is able to do is handling the back and forth of negotiations, follow up with candidates, send out invitations and book meeting rooms.
Evie is based in the cloud and only requires Google or Office 365 to operate.
Beyond recruitment, AI-enabled legal services could develop an AI engine to automatically review legal contracts and highlight any issues based on a business’s legal policies and in this way ensuring consistency. It could also manage contract approvals and escalation which would get the right tasks to the right people automatically.

Various definitions of assisted intelligence and how they differ from augmented intelligence
The folks from PwC have been most visible in promoting the different definitions of augmented vs. assisted intelligence. From their perspective, they see a continuum of human-machine intelligence interaction ranging from situations where machines are basically repeating many of the tasks humans are already doing (assisted) to enabling humans to do more than they are currently capable of doing (augmented) to fully accomplishing tasks on their own without human intervention (autonomous). Others are defining the assisted – augmented – autonomous continuum as being one of control and decision-making. From this perspective, in assisted intelligence approaches, machines might be doing the action but humans are making the decisions, while with augmented intelligence, machines are doing the action but there’s collaborative human-machine decision-making, and in autonomous systems machines are making both the actions and decisions. Another group defines things even more simply: assisted intelligence improves what people and organizations are already doing, augmented intelligence enables organizations and people to do things they couldn’t otherwise do, and autonomous intelligence systems act on their own.

While these definitions make some sense, the challenge is applying these terms to the various real-world situations in which they might be used. For example, it’s fairly clear that a Level 5 Autonomous vehicle is exhibiting truly autonomous behavior, especially when there’s no control of the vehicle even possible. But what about Level 2 or Level 3 vehicles? There’s clearly some AI at work here keeping the vehicle in lane and managing various speed and navigation changes. Is this augmented or assisted? I suppose since the system is not providing any capabilities that a human can’t otherwise do, you could call this simply assisted. However, that means in autonomous vehicle situations there is no augmented intelligence role, from that definition.

PROMOTED
In other situations, it gets more complex. Are machine-language powered solutions for online recommendation systems augmented or assisted or autonomous? I suppose people could be manually providing recommendations for products, but that’s hardly possible in the context of millions of customers and tons of website traffic. So are these AI solutions augmented or assisted or perhaps they’re autonomous? We tend to think of collaborative robots (cobots) as augmented intelligence because they’re giving humans skills and capabilities they don’t already have. But if they’re just being used to assemble widgets or move things from place to place are they really augmenting anything, or are they just assisting? As we can see the assisted vs. augmented vs. autonomous difference is sometimes entirely from the perspective of not what the AI-enabled system can do, but what it’s actually doing at that time.

Using the terms to define roles and boundaries for AI systems
Using these terms are all about providing some expectations about what the role of the systems are and how we can understand where the human needs to be in the loop. In many ways, the terms are used to define the boundaries of what we expect the AI systems, and their human counterparts, to do. From that perspective, the terms can be useful in project management and ROI contexts. When an organization is looking to use cognitive technology as part of their processes, they should first look at the use case in which those AI technologies will provide the best impact and ROI. After deciding that, then they can look at the scope of what they want these systems to do, what they want their people to continue doing, and what the scope of control they will give to the system in each of the specific parts of the application and processes they will be employing the AI system. From this perspective, we can say that the AI solution is playing an assisted, augmented, or autonomous role in the solution, and this role might change over the course of how the cognitive technology is applied over time.

As part of an AI project management exercise, organizations need to determine the range and scope of what they want their cognitive technologies to do and provide. Just like in many non-AI projects, project managers first need to identify the business need and required return. Then, they need to define the various aspects of data requirements and functionality to solve those business needs. What makes AI projects unique is that they also need to consider the human-machine dynamic. Which elements of the AI solution do they want to hand over entirely to machines to execute, and which things do they want to retain for their human resources? In the scope of these decisions, then, it makes a lot more sense to create an AI role matrix which can evolve over time. This matrix specifies that for a particular function or process, the AI system will be providing an assisted, augmented, or autonomous role, and defines specifically what will be under the operation and control of the machine, and what will be under the operation and control of the person. Doing so not only helps to delineate the capabilities of the system, but also helps to assuage any concerns people might have about these AI systems taking their jobs.

Autonomous is really hard, and Assisted / Augmented are very similar
Organizations implementing AI systems are quickly realizing the limits of cognitive technology. While there’s no doubt significant power in machine learning and the range of technologies enabled by the movement to AI, getting to true autonomous systems is a big challenge. In fact, many of the challenges of AI arise from the desire to push the boundaries of autonomous systems vs. the use of AI in a more human controlled and operated context. This is the reason why many companies choose to start with augmented intelligence approaches to AI because they provide the most immediate opportunities for ROI.
So where does that put assisted intelligence? Are assisted intelligence and augmented intelligence two sides of the same coin? These terms represent different expectations for how humans and machines can work together in the context of cognitive technologies, and as discussed above, are more a matter of role definition than technology capabilities. It goes without saying that we expect machines to provide value greater than what humans can provide for the same activity. If they didn’t, then what is the point of applying the technology? If the human will retain some amount of control or operation of the system, then augmented and assisted intelligence capabilities both will provide suitable application. As a matter of role definition, the only real practical difference between assisted and augmented intelligence approaches to AI is one of expectations. Will the system deliver the same operational benefit as humans but at a lower cost or higher efficiency, or will it add additional capabilities that the organization can’t or doesn’t provide today. From that perspective, we can see cognitive technologies providing an assisted or augmented intelligence role in ways that keep humans in the loop.

         — 
    


            College career centers used to prepare students for job interviews by helping them learn how to dress appropriately or write a standout cover letter. These days, they’re also trying to brace students for a stark new reality: They may be vetted for jobs in part by artificial intelligence.
    

            At schools such as Duke University, Purdue University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, career counselors are now working to find out which companies use AI and also speaking candidly with students about what, if anything, they can do to win over the algorithms. This shift in preparations comes as more businesses interested in filling internships and entry-level positions that may see a glut of applicants turn to outside companies such as HireVue to help them quickly conduct vast numbers of video interviews.

AI software defines people as male or female. That's a problem




            With HireVue, businesses can pose pre-determined questions — often recorded by a hiring manager — that candidates answer on camera through a laptop or smartphone. Increasingly, those videos are then pored over by algorithms analyzing details such as words and grammar, facial expressions and the tonality of the job applicant’s voice, trying to determine what kinds of attributes a person may have. Based on this analysis, the algorithms will conclude whether the candidate is tenacious, resilient, or good at working on a team, for instance.
    

            Much has been written about the potential of AI to replace human jobs in the future, but the use of services like HireVue highlights a different concern: that AI can act as a gatekeeper for the jobs of today. Companies may not be ready to outsource vetting candidates for C-Suite and executive positions to algorithms, but the stakes are lower for entry-level roles and internships. That means some of today’s college students are effectively the guinea pigs for a largely unproven mechanism for evaluating applicants. 
    

            To make matters more complicated, there is little in the way of regulations or industry standards surrounding disclosure of technology usage -— though Illinois, for example, changed that with a recently-enacted law. So interviewees may not know when (or how) AI is analyzing their interview, and when it isn’t. That creates a sense of uncertainty for those trying to guide college students and new graduates through the interview process, and for the job seekers themselves.
    



        What worries me about AI is AI can’t tell the heart of a person and the drive a person has.
    

            Matthew French, assistant director for employer relations at UNC Charlotte
        


            “It’s kind of the wild, wild west right now of interviewing,” said Matthew French, assistant director for employer relations at UNC Charlotte’s university career center.

            Sarah Ali, a Duke undergraduate student, has gone through about eight HireVue interviews with various companies for jobs and internships in fields like tech and marketing. Except for the first interview, which helped her snag a marketing internship, none of them led to a job. Even now, she’s unsure what role, if any, AI played in the process — a possibility she only contemplated after speaking with friends about it following the first one.
    

            Even though she landed the internship after that first interview, Ali said she would have done a lot of things differently had she known for sure AI was involved. She might have used key words or phrases that would be picked up by AI and also kept direct eye contact with the camera.
    

            “Once I understood the AI interview process, I definitely started thinking about it as a game and how I could optimize for certain qualities or gestures,” Ali said.

        Why some companies turn to AI in interviews 


            HireVue may be the most well-known video interview company with nearly 800 companies as clients (including CNN, which does not use its AI features). It is used to interview about 1 million people every 90 days, according to HireVue CEO Kevin Parker.
    

            “We’ll interview probably a million college kids this year,” Parker told CNN Business.

            Parker said the Utah-based company began using AI in 2014 as a way to help companies sort through video interviews. He won’t say how many clients use AI assessments today, beyond noting that it’s a “smaller subset” of the companies it works with. HireVue highlights several of them on its website, including multiple Fortune 500 companies, such as Unilever.

            As with other companies like Yobs and Talview that offer AI-based assessments of video interviews, HireVue believes it can be helpful for ushering a massive number of people through the interview process quickly and reviewing them in a fair, consistent way. 
    






A mockup of a report that a company would receive after AI is used to assess a job candidate's HireVue interview, showing how the person compared to others who were interviewed and an average recommendation for the candidate. In this example, the candidate also completed a coding task and answered multiple-choice questions.

HireVue



            Parker said its algorithms consider things such as word usage, pronouns and facial expressions to determine how likely a job candidate is to possess a specific attribute a client is looking for in a certain job, such as empathy or willingness to learn. 
    

            These AI assessments are often used for filling entry-level jobs because candidates don’t have a lot of work history. The goal, according to Parker, is that the AI can act as a way to evaluate abilities and talent.
    

            After an AI assessment is performed on an interview – video interviews can take roughly 20 to 25 minutes –  the client gets a report scoring the candidate on the attributes deemed key to the job. This, Parker said, gives the company offering the job an almost standardized-test-score view of the candidate, showing what they’re good at and how they stand relative to other candidates. A report can also be generated for the job candidate to give them feedback, but it’s up to the employer to share that.
    

            “We recommend that customers do it and I think it’s great feedback for the candidate, but it’s customer specific,” Parker said. It’s unclear how many companies do applicants the courtesy of taking this step.

        “We don’t know what it’s looking for”


            For Meredith McCook, assistant director at the Duke career center, the rise of this kind of interview — via video, and possibly with AI in the background analyzing that video — has meant some changes to how she works with students. She’s often talking to students about the new ways technology may be part of the interview process, and coaching them to practice by doing things such as turning on their laptop’s video camera and spending time talking to it. Duke offers students online video interview practice sessions, too.

            “With AI, we don’t know what it’s looking for,” McCook said. But in case AI is analyzing the interview, she suggests students raise their laptop to be eye level with the camera so it appears they’re maintaining eye contact, even though there isn’t a human on the other side of the lens.
    

            At UNC Charlotte, French is trying to help students become more informed about when AI is being used. This year, he said, the school will be asking employers it partners with whether they use AI for their virtual interviews in hopes of getting some data on how widespread the practice is. 
    

            He remains troubled about the use of AI in the recruitment process, though. “Everyone makes snap judgments on students, on applicants, when first meeting them,” he said. “But what worries me about AI is AI can’t tell the heart of a person and the drive a person has.”

            Others like Stephen Roach, a career services consultant at Purdue’s center for career opportunities, sometimes take an almost dismissive approach when coaching students on dealing with a potential AI assessment. For example, he may tell them not to worry about it, since it’s outside their control.
    

            “If it is looking at their facial expressions or tone of voice, it might just be them being who they are,” he said. “They can’t know how that platform’s going to judge them.”
    

            These career counselors might soon have more tools to help students crack the black box. Interview prep platform Big Interview, which is used by more than 500 colleges and universities including Purdue and UNC Charlotte, is building its own AI system for scoring mock video interviews and giving would-be interviewees feedback. Big Interview cofounder and chief coach Pamela Skillings said the feedback will include details such as how quickly the person speaks and how much confident or negative language they use. The company plans to roll it out next month.
    

            The impetus for developing the tool, Skillings said, is from seeing people getting screened out after doing video interviews and feeling like they “deserve to know how they’re coming across.” 
    






College students and career counselors are still trying to figure out how to deal with the new role that AI plays in job interviews

        But does it even work?


            Regardless of how clued in candidates are to when and how AI evaluates their interviews, plenty of people encountering this kind of interview technology — from college career counselors to AI scholars to technology rights activists — are unconvinced it can really work.
    

            “When you start saying, ‘We’ll use things like cadence and facial animation and things of that nature,’ I’m really skeptical that there’s real validity there,” said Aaron Rieke, a managing director at technology rights nonprofit Upturn.
    

            There are also concerns about how well AI can apply to the interview process. Arvind Narayanan, an associate professor of computer science at Princeton, said that while AI can be helpful at, say, identifying whether a photo contains a cat or a dog, it’s much harder to automate things such as predicting future social outcomes — like who will succeed at a job.
    

            He’s particularly doubtful of companies claiming they can analyze facial expressions in order to assess a person’s suitability for a job. (HireVue’s AI assessments can include this, Parker said, but he stressed that it’s used “very, very little”.)

            One group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, has gone as far as asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate HireVue for what it calls “unfair and deceptive trade practices” related to its use of AI — particularly “secret, unproven algorithms” — in the interview process.
    

            HireVue said in a statement that it believes the complaint is without merit. “We uphold the highest levels of rigor and ethics as we work every day to increase fairness and objectivity in the hiring process,” the company said.
    

        Coming face-to-face with artificial intelligence


            To get a sense for what it’s actually like to be knowingly graded by a computer, I recently tried out a simulator that’s available online from Los Angeles-based startup Yobs, which uses AI to help a range of companies.
    

            The interview started with a familiar question: Name your biggest strengths and weaknesses. In the back of my mind, however, I wondered what an algorithm would make of my answer, complete with nervous pauses and frowns.
    






After completing a mock video interview via Yobs, CNN Business' Rachel Metz received an AI assessment scoring her personality traits, including extraversion and agreeableness.

FROM YOBS



            As I stared into my laptop camera, talking to nobody about myself and why I should be a potential employee at the faux Your Dream Company, I couldn’t help but feel a lot more anxious than I ever recall feeling during a phone or in-person interview.
    

            After answering the warm-up question about my strengths and weaknesss, which I was allowed to watch and redo as many times as I wanted, I recorded an ersatz interview where I had to talk about topics such as a time I faced a challenge with a team. Yobs gave me 30 seconds to prepare an answer to each of the questions, and each answer needed to be one to three minutes long. Without a human on the other side of my desk, I struggled to speak for even 40 seconds straight.
    

            The AI assessment of my performance arrived in my inbox soon after. It included computer-generated scores of the so-called Big Five personality traits — including openness and conscientiousness, where I scored highly, and neuroticism where, to my surprise, I scored low. The report also rated me on what are often known as “soft” or interpersonal skills: According to Yobs, my answers indicated a tendency to be cooperative, humble, and analytical, but less likely to be assertive or empathetic.
    

            To score these traits and skills, Yobs cofounder and CEO Raphael Danilo said the company’s AI assessment analyzes what interviewees say and how they say it — a method that sounds similar to HireVue’s. If a video is poor quality or the speaker has an unclear voice, he said, a trained human reviewer (who’s been given guidelines by psychologists working for Yobs on how to measure the same things the AI system is assessing) will look it over. 
    

            Danilo acknowledges that using AI to look over interviews is challenging; he’s not, for instance, comfortable letting it completely automate the hiring process at this point. But he’s convinced it can help employers find good employees quickly.
    

            If you’re looking at 100,000 applications for 500 spots, for instance, “you can’t talk to everybody,” he said. “You can’t take everyone out to lunch. So you have to use signals.”
    






",,There’s a new obstacle to landing a job after college: Getting approved by AI,,,,,"College career centers used to prepare students for job interviews by helping them learn how to dress appropriately or write a standout cover letter. These days, they’re also trying to brace students for a stark new reality: They may be vetted for jobs in part by artificial intelligence. At schools such as Duke University, Purdue University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, career counselors are now working to find out which companies use AI and also speaking candidly with students about what, if anything, they can do to win over the algorithms. This shift in preparations comes as more businesses interested in filling internships and entry-level positions that may see a glut of applicants turn to outside companies such as HireVue to help them quickly conduct vast numbers of video interviews. With HireVue, businesses can pose pre-determined questions — often recorded by a hiring manager — that candidates answer on camera through a laptop or smartphone. Increasingly, those videos are then pored over by algorithms analyzing details such as words and grammar, facial expressions and the tonality of the job applicant’s voice, trying to determine what kinds of attributes a person may have. Based on this analysis, the algorithms will conclude whether the candidate is tenacious, resilient, or good at working on a team, for instance. Much has been written about the potential of AI to replace human jobs in the future, but the use of services like HireVue highlights a different concern: that AI can act as a gatekeeper for the jobs of today. Companies may not be ready to outsource vetting candidates for C-Suite and executive positions to algorithms, but the stakes are lower for entry-level roles and internships. That means some of today’s college students are effectively the guinea pigs for a largely unproven mechanism for evaluating applicants.  To make matters more complicated, there is little in the way of regulations or industry standards surrounding disclosure of technology usage -— though Illinois, for example, changed that with a recently-enacted law. So interviewees may not know when (or how) AI is analyzing their interview, and when it isn’t. That creates a sense of uncertainty for those trying to guide college students and new graduates through the interview process, and for the job seekers themselves. “It’s kind of the wild, wild west right now of interviewing,” said Matthew French, assistant director for employer relations at UNC Charlotte’s university career center. Sarah Ali, a Duke undergraduate student, has gone through about eight HireVue interviews with various companies for jobs and internships in fields like tech and marketing. Except for the first interview, which helped her snag a marketing internship, none of them led to a job. Even now, she’s unsure what role, if any, AI played in the process — a possibility she only contemplated after speaking with friends about it following the first one. Even though she landed the internship after that first interview, Ali said she would have done a lot of things differently had she known for sure AI was involved. She might have used key words or phrases that would be picked up by AI and also kept direct eye contact with the camera. “Once I understood the AI interview process, I definitely started thinking about it as a game and how I could optimize for certain qualities or gestures,” Ali said.  Why some companies turn to AI in interviews  HireVue may be the most well-known video interview company with nearly 800 companies as clients (including CNN, which does not use its AI features). It is used to interview about 1 million people every 90 days, according to HireVue CEO Kevin Parker. “We’ll interview probably a million college kids this year,” Parker told CNN Business. Parker said the Utah-based company began using AI in 2014 as a way to help companies sort through video interviews. He won’t say how many clients use AI assessments today, beyond noting that it’s a “smaller subset” of the companies it works with. HireVue highlights several of them on its website, including multiple Fortune 500 companies, such as Unilever. As with other companies like Yobs and Talview that offer AI-based assessments of video interviews, HireVue believes it can be helpful for ushering a massive number of people through the interview process quickly and reviewing them in a fair, consistent way.  Parker said its algorithms consider things such as word usage, pronouns and facial expressions to determine how likely a job candidate is to possess a specific attribute a client is looking for in a certain job, such as empathy or willingness to learn.  These AI assessments are often used for filling entry-level jobs because candidates don’t have a lot of work history. The goal, according to Parker, is that the AI can act as a way to evaluate abilities and talent. After an AI assessment is performed on an interview – video interviews can take roughly 20 to 25 minutes –  the client gets a report scoring the candidate on the attributes deemed key to the job. This, Parker said, gives the company offering the job an almost standardized-test-score view of the candidate, showing what they’re good at and how they stand relative to other candidates. A report can also be generated for the job candidate to give them feedback, but it’s up to the employer to share that. “We recommend that customers do it and I think it’s great feedback for the candidate, but it’s customer specific,” Parker said. It’s unclear how many companies do applicants the courtesy of taking this step.  “We don’t know what it’s looking for” For Meredith McCook, assistant director at the Duke career center, the rise of this kind of interview — via video, and possibly with AI in the background analyzing that video — has meant some changes to how she works with students. She’s often talking to students about the new ways technology may be part of the interview process, and coaching them to practice by doing things such as turning on their laptop’s video camera and spending time talking to it. Duke offers students online video interview practice sessions, too. “With AI, we don’t know what it’s looking for,” McCook said. But in case AI is analyzing the interview, she suggests students raise their laptop to be eye level with the camera so it appears they’re maintaining eye contact, even though there isn’t a human on the other side of the lens. At UNC Charlotte, French is trying to help students become more informed about when AI is being used. This year, he said, the school will be asking employers it partners with whether they use AI for their virtual interviews in hopes of getting some data on how widespread the practice is.  He remains troubled about the use of AI in the recruitment process, though. “Everyone makes snap judgments on students, on applicants, when first meeting them,” he said. “But what worries me about AI is AI can’t tell the heart of a person and the drive a person has.” Others like Stephen Roach, a career services consultant at Purdue’s center for career opportunities, sometimes take an almost dismissive approach when coaching students on dealing with a potential AI assessment. For example, he may tell them not to worry about it, since it’s outside their control. “If it is looking at their facial expressions or tone of voice, it might just be them being who they are,” he said. “They can’t know how that platform’s going to judge them.” These career counselors might soon have more tools to help students crack the black box. Interview prep platform Big Interview, which is used by more than 500 colleges and universities including Purdue and UNC Charlotte, is building its own AI system for scoring mock video interviews and giving would-be interviewees feedback. Big Interview cofounder and chief coach Pamela Skillings said the feedback will include details such as how quickly the person speaks and how much confident or negative language they use. The company plans to roll it out next month. The impetus for developing the tool, Skillings said, is from seeing people getting screened out after doing video interviews and feeling like they “deserve to know how they’re coming across.”   But does it even work? Regardless of how clued in candidates are to when and how AI evaluates their interviews, plenty of people encountering this kind of interview technology — from college career counselors to AI scholars to technology rights activists — are unconvinced it can really work. “When you start saying, ‘We’ll use things like cadence and facial animation and things of that nature,’ I’m really skeptical that there’s real validity there,” said Aaron Rieke, a managing director at technology rights nonprofit Upturn.

Now regulation has to catch up.by  Rebecca HeilweilJan 8, 2020, 7:30 PM ESTFacebookLinkPresident Donald Trump speaks while touring a computer manufacturing facility that produces Apple computers in Austin, Texas, on November 20, 2019. Mandel Ngan/Getty ImagesRebecca Heilweil covered emerging technology, artificial intelligence, and the supply chain.Artificial intelligence is here, and it’s impacting our lives in real ways — whether it’s the Alexa smart speaker on our nightstand, online customer service chatbots, or the smart replies Google drafts for our emails.But so far, the tech’s development has outpaced regulation. Now, government agencies are increasingly encountering AI-based tools, and they must figure out how to evaluate them. Take the Food and Drug Administration, which greenlights new medical products: It needs to review and approve new health care products that boast AI-capabilities — like this one that promises to detect eye problems related to diabetes — before they’re sold to us. Or consider the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which investigates employment discrimination. Today, the agency must also make decisions about AI-based hiring algorithms, like those that screen job candidates’ resumes and decide whether or not you deserve an interview.On Wednesday at CES, the prominent Las Vegas-based technology trade show, White House officials formally announced how the Office of Science and Technology wants federal agencies to approach regulating new artificial intelligence-based tools and the industries that develop the tech.The White House’s proposed AI guidance discusses some of the biggest concerns technologists, AI ethicists, and even some government officials have about the technology, but the guidelines are centered most on encouraging innovation in artificial intelligence and making sure regulations don’t “needlessly” get in the way.That reflects an ongoing problem for AI, one that’s already played out in other tech sectors, where a rush to innovate without much oversight has only come to back haunt us.While encouraging innovation in AI is certainly a consideration, critics of the technology have said that regulators must scrutinize artificial intelligence more closely as it continues to be rolled out in the real world. They argue that artificial intelligence can replicate, and even amplify, human biases. These tools often function in black boxes — meaning that they’re proprietary and operated by the companies that sell them — which makes it difficult for us to know when or how they might be harming real people (or if they even work as intended). And new AI-based tools can also raise concerns about privacy and surveillance.For now, these new guidelines are just that — guidelines — which means that today’s memo won’t have an immediate effect on the artificial intelligence tech you might encounter in your daily life. But the memo shows how the government is thinking about AI and its potential impact on Americans. “People should care that the White House is trying to bring a framework for assessing and justifying the deployment of AI tools, because what we’re finding as these tools develop and emerge is that there are some applications that have deeper consequences than others,” said Nicol Turner-Lee, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who researches technology and equity.The Trump administration wants a national AI effortTrump and his administration want the US to dominate the AI industry — and they definitely want the US to be better at AI than China. Early last year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the “American A.I. Initiative,” which is meant to jumpstart AI research and help build an AI-competent US workforce, among other goals, and directs agencies to prioritize the technology within their budgets.“Federal agencies must avoid ... needlessly hamper[ing] AI innovation and growth”Outlining 10 primary principles, today’s memo to federal departments and agencies echoes the goals of that executive order. It urges regulators to be mindful of innovation and to “consider ways to reduce barriers to the development and adoption” of AI when weighing how existing laws and potential new rules apply to the emerging technology.“Federal agencies must avoid regulatory or non-regulatory actions that needlessly hamper AI innovation and growth,” says the memo. “Agencies must avoid a precautionary approach that holds AI systems to such an impossibly high standard that society cannot enjoy their benefits.” At the same time, the guidance also urges regulators to be conscientious of values like transparency, risk management, fairness, and nondiscrimination.These are all fair points. By encouraging these federal departments and agencies to take action, the Trump administration also hopes to avoid a future in which American AI companies might face a patchwork of local and state regulation, or possibly overreaching federal regulation, that could impede the technology’s expansion.AI experts told Recode that the AI guidelines are a starting point. “It will take time to assess how effective these principles are in practice, and we will be watching closely,” said Rashida Richardson, the director of policy research at the AI Now Institute. “Establishing boundaries for the federal government and the private sector around AI technology will offer greater insight to those of us working in the accountability space.”Aaron Rieke, the managing director of the technology rights nonprofit Upturn, said in an email to Recode that, for now, he doesn’t think the memo will have much influence: “I do not think these principles will have much of an impact on the average person, especially in the short term. I think regulators will be able to justify their decisions, good or bad, without much effort.” Importantly, the memo doesn’t actually apply to artificial intelligence that the US government itself uses (of which there’s plenty). For instance, a search of a US federal contracts database shows that the Centers for Disease Control has purchased facial recognition products (an AI-based technology), while the Department of Commerce appears to be using AI to improve its patent search system.One of the reasons AI needs regulations: It comes with risksAI systems are not inherently objective. Humans build these tools, and AI is often developed using flawed or biased data, which means the technology can inherit or even magnify human biases like sexism and racism. For instance, when in 2017 scientists taught a computer program to learn the English language by mining the internet, it ultimately became prejudiced against women and black people.Critics say that risk means the government should aggressively regulate, and even ban, certain applications of artificial intelligence. And some AI tools, like facial recognition, that rely on collecting sensitive information, have also spurred concerns about how this tech could potentially create privacy and surveillance nightmares.“AI systems have a potential to discriminate against the American public on the basis of race, sex, gender — every sort of criteria imaginable”This all matters because AI already has the potential to have a real impact on your life, even if you haven’t realized it yet. Some landlords have floated requiring tenants to use facial recognition to enter their homes, even though the technology is known to be less accurate on people of color and women (and especially women with dark skin), among other groups. Another example: Though never used, a resume-screening algorithm produced by Amazon inadvertently discriminated against female applicants because it was trained on resumes the company had previously collected, which mostly came from men. Imagine losing out on your dream job because of a biased algorithm.“AI systems have a potential to discriminate against the American public on the basis of race, sex, gender — every sort of criteria imaginable,” Albert Fox Cahn, an attorney who leads the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told Recode. “This could impact everything from whether you get a job offer, whether you get approved for an apartment or a mortgage, whether you get the good interest rate or the bad interest rate. It could impact college admissions and school placement.”That’s left him disappointed with the new proposed guidelines. “Rather than provide a framework for regulators to actually address discrimination head-on, instead the White House is urging a hands-off approach which will allow AI to simply target historically marginalized communities without the interventions we need,” said Cahn. He said the memo’s references to values of nondiscrimination and transparency don’t have much force behind them. “When you think of where most consumers are more AI-vulnerable, it’s in those areas like housing, health care, and employment — the areas that primarily make the front page of the newspaper,” said Turner-Lee. She said it’s not clear what the memo will mean for agencies like the Department of Labor and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as compared to, say, the Department of Agriculture.She adds that it’s also not clear whether agencies are actually prepared to identify the risks AI tech poses, or if they’re up to the job of ensuring their regulations keep pace with innovation. “There’s a lot more of the devil in the details that I’d like to see, but I think they’re just trying to give us a general framework for some kind of ethical and fair deployment.”Now the White House wants feedback, including yoursThe draft guidance isn’t set in stone. For the next several months, it will be subject to public feedback, including yours (You can share your comments here). Once the guidance is formally approved, the White House expects that agencies will report back on how they plan to meet its new AI expectations.Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly implied that President Trump has not directed an increase in funding for AI.

It’s a new world that needs new skills. To many, that is an exciting prospect, because it speaks to progress. But the sheer speed, scope, and impact of technological change is also challenging businesses — and society at large — in fundamental ways. Last year, I crisscrossed the globe, talking to CEOs and other leaders about the workforce of the future and what to expect from it. Most agree in principle that the digital age will bring benefits — but they fear that neither they nor their people are ready.
They are right to be worried. One in three jobs is likely to be severely disrupted or to disappear in the next decade because of technological change. This disruption could affect almost half of all low-skilled jobs and one-third of semi-skilled jobs. The World Economic Forum estimates (pdf) that upskilling the 1.37 million workers in the U.S. whose jobs are currently threatened will cost US$34 billion — or $24,800 per person. Multiply that by 100 to include the rest of the world, and the sums become staggering.

Yet the cost of inaction will be worse. Already, there is a skills mismatch on a global scale, and millions of jobs are going unfilled. Unemployment is low, but so too is productivity. In many developed economies, and in particular in developing economies, it is not possible to recruit enough skilled people to fill the available jobs. But society cannot afford the digital divide between rich and poor to widen further.
People will also need to understand technology to be able to make better choices. Social fracturing is being exacerbated by digital media, causing many to question the credibility of information. The pressures of climate change and advances in energy technology and mobility will require new approaches to environmental sustainability. The growing use of surveillance devices is forcing a reconsideration of ethics and governance. And advances in genetic engineering and artificial intelligence are even raising questions about the nature of being human.
Upskilling solutions
In the face of these rising challenges, the only option is upskilling: helping members of the existing workforce, those currently excluded from it, those starting their working lives, and those in the next generation gain the knowledge and skills they need — and that society needs them to have — in the digital age. The good news is that workers are ready to take the plunge. PwC recently asked more than 22,000 people across the world whether they would upskill to be more employable: 77 percent said they would.

Most leaders agree in principle that the digital age will bring benefits — but they fear that neither they nor their people are ready.

By upskilling, we mean giving people the opportunity to gain the knowledge, tools, and abilities they need to use and understand advanced and ever-changing technologies in the workplace and their daily lives. Not everyone has to learn to code, but many people need to understand and manage artificial intelligence, data analytics, autonomous vehicles, and other technologies that can’t even be predicted — those emerging now and those that will be created in the future.
But upskilling is not simply a matter of teaching people how to use a new device. That device may be obsolete by the following year. It involves learning how to think, act, and thrive in a digital world in a way that is sustainable over time.
Each nation will need its own approach, and each will need to consider the demographics of its citizens, its level of tech maturity, and the makeup of its economy to develop its own upskilling solution. A territory with a developed economy, an aging population, and a strong service sector will have different priorities than a region with a developing, mostly rural economy and a population in which most people are under 30. For example, Luxembourg, Singapore, and Canada are preparing their workers by introducing incentives to help them learn new skills.

Living, learning, and working in the digital world



In 2019, many large corporations declared they would make serious investments in their people. Amazon, for example, announced a $700 million investment to upskill 100,000 workers. At PwC, we have always embraced new technology and innovation in our ways of working, including learning and development. In 2017, we started our own upskilling journey and devoted our attention to finding solutions that work. And in September 2019, we announced a $3 billion investment to upskill our people.
We support and encourage an employee-led approach to innovation because we’ve found that it is most effective to let people choose what they want to learn. We encourage our people to use their new skills to improve their jobs and their work with clients. Some of this learning takes place in classrooms, but most of it is carried out through self-paced multimedia and simulation game modules, or through projects in which teams learn by building and sharing new tools.

We’ll monitor what works and what doesn’t, and share our insights on our upskilling website. Our intention with this initiative is to encourage a multi-stakeholder approach, in which everyone involved in the upskilling journey can benefit from the initiatives that work best, and those benefits can be scaled and shared, wherever they lie. I know it is possible to motivate people to embrace new ways of working. I’ve seen it at PwC and helped other organizations implement a similar approach.
Technological change presents complex problems that will require decision makers — educators; national, regional, and local government administrators; and business leaders — to come together. Now it is time to build a movement, in which companies and communities around the world join together to create the next wave of human capability.

Cast your mind back a decade or so and consider how the future looked then. A public horizon of Obama-imbued “yes we can” and a high tide of hope and tolerance expressed in the London Olympics provides one narrative theme; underlying austerity-induced pressure another. Neither speaks directly to our current world of divisive partisan politics, toxic social media use, competing facts and readily believed fictions.
This should be instructive. The future is made, not discovered, and yet we are constantly confounded by the future as it becomes the present. What we believe, say, do, organise and vote for matter, but the world they matter to constantly eludes our grasp. We often stumble into futures we would rather avoid. Our ecological and climatological future represents one such horizon and whether and how we will work, another.
Organisations are also constantly trying to own the future by mapping out what it will mean for us. The “fourth industrial revolution” is the latest version of this. It is commonly defined as a combination of new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, natural language coding, robotics, sensors, cloud computing, nano-technology, 3D printing and the internet of things. According to proponents of the fourth industrial revolution, these technologies are set to transform the societies we live and the economies we work in. And apparently, this is likely to be well underway by 2030. 
It’s important to grasp, though, that the fourth industrial revolution is just a concept, an attempt to capture the meaning and significance of what seems to be occurring. The idea incites anxiety-inducing headlines regarding threats to employment and a general theme of positivity regarding the benefits of technology.



How many jobs will be affected?

A shiny future
The main proponents of the idea of a fourth industrial revolution are think tanks and consultancies working with modellers, economists and tech-experts (and of course technology companies themselves). This work provides the themes, insights and much of the analysis of data that informs current government policy in the form of industrial strategy. 
At the heart of this is the World Economic Forum’s work, spearheaded by its Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab, and that of the McKinsey Global Institute. The focus of both is weighted towards expressing the benefits of imminent transformations if we invest quickly and invest heavily. 
For example, imagine a world where your toilet bowl tells your fridge that your cholesterol is high. Your fridge, in turn, both adjusts your order for dairy products that week (delivered by automated vehicle or drone from a grocery warehouse) and sends an alert to the healthcare AI whose database monitors your cardiovascular system. This AI, in turn, liaises with your home hub chatbot facility (which rebukes you and suggests you cut down on fats and make more use of your home gym subscription) and, if deemed necessary, sets up a home visit or virtual reality appointment with your local nurse or doctor.
According to the fourth industrial revolution literature, this, like many other possibilities, is science fiction on the cusp of being science fact. It is a commercialised future, a cradle to grave system. A system that, apparently, may help us survive our profligate past and present since the fourth industrial revolution also promises a sustainable future, where a connected set of technologies creates the possibility of controlled energy and resource use, minimal waste creation and maximal recycling.   
But these think tanks and consultancies are hardly going to be held directly responsible for the future they help to produce. They are not sinister organisations, but nor are they neutral. The “fourth industrial revolution” is not simply an opportunity. It matters what kind of opportunity it is for whom, and under what terms. And this is discussed much more rarely.
A future for whom?
The emphasis on benefits and the focus on the need for investment subtly distracts from the core issue of who will own the basic infrastructure of our futures. Large corporations aim to control intellectual property for technologies that will influence every aspect of life.
At the same time, those writing about the fourth industrial revolution recognise that there might be what they call “technological unemployment”. Current claims regarding the likely rate of job displacement are mixed. Some research  claim between 30% and 50% of current forms of employment could disappear. Some suggests around 10% is more likely.
But the implicit message conveyed by corporations and consultancies, despite the fact that this will affect most sectors of society, is that “the future is coming and you’d better get used to it”. And government messaging and policy has tended to absorb this point of view. For government, the opportunities have been translated into a language of competitive threats: “If we do not do these things, others will.” This subtly focuses attention on inevitable economic consequences without providing scope to consider the broader social ramifications that might need to be managed.  
In the UK, for example, there is, as yet, no broad government initiative for public education, consultation and deliberation regarding a subject that may involve profound changes to our societies. Only the House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence has flagged this. The focus otherwise has been on “employability”. And the main emphasis has tended to be on individual responsibility. This assumes there will be jobs we can do if we retrain, enhance our human capital, compete with robot capital, and get used to collaborating with technologies. 
And yet fourth industrial revolution technologies could put the basic functional relations of a capitalist economy at risk. Waged labour is what allows consumption,  which in turn becomes profit for companies, which in turn maintains companies, wage labour, and the capacity to contribute taxes. If adoption of new technologies is rapid and pervasive, then the displacement of human workers may overwhelm the capacity of economies to provide alternative forms of work.
This is one extreme possibility, but it is one that current government policy is doing little to confront. At the moment, in the UK, only trade unions and some fringes of the Labour Party are thinking about the scope inherent in new technology for different kinds of societies that might liberate us from work. This must change.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



AI in recruitment
Numerous startups are leveraging AI and automation to streamline the recruitment process, including New York-based Fetcher, which crunches data to proactively headhunt new candidates; San Francisco’s Xor, which uses AI for recruitment and screening; and New York-based Pymetrics, which helps companies carry out candidate assessments through neuroscience games.
Phenom People claims some 300 clients around the world, including big-name customers such as Microsoft, which uses the Phenom People platform to power its career portal. “Microsoft is an excellent example of a leading technology organization working to revolutionize candidate experience through AI-driven experiences,” said Phenom People CEO and cofounder Mahe Bayireddi in an earlier statement. Other notable clients include Amazon-owned Audible and Whole Foods, Ford, General Motors, Hershey’s, and Philips.
With a fresh $30 million on top of the $29 million it has raised previously, Phenom People is well positioned to scale beyond its current 500-person head count and grow globally.
“Global organizations are shifting their spend from legacy singular HR tools to data-driven, intelligent talent experience platforms,” Bayireddi said. “Chief human resources officers can make an investment in a modern approach — connecting every interaction across the talent lifecycle for candidates, recruiters, employees, and management.”
How it works
Companies that integrate Phenom People’s technology can tap into AI-powered recommendations based on people’s skills, location, and interests, with natural language processing (NLP) used to surface positions by understanding what a candidate is looking for. This may involve correlating search terms with synonyms or highlighting other closely related fields. The system can also suggest job openings based on someone’s profile (e.g. if they have logged in with their LinkedIn credentials), search history, content that they click on, and more.
Alternatively, companies can adopt a more conversational approach, integrating a Phenom People chatbot that can field questions like whether a company currently has job openings in a certain locale. Phenom People launched its chatbot last January, and in the past year it has captured 20 million interactions while “getting smarter with every one,” according to Bayireddi.
“To help the chatbot learn and better personalize the talent experience, our customers feed it the information it craves, such as frequently asked questions and facts about the organization,” Bayireddi told VentureBeat.

For talent acquisition, Phenom People’s platform matches key information from job descriptions (e.g. required skills, experience, and education) with data from candidate profiles to establish the best matches.
However, the platform isn’t purely about helping companies add new faces to their workforce — it can also be used to help internal candidates plan a career path by surfacing potential promotions, garnering job referrals from their alumni network, and more.

On the recruitment side, AI is instrumental in matching skills and compatibility to help determine the best candidates for a role, while recruiters can also rediscover past candidates who may have fallen marginally short.
Above: Phenom People offers AI-guided candidate insights
Big data
Bayireddi noted that his company’s AI algorithms are powered by huge datasets incorporating 3 billion events annually and include a network of 100 million candidates, 8,000 recruiters, 2 million employees, and 20 million active job openings.
“These observations are turned into 10,000 markers, which are used to develop over 360 talent signals,” Bayireddi said. “These talent signals are key to making our platform’s AI real and impactful.”
“Talent signals” are essentially micro-insights based on current market conditions in recruitment and across industries. Network activity, which refers to internal signals generated from within Phenom People’s ecosystem, is also incorporated.
Using these types of markers, Phenom People promises companies the tools to personalize career sites, make job searches more intelligent, and give recruiters deeper insights based on big data.
“This allows candidates, recruiters, employees, and management to get the information they need — whether relevant jobs, data, or quality leads — to make smarter decisions faster,” Bayireddi concluded.

The robots are coming! It sounds like a tagline for a science fiction film, but we need only look as far as the retail industry to see the truth in this statement. Robots have been with us for a while in retail, and technology powered through AI and machine learning to incorporate the voice of the customer to transform how retailers make product and pricing decisions is something I’ve been advocating for years. Amazon and many retailers are operating robots behind the scenes to help with inventory management. Walmart is building its robot army as well, and according to this ABI Research release, the company deployed 350 systems for inventory management across its stores in 2019 alone. That’s an average of roughly one robot for each store.


As retailers look to trim costs and streamline operations, particularly along the supply chain, robots are only going to become more entrenched in retail’s day-to-day operations, taking on greater roles and interacting with employees and consumers alike as AI becomes smarter. By 2025, more than 150,000 mobile robots will be deployed in brick-and-mortar retail establishments, according to an estimation by ABI Research. And robots’ work will certainly not be limited to warehouses.

A New Breed of Robot

The newest models of robots are already getting upgrades, and are coming equipped with machine vision algorithms able to capture and analyze images and video and respond accordingly. New technology is enabling them to analyze and interpret unclean areas and clean by themselves, understand when customers enter the store and greet them, and take photos of new cartons, analyzing items in the box and moving them to the right shelves.

PROMOTED
At Walmart in particular, scanner robots are able to pinpoint locations where items are out-of-stock, send images to associates who use handheld devices, and also transmit that information to the fast unloader robots that are prioritizing which items get unloaded off trucks. The theory  is that when working in conjunction, robots make store associates more productive. Kroger plans to build as many as 20 automated grocery warehouses across the US where robots will help fulfill orders placed online. The company is also testing driverless robot delivery cars. Hundreds of stores by Giant Food Stores and Stop & Shop have deployed a pillar-shaped robot named Marty who travels the aisles looking for spills and runs price checks.
The plan is for robots to take over the mundane tasks and leave human employees open to doing more high-value jobs, like customer service. For example, instead of spending time finding items on store shelves, employees could interact with customers to teach them about new products and, ideally, boost sales.

Walmart spokesman Ragan Dickens told Digiday, “We don’t have any associates that just scan shelves; it’s a piece of what they do,” he said. “[Robots] reduce the amount of time they’re spending on repetitive, mundane work, and they can work with customers.”

Robot Ripple Effect
We can see the ripple effect of the robots by looking at Amazon, which has already been replacing low-skill warehouse workers with robots. Last spring, when Amazon announced new machines in several of its US warehouses that scan and box items to be sent to customers, it meant replacing at least 24 jobs at each location where they were installed, according to Reuters. If installed in all of Amazon's 55 US fulfillment centers, they could replace more than 1,300 employees, according to the article. Business Insider surmised that “Amazon's broader warehouse robotics usage could be part of a larger push to shift its logistics workforce out of the warehouse and into the last mile,” and referenced the company’s separate announcement that it would pay workers up to $10,000 each to quit their jobs and set up their own delivery businesses as part of its Delivery Service Partners program.

The idea is seeing tremendous traction already. Since it was announced June 28 of last year, tens of thousands of people have applied to the program and Amazon has put in an order for 20,000 Mercedes-Benz vans from German automaker Daimler, according to The Wall Street Journal. This is likely creating “openings” where even more robots can be backfilled.
According to Oliver Chen, Managing Director and senior equity research analyst covering retail and luxury goods at Cowen and Company, robots are well placed at the intersection of physical and digital, particularly with regards to curbside pickup. “In-store autonomous robots are new, and so scaling them accurately is a challenge. As curbside pickup becomes more popular, we have to figure out how to manage the volume in the store.” He goes on to note in his recent interview with RetailNext that with fully automated dispensaries, you don’t even need a person to bring out the groceries for pickup.”
My Robot Teammate
The reality of working side-by-side with robots may feel a little far-fetched to some in the industry, but it’s worth asking how human employees might react particularly as robots move toward more interpersonal relationships through AI.
A few years ago, researchers in Germany explored how people feel about having robots for colleagues, according to an article in Forbes. More than 60 percent of respondents said they could easily imagine being supported by a robotic colleague, with 21 percent even suggesting such a change would be an improvement, with this largely due to the belief that a robot would be less error prone and more predictable in its behavior.
But what about a robot boss? Here, too, we found some surprising results. The October 2019 Oracle and Future Workplace report surveyed more than 8,000 employees, managers, and human resources leaders from across 10 countries on AI and robots in the workplace.
According to the study in TechCrunch, while many employees noted they once feared AI would eliminate their jobs, once they realized AI (and robots) could actually help them conduct work more efficiently, their attitudes changed.
The number of employees using AI at work increased by nearly 20 percent over the past year, from 32 percent to 50 percent. And the study found that 64 percent of employees surveyed said they trust a robot more than their manager, with half turning to a robot instead of a supervisor for advice, as they felt that technology could better provide unbiased information (26 percent), maintain work schedules (34 percent), problem solve (29 percent), and manage a budget (26 percent).
Robots are even making their way into the hearts of employee workplaces. Take a look at this great story by BBC which highlights how people are developing a soft spot for robot colleagues, and holding ceremonies when they retire or are taken out of commission. 
The Robot Store Associate
At the end of the day, however, like everything in retail, new technologies won’t fly without customer buy-in, and that goes for robots on the showroom floor too. Customers who are having their first interactions with robots are still a little lukewarm on the idea overall. Let’s face it, consumers can be slow on the uptake with new technologies, such as mobile payments which are still only eking out traction every year. Even chatbots, virtual robots that answer questions in an automated way online, are not a fan favorite. 
According to Fast Company, 95 percent of consumers don’t want to talk to a robot when they are shopping, neither online nor in brick-and-mortar stores. And 66 percent of consumers find that chatbots are more damaging than helpful to the shopping experience. There was no reference to generation breakdown on this, so it’s hard to know exactly who was responding in this way, but with the rising Generation Z and the tech-savvy Millennials driving consumer demand these days, we should probably drill down further.
This research report found that Generation Z named robots as new technologies they’d like to see in retail, particularly for delivery and in-store assistance. The “Generation Z as Future Customers, 2027” report agrees, and notes Gen Z customers will be more comfortable with the idea of autonomous technologies and robots, given that they are the first generation to be born in the Internet and technology era.
Tim Brady, Manager of Deployment and Strategic Initiatives at Giant Food Stores believes starting to integrate robots now will better align him with the next generation of shopper when the time comes. “We don’t want to put [robots] in place just because it’s a robot. It has to provide benefit. As customers change, like Millennials and Generation Z, they want to see more technology, more kiosks, more tablets, more self-checkout, that kind of thing, so if we don’t leverage the technology that is out there now we’ll become irrelevant,” he told Grocery Dive. 
Wrangling the Robots
As AI becomes more sophisticated, it’s likely that very soon retailers will have to navigate regulations on how robots are and can be used. And this may slow how the retail industry is able to innovate using AI and robot technology.
Chris Harlow, Director of Product Development at Realtime Robotics, predicts that ""In the 2020s, the artificial intelligence and machine learning technology landscape will move from the 'Wild West' where almost anything goes to a more controlled regulatory environment. The introduction of mandatory legislation will inevitably slow down the pace of progress, and this will impact robotic automation. For example, AI and ML algorithms will face safety regulations, and this will hamper the speed of development of vision systems that are the key to AVs [autonomous vehicles] along with industrial robots taking on more complex tasks such as kitting or parcel sorting.""
For those of us who have watched too many Terminator movies, the evolution of AI and robotics into everyday lives may feel like early days of an impending apocalypse. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Robots are bringing efficiency and creating opportunities for their human counterparts to have more meaningful work that exercises humanity’s best skills – like drive, creativity and interpersonal relationships. And as consumer expectations continue to shift toward technology-driven experiences, retail has no real choice but to rise up to meet them. At least for now.

It further highlights that workers are looking at the increasing adoption of AI in the workplace as an opportunity to acquire new skills and deliver more strategic work for their organisation.“More employees, managers and HR leaders across the globe are welcoming AI in the workplace with love and optimism. The latest advancements in machine learning and AI are rapidly reaching mainstream, resulting in a massive shift in the way people across the world interact with technology and their teams,” said He.According to the study, 50% of workers used some form of AI at work in 2019 compared to only 32% the previous year.

Doctors say digital technology and data are driving change that will create a different world of medicine in the next couple of decades, a new report from Stanford Medicine finds.In a survey, physicians, residents and medical students say they expect almost a third of their current duties could be automated in 20 years. And doctors are preparing for that very different healthcare future now, according to the report (PDF).Nearly half of physicians (73%) and most medical students (73%) are seeking additional training in areas such as advanced statistics, genetic counseling, population health and coding. One-third are studying artificial intelligence, according to the national survey of more than 700 physicians, residents and medical students commissioned by Stanford Medicine to understand how changing trends will reach the doctor’s office and shape patient care.RELATED: What the trends at CES 2020 could mean for the future of digital health""We found that current and future physicians are not only open to new technologies but are actively seeking training in subjects such as data science to enhance care for their patients,"" said Lloyd Minor, M.D., dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, in a statement.""We are encouraged by these findings and the opportunity they present to improve patient outcomes. At the same time, we must be clear-eyed about the challenges that may stymie progress,” he said.RELATED: Meet Ballie, Samsung's new AI-powered robot execs call the 'next evolution of wellness'Key trends that are reshaping healthcare include a maturing digital health market, new health laws opening patient access to data and AI gaining regulatory traction for medical use.And the jury’s still out when it comes to whether the private industry’s foray into healthcare—in the form of companies such as Amazon, Google and Apple— will solve problems.Physicians, residents and students had mixed views about the impact these companies will have on healthcare, with 30% of students and residents and 21% of physicians still undecided. While patient outcomes are likely to improve, respondents are divided on whether physician effectiveness will improve and say physician job satisfaction will likely decrease, while healthcare costs likely increase.Other findings include:

The value of data. The survey also showed that providers are heavy digital users and they believe patient data from wearables can be clinically valuable. Nearly half the survey respondents wear a health monitoring device, and most of them use the data to inform their personal healthcare decisions (71% of physicians, 60% of students and residents). A majority of students and residents (78%) and physicians (80%) say self-reported data from a patient’s health app would be clinically valuable in supporting their care. They also see value in data from consumer genetic testing reports.RELATED: Study—Google AI can outdo the experts in finding breast cancerDoctors aren’t prepared to implement innovations. However, most providers don’t believe the current generation of practitioners is ready for the data-driven future, even current medical students and residents. When asked to rate the effectiveness of their education to prepare them for these developments, only 18% of current medical students and residents surveyed said that their education was “very helpful.” And 44% of physicians surveyed said their education was either “not very helpful” or “not helpful at all.”The report pointed to the need to modernize curriculum and training programs so current and future physicians can make the most of new technologies.The ongoing struggle with medical practice burdens. And, no surprise, physicians and residents say they are struggling under medical practice burdens. Nearly 1 in 5 would change their career path if given the opportunity, citing poor work-life balance and administrative burdens as the top reasons to reconsider their decision.

Both Microsoft’s Bill Gates New York Mayor Bill de Blasio have called for a tax on job-stealing robots, according to a Wall Street Journal tax policy reporter:  
A robot tax could serve multiple purposes, slowing job-destroying automation while raising revenue to supplement shrinking taxes paid by human workers. It could take a few different forms. Lawmakers could limit or slow down deductions for businesses that replace humans with robots, or they could hit businesses with levies equivalent to the payroll taxes paid by employers and employees.
Richard Rubin, “The ‘Robot Tax’ Debate Heats Up” at Wall Street Journal
The current employment  picture in the United States has been reasonably good (only 3.5% unemployment in 2019) so the proposed robot tax is just an idea at present. But a downturn could turn the idea into a cause.

Why wasn’t a tax  levied on innovations like the tractor or the word processor   in the past? Historically, new technology has not led to overall job loss because  the economic growth that results from labor-saving devices usually creates new jobs. 
Consider, for example, the small animal vet. At one time, vets generally attended to economically valuable livestock (working horses, beef and dairy cattle, etc.). Dogs and cats mostly lived and died without much veterinary attention. 
When tractors replaced heavy horses, displaced newly urban people turned to small companion animals. Eventually, their rising living standards meant that they could afford veterinary care for their pets. But that in turn required the training of large numbers of veterinary medicine practitioners and researchers to address the specific needs of dogs and cats in a science-based way. For example, feed companies had to research and develop formulas suited to small urban animals. Most of these jobs, which require considerable skill and training, would not exist if farming had not been mechanized. 
But, some worry, today might present a very different picture:
But what if the next wave of robots is different? What if robots aren’t like laptops or sewing machines or any other technology we’ve ever seen and they replace jobs without creating new ones?  “That’s the bazillion-dollar question,” says Shu-Yi Oei, a Boston College law professor. “Is this the same as the last manufacturing age? Or is it really something new?” There’s a real risk that the next wave of automation and artificial intelligence will displace workers and not create enough jobs, says Daron Acemoglu, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who co-wrote a recent study that found technology already contributing to slower employment growth.  Richard Rubin, “The ‘Robot Tax’ Debate Heats Up” at Wall Street Journal 

Business prof Jay Richards (right), author of The Human Advantage: The Future of American Work in an Age of Smart Machines, thinks that the “tax the robots” proposal is based on a fallacy. He told Mind Matters News, 
Although governments have to tax something to generate revenue, a targeted “robot tax” would be stupid. No doubt it would be sold as a way to prevent jobs from being lost to robots. But this assumes the “lump of labor” fallacy which treats innovation as a net destroyer of jobs (despite the testimony of, well, all of history).  Just imagine if our government had taxed earlier technological innovations because they threatened jobs. Does anyone think a targeted “tractor tax” would have been a good idea in the early twentieth century? It might have “preserved” some farm jobs in the short term. The long term cost would have been to prevent new and better jobs from emerging. It would have also made American agriculture disastrously uncompetitive on the global stage.  In fact, such a tax, if severe enough, might have changed the course of the twentieth century, including the outcome of the Second World War. As Henry Hazlitt wrote, the art of economics consists in tracing the unintended consequences of any act or policy. Economic policies are shaped by economic reality, not by the good but misguided intentions of policy makers. 
In any event, to cause widespread unemployment, robots would need to do two things at once: Take jobs that people now do and somehow prevent those people from developing new jobs that are harder to mechanize. It’s not clear how that would happen.  
It was easy to replace the draft horse with a tractor. The horse did not want a job and the driver, who did want a job, could go away and get one in the city. But it would be much harder to replace the small animal veterinarian with a “vetbot.” Jobs that require long-term relationships of trust and sharing probably can’t be automated and they are the most rewarding ones.

Cornerstone Acquires Clustree to Build Leading AI-Powered Skills Platform for People Development




With the acquisition of Clustree, Cornerstone will accelerate the development of the world’s largest skills engine to help organizations identify, develop and deploy their talent for the roles needed today and in the future






January 16, 2020 04:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSOD), a global leader in people development solutions, today announced it has acquired Clustree, a French technology company that developed an industry-leading, AI-powered skills engine and extensive skills ontology that is being used by leading global brands, including Carrefour and SNCF.


Founded in 2014, Clustree developed one of the world’s most sophisticated skills engines using machine learning and bias-free algorithms to help organizations match their employees’ skills with specific job roles. Clustree developed its skills ontology based on the consolidation of over 1 billion job skills across multiple languages into a library of 53,000 verified skills that accurately describe any employee profile from any industry.


Organizations rely on Clustree’s AI-driven skills engine and skills ontology to analyze their employee skill data to inform critical decisions regarding whom to hire, how to develop their employees, how to structure long-term workforce planning, and ultimately, how to close the pervasive skills gap that companies are experiencing worldwide.


“The future of work will require organizations and their people to continuously learn new skills to keep up with the pace of technology and fundamental industry shifts,” said Adam Miller, founder and CEO, Cornerstone. “In order to prepare for the future, organizations must have a grasp on the skills and capabilities their talent has today so they can identify skills gaps and start developing their talent for tomorrow.”


Over the next year, Cornerstone plans to integrate the Clustree skills engine and skills ontology into its portfolio of products that make up Cornerstone’s holistic People Development solution. The integration will enable Cornerstone clients and their people to:



Build a skills inventory. Organizations will have clear insight into their employees’ current skills and capabilities, enabling them to better match employees to specific roles and build more productive teams. Additionally, employees will have a better understanding of the specific skills and capabilities they have, as well as the specialized skills required for their job position.


Identify precise areas for growth and development. Based on employees’ current job positions and projected career paths, organizations and their people will be able to identify potential skills gaps and access personalized development opportunities within the flow of work, including relevant, modern learning content through Content Anytime.


Make more informed recruiting decisions. Organizations will be able to detect “hidden” skills in candidates’ resumes based on their previous job roles, credentials and accomplishments, enabling HR teams to better match candidates with open requisitions.



""We’ve dedicated the past five years to making skills the currency of work and helping organizations prepare for the future thanks to a very strong AI technology and product,” said Bénédicte de Raphélis Soissan, founder and CEO, Clustree. “By joining Cornerstone, we can now expand our footprint even larger and integrate our value proposition into a leading people development solution that is used by thousands of organizations around the world.”


Cornerstone agreed to acquire Clustree for approximately $18.5 million in an all-cash deal. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. More information about this acquisition will be shared during Cornerstone's next earnings announcement.

CV tips: How to showcase your skills as an AI specialist


                    by Laura Slingo
                
January 09, 2020







Laura Slingo, writer for TopCV, shares her advice on how to showcase your skills on your CV as an AI specialist.



The discussion about robots stealing jobs is not a new one. However, there is a new perspective to adopt. The development of technology - particularly artificial intelligence (AI) - has actually created jobs. LinkedIn’s 2020 Emerging Jobs Report supports this notion, revealing that 18 times more talent is working in this industry today than in 2015. What’s more, two-fifths of employers who have introduced AI and automation have witnessed job creation.
AI is set to radically transform the way we work, but it’s not all doom and gloom. AI is an industry with a wealth of job opportunities, from security and programming to customer service and public relations. Considering entering this field? Here’s how to showcase your skills on your CV as an AI specialist.
Highlight your soft skills
At its core, AI is technology that mimics cognitive function. That means for both the tech and the programmers themselves, learning, testing and problem solving are heavily involved in the day-to-day workflow.
So while the role of an AI specialist sits comfortably within the realm of computer science, soft skills are essential for successful candidates too.
On your CV, demonstrate your critical thinking abilities with examples of use. Show that you can analyse situations and make informed decisions. Highlight the ways you are adaptable yet critical, creative yet logical, by drawing on examples from previous roles to show that your personality is a fit for this industry.
Zoom in on your hard skills
There are a number of roles you could pursue as an AI specialist, and all require varying degrees of hard skills, whether they come from previous experience or education and development.

Common hard skills include fluency in computer programming languages, a background in programming or systems analysis, and an understanding of computer or cognitive science.
Therefore, you don’t necessarily need direct experience within AI to make a sideways move into the industry. Just make your selection of desirable skills clear on your CV - with examples of use - to display your level of competency.
Make your CV relevant to the role
It’s all very well tweaking and tailoring your CV so that it references sought-after skills related to AI specialist roles, but if you really want to impress, make your CV relevant to the specific job you’re applying for.
Go through the job spec, highlighter in hand, and identify the most important criteria to see if they align with your own abilities. Also, pay attention to the phrasing of certain skills and attributes - you may want to mirror these lines in your own CV to make it clear to the prospective employer that you’re a match.
Don’t forget your passion
Although AI has been around for decades, the professional field is still in its infancy. This means it’s an exciting time to pick up a position as an AI specialist as you’ll be at the forefront of its developments.
Displaying a little bit of passion in your CV goes a long way. Highlight your ambitions in your personal profile regarding not only what this opportunity could hold for you personally, but also what it will mean for your prospective employer and the future of the company if they give you a chance to fill this position.

This study looks at how to adapt to the threatJohn ArlidgeSunday January 12 2020, 12.01am GMT, The Sunday TimesGetting a grip: a robot installing a computer chip in a factoryGARN PHAKATHUNYA/ALAMYWhen we meet someone new, the first question we often ask is: “What do you do?” It reveals more about them than perhaps any other single piece of information and is unlikely to cause embarrassment since, in the western world at least, finding a job is, thankfully, not that hard for most. Unemployment in Britain and America is the lowest for a generation.The icebreakers we ask each other will soon change, says Daniel Susskind in this challenging book. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is replacing “human” jobs so fast that finding work will shortly be much harder for many of us. “Our age of security… [the age of labour] is fated to come to an end,” he declares.“Technological unemployment” has already struck travel agents and supermarket cashiers and will soon devour truck drivers, cabbies and couriers, before moving on to accountants, back-room lawyers and many more professionals who once loftily thought themselves safe from the robots. This list also includes journalists: a rising number of Bloomberg market reports are written by AI.But hang on. Every time a revolutionary form of technology has emerged, from the spinning jenny to the motor car, Luddites have protested that it will destroy jobs. But every time the Luddites have been proved wrong, because the new technology has created jobs that no one imagined could exist and boosted productivity and economic growth, which have driven up consumption, creating yet more jobs.This time, it really is different, Susskind argues. For two reasons. First, AI is getting better at tasks that could once only be performed by people — “task encroachment”, he calls it. Uniqlo has developed a robot that can neatly fold and pack T-shirts, a remarkably delicate skill for metal hands. Second, the AI revolution is happening so much faster than disruptions that have come before. This time a decade ago you didn’t bark orders at Alexa or Siri. You had to show your passport and your face to an immigration officer, not a machine, when you landed at an airport. And your car could not drive itself on the motorway, or park itself. By the end of this decade Uber plans to be driver-free in many American cities and contractors predict that many building sites will be free of human brickies.AdvertisementMany of Susskind’s arguments have been made before. What make his book stand out are his prescriptions for how society might well have to change to cope with the effects of vast un- and underemployment. The first step is to encourage our children to opt for non-routine jobs that require subjective judgments, often working with others, to answer “Why?” questions, which AI is bad at, not “What?” questions, which AI is good at.But not even that will be enough to stave off huge job losses. To cope, we will require a whole new kind of government: a “big state”. It will have to tax more heavily those of us lucky enough to remain in work and retain access to capital. Income tax rates could be as high as 70%. Governments across the world will have to find better ways to prevent big companies exploiting corporation tax loopholes.The extra tax revenue raised should be used to offer universal basic income to those without jobs, but only in return for an agreement that recipients will sign up to perform socially useful tasks, such as care-giving. Susskind acknowledges that many of these ideas sound fanciful now, to put it mildly, but he argues that the alternative — doing nothing or failing to prepare — is worse.Susskind is an Oxford economist, but he does not live in an ivory tower. He worked as a senior policy adviser in No 10, under Gordon Brown and David Cameron. That means he has an eye for a crowd-pleasing line. To show the value and pride we traditionally attach to getting a good job he recalls an old joke about a Jewish mother who is watching her adult son swim and fears he might be getting into difficulty. “Help! My son, the doctor, is drowning,” she cries.Susskind’s youth means that his language will be rather too politically correct for some readers. He does not use “he” or “he or she” when describing third parties, preferring instead “she”. But if his overall thesis is correct, this criticism is easily fixed. By the time the second edition of his book is published, a simple AI programme will allow users to choose between downloading the “woke” version or keeping the language old school.AdvertisementA World Without Work: Technology, Automation and How We Should Respond by Daniel SusskindAllen Lane £20 pp336CultureBooksRelated articlesTECHNOLOGYReview: The Globotics Upheaval: Globalisation, Robotics and the Future of Work by Richard Baldwin — this book might just save your life, and your children’sJanuary 13 2019, 12.01am GMTReview by John ArlidgeTECHNOLOGYReview: AIQ: How Artificial Intelligence Works and How We Can Harness Its Power for a Better World by Nick Polson and James Scott — why AI is a force for goodJune 03 2018, 12.01am BSTReview by James McConnachieSponsored",,A World Without Work by Daniel Susskind review — how to beat the work robots,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Culture', 'item': 'https://www.thetimes.com/undefined'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Books', 'item': 'https://www.thetimes.com/undefined'}]",,,Culture,https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fc61a2f1e-3209-11ea-81b4-81217bc4782e.jpg?crop=2667%2C1500%2C0%2C0,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'The Times & The Sunday Times', 'productID': 'thetimes.co.uk:basic'}",False,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.paywall-EAB47CFD'}",,,,,,7963ca7c-3222-11ea-81b4-81217bc4782e,,,,,

Levi Strauss Foundation StaffLevi Strauss & Co.
January 13, 2020

Ai-jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA), has spent more than two decades campaigning to improve working conditions and labor standards for domestic workers. But in the last few years her work—and her exceptional ability to connect rising movements together in service of advancing the lives of all women—has gained major national attention.
The Levi Strauss Foundation has been funding Ai-jen and her expanding work as part of our gender justice portfolio since early 2017, before her work with the Time’s Up and the #MeToo movement thrust her into the spotlight. Here, she shares thoughts about working to win rights for domestic workers and why she thinks women are about to change the future.
Q: How did you get into this work?
Ai-jen: I was raised by strong women that I thought were invincible. My grandmother was a nurse and my mom was a doctor, and they were both really oriented around service. Watching them handle everything and do everything, I assumed that women were always in charge. When I realized they weren’t, that disconnect felt really sharp for me. Later, in college, I worked the bilingual hotline at the New York Asian Women’s Center. Women would call at all hours of the night in crisis. Some calls related to  abusive relationships, but many of the calls were about the indignities and struggles of doing poverty-wage work. These women were working incredibly hard and were still not able to pay the bills and put food on the table. I thought there had to be a way to make these jobs better jobs—or to make sure these women had access to jobs that paid a family-sustaining wage. That’s what set me on this path.
Can you describe the challenges facing domestic workers in this country?
The caregiving and cleaning that happens in our homes behind closed doors has never really been recognized or properly valued in our society. Some of the first domestic workers in the U.S. were enslaved African women, and there’s always been an association with women of color and women of marginalized social status. Both because of who does this work and because of the nature of the work itself, it is culturally stigmatized and undervalued. Oftentimes it is not even referred to as work. It’s called “help,” even though it is a profession for millions of women. Domestic work is also largely invisible. You could walk into any neighborhood and not know which homes are domestic workplaces. The intimacy of being in somebody else’s home creates a power imbalance and a vulnerability to abuse. You might find a wonderful employer that you work with for years and it’s a beautiful and respectful relationship—but you also might find the other end of the spectrum. We’ve seen cases of rape and sexual assault and human trafficking and everything in between.
How did the National Domestic Workers Alliance form? 
I first started organizing domestic workers in the Asian community in New York in 1998, and in 2000 I was part of the founding ofDomestic Workers United as a multi-racial, New York City-wide organization for domestic workers. But the organizing we were doing was isolating and challenging. Organizers like me in cities around the country started reaching out to one another. We had our first national meeting in 2007. Fifty of us participated in that meeting, both domestic workers and organizers. Right then and there, we formed the National Domestic Workers Alliance. We felt the power and the potential of coming together and giving voice to the incredible heroism of this work.
You worked hard to ensure that domestic workers were a visible part of Time’s Up and #MeToo. Why?
Our work is very much a part of the same effort, which is to address a power imbalance that structures our economy and that values the lives and contributions of men over women. Women are 54 percent of the electorate, 51 percent of the population, more than half of the workforce, and a lot more than half of the consumer base. Yet we are still overrepresented in positions of vulnerability and abuse and underrepresented in positions of power and decision-making. Making sure that domestic workers were a part of Time’s Up and #MeToo was important, because if we can democratize the economy for the least visible working women, we can make it better for everyone. If domestic workers no longer have to worry about being completely vulnerable to harassment and assault as isolated workers working behind closed doors, if we can create enough voice and power and visibility for those workers, then the workforce will be better for all of us. We’re addressing the imbalance of power in the places where that imbalance is the sharpest.
What has the Levi Strauss Foundation’s funding of your movement enabled?
Their funding has been so critical in our ability to be agile and responsive in the last couple of years, especially in protecting vulnerable communities. In 2018, we formed Families Belong Together, an effort to mobilize hundreds of thousands of people in all 50 states to take action against the family separations happening at the border. It was because of our support from LSF that we were able to move quickly into action on that effort. And I just think the way that LSF invests in and trusts leaders is really important. It’s a real partnership, and like all strong relationships, we know they will respond and support us leaders when there’s a need. Their rapid response funding has been so critical in the last couple of years. The way they build relationships with organizations and leaders, and the way they fund so nimbly and responsively, is both rare and really needed right now.
There’s so much conversation these days about the “closing space” for civil society. But what you’re describing sounds like the opposite. 
This is the biggest opportunity we’ve had to update and strengthen our democracy in generations. The level of energy right now is off the charts, and it’s being driven by women. From the workers I talk to every day to new members of Congress and judges elected in 2018, to your everyday woman voter in the Heartland—all of these women I talk to want to do even more and they want to do it together. They want to connect with and learn from and lift up other women. One of the biggest things is that these women want is to work across race. They really want a multiracial future, and they’re willing to fight for it and build it together. Every woman organizer I know is asking themselves the same question right now, which is how do we harness the incredible activism of this moment? And that, to me, is so hopeful.

From the first striking of stones to produce fire to the making of metal works, man has struggled to tame technology or machine (Artificial Intelligence), if you please.

The invention of the computer only served to bring the battle closer home. There has always been the fear that one day the computer (machines) would among other things, take jobs, change the world and maybe even take over the world and rule man.

This fear has persisted.

A deep and often unspoken fear is that <em>the end is near when machines begin to think</em>. And thinking machines is precisely what artificial intelligence (AI) is all about. The emergence of thinking computers therefore only served to heighten that fear.

Consider when the World chess champion, Garry Kasparov, faced the first thinking machine, an IBM supercomputer called <em>Deep Blue</em>. The first match was played in Philadelphia in 1996 and won by Kasparov. The rematch was played in New York City in 1997 and won by Deep Blue. The 1997 match was the first defeat of a reigning world chess champion by a computer under tournament conditions. When Deep Blue took the match by winning the final game, Kasparov refused to believe it.

It was an epic moment. It sent shock waves around the world. Naturally, there were controversies. Some argued that everything was done to make the battleground comfortable for the machine, it was chilled to, like we say in Nigeria, mortuary temperature.

The truth be told, computer scientists had for decades viewed chess as a meter stick for artificial intelligence. Garry’s defeat, in many circles, meant that humans were entering the age of the machines.

Since that time, so much has happened. Computers have since grown so much more powerful. In fact, today, we have apps on our mobile phones that are far more powerful than Deep Blue. Thinking computers are everywhere. Welcome the age of Artificial Intelligence!

To understand what AI is and how it works, let’s hear the experts:

“AI is the use of intricate logic or advanced analytical methods to perform simple tasks at greater scale in ways that mean we can do more at large scale with the workers we have, allowing them to focus on what humans are best at, like handling complex exceptions or demonstrating sympathy.” <em>–Whit Andrews, vice president and distinguished analyst with Gartner Research</em>

“AI is a mathematical and algorithmic model that allows computers to learn to do tasks without being explicitly programmed to do those tasks.” <em>–Timothy Havens, the William and Gloria Jackson Associate Professor of Computer Systems in the </em><a href=""http://mtu.edu/computing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>College of Computing at Michigan Technological University</em></a><em> and director of the </em><a href=""http://mtu.edu/icc""><em>Institute of Computing and Cybersystems</em></a><em>.</em>

Today, AI is becoming more pervasive. It is already in use in several sectors, particularly the financial service and marketing spheres. Reports indicate that the demand for AI-enabled initiatives would continue to increase in the coming days.

It is interesting to note that AI is rapidly making its way into the workplace. Today it touches customer care, staff recruitment and consumer insights and marketing. Tomorrow, it would reach and cover more business segments.

In spite of this, mentioning AI in the workplace still produces fear – particularly for job security. Until recently, people predicted that the automation brought by AI would render many job functions redundant. Currently, thankfully, the fear that AI will lead to redundancy has reduced with experts re-evaluating their perspective.

The truth is that AI is not replacing jobs. On the contrary, reports show that it is targeting specific tasks, improving and making them easier and faster. According to PWC, “72% of business decision-makers consider AI as a key tool for allowing humans to focus on more meaningful work.” Precisely!

So, while AI will eliminate certain types of job, it would create others. It will limit some functions, expand others and definitely restructure some industries and realign others. Overall, there would be net job gain.

AI will bring good and bad. Individuals and businesses must explore how they can use it for good. Take advantage of its potential to improve productivity, boost capacity and increase revenue.

As Red Hat technologist Gordon Haff wrote, “AI projects in the past have often tried to boil the ocean - to solve multi-faceted problems like self-driving cars. Today’s enterprise AI projects are more practical, often focusing on customer experience pain points. “What’s happening with AI today is exciting in part because it involves practical solutions that address complexity, the need to handle more and more data, and demanding customers,” Haff noted.

Evidently, the use of AI in business will continue to grow. In its current iteration, AI is significantly more practical, more useful, and more impactful. Its definition as the technology that allows computers to do things that were once only the domain of humans, is proving truer each day. For example, computers have always been able to calculate, today, with AI, they can learn and draw conclusions.

AI is essentially a thinking machine. It thinks by learning and making deductions from the data available to it

To work, AI needs data. It consumes data in order to learn. Big data refers to the massive sets of data that are now available and to all intents and purposes suited for this purpose. These sets of data can be analyzed by machines. This can reveal patterns and trends, and facilitate making future predictions. With big data, AI is in its element.

It is no surprise therefore that AI and <a href=""https://www.brandcrunch.com.ng/2017/04/21/use-big-data-drive-smart-business-decision-making/"">Big Data</a> are already driving the provision of new, innovative and efficient services, particularly in the financial sector.

In Nigeria, some fintechs are already adopting AI and Big Data. Take Renmoney. With AI and big data, it has unprecedented customer insight so that it is able to assess and disburse loans much faster, deliver incredible and efficient customer experience and indeed broaden the scope of its operations.

In adopting AI, firms demonstrate their commitment to executing what is truly a data-driven strategy. AI will enable organisations to make optimal use of data. In the age of social media, data is everywhere. To be able to gather and harness it would be tremendous. AI is helping to create the business of the future.

The Final Rule adopts a four-factor balancing test and rejects various factors that have fueled recent litigation, e.g., a worker’s economic dependence on a potential joint employer, the potential employer’s business model, and its unexercised power over the worker.
Despite being the subject of intense debate and administrative focus, the DOL’s joint employment interpretation has not been subject to formal, substantive change in the 60 years since it was issued. In January 2016, however, then-WHD Administrator David Weil issued an Administrator’s Interpretation (“AI”) regarding joint employment under the FLSA. In the AI, Dr. Weil published a view that joint employment “should be defined expansively.” The AI focuses the inquiry, in part, on a worker’s economic dependence on the potential joint employer. This standard was intended to be “as broad as possible.” In June 2017, then-DOL Secretary Alexander Acosta withdrew the AI, which had grown to be seen by the business community as an over-expansion of the joint employment standard.
Four Factor Test
In the Final Rule, DOL specifies that, when an employee performs work for the employer that simultaneously benefits another person, that person will be considered a joint employer when that person is acting directly or indirectly in the interest of the employer in relation to the employee.
DOL adopts the four-factor test from its proposal. Thus, where an employee performs work for the employer that simultaneously benefits another individual or entity, the determination of whether the potential joint employer is directly or indirectly controlling the employee, looks to whether the potential joint employer: 

hires or fires the employee;
supervises and controls the employee’s work schedule or conditions of employment to a substantial degree;
determines the employee’s rate and method of payment; and
maintains the employee’s employment records. 

Actual control is necessary to establish joint employment. Standard contractual language reserving a right to act, for example, is alone insufficient for demonstrating joint employer status.
The Final Rule also specifically notes that an employee’s “economic dependence” on a potential joint employer does not determine whether it is a joint employer under the FLSA. In addition, the Final Rule sets forth several factors that do not make joint employer status more or less likely under the FLSA, including: 

operating as a franchisor or entering into a brand and supply agreement, or using a similar business model;
the potential joint employer’s contractual agreements with the employer requiring the employer to comply with its legal obligations or to meet certain standards to protect the health or safety of its employees or the public;
the potential joint employer’s contractual agreements with the employer requiring quality control standards to ensure the consistent quality of the work product, brand, or business reputation; and
the potential joint employer’s practice of providing the employer with a sample employee handbook, or other forms, allowing the employer to operate a business on its premises (including “store within a store” arrangements), offering an association health plan or association retirement plan to the employer or participating in such a plan with the employer, jointly participating in an apprenticeship program with the employer, or any other similar business practice. 

As was the case with the proposal, the Final Rule provides several examples applying the Department’s guidance for determining FLSA joint employer status in a variety of different factual situations.
The Final Rule is expected to be effective on March 16, 2020. 
Practical Pointers
When the Final Rule becomes effective, it will provide additional support to businesses claimed to be jointly and severally liable for unpaid wages alleged to be owed by workers who are not their own.  The Final Rule, however, should not be viewed as reason for businesses generally to be less cautious in the measures taken to avoid joint employer responsibility.  As a practical matter, for instance, the provision of handbooks, policies, and other materials to another employer’s employees will create less risk of imputing pay responsibilities beyond the direct employer; but additional safeguards such as disclaimers making clear that the provision of those materials does not create an employment relationship will remain prudent.
All of this said, the Final Rule creates an opportune moment for businesses to examine their relationships with the workers from whom they receive beneficial services but whom they do not employ directly.  The DOL’s new guidance provides a roadmap for further risk mitigating measures, though interpretations of joint employment under state wage and hour law need to be considered as well.
