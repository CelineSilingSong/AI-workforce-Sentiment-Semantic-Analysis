Nov 19, 2022–Oct 29, 2023. What would a machine dream about after seeing the collection of The Museum of Modern Art? For Unsupervised, artist Refik Anadol (b. 1985) uses artificial intelligence to interpret and transform more than 200 years of art at MoMA. Known for his groundbreaking media works and public installations, Anadol has created digital artworks that unfold in real time, continuously generating new and otherworldly forms that envelop viewers in a large-scale installation. Unsupervised is a meditation on technology, creativity, and modern art. Anadol trained a sophisticated machine-learning model to interpret the publicly available data of MoMA’s collection. As the model “walks” through its conception of this vast range of works, it reimagines the history of modern art and dreams about what might have been—and what might be to come. In turn, Anadol incorporates site-specific input from the environment of the Museum’s Gund Lobby—changes in light, movement, acoustics, and the weather outside—to affect the continuously shifting imagery and sound. AI is often used to classify, process, and generate realistic representations of the world. In contrast, Unsupervised is visionary: it explores fantasy, hallucination, and irrationality, creating an alternate understanding of art-making itself. The installation is based on works that are encoded on the blockchain, a distributed digital ledger, which stands as a public record of Anadol’s art. “I am trying to find ways to connect memories with the future,” the artist has said, “and to make the invisible visible.”","Refik Anadol: Unsupervised Exhibition.

However, little work has focused on ways to mitigate the harm discriminatory algorithms can cause in high-stakes settings such as medicine. In this study, we experimentally evaluated the impact biased AI recommendations have on emergency decisions, where participants respond to mental health crises by calling for either medical or police assistance. We recruited 438 clinicians and 516 non-experts to participate in our web-based experiment. We evaluated participant decision-making with and without advice from biased and unbiased AI systems. We also varied the style of the AI advice, framing it either as prescriptive recommendations or descriptive flags. Participant decisions are unbiased without AI advice. However, both clinicians and non-experts are influenced by prescriptive recommendations from a biased algorithm, choosing police help more often in emergencies involving African-American or Muslim men. Crucially, using descriptive flags rather than prescriptive recommendations allows respondents to retain their original, unbiased decision-making. Our work demonstrates the practical danger of using biased models in health contexts, and suggests that appropriately framing decision support can mitigate the effects of AI bias. These findings must be carefully considered in the many real-world clinical scenarios where inaccurate or biased models may be used to inform important decisions. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems that make decisions based on historical data are increasingly common in health care settings. However, many AI models exhibit problematic biases, as data often reflect human prejudices against minority groups. In this study, we used a web-based experiment to evaluate the impact biased models can have when used to inform human decisions. We found that though participants were not inherently biased, they were strongly influenced by advice from a biased model if it was offered prescriptively (i.e., “you should do X”). This adherence led their decisions to be biased against African-American and Muslims individuals. However, framing the same advice descriptively (i.e., without recommending a specific action) allowed participants to remain fair. These results demonstrate that though discriminatory AI can lead to poor outcomes for minority groups, appropriately framing advice can help mitigate its effects. Adam et al. evaluate the impact of biased AI recommendations on emergency decisions made by respondents to mental health crises. They find that descriptive rather than prescriptive recommendations made by the AI decision support system are more likely to lead to unbiased decision-making.","Mitigating the impact of biased artificial intelligence in emergency decision Prior research has shown that artificial intelligence (AI) systems often encode biases against minority subgroups.
