This article evaluates how developments in artificial intelligence (AI) — advanced, narrow applications in particular — are poised to influence military power and international politics. It describes how AI more closely resembles “enabling” technologies such as the combustion engine or electricity than a specific weapon. AI’s still-emerging developments make it harder to assess than many technological changes, especially since many of the organizational decisions about the adoption and uses of new technology that generally shape the impact of that technology are in their infancy. The article then explores the possibility that key drivers of AI development in the private sector could cause the rapid diffusion of military applications of AI, limiting first-mover advantages for innovators. Alternatively, given uncertainty about the technological trajectory of AI, it is also possible that military uses of AI will be harder to develop based on private-sector AI technologies than many expect, generating more potential first-mover advantages for existing powers such as China and the United States, as well as larger consequences for relative power if a country fails to adapt.

Smart marketers are developing, partnering to build, or integrating AI into their tech stacks to get better at what they do. To get started leveraging AI in your marketing efforts, it’s important to first confirm your policies regarding the handling of consumer data, transparency, and control. Consumers should be able to interact with connected devices — from web browsers to mobile phones to voice assistants — knowing that their data is being used in transparent ways, in a manner consistent with their preferences and expectations. Then, make sure that your data is actionable, for example by using a unique, common identifier for individual consumers across all of your company’s various channels and touchpoints. Finally, be sure to choose the right AI partner. Be sure to choose a partner that has true AI, not simply rules-based decisioning, which is impossible to scale for the volume of data and combinations of interactions that marketers are managing today. In addition, be sure to choose partners with real experience addressing your particular use cases and working with your existing technology partners. Finally, as with any vendor relationship, be sure to check on your partner’s ethical and philopshical approach to AI, as this is still an emerging technology that demands thoughtful guardrails to produce effective results in a responsible manner.","How Marketers Can Start Integrating AI in Their Work Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise for making marketing more intelligent, efficient, consumer-friendly, and, ultimately, more effective.
