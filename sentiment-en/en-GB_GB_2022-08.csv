Mueller works in the food industry, an industry that already faces high turnover. She recalls how her business decided to use TextRecruit, a service that reaches out to candidates via text message. 

Mueller also explains how her HR team utilized a chatbot named Dottie to interact with applicants via text. After some training, 'Dottie' became the official recruiter face of RPM Pizza. She was not only able to interact with possible candidates, but also conduct pre-screenings to narrow down the pool. AI-based HR technology like 'Dottie' can drive efficiency and ease the recruiting process.
