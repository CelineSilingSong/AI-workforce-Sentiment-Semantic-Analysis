But what exactly is this new technology and how is it going to impact your work? Whether you’re someone who’s been raised on tech or are just getting comfortable with it, here’s how to increase your chances of success in an AI-enhanced world. Make friends with AI. Today, there are tools on the market — or freely available on the internet — that allow just about anyone to integrate AI into their workflow. If you work (or are planning to work) in what is sometimes called the information economy — i.e., any role that involves creating, using, or exchanging information — you can leverage generative AI to get more done in a shorter amount of time and create more value for your organizations. Integrate AI in your daily work. Generative AI can automate manual and repetitive tasks, freeing up human resources for more complex and creative tasks. For example, AI can be your personal assistant — scheduling meetings, managing routine emails, organizing your calendar, and reviewing or approving work where you have supervisory responsibilities. Generative AI can also automate tasks such as interpreting complex data sets, identifying trends, and even predicting future outcomes based on historical data. Learn how to write strong prompts. Harnessing the power of generative AI models like ChatGPT involves more than just asking a question — it’s about crafting a prompt that guides the model towards a useful and relevant response. Start by assigning it a role, or giving it a job title. This helps in limiting the scope of the AI’s responses, ensuring it stays on topic. When using ChatGPT, for example, ask it to collaborate with you on a task, rather than telling it to do it for you. This prompt encourages a collaborative conversation, rather than a one-way command.","Boost Your Productivity with Generative AI With the emergence of tools like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and Google Bard, most of us have been left stunned by the power and potential of Generative AI. But what exactly is this new technology and how is it going to impact your work? Whether you’re someone who’s been raised on tech or are just getting comfortable with it, here’s how to increase your chances of success in an AI-enhanced world. Make friends with AI. Today, there are tools on the market — or freely available on the internet — that allow just about anyone to integrate AI into their workflow. If you work (or are planning to work) in what is sometimes called the information economy — i.e., any role that involves creating, using, or exchanging information — you can leverage generative AI to get more done in a shorter amount of time and create more value for your organizations. Integrate AI in your daily work. Generative AI can automate manual and repetitive tasks, freeing up human resources for more complex and creative tasks. For example, AI can be your personal assistant — scheduling meetings, managing routine emails, organizing your calendar, and reviewing or approving work where you have supervisory responsibilities. Generative AI can also automate tasks such as interpreting complex data sets, identifying trends, and even predicting future outcomes based on historical data. Learn how to write strong prompts. Harnessing the power of generative AI models like ChatGPT involves more than just asking a question — it’s about crafting a prompt that guides the model towards a useful and relevant response. Start by assigning it a role, or giving it a job title. This helps in limiting the scope of the AI’s responses, ensuring it stays on topic. When using ChatGPT, for example, ask it to collaborate with you on a task, rather than telling it to do it for you.

This study is based on qualitative methodology using PLS-Smart for the data analysis. Primary data was collected from 285 students from different universities in Pakistan and China. The purposive Sampling technique was used to draw the sample from the population. The data analysis findings show that AI significantly impacts the loss of human decision-making and makes humans lazy. It also impacts security and privacy. The findings show that 68.9% of laziness in humans, 68.6% in personal privacy and security issues, and 27.7% in the loss of decision-making are due to the impact of artificial intelligence in Pakistani and Chinese society. From this, it was observed that human laziness is the most affected area due to AI.
