Starting from writing assignments to submitting an important ppt for your company, AI is everywhere. But, is it really eating up all the job opportunities? 

AI is used for the benefits of humans, it's not here to replace them. But, a US survey says that 10% of US workers can lose their job due to the much interference of AI, and this problem is emerging exponentially to the lower class less educated people who are working for a very low salary. 

The report also says that 20% of employees are in jobs with 'high exposure', so the way they used to work can change due to the interference of AI

But, we have to understand the fact that AI can only make facts easier. If you see closely, AI can drive a car, AI can write articles and Ai can also generate big thesis papers. But, in order to fact check we have to take human help. 

Even if AI is driving the car there needs to be a real human behind it who is going to supervise it. Otherwise the AI can sometime glitch causing an accident. 

In cases of thesis papers a person has to check it before sharing it to the higher authority because, an AI lacks empathy and it lacks correct sentence structure. So to correct an AI generated text one human has to be there. 

Along with artificial intelligence a professional who knows the skills is also needed to excel in the work. As of now artificial intelligence can't manage people or raise the capital required to establish business.

So, to answer the question that is AI going to eat up all the job opportunities, the answer regarding the near future is no, a higher professional who knows everything has to be there to control the damage. Probably later in future AI can take up jobs but for now there is a lot of space for improvement.","Al Going To Eat Up Job?

Adaptation of this technology is becoming increasingly important in any country, particularly one developing artificial intelligence. In collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Robotics Association Nepal, and a myriad of local partners, The Asia Foundation held the “Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Prosperous Nepal” on March 3, emphasizing the future of work. The conference focused on the ethics, practicality, and developmental implications of AI for Nepal’s AI technology sector. National and international experts were in attendance to participate in critical discussions, present their research, work on AI and robotics, and deliver keynote speeches. Attendees explored various facets of AI, including its policy implications in relation to national development and its potential applications in the market. Breakout sessions featured presentations from tech experts on combating misinformation and disinformation. The final panel discussion focused on strategies to accelerate the Nepali innovation industry through AI. Following the conference, the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MoEST) delivered its resolution on the country’s AI policy framework. This framework will be shared with partner organizations, stakeholders, and participants for input. The Ministry aims to align the policy with national development goals to foster more innovation in various sectors with government support and existing frameworks that enable research to transform fields like healthcare. The resolution from MoEST stresses collaboration, capacity building, meaningful public service, and the integration of artificial intelligence into education, agriculture, and the industrial sector, among other things. It also emphasizes the necessity of continuous research and innovation to ensure Nepal stays ahead in the rapidly evolving field while also emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and data privacy in the development and implementation of AI technologies.","Future of Work in Nepal: Conference on Artificial Intelligence AI technology is rapidly expanding worldwide, whether in regular individuals’ lives, research, or advances in health and agriculture.

The workshop will provide participants with expert training in empirically based knowledge and skills of emotional intelligence. Participants develop their own emotional intelligence as part of the experiential training process that focuses on depth into the 4 abilities areas of EI (perception, facilitation, knowledge, and regulation of emotions). The workshop is applicable for psychologists, teachers, counselors, therapists, physicians, consultants, administrators, managers, organizational specialists, and other professionals who wish to enhance their professional work through the application of EI principles and strategies. The level 1 certificate provides a foundation in EI and enables participants to apply EI interventions in their respective disciplines.</p> <p>The one-day training includes two parts:<br /> <em><strong>Part 1. History, development, and current issues of EI</strong></em><strong><br /> </strong>This class will provide an overview and address current issues in EI. It will review the history and evolution of the concepts and present the major models (abilities, traits &amp; competencies). Current challenges with conceptualization and measurement will be reviewed.<br /> <em><strong></strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>Part 2. Developing EI abilities</strong></em><br /> This experiential lab class is designed to explore each of the four areas of the abilities model of EI. Participants will engage in experiential activities aimed to teach and to develop (a) emotional perception (b) emotional facilitation of thinking (c) emotional knowledge and (d) regulation of emotions. Development of these abilities will serve as a foundation for personal growth as well as for implementing EI strategies in professional settings.</p> <h4><strong>Workshop 2 | </strong><strong>Emotional Intelligence for Health Professionals</strong></h4> <p><strong>Facilitator:</strong> Chris Skinner, <em>Notre Dame University, Perth, Australia</em><em><br /> </em><strong>N.º of hours:</strong> 3.5 hours<br /> <strong>Date:</strong> 6 June 2024<br /> <strong>Language:</strong> English</p> <p><strong>REGISTER <a href='https://forms.office.com/e/qtiB1aVJ2X?origin=lprLink'>HERE</a>.</strong></p> <p><a href='http://conference.mercatura.pt/6thicei/login.php'></a><strong>Objectives</strong><br /> <em>1.
