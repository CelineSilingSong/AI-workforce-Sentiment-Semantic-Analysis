But what does that mean for the future of art and music? Violinist Hilary Hahn wants to make sure that artists have a say in the development and direction of artificial intelligence, and so she has teamed up with roboticist and AI specialist Carol Reiley to form an organization called <a href=""https://www.deepmusic.ai/"">DeepMusic.ai</a>. Its goal is to weave the artificial intelligence and arts communities together, so that the future of AI can be influenced by the vision and needs of artists.

I spoke with Hilary and Carol last week about their inspiration and vision for DeepMusic.ai - below is a video of our full conversation, which took place via Zoom, with Hilary in Massachusetts, Carol in Northern California and me in Pasadena, Calif.

On Tuesday night, Hilary performed the online world premiere of one of three pieces that DeepMusic.ai commissioned from composers Michael Abels, David Lang, and Dana Leong, who each wrote a piece with AI-assisted software programs. Hilary performed David Lang's ""out of body"" for solo violin.
