The benefits for employers have been significant, often providing a lifeline for business continuity during the lockdowns of the last year, but what about the impact on the employee? The rise of AI in the workplace has principally been discussed in the context of the gig economy, where workers are no longer directed by a human manager, but by an automated algorithm. Now, with the acceleration in the use of radical new technologies, AI is very much a feature of working life in general. However, while stories of robots replacing workers have (on the whole) not (as yet?) come true, the rise of algorithmic HR and management tools means that it’s the ‘bosses’ whose jobs risk to some extent becoming automated. AI in the workplace today AI technologies are already being used across a broad range of industries, at every stage in the employment cycle. From recruitment to dismissal, their use has significant implications for today’s workplaces - whether that workplace is a bank, an accountancy firm or a university. It is worth defining some of the terms in the context of the functions that AI performs: Algorithmic decision making (ADM) – this is where the AI - be it an algorithm or a software application (an “app”) - takes over the decision making in the employment relationship. That could be to manage a schedule or assign tasks. It might also be used in the recruitment process. For example, in algorithmic hiring, applicants could be asked to upload a video of themselves talking; yet no human being or HR manager will ever watch that video to make the decision as whether to hire them. Likewise, ADM has been used to make “high risk” decisions, such as analysing performance metrics to establish who should be promoted or Think of the scenario where a driver in the gig economy has a rating which goes below 4.5 out of 5 and then, one day, she tries to log on to the app and it no longer works. Machine learning - a machine is made “smart” by allowing the algorithms in the AI system to adapt by learning from correlations it finds in one data input (known as the “training set”) to make predictions relating to another data set. For instance, a hiring system trained on the data of a company’s historical employees might use this data to decide who to hire in the future. Profiling - machines can use “feature selection” to categorise employees by analysing known and inferred personal data about each person. This data, in turn, could be used to make predictions about individuals, such as the risk of them turning up late for work or whether they are likely to move to a competitor. As these functions show, algorithmic management is starting in some areas to replace – or, at the very least, augment - the exercise of a whole range of traditional employment functions. Algorithmic discrimination Where algorithms are used in place of human decision making, it is perhaps unsurprising that they sometimes risk replicating existing biases and inequalities in society. Consequently, unfair rules have been inadvertently hardcoded into AI systems, thereby resulting in discriminatory decisions: In March, Uber’s use of facial identification software in its app was inconsistent and inaccurate when it came to skin colour. This indirectly caused racial discrimination by denying the use of its app by drivers and couriers of non-White ethnicities (and therefore their access to work). Amazon’s hiring algorithm was ultimately scrapped after its machine learning system taught itself that male candidates were preferable. This sex discrimination was brought about by using data relating to Amazon’s top engineers (who were mainly men) as the “training set”. This resulted in CVs being discarded where they included the word “women’s”, (such as “women’s netball team captain”) and by giving low scores to graduates of all-women colleges. But even where the data has been “cleaned”, there are still legal traps which need to be avoided. For instance, one approach which computer scientists favour to avoid such biases, is to run a different algorithm for each subpopulation in a data set. However, this is the equivalent to saying that there should be one machine to score women and another machine to score men (or separate machines to score people of different ethnicities, for example). Computationally, this approach could be an elegant solution. Nevertheless, in employment law terms, the inconsistent application of criteria to people with different protected characteristics would fall foul of the Equality Act. This would make such a technological solution wholly unlawful – and ultimately unhelpful - as a starting point. Technological problems, legal solutions? The paradox of AI is that it expands its control over the workforce, while simultaneously diffusing accountability in the decision-making chain. An HR manager in charge of hiring workers will be subject to anti-discrimination duties in law. But who is held responsible when an AI tool, itself, introduces discrimination into the “hiring and firing” process?    An employee is unlikely to be able to claim for direct discrimination in such circumstances, as it is not possible to show any kind of intent on the part of the AI. As indirect discrimination is the only claim available, this opens up a space for justification for use of the AI. So, in the example of an automated hiring process, an employer might have a defence that its use of ADM is a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim (in this case, efficiently dealing with a very high number of applications for a given role). As such, there may be a risk that a claimant will not be able to enforce their right not to be discriminated against, wherever the employer can defer accountability to the AI system. As it currently stands, the law does allow employers to make decisions without human intervention, albeit these are in limited circumstances and require transparency, under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). The Trade Union Congress (TUC) (in conjunction with Robin Allen QC and Dee Masters of Cloisters Chambers) has argued for changes in the law, in its recently published report on the use of AI at work. This report sets out the TUC’s recommendations for better protection of workers against algorithmic discrimination, including: Re-evaluating existing legal structures, such as the Equality Act, to protect against “discrimination by algorithm”. This would include: “a complete and express reversal of the burden of proof in relation to “high risk” uses of AI or ADM systems, such that the employer must prove from the outset that discrimination has not occurred rather than the conventional burden of proof in discrimination claims where the claimant bears the initial burden.” “Red lines” beyond which the deployment of new technologies should not occur. Specifically, they argue that the use of AI and ADM in high-risk decisions should only be permitted where existing and potential employees and workers themselves can sensibly understand those decisions, be part of the decision-making process and satisfy themselves that the technology is being used in a way which is rational, accurate and non-discriminatory. AI registers to be made mandatory for employers to maintain and update regularly and for these registers to be accessible to employees, workers, and job applicants. Likewise, the government in its (much lambasted) race report, has made its own recommendations for improving the transparency of AI and ADM. This report calls for: Mandating the use of tools, such as Algorithmic Impact Assessments, that help raise fairness risks and detect and mitigate bias before, during, and after any system deployment; Placing a transparency obligation on all public sector organisations that apply algorithms with an impact on significant decisions that affect individuals; and Asking the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to issue guidance on the lawfulness of bias mitigation techniques, the collection of data to measure bias, and to clarify how to apply the Equality Act to ADM. Where next for the regulation of AI? So far AI has on the whole been developed and deployed with very little oversight. However, given the rapid rise in its reach and impact, we are starting to see a shift towards calls for greater restrictions and regulation. Perhaps not surprisingly (given its far-reaching approach to privacy in the GDPR), the EU appears to be leading the way on this front, with its recently published Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence. This is described as the first ever legal framework on AI, aimed at harnessing the opportunities and addressing the challenges of AI and positioning the EU to play a leading role globally on the issue. From a work perspective, the EU’s report states that any AI-systems involved in employment, worker management and self-employment (eg in recruitment, evaluation of performance, promotion and termination) should be classified as “high-risk”, and so subject to specific safeguards, “since those systems may appreciably impact future career prospects and livelihoods of these persons”. Proposed obligations include (from a provider point of view) ensuring human oversight of AI systems and focusing on the quality of the data used to teach the AI system, and (from a user point of view) following instructions on the use of AI systems, monitoring the functioning of the system and keeping records. The proposed sanctions for breach are significant, with fines of up to €20 million or 4 per cent of annual worldwide turnover. The rules are still in draft form and subject to a lengthy approvals process, so it is likely to take several years before anything comes into effect. Moreover, now that the UK has left the EU, the proposals will not be binding on the UK as and when they are implemented. Nevertheless, in publishing its proposals, the EU has sent a strong message about its intent to push for tighter extra-territorial oversight on how AI is used and it will be interesting to see how the UK, and indeed the rest of the world, respond. Even if the UK Government does not follow suit in introducing regulations of its own, it is worth noting that UK based entities creating or deploying AI in the EU will still need to follow whatever EU rules eventually come into force.  For more information, see our article on Artificial Intelligence: Analysing the EU’s new Regulation. What this means for employers In the absence of any clear guidance, employers should be live to the potential unintended consequences of any automated AI systems they use. This requires organisations to stay up to date with rapidly changing technological developments and, wherever such AI systems are implemented, to carefully consider how these might impact on fairness, accountability, and transparency in the workplace. The extent to which employers bear legal responsibility for any discriminatory decisions arising from such AI systems is currently unclear; but it is incumbent on employers to inform themselves of such issues. In other words, there is still very much a need to keep the ‘human’ in human resources decision-making.

The rise of AI in the workplace has principally been discussed in the context of the gig economy, where workers are no longer directed by a human manager, but by an automated algorithm.

However, while stories of robots replacing workers have (on the whole) not (as yet?) come true, the rise of algorithmic HR and management tools means that it’s the ‘bosses’ whose jobs risk to some extent becoming automated.
AI in the workplace today
AI technologies are already being used across a broad range of industries, at every stage in the employment cycle. From recruitment to dismissal, their use has significant implications for today’s workplaces - whether that workplace is a bank, an accountancy firm or a university.
It is worth defining some of the terms in the context of the functions that AI performs:

Algorithmic decision making (ADM) – this is where the AI - be it an algorithm or a software application (an “app”) - takes over the decision making in the employment relationship. That could be to manage a schedule or assign tasks. It might also be used in the recruitment process. For example, in algorithmic hiring, applicants could be asked to upload a video of themselves talking; yet no human being or HR manager will ever watch that video to make the decision as whether to hire them. Likewise, ADM has been used to make “high risk” decisions, such as analysing performance metrics to establish who should be promoted or Think of the scenario where a driver in the gig economy has a rating which goes below 4.5 out of 5 and then, one day, she tries to log on to the app and it no longer works.
Machine learning - a machine is made “smart” by allowing the algorithms in the AI system to adapt by learning from correlations it finds in one data input (known as the “training set”) to make predictions relating to another data set. For instance, a hiring system trained on the data of a company’s historical employees might use this data to decide who to hire in the future.
Profiling - machines can use “feature selection” to categorise employees by analysing known and inferred personal data about each person. This data, in turn, could be used to make predictions about individuals, such as the risk of them turning up late for work or whether they are likely to move to a competitor.

As these functions show, algorithmic management is starting in some areas to replace – or, at the very least, augment - the exercise of a whole range of traditional employment functions.
Algorithmic discrimination
Where algorithms are used in place of human decision making, it is perhaps unsurprising that they sometimes risk replicating existing biases and inequalities in society. Consequently, unfair rules have been inadvertently hardcoded into AI systems, thereby resulting in discriminatory decisions:

In March, Uber’s use of facial identification software in its app was inconsistent and inaccurate when it came to skin colour. This indirectly caused racial discrimination by denying the use of its app by drivers and couriers of non-White ethnicities (and therefore their access to work).
Amazon’s hiring algorithm was ultimately scrapped after its machine learning system taught itself that male candidates were preferable. This sex discrimination was brought about by using data relating to Amazon’s top engineers (who were mainly men) as the “training set”. This resulted in CVs being discarded where they included the word “women’s”, (such as “women’s netball team captain”) and by giving low scores to graduates of all-women colleges.

But even where the data has been “cleaned”, there are still legal traps which need to be avoided. For instance, one approach which computer scientists favour to avoid such biases, is to run a different algorithm for each subpopulation in a data set. However, this is the equivalent to saying that there should be one machine to score women and another machine to score men (or separate machines to score people of different ethnicities, for example). Computationally, this approach could be an elegant solution. Nevertheless, in employment law terms, the inconsistent application of criteria to people with different protected characteristics would fall foul of the Equality Act. This would make such a technological solution wholly unlawful – and ultimately unhelpful - as a starting point.
Technological problems, legal solutions?
The paradox of AI is that it expands its control over the workforce, while simultaneously diffusing accountability in the decision-making chain. An HR manager in charge of hiring workers will be subject to anti-discrimination duties in law. But who is held responsible when an AI tool, itself, introduces discrimination into the “hiring and firing” process?   
An employee is unlikely to be able to claim for direct discrimination in such circumstances, as it is not possible to show any kind of intent on the part of the AI. As indirect discrimination is the only claim available, this opens up a space for justification for use of the AI. So, in the example of an automated hiring process, an employer might have a defence that its use of ADM is a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim (in this case, efficiently dealing with a very high number of applications for a given role). As such, there may be a risk that a claimant will not be able to enforce their right not to be discriminated against, wherever the employer can defer accountability to the AI system.
As it currently stands, the law does allow employers to make decisions without human intervention, albeit these are in limited circumstances and require transparency, under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). The Trade Union Congress (TUC) (in conjunction with Robin Allen QC and Dee Masters of Cloisters Chambers) has argued for changes in the law, in its recently published report on the use of AI at work. This report sets out the TUC’s recommendations for better protection of workers against algorithmic discrimination, including:

Re-evaluating existing legal structures, such as the Equality Act, to protect against “discrimination by algorithm”. This would include: “a complete and express reversal of the burden of proof in relation to “high risk” uses of AI or ADM systems, such that the employer must prove from the outset that discrimination has not occurred rather than the conventional burden of proof in discrimination claims where the claimant bears the initial burden.”
“Red lines” beyond which the deployment of new technologies should not occur. Specifically, they argue that the use of AI and ADM in high-risk decisions should only be permitted where existing and potential employees and workers themselves can sensibly understand those decisions, be part of the decision-making process and satisfy themselves that the technology is being used in a way which is rational, accurate and non-discriminatory.
AI registers to be made mandatory for employers to maintain and update regularly and for these registers to be accessible to employees, workers, and job applicants.

Likewise, the government in its (much lambasted) race report, has made its own recommendations for improving the transparency of AI and ADM. This report calls for:

Mandating the use of tools, such as Algorithmic Impact Assessments, that help raise fairness risks and detect and mitigate bias before, during, and after any system deployment;
Placing a transparency obligation on all public sector organisations that apply algorithms with an impact on significant decisions that affect individuals; and
Asking the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to issue guidance on the lawfulness of bias mitigation techniques, the collection of data to measure bias, and to clarify how to apply the Equality Act to ADM.

Where next for the regulation of AI?
So far AI has on the whole been developed and deployed with very little oversight. However, given the rapid rise in its reach and impact, we are starting to see a shift towards calls for greater restrictions and regulation. Perhaps not surprisingly (given its far-reaching approach to privacy in the GDPR), the EU appears to be leading the way on this front, with its recently published Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence. This is described as the first ever legal framework on AI, aimed at harnessing the opportunities and addressing the challenges of AI and positioning the EU to play a leading role globally on the issue.
From a work perspective, the EU’s report states that any AI-systems involved in employment, worker management and self-employment (eg in recruitment, evaluation of performance, promotion and termination) should be classified as “high-risk”, and so subject to specific safeguards, “since those systems may appreciably impact future career prospects and livelihoods of these persons”. Proposed obligations include (from a provider point of view) ensuring human oversight of AI systems and focusing on the quality of the data used to teach the AI system, and (from a user point of view) following instructions on the use of AI systems, monitoring the functioning of the system and keeping records. The proposed sanctions for breach are significant, with fines of up to €20 million or 4 per cent of annual worldwide turnover.
The rules are still in draft form and subject to a lengthy approvals process, so it is likely to take several years before anything comes into effect. Moreover, now that the UK has left the EU, the proposals will not be binding on the UK as and when they are implemented. Nevertheless, in publishing its proposals, the EU has sent a strong message about its intent to push for tighter extra-territorial oversight on how AI is used and it will be interesting to see how the UK, and indeed the rest of the world, respond. Even if the UK Government does not follow suit in introducing regulations of its own, it is worth noting that UK based entities creating or deploying AI in the EU will still need to follow whatever EU rules eventually come into force.

What this means for employers
In the absence of any clear guidance, employers should be live to the potential unintended consequences of any automated AI systems they use. This requires organisations to stay up to date with rapidly changing technological developments and, wherever such AI systems are implemented, to carefully consider how these might impact on fairness, accountability, and transparency in the workplace.
The extent to which employers bear legal responsibility for any discriminatory decisions arising from such AI systems is currently unclear; but it is incumbent on employers to inform themselves of such issues. In other words, there is still very much a need to keep the ‘human’ in human resources decision-making.

But Big Tech companies want you to believe otherwise.By Kate CrawfordApril 27, 2021ShareSave At a remote outpost in the mountainous highlands of Papua New Guinea, a young American psychologist named Paul Ekman arrived with a collection of flash cards and a new theory. It was 1967, and Ekman had heard that the Fore people of Okapa were so isolated from the wider world that they would be his ideal test subjects.Like Western researchers before him, Ekman had come to Papua New Guinea to extract data from the indigenous community. He was gathering evidence to bolster a controversial hypothesis: that all humans exhibit a small number of universal emotions, or affects, that are innate and the same all over the world. For more than half a century, this claim has remained contentious, disputed among psychologists, anthropologists, and technologists. Nonetheless, it became a seed for a growing market that will be worth an estimated $56 billion by 2024. This is the story of how affect recognition came to be part of the artificial-intelligence industry, and the problems that presents.When Ekman arrived in the tropics of Okapa, he ran experiments to assess how the Fore recognized emotions. Because the Fore had minimal contact with Westerners and mass media, Ekman had theorized that their recognition and display of core expressions would prove that such expressions were universal. His method was simple. He would show them flash cards of facial expressions and see if they described the emotion as he did. In Ekman’s own words, “All I was doing was showing funny pictures.” But Ekman had no training in Fore history, language, culture, or politics. His attempts to conduct his flash-card experiments using translators floundered; he and his subjects were exhausted by the process, which he described as like pulling teeth. Ekman left Papua New Guinea, frustrated by his first attempt at cross-cultural research on emotional expression. But this would be just the beginning.This article is adapted from Crawford’s recent book.Today affect-recognition tools can be found in national-security systems and at airports, in education and hiring start-ups, in software that purports to detect psychiatric illness and policing programs that claim to predict violence. The claim that a person’s interior state can be accurately assessed by analyzing that person’s face is premised on shaky evidence. A 2019 systematic review of the scientific literature on inferring emotions from facial movements, led by the psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett, found there is no reliable evidence that you can accurately predict someone’s emotional state in this manner. “It is not possible to confidently infer happiness from a smile, anger from a scowl, or sadness from a frown, as much of current technology tries to do when applying what are mistakenly believed to be the scientific facts,” the study concludes. So why has the idea that there is a small set of universal emotions, readily interpreted from a person’s face, become so accepted in the AI field?To understand that requires tracing the complex history and incentives behind how these ideas developed, long before AI emotion-detection tools were built into the infrastructure of everyday life.The idea of automated affect recognition is as compelling as it is lucrative. Technology companies have captured immense volumes of surface-level imagery of human expressions—including billions of Instagram selfies, Pinterest portraits, TikTok videos, and Flickr photos. Much like facial recognition, affect recognition has become part of the core infrastructure of many platforms, from the biggest tech companies to small start-ups.Whereas facial recognition attempts to identify a particular individual, affect recognition aims to detect and classify emotions by analyzing any face. These systems already influence how people behave and how social institutions operate, despite a lack of substantial scientific evidence that they work. Automated affect-detection systems are now widely deployed, particularly in hiring. The AI hiring company HireVue, which can list Goldman Sachs, Intel, and Unilever among its clients, uses machine learning to infer people’s suitability for a job. In 2014, the company launched its AI system to extract microexpressions, tone of voice, and other variables from video job interviews, which it used to compare job applicants against a company’s top performers. After considerable criticism from scholars and civil-rights groups, it dropped facial analysis in 2021, but kept vocal tone as an assessment criterion. In January 2016, Apple acquired the start-up Emotient, which claimed to have produced software capable of detecting emotions from images of faces. Perhaps the largest of these start-ups is Affectiva, a company based in Boston that emerged from academic work done at MIT.Affectiva has coded a variety of emotion-related applications, primarily using deep-learning techniques. These approaches include detecting distracted and “risky” drivers on roads and measuring consumers’ emotional responses to advertising. The company has built what it calls the world’s largest emotion database, made up of more than 10 million people’s expressions from 87 countries. Its monumental collection of videos was hand-labeled by crowdworkers based primarily in Cairo.Outside the start-up sector, AI giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM have all designed systems for emotion detection. Microsoft offers perceived emotion detection in its Face API, identifying “anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise,” while Amazon’s Rekognition tool similarly proclaims that it can identify what it characterizes as “all seven emotions” and “measure how these things change over time, such as constructing a timeline of the emotions of an actor.”Emotion-recognition systems share a similar set of blueprints and founding assumptions: that there is a small number of distinct and universal emotional categories, that we involuntarily reveal these emotions on our faces, and that they can be detected by machines. These articles of faith are so accepted in some fields that it can seem strange even to notice them, let alone question them. But if we look at how emotions came to be taxonomized—neatly ordered and labeled—we see that questions lie in wait at every corner.Ekman’s research began with a fortunate encounter with Silvan Tomkins, then an established psychologist at Princeton who had published the first volume of his magnum opus, Affect Imagery Consciousness, in 1962. Tomkins’s work on affect had a huge influence on Ekman, who devoted much of his career to studying its implications. One aspect in particular played an outsize role: the idea that if affects are an innate set of evolutionary responses, they would be universal and thus recognizable across cultures. This desire for universality has an important bearing on why this theory is widely applied in AI emotion-recognition systems today. The theory could be applied everywhere, a simplification of complexity that was easily replicable at scale.In the introduction to Affect Imagery Consciousness, Tomkins framed his theory of biologically based universal affects as one addressing an acute crisis of human sovereignty. He was challenging the development of behaviorism and psychoanalysis, two schools of thought that he believed treated consciousness as a mere by-product that was in service to other forces. He noted that human consciousness had “been challenged and reduced again and again, first by Copernicus”—who displaced man from the center of the universe—“then by Darwin”—whose theory of evolution shattered the idea that humans were created in the image of a Christian God—“and most of all by Freud”—who decentered human consciousness and reason as the driving forces behind our motivations. Tomkins continued, “The paradox of maximal control over nature and minimal control over human nature is in part a derivative of the neglect of the role of consciousness as a control mechanism.” To put it simply, consciousness tells us little about why we feel and act the way we do. This is a crucial claim for all sorts of later applications of affect theory, which stress the inability of humans to recognize both the feeling and the expression of affects. If we as humans are incapable of truly detecting what we are feeling, then perhaps AI systems can do it for us?Tomkins’s theory of affects was his way to address the problem of human motivation. He argued that motivation was governed by two systems: affects and drives. Tomkins proposed that drives tend to be closely associated with immediate biological needs, such as hunger and thirst. They are instrumental; the pain of hunger can be remedied with food. But the primary system governing human motivation and behavior is that of affects, involving positive and negative feelings. Affects, which play the most important role in human motivation, amplify drive signals, but they are much more complex. For example, it is difficult to know the precise causes that lead a baby to cry, expressing the distress-anguish affect.How can we know anything about a system in which the connections between cause and effect, stimulus and response, are so tenuous and uncertain? Tomkins proposed an answer: “The primary affects . . . seem to be innately related in a one-to-one fashion with an organ system which is extraordinarily visible”—namely, the face. He found precedents for this emphasis on facial expression in two works published in the 19th century: Charles Darwin’s The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, from 1872, and an obscure volume by the French neurologist Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne de Boulogne from 1862.Tomkins assumed that the facial display of affects was a universal human trait. “Affects,” Tomkins believed, “are sets of muscle, vascular, and glandular responses located in the face and also widely distributed through the body, which generate sensory feedback . . . These organized sets of responses are triggered at subcortical centers where specific ‘programs’ for each distinct affect are stored”—a very early use of a computational metaphor for a human system. But Tomkins acknowledged that the interpretation of affective displays depends on individual, social, and cultural factors. He admitted that there were very different “dialects” of facial language in different societies. Even the forefather of affect research raised the possibility that interpreting facial displays depends on social and cultural context.Given that facial expressions are culturally variable, using them to train machine-learning systems would inevitably mix together all sorts of different contexts, signals, and expectations. The problem for Ekman, and later for the field of computer vision, was how to reconcile these tensions.During the mid-1960s, opportunity knocked at Ekman’s door in the form of a large grant from what is now called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research arm of the Department of Defense. DARPA’s sizable financial support allowed Ekman to begin his first studies to prove universality in facial expression. In general, these studies followed a design that would be copied in early AI labs. He largely duplicated Tomkins’s methods, even using Tomkins’s photographs to test subjects from Chile, Argentina, Brazil, the United States, and Japan. Subjects were presented with photographs of posed facial expressions, selected by the designers as exemplifying or expressing a particularly “pure” affect, such as fear, surprise, anger, happiness, sadness, and disgust. Subjects were then asked to choose among these affect categories and label the posed image. The analysis measured the degree to which the labels chosen by subjects correlated with those chosen by the designers.From the start, the methodology had problems. Ekman’s forced-choice response format would be later criticized for alerting subjects to the connections that designers had already made between facial expressions and emotions. Further, the fact that these emotions were faked would raise questions about the validity of the results.The idea that interior states can be reliably inferred from external signs has a long history. It stems in part from the history of physiognomy, which was premised on studying a person’s facial features for indications of his character. Aristotle believed that “it is possible to judge men’s character from their physical appearance . . . for it has been assumed that body and soul are affected together.” The Greeks also used physiognomy as an early form of racial classification, applied to “the genus man itself, dividing him into races, in so far as they differ in appearance and in character (for instance Egyptians, Thracians, and Scythians).”Physiognomy in Western culture reached a high point during the 18th and 19th centuries, when it was seen as part of the anatomical sciences. A key figure in this tradition was the Swiss pastor Johann Kaspar Lavater, who wrote Essays on Physiognomy: For the Promotion of Knowledge and the Love of Mankind, originally published in German in 1789. Lavater took the approaches of physiognomy and blended them with the latest scientific knowledge. He believed that bone structure was an underlying connection between physical appearance and character type. If facial expressions were fleeting, skulls seemed to offer a more solid material for physiognomic inferences. Skull measurement was a popular technique in race science, and was used to support nationalism, white supremacy, and xenophobia. This work was infamously elaborated on throughout the 19th century by phrenologists such as Franz Joseph Gall and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim, as well as in scientific criminology through the work of Cesare Lombroso.But it was the French neurologist Duchenne, described by Ekman as a “marvelously gifted observer,” who codified the use of photography and other technical means in the study of human faces. In Mécanisme de la physionomie humaine, Duchenne laid important foundations for both Darwin and Ekman, connecting older ideas from physiognomy and phrenology with more modern investigations into physiology and psychology. He replaced vague assertions about character with a more limited investigation into expression and interior mental and emotional states.Duchenne worked in Paris at the Salpêtrière asylum, which housed up to 5,000 people with a wide range of mental illnesses and neurological conditions. Some would become his subjects for distressing experiments, part of the long tradition of medical and technological experimentation on the most vulnerable, those who cannot refuse. Duchenne, who was little known in the scientific community, decided to develop techniques of electrical shocks to stimulate isolated muscle movements in people’s faces. His aim was to build a more complete anatomical and physiological understanding of the face. Duchenne used these methods to bridge the new psychological science and the much older study of physiognomic signs, or passions. He relied on the latest photographic advancements, such as collodion processing, which allowed for much shorter exposure times, enabling Duchenne to freeze fleeting muscular movements and facial expressions in images.Even at these early stages, the faces were never natural or socially occurring human expressions but simulations produced by the brute application of electricity to the muscles. Regardless, Duchenne believed that the use of photography and other technical systems would transform the squishy business of representation into something objective and evidentiary, more suitable for scientific study. Darwin praised Duchenne’s “magnificent photographs” and included reproductions in his own work.Plates from Mécanisme de la physionomie humaine. (U.S. National Library of Medicine)Ekman would follow Duchenne in placing photography at the center of his experimental practice. He believed that slow-motion photography was essential to his approach, because many facial expressions operate at the limits of human perception. The aim was to find so-called microexpressions—tiny muscle movements in the face.One of Ekman’s ambitious plans in his early research was to codify a system for detecting and analyzing facial expressions. In 1971, he co-published a description of what he called the Facial Affect Scoring Technique (FAST).Relying on posed photographs, the approach used six basic emotional types largely derived from Ekman’s intuitions. But FAST soon ran into problems when other scientists encountered facial expressions not included in its typology. So Ekman decided to ground his next measurement tool in facial musculature, harkening back to Duchenne’s original electroshock studies. Ekman identified roughly 40 distinct muscular contractions on the face and called the basic components of each facial expression an “action unit.” After some testing and validation, Ekman and Wallace Friesen published the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in 1978; updated editions continue to be widely used.Despite its financial success, FACS was very labor-intensive to use. Ekman wrote that it took 75 to 100 hours to train users in the FACS methodology, and an hour to score a single minute of facial footage. This challenge presented exactly the type of opportunity that the emerging field of computer vision was hungry to take on.As work into the use of computers in affect recognition began to take shape, researchers recognized the need for a collection of standardized images to experiment with. A 1992 National Science Foundation report co-written by Ekman recommended that “a readily accessible, multimedia database shared by the diverse facial research community would be an important resource for the resolution and extension of issues concerning facial understanding.” Within a year, the Department of Defense began funding a program to collect facial photographs. By the end of the decade, machine-learning researchers had started to assemble, label, and make public the data sets that drive much of today’s machine-learning research. Academic labs and companies worked on parallel projects, creating scores of photo databases. For example, researchers in a lab in Sweden created Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces. This database comprises images of individuals portraying posed emotional expressions corresponding to Ekman’s categories. They’ve made their faces into the shapes that accord with six basic emotional states: joy, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise, and fear. When looking at these training sets, it is difficult to not be struck by a sense of pantomime: Incredible surprise! Abundant joy! Paralyzing fear! These subjects are literally making machine-readable emotion.Facial expressions from the Cohn-Kanade data set: joy, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise, and fear. (Courtesy of Jeffrey Cohn)As the field grew in scale and complexity, so did the types of photographs used in affect recognition. Researchers began using the FACS system to label data generated not from posed expressions but rather from spontaneous facial expressions, sometimes gathered outside of laboratory conditions. Ekman’s work had a profound and wide-ranging influence. The New York Times described Ekman as “the world’s most famous face reader,” and Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. He would eventually consult with clients as disparate as the Dalai Lama, the FBI, the CIA, the Secret Service, and the animation studio Pixar, which wanted to create more lifelike renderings of cartoon faces. His ideas became part of popular culture, included in best sellers such as Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink and a television drama, Lie to Me, on which Ekman was a consultant for the lead character’s role, apparently loosely based on him.His business prospered: Ekman sold techniques of deception detection to agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration, which used them to develop the Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program. SPOT has been used to monitor air travelers’ facial expressions since the September 11 attacks, in an attempt to “automatically” detect terrorists. The system uses a set of 94 criteria, all of which are allegedly signs of stress, fear, or deception. But looking for these responses means that some groups are immediately disadvantaged. Anyone who is stressed, is uncomfortable under questioning, or has had negative experiences with police and border guards can score higher. This creates its own forms of racial profiling. The SPOT program has been criticized by the Government Accountability Office and civil-liberties groups for its racial bias and lack of scientific methodology. Despite its $900 million price tag, there is no evidence that it has produced clear successes.As Ekman’s fame spread, so did the skepticism of his work, with critiques emerging from a number of fields. An early critic was the cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, who debated Ekman on the question of the universality of emotions in the late 1960s. Mead was unconvinced by Ekman’s belief in universal, biological determinants of behavior that exist separately from highly conditioned cultural factors.Scientists from different fields joined the chorus over the decades. In more recent years, the psychologists James Russell and José-Miguel Fernández-Dols have shown that the most basic aspects of the science remain uncertain. Perhaps the foremost critic of Ekman’s theory is the historian of science Ruth Leys, who sees a fundamental circularity in Ekman’s method. The posed or simulated photographs he used were assumed to express a set of basic affective states that were, Leys wrote, “already free of cultural influence.” These photographs were then used to elicit labels from different populations to demonstrate the universality of facial expressions. The psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett puts it bluntly: “Companies can say whatever they want, but the data are clear. They can detect a scowl, but that’s not the same thing as detecting anger.”More troubling still is that in the field of the study of emotions, researchers have not reached consensus about what an emotion actually is. What emotions are, how they are formulated within us and expressed, what their physiological or neurobiological functions could be, their relation to stimuli—all of this remains stubbornly unsettled. Why, with so many critiques, has the approach of “reading emotions” from a person’s face endured? Since the 1960s, driven by significant Department of Defense funding, multiple systems have been developed that are more and more accurate at measuring facial movements. Ekman’s theory seemed ideal for computer vision because it could be automated at scale. The theory fit what the tools could do.Powerful institutional and corporate investments have been made based on perceived validity of Ekman’s theories and methodologies. Recognizing that emotions are not easily classified, or that they’re not reliably detectable from facial expressions, could undermine an expanding industry. Many machine-learning papers cite Ekman as though these issues are resolved, before directly proceeding into engineering challenges. The more complex issues of context, conditioning, relationality, and culture are often ignored. Ekman himself has said he is concerned about how his ideas are being commercialized, but when he’s written to tech companies asking for evidence that their emotion-recognition programs work, he has received no reply.Instead of trying to build more systems that group expressions into machine-readable categories, we should question the origins of those categories themselves, as well as their social and political consequences. For example, these systems are known to flag the speech affects of women, particularly Black women, differently from those of men. A study conducted at the University of Maryland has shown that some facial recognition software interprets Black faces as having more negative emotions than white faces, specifically registering them as angrier and more contemptuous, even when controlling for their degree of smiling.This is the danger of automating emotion recognition. These tools can take us back to the phrenological past, when spurious claims were used to support existing systems of power. The decades of scientific controversy around inferring emotional states consistently from a person’s face underscores a central point: One-size-fits-all “detection” is not the right approach. Emotions are complicated, and they develop and change in relation to our cultures and histories—all the manifold contexts that live outside the AI frame.But already, job applicants are judged unfairly because their facial expressions or vocal tones don’t match those of other employees. Students are flagged at school because their faces appear angry, and customers are questioned because their facial cues indicate they may be shoplifters. These are the people who will bear the costs of systems that are not just technically imperfect, but based on questionable methodologies. A narrow taxonomy of emotions—grown from Ekman’s initial experiments—is being coded into machine-learning systems as a proxy for the infinite complexity of emotional experience in the world.This article is adapted from Kate Crawford’s recent book, Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence.Kate Crawford is a research professor at USC Annenberg and a senior principal researcher at Microsoft Research.

Artificial intelligence is changing the way clubs are designed - which is good news for golfers
How A.I. Is Transforming Golf EquipmentEverywhere you look, there's evidence of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). Computers are becoming increasingly adept at simulating human-like tasks. For example, when you ask Alexa for a weather update ahead of your match, that's A.I. It's clever stuff - and the good news is that it's even being used to help us play better golf.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksCompareCredit2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026CompareCreditUndoWe spoke to Dr Alan Hocknell, head of R&D at Callaway, about how and why the company started using A.I., the exciting direction it has taken them and what the future holds.LATEST VIDEOS FROM golfmonthly

Why did Callaway start using A.I.?""I was interested in trying to break out of a pattern of thinking too similarly to our competitors, particularly in driver design,"" explained Hocknell.""Take face design, for example. Most faces are thicker in the middle and thinner at the edges, done one way or another, mostly with thin titanium. There was a thread that everybody was edging down the same path and I wanted to have some extra inspiration to think differently.""""We discovered we could take what we had built over the last few years, which is essentially a very accurate simulation capability for the collision between a club and ball, and we could use this large amount of data to try to teach a computer how to think about club design. Perhaps it would come up with some solutions or some design directions that we wouldn't have come up with ourselves?""Get the Golf Monthly NewsletterSubscribe to the Golf Monthly newsletter to stay up to date with all the latest tour news, equipment news, reviews, head-to-heads and buyer’s guides from our team of experienced experts.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.""I think A.I. is this giant ethereal thing that people hear about in all walks of their life, but they don't really know what it is. We're only using the machine learning piece of A.I., but we are doing something a bit unique in turning a lot of A.I. stuff into a physical good."" In the case of Callaway, it is golf clubs that perform better than ever before.""This has led us to hire new staff not from the golf industry that have more specialisation in numerical analysis. We did that on purpose so that they brought that ‘non-golf’ set of thoughts about how to set up the problems correctly for the computer with the type of data that you need to add.""For Callaway's engineers, the aim is to combine these A.I., data-driven design break-throughs with the knowledge they already have about what golfers like to see and feel from their equipment.""If players can see vestiges of their input in the final design, then their desire for that product increases because they have a level of ownership of it,"" Hocknell added.""That feels human whereas A.I. might feel cold and alien because it's generated by a computer, although the computer has been influenced by humans and it's not just like we press a button and the design comes out. But, including people in the feedback loop has genuine impacts on the final design, particularly for Tour players.""Changing The Face Of GolfMany golfers won't concern themselves with what's going on in the clubhead, so long as it's hitting the ball long and straight. However, what makes A.I. so fascinating is how it's transforming the way clubs are being made - and it's playing a significant role in delivering huge performance benefits.Callaway has always been a brand that thinks outside the box, and right from the very beginning it has recognised the importance of investing in R&D. Ever since the days of the Big Bertha, the manufacturer has strived to maximise the amount of ball speed a player can generate.In 2019, it took this to a different level with a new Flash Face, designed by an $8m supercomputer, which used A.I. to cycle through 15,000 face design iterations and over 100 impact simulations.""The computer came back with some face thickness pattern variations that we had never considered before,"" adds Hocknell. ""A lot of the thickness patterns that we were looking at were generally thicker in the middle of the face and thinner at the edges in various forms. But this one came up with a series of thick areas and thin areas.""This illustration shows the ripple design on the back of the Flash Face that promises more ball speed across a larger hitting areaThe 'chosen one' was Epic Flash. Its unique internal mapping consisted of dozens of subtle ripples flowing from heel to toe that worked together to elevate COR in the face's centre region. It was, Hocknell says, an ""aha moment"".Epic Flash won a lot of fans - us included. On that promise of extra ball speed and more distance even on off centre strikes, it delivered. However, Callaway is a brand with a rich heritage in innovation, and it has always looked to push technological boundaries. If A.I. could be used to change the design of club faces, what else could it do?When Callaway upgraded its own supercomputer, we found out just how powerful A.I. could be. It worked its way through thousands more design iterations to deliver a new face for the Mavrik drivers. Flash Face SS20 was thinner than the one used in Epic Flash and, because A.I. had identified an even more powerful design, it needed to be made from a stronger material - an upgraded form of titanium - to withstand the pressure.RELATED: Callaway Mavrik Drivers ReviewUsing A.I. To 'Personalise' ClubsA.I. has played a crucial role in helping golfers to generate extra speed, but it's also taken personalisation to a different level. The Mavrik line-up, released in 2020, includes three distinct head shapes (Standard, Sub Zero and Max), and each head is uniquely optimised for different player types.It wasn't just the driver that benefitted from A.I.'s influence, either. The Mavrik range comprises drivers, fairway woods, hybrids and irons, with each available in three player categories. Here's the crucial part: because each club has a different purpose, it has a different face design. So, each of the heads employs unique A.I.-generated face thickness patterns that vary by model and even by loft to further optimise performance benefits for different types of golfers, hitting different types of shots.For example, with Mavrik's long irons, the faces are crafted for launch and speed, while the mid-irons are shaped for speed and consistency; meanwhile, the short irons are fine-tuned for spin and precision.And just to emphasise how the use of A.I. is spreading into other areas of the design process, it has also helped Callaway engineers redesign the interior of the head, with sound ribs improving the acoustics, something which has delivered better feel, too.RELATED: Callaway Mavrik Irons ReviewNew Epic, More A.I.In the new Epic drivers for 2021, Callaway has used A.I. to influence another of its key speed enhancing technologies - ""Jailbreak"", the structure that joins the crown and sole. With improved stability in the horizontal and torsional direction, the new Speed Frame delivers more ball speed across the face. In fact, in combination with a new Flash Face (SS21) - also the work of A.I. - these are Callaway's fastest ever drivers.""The Jailbreak Speed Frame is a classic example of how A.I. completely changed our thinking,"" Hocknell explains.""The normal design process would be to ask how we could make Jailbreak better. An engineer would say it's very stiff in the vertical direction but it's not so stiff horizontally or torsionally - would stiffness in those extra dimensions help? So we'd go away and build a prototype that was stiffer in those extra dimensions and then test it to see if it worked.""""Instead with A.I., we said to the computer: ""Here's Jailbreak, your design space allows you to change it if you want to with the goal of added ball speed"". A.I. comes back with a design that achieved it. At the end of the day, the computer doesn't know what torsional stiffness is, it just knows math. So it's completely backwards, in a way, we're left to interpret what it has done versus setting out parameters of how the design will change.""The Epic range is comprised of three drivers - Epic Speed, Epic Max and Epic Max LS, whilst there are two fairway wood options. If it's not clear already, there's a model to suit every level of golfer and swing type. And because A.I. has optimised each head for different players, you can also be sure of getting the best possible performance from your Callaway woods.RELATED: Callaway Epic 21 Drivers ReviewWhatever the future holds, A.I. will continue to play a key role in golf club design. It's not a marketing concept - A.I. is affecting the way clubs are designed. Perhaps there will come a time when Callaway's R&D department - there's no danger of the supercomputer replacing the human experts - designs a bespoke face for each of its Tour players depending on their own swing.""There's a whole lot of possibilities out there and we are looking at which ones are most effective for designing the better products we want,"" says Hocknell.""I don't think it's too much of a secret we are using A.I. tools in golf ball design. I can say that in five years time, we'll be thinking differently as an R&D organization and using a different toolset than the one that we've used before.""It feels like this is very much just the beginning. Watch this space.

Organizations are increasingly using  artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to solve business problems and transform their operations. These technologies are affecting nearly every process across all industries and becoming imperative for competitive edge. 
As AI and ML techniques continue to evolve, so do the requirements of the businesses that use them. When choosing an AI/ML strategy, it is important to ensure that the product roadmaps of your prospective AI/ML vendors align with your business’s future objectives in areas such as AI democratization, augmented analytics in BI, and cloud.
[ Need to speak artificial intelligence? Download our Cheat sheet: AI glossary. ]
Here are a few key questions to consider when choosing an AI/ML strategy and solution:
1. How will your solution save my team time?
There are plenty of  open source tools and solutions out there that you can cobble together to get the job done for little or no cost. If you're going to shell out real money for a data science platform, you need to see tangible ROI. 
Data preparation
Data preparation dominates most data science projects, turning your data scientists into expensive, and often unproductive, data engineers. To counter this, it’s important to choose a platform that makes data acquisition and transformation easy. These data engineering features should be seamlessly integrated into the modeling workflow.
Model selection
Another area ripe for optimization and automation is model selection. The platform should provide access to a variety of models, open source and proprietary, and recommend the best model for the job. 
Feature stores
Feature development is often a time-consuming and error-prone process. Choose a platform that integrates with a variety of ""feature stores,"" like Feast or Uber’s Michelangelo to reduce duplicative work and drive consistency across data science projects and teams.

2. What types of AI use cases work best on your platform?
Typically, there are two main categories of use cases for data science: operational and diagnostic. Most machine learning platform vendors excel at one or the other.
Operational use cases
Let’s start with the operational use case. Developing the best algorithm for displaying the optimal set of products on your homepage is an example of an operational data science use case. In such cases, real-time performance, application and data integration, and CI/CD features are critical. For operational use cases, an expert data scientist or team of data scientists may work for weeks on developing and testing an optimal algorithm. Stability, performance, and accuracy are tantamount to success. These solutions are often long-lived and have a direct impact on a consumer.
Diagnostic use cases
In diagnostic use cases, the requirements are very different. Predicting sales for a particular SKU for an upcoming promotion is an example of a diagnostic use case. In this example, a citizen data scientist would benefit from an AutoML platform to help in model training, selection and visualizing results. These use cases typically involve a single data scientist working over the course of a few days at most. The most important features are automation, agility, and results that are ""good enough."" These use cases are typically one-offs with no customer-facing implications of operational use cases.
Be sure to choose a vendor whose solution best matches your most common use case.
3. How does your platform scale and how does it work in the cloud?
We live in an increasingly cloud-y world, where most of our enterprise data is generated, captured, and stored. 
Cloud-native
It’s essential that your machine learning platform is  cloud-native so you can operate on the data without egress and with elastic scale. However, a cloud-native architecture may not be enough. Many of the public cloud AI/ML solutions operate only in their own cloud, so avoid lock-in by choosing a platform that can work across multiple clouds.

Another major consideration: Where does your data live, and how is it prepared? Choose a data science platform that can operate on a variety of data platforms, including data lakes and data warehouses. Since most of the time in a data science workflow is spent preparing data, the ML platform’s data-wrangling features are critical. This is especially important if your data science team lacks data engineering sophistication, which puts additional pressure on IT to acquire data and thereby limits self-service.

4. What level of expertise is required to use your platform?
This question touches on your team’s maturity and skill level when it comes to data integration and machine learning. Are you looking for a solution primarily targeted at the expert data scientist, a citizen data scientist, or both? The answer to this question will determine the style of machine learning platform you can support. 
There’s a clear trend in the market for AI/ML democratization, so choosing a platform that can work for both personas is a good bet.

As soon as Gregor was alone, he began to feel ill. Turning around was an effort. Even breathing was an effort. A thin stream of blood trickled from his flank down his fuzzy belly. He wanted to crawl away from it, but there was no place to go. He lay still on the spot where he had come to rest just in order to get his breath back and to stop the bleeding. “I’m in a bad way,” said Gregor. It had never occurred to him before that he could really become ill. He had seen sick animals—a dove once in a while, which had fallen out of the nestling into the gutter and could not fly any more, or the weak infants of the woman next door who had to be picked up with the tongs and thrown into the dustbin, or the bugs his father used to bring to him when he was still a young boy and which he had liked so much.

Except the second section of “The Metamorphosis” doesn’t begin that way. An artificial-intelligence application called Sudowrite wrote the paragraph above. I inputted the text of the first section of “The Metamorphosis” and then pressed a button called Wormhole. The computer composed the continuation.
Sudowrite uses, as its base, GPT-3, the latest version of a deep-learning neural network that can auto-generate text. The organization that created GPT-3, OpenAI, was founded as a nonprofit with a mission “to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.” In July of 2019, Microsoft invested a billion dollars, which allowed OpenAI to create a supercomputer with two hundred and eighty-five thousand C.P.U. cores, ten thousand G.P.U.s, and four hundred gigabits per second of network connectivity per server. Microsoft claims that it ranks in the top five supercomputers in the world, processing more than twenty-three thousand teraflops per second. The power of the supercomputer has been transformative. GPT-2, which John Seabrook took for a test drive in 2019, asking it to write an article for The New Yorker, had 1.5 billion parameters. GPT-3 has a hundred and seventy-five billion. (A parameter is a configuration variable required to make a prediction in machine learning.) Brute computational power is why Sudowrite can write like Kafka.
GPT-3 hints at a world in which machines can generate language. The consequences are vertiginous. To spend ten minutes with Sudowrite is to recognize that the undergraduate essay, the basic pedagogical mode of all humanities, will soon be under severe pressure. Take an A paper, change a few words in the first paragraph, push buttons three times, and you have an essay that fits the assignment. Whatever field you are in, if it uses language, it is about to be transformed. The changes that are coming are fundamental to every method of speaking and writing that presently exists.
Amit Gupta is one of the founders of Sudowrite. He left Silicon Valley for a career as a science-fiction writer and found a glorious fusion of the two when GPT-3 appeared. “Other artists have had tools like this for a long time,” he said. “There are really sophisticated tools for visual artists—whether it’s Photoshop or a 3‑D tool, there’s all these things that you can apply. People who are using 3‑D models aren’t using clay. They’re not using the tools of the past. They’re using really advanced tools that automate a lot of the processes. But writing has been stuck in the past. We’re not using paper and pen, but we’re not much better off than that.” Sudowrite accesses GPT-3’s interface and turns it into a legible tool that any writer can use. Currently, Sudowrite is in beta. Gupta imagines the product turning into a resource that writers will pay fifteen to twenty dollars per month to use.
Kafka has a plain style. But Sudowrite is not just for plain styles. In fact, it works better with more distinctive literary styles. In the autumn of 1797, Samuel Taylor Coleridge gave himself an opiate and fell asleep while reading “Purchas’s Pilgrimage.” He woke up after a dream that lasted three hours, in which he believed that he had written between two hundred and three hundred lines. On waking, he began transcribing what he had dreamt.

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.

Unfortunately, Coleridge was interrupted by a “person on business from Porlock,” and, “on his return to his room, found, to his no small surprise and mortification, that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision, yet, with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images, all the rest had passed away like the images on the surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast.” If Coleridge had Sudowrite, he would have typed in what he had and pressed a button.
When I pressed the button asking Sudowrite to continue “Kubla Khan” in an “ominous” style, it generated the following:

The old Moon shook her silver tresses
The new Moon bow’d her golden horns:
While all the stars that round her burn’d,
Bow’d to the ground and based their fires.
    To the one ever-branching cloud
    That blew and drifted—blow and drift;
    To the one moon that alone swung,
    Colossal, glimmering, through the sky;
    I bowed my head and half-believed
A dizzy spell had made me dream.
The tumult ceased, the clouds were torn,
The moon resumed her solemn course,
The stars were faint, the dawn was near,
And faintly from the distant sea
What seemed a misty-white and slender rod,
A phantom-wand, a beam of light,
    It grew and grew to a towering spire,
    A seraph-wand, a sun-bright sail.

I find this beautiful, memorable. If you told me that Coleridge wrote it, I would believe you. The machine even put in the indents.
But what is writing this? Who is writing this? In a sense, Coleridge wrote it. He articulated the pathways of its manufacture. I suppose that I could be the author insofar as I selected the passage and pressed the button. Or, thinking broadly, the author of this passage is the entire corpus of human language processed through GPT-3.
But GPT-3 points to a deeper question: In what way did Coleridge write the original lines of “Kubla Khan”? He himself doubted whether what led him to have the manuscript of “Kubla Khan” in front of him could be called writing. He said he composed it “if that indeed can be called composition in which all the images rose up before him as things, with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions, without any sensation or consciousness of effort.” He considered his own work the vessel of a force outside himself. And this is not an experience unique to him. The oldest poems in the Western tradition, the Iliad and the Odyssey, begin with an invocation to the muse, a plea for a mysterious, unfathomable other to enter the artist, taking over, conjuring language. GPT-3 is a mysterious, unfathomable other, taking over, conjuring language. It is a muse you will be able to access for fifteen to twenty dollars per month.
I wanted to see how another writer would react to Sudowrite. Nathan Englander moved in down the street from me in Toronto, and, during COVID, we’ve been sitting around my back yard in a distanced way, chatting and drinking. He very kindly agreed to an experiment. I took one of my favorites of his stories, “Free Fruit for Young Widows,” about a young boy named Etgar who hears a powerful story of wartime revenge from his father, and put it in Sudowrite. It continued the story this way:

Etgar began having dreams. Not the way people always talk about. Not the way people always say dreams are, like scenes of floating in the sky, or journeys down long spiral staircases into deep caves. Not dreams of falling into a stream or waking lost in the woods. Not the kind of dreams where you see people you missed and can’t remember them. Not like that. Because that is a dream that people talk about, but no one really dreams that way. To the contrary, Etgar’s dreams were more like little flashes—no more than a few seconds each time. With more than that you are already in the world, you are interacting with it, after all, and that’s not me. No, Etgar’s dreams were more like the few seconds before sleep or the few seconds after it, when you too are suspended in between.

At first, I was confused by this continuation from the machine. For one thing, Englander doesn’t write with sentence fragments, but, upon rereading, the content seemed Englander-esque to me. “It’s a shocking and terrifying leap,” he said, when I showed it to him. “Yes, it’s off. But not in the sense that a computer wrote it but in the sense that someone just starting to write fiction wrote it—sloppy but well-meaning. It’s like it has the spark of life to it but just needs to sit down and focus and put the hours in.” Although Englander doesn’t feel the passage is something he would write, he doesn’t hate it, either. “It was like the work of someone aspiring to write,” he said. “Like maybe a well-meaning pre-med student or business student fulfilling a writing requirement because they have to—the work is there, but maybe without some of the hunger. But it definitely feels teachable. I’d totally sit down and have a cup of coffee with the machine. You know, to talk things out.”
Friendliness will not be the typical reaction, I fear. The first reaction to this technology will be dismissal—that the technology isn’t really doing anything much at all, that it isn’t writing, that it’s just a toy. The second reaction will be unease—that the technology is doing too much, that it is writing, that it will replace the human. GPT-3 is a tool. It does not think or feel. It performs instructions in language. The OpenAI people imagine it for “generating news articles, translation, answering questions.” But these are the businessman’s pedantic and vaguely optimistic approaches to the world’s language needs.
For those who choose to use artificial intelligence, it will alter the task of writing. “The writer’s job becomes as an editor almost,” Gupta said. “Your role starts to become deciding what’s good and executing on your taste, not as much the low-level work of pumping out word by word by word. You’re still editing lines and copy and making those words beautiful, but, as you move up in that chain, and you’re executing your taste, you have the potential to do a lot more.” The artist wants to do something with language. The machines will enact it. The intention will be the art, the craft of language an afterthought.
For writers who don’t like writing—which, in my experience, is nearly all of us—Sudowrite may well be a salvation. Just pop in what you have, whatever scraps of notes, and let the machine give you options. There are other, more obvious applications. Sudowrite was relatively effective when I asked it to continue Charles Dickens’s unfinished novel “The Mystery of Edwin Drood.” I assume it will be used by publishers to complete unfinished works like Jane Austen’s “Sanditon” or P. G. Wodehouse’s “Sunset at Blandings.” With a competent technician and an editor-writer you could compose them now, rapidly, with the technology that’s available. There must be a market for a new Austen or Wodehouse. I could do either in a weekend. (Other writers have already tried to write like Austen and Wodehouse, but even excellent examples always feel like contemporary versions of their works. If you used a Wodehouse machine or an Austen machine, it would sound like they sound. The future would not have happened to the algorithm.)
Gupta knows that Sudowrite is only beginning to sense, dimly, the possibilities of GPT-3, never mind the possibilities of artificial intelligence in natural language. GPT-3 is perhaps the Model A of this technology. The above is a small taste of what can be done at a hundred and seventy-five billion parameters. What happens at a trillion? What happens at ten trillion? The human brain has about a hundred trillion parameters. What happens when the technology passes that number? “It’s early days,” Gupta said. “I see a future where it gets super more sophisticated and it helps you realize ideas that you couldn’t realize easily on your own.”
The creative possibilities are exciting and terrifying. Englander didn’t really see the machine as a competitor to himself but almost as a student that he could coax out of weakness. “If it was desperately trying to tell me something about dreams, it would have the juice,” Englander told me. “But this was more like the work of somebody who admires writing but doesn’t need to write. Someone—a living, breathing someone—trying to sound like they think a writer should.”
Already, what GPT-3 shows is that literary style is an algorithm, a complex series of instructions. The reason a passage from Kafka or Coleridge or Englander doesn’t look like math is because the mind isn’t capable of holding a hundred and seventy-five billion parameters at the same time. Very soon, when you read a text you will not be able to assume a person intended or wrote that language. Eventually, this technology will escape the confines of the scientific realm, to those who use language to manipulate and to control, and perhaps even those who use language to express and celebrate.
Meanwhile, there are other avenues of meaning to explore. If you put in the whole of “The Metamorphosis” into Sudowrite, it will compose an extension:

When Mr. Samsa thought about moving house and how they could all pull their way up again, he couldn’t suppress a shiver running down his spine—and this shiver ran down the spine of all three of them, he could see, as if they were collectively possessed and trembling all over with some sort of fever. It was more like a convulsion than a shiver. Then they calmed down, quite exhausted. Mr. Samsa thought: “If we continue like this we’ll soon be having a charwoman in our family. First thing tomorrow I’ll make inquiries about suitable flats”. And then he looked up: the two women were gazing ahead and did not see that he was looking at them. All of a sudden Grete burst out laughing. “What’s that for?”, asked her father. “Well, just because”, replied Grete. And Mr. Samsa did not insist.

But “The Metamorphosis” doesn’t need extension. It’s perfect. It has survived because the core meaning of its story continues to resonate. Gregor is subject to a miracle that is at once a revelation and a catastrophe. The human entity changes once again, in a way that is both magical and degrading.

Just pop in what you have, whatever scraps of notes, and let the machine give you options. There are other, more obvious applications. Sudowrite was relatively effective when I asked it to continue Charles Dickens’s unfinished novel “The Mystery of Edwin Drood.” I assume it will be used by publishers to complete unfinished works like Jane Austen’s “Sanditon” or P. G. Wodehouse’s “Sunset at Blandings.” With a competent technician and an editor-writer you could compose them now, rapidly, with the technology that’s available. There must be a market for a new Austen or Wodehouse. I could do either in a weekend. (Other writers have already tried to write like Austen and Wodehouse, but even excellent examples always feel like contemporary versions of their works. If you used a Wodehouse machine or an Austen machine, it would sound like they sound. The future would not have happened to the algorithm.)Gupta knows that Sudowrite is only beginning to sense, dimly, the possibilities of GPT-3, never mind the possibilities of artificial intelligence in natural language. GPT-3 is perhaps the Model A of this technology. The above is a small taste of what can be done at a hundred and seventy-five billion parameters. What happens at a trillion? What happens at ten trillion? The human brain has about a hundred trillion parameters. What happens when the technology passes that number? “It’s early days,” Gupta said. “I see a future where it gets super more sophisticated and it helps you realize ideas that you couldn’t realize easily on your own.”The creative possibilities are exciting and terrifying. Englander didn’t really see the machine as a competitor to himself but almost as a student that he could coax out of weakness. “If it was desperately trying to tell me something about dreams, it would have the juice,” Englander told me. “But this was more like the work of somebody who admires writing but doesn’t need to write. Someone—a living, breathing someone—trying to sound like they think a writer should.”Already, what GPT-3 shows is that literary style is an algorithm, a complex series of instructions. The reason a passage from Kafka or Coleridge or Englander doesn’t look like math is because the mind isn’t capable of holding a hundred and seventy-five billion parameters at the same time. Very soon, when you read a text you will not be able to assume a person intended or wrote that language. Eventually, this technology will escape the confines of the scientific realm, to those who use language to manipulate and to control, and perhaps even those who use language to express and celebrate.Meanwhile, there are other avenues of meaning to explore. If you put in the whole of “The Metamorphosis” into Sudowrite, it will compose an extension:When Mr. Samsa thought about moving house and how they could all pull their way up again, he couldn’t suppress a shiver running down his spine—and this shiver ran down the spine of all three of them, he could see, as if they were collectively possessed and trembling all over with some sort of fever. It was more like a convulsion than a shiver. Then they calmed down, quite exhausted. Mr. Samsa thought: “If we continue like this we’ll soon be having a charwoman in our family. First thing tomorrow I’ll make inquiries about suitable flats”. And then he looked up: the two women were gazing ahead and did not see that he was looking at them. All of a sudden Grete burst out laughing. “What’s that for?”, asked her father. “Well, just because”, replied Grete. And Mr. Samsa did not insist.But “The Metamorphosis” doesn’t need extension. It’s perfect. It has survived because the core meaning of its story continues to resonate. Gregor is subject to a miracle that is at once a revelation and a catastrophe. The human entity changes once again, in a way that is both magical and degrading.An earlier version of this post misidentified the name of a function in Sudowrite as well as its proposed cost.",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-computers-are-getting-better-at-writing'}",,2021-04-30T06:00:00.000-04:00,,,,,,,,,True,,cultural comment,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/607742e2871bbfab520aed42/1:1/w_2560,h_2560,c_limit/Marche-AIWriting.jpg",,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Culture', 'item': 'https://www.newyorker.com/culture'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Writing', 'item': 'https://www.newyorker.com/tag/writing'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'The Computers Are Getting Better at Writing'}]",,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'The New Yorker'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somewhere in Peter Maercklein’s heartbeat was an abnormality no one could find. He survived a stroke 15 years ago, but doctors never saw anything alarming on follow-up electrocardiograms. Then, one day last fall, an artificial intelligence algorithm read his EKGs and spotted something else: a ripple in the calm that indicated an elevated risk of atrial fibrillation.
Specifically, the algorithm, created by physicians at Mayo Clinic, found Maercklein had an 81.49% probability of experiencing A-fib, a quivering or irregular heartbeat that can lead to heart failure and stroke. Just days later, after Maercklein agreed to participate in a research study, a wearable Holter monitor recorded an episode of A-fib while he was walking on a treadmill.advertisement

The finding dramatically altered the course of his care. He was put on a blood thinner and eventually received a pacemaker, interventions that happen too late, or not at all, for hundreds of thousands of people who die every year of untreated heart disease.

Attabotics offers an ideal applied platform to utilize emerging technologies to optimize the supply chain for modern commerce.

Integrating AI technology into the supply chain for transparency, predictive analytics and network optimization is integral as the pandemic has shown that the traditional supply chain doesn’t – and won’t – support modern consumer behavior. Attabotics is building advanced AI/ML capabilities that maximize supply chain system throughput by predictively optimizing fulfillment while minimizing downtime. Attabotics drives these advanced AI models by leveraging IoT data derived from modern cloud based robotic operations. With AltaML and Amii, Attabotics is taking another step toward building out its digitally integrated, distributed network that is optimized for modern commerce.

“We’re excited to work with two world-renowned organizations to build the future of innovation in Canada,” said Scott Gravelle, Attabotics CEO. “Creating alliances with industry-leading partners is something we’ve put an emphasis on, which is why we’re so grateful to have identified the right partners in AltaML and Amii to help further optimize our platform as we revolutionize the supply chain.”

This collaboration draws on the strengths of three Alberta technology leaders to expand the data analytics capabilities for customers. Combining Attabotics’ expertise in warehousing and fulfillment with AltaML’s expertise developing applied AI solutions and Amii’s world-leading research expertise, the collaboration will enable innovation in areas such as maximizing system automation uptime and throughput. This partnership will also support the growth of Calgary and Alberta as an innovation hub and contributes to an ecosystem where technology and innovation continue to thrive.

“AltaML builds and deploys AI-powered software for complex problems, creating new competitive advantage for our partners,” said Nicole Janssen, AltaML co-CEO. “Attabotics has disrupted traditional warehousing, and we are thrilled to work with them, and Amii, to optimize their processes through applied AI. We are already seeing promising results and look forward to many more to come.”

“Amii is thrilled to be part of this one-of-a-kind collaboration bringing together three of Alberta’s leading technology organizations. Together, we’re demonstrating the province’s reputation as a hub for technology and artificial intelligence through the combination of Attabotics’ transformational work in advanced robotics for supply chain, Amii’s leadership and expertise in artificial intelligence research and development and AltaML’s proven record in applying AI to create business impact. This partnership shows the power of public-private partnerships and is further proof of Alberta’s leadership in the research and application of AI,” said Cam Linke, Amii CEO.

Yes, but not for a long while.",Professors Fei-Fei Li and Andrew Ng are skeptical that we'll see any AI healthcare breakthroughs in the next few years.,https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Computer scientists have long promised that artificial intelligence could make healthcare work easier for doctors and ultimately better for patients. Around 10 years ago, IBM said its Watson technology would help doctors diagnose and treat patients. But no company has yet come close to delivering on that promise; in fact, according to two leading AI experts, artificial intelligence probably won’t transform healthcare for another decade.“In the tech world, progress tends to happen slowly and then very quickly,” says Andrew Ng, founder of Google Brain, former chief scientist at Baidu, and current adjunct professor at Stanford. “I think we’re still in the progress-is-happening-slowly process in healthcare.”On Thursday, Ng and Fei-Fei Li, codirector of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, discussed how they see AI integrating into the healthcare industry at a panel hosted by the institute. Ng said that he doesn’t anticipate major breakthroughs in the next few years. Rather, he hopes to see AI in healthcare “blossom” over the next decade.The Obama administration paved the way for this eventual future by incentivizing healthcare systems to digitize patient health records through the HITECH Act and the Affordable Care Act. But the promise of AI-powered health has not materialized, even though the healthcare industry could certainly use the help. More than 40% of doctors are suffering from burnout, according to a 2021 Medscape survey—and the vast majority of them say they were burned out even before the pandemic. The main agents thrusting them toward exhaustion are bureaucratic tasks, like inputting notes, that often need to be completed in their off time. There are big concerns that pervasive burnout among clinicians could lead to poor outcomes for patients.Some companies, like Nuance AI, which was recently acquired by Microsoft, are developing tools that could potentially write a doctor’s notes for them. But so far, the technology is little more than a transcription service. There are still major hurdles to making technology good enough that it can truly assist doctors in a way that reduces their workload.“We need AI and technology to prove that they make a fundamental human difference to the care, recovery, or the well-being of . . . the patient or to the healthcare worker’s work,” Li said.Healthcare is a high-stakes business. When there are errors in medicine—a missed diagnosis, a wrong medication administered—people can die. Ng says there are multiple barriers to getting artificial intelligence to work inside of healthcare. He says the algorithms need to be better and they need to be tackling the right problems.For instance, when Ng’s researchers test and train their algorithms in Stanford’s hospital using its data and machines, they can prove that the technology is as good as Stanford’s radiologists at spotting various conditions in X-rays. But, he says, there is a gap between this proof of concept and actual in situ use. If a researcher were to take that same algorithm down the street to another hospital where the X-ray technician uses a slightly different imaging protocol, the AI system would perform poorly, because the conditions are not exactly as the ones in which the algorithm was tested.“In contrast, any human radiologist can walk down the street to the other hospital and do just fine,” Ng said.Another problem concerning AI in healthcare is that not all of the necessary data is digitized. Li noted that an important aspect of healthcare that isn’t documented is human behavior, “whether you’re talking about patients living at home with chronic disease and hoping they never have signs of deterioration or you’re talking about doctors carrying out their important procedures, hoping that the protocols are met and there’s no clinical error.”What’s called ambient artificial intelligence, or technology that sits seamlessly in the background of an environment passively collecting data, could play an important role, for instance, in monitoring whether doctors are conducting procedures appropriately. Another possibility: alerting a doctor to a patient in intensive care who’s taken a downturn. But right now, the technology is not there yet.“We need, for example, in radiology, a proven product or proven story that truly has not only helped diagnose patients but also made radiologists work better and collectively moved the needle,” Li said. “We’re inching toward that watershed moment.”Recognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards!

Artificial Intelligence and Improved Hardware Architecture GCI team aims to redesign the shape of the computer
April 26, 2021


The Grand Challenges Initiative (GCI) is the backbone of the first and second-year experience in the Schmid College of Science and Technology and the Fowler School of Engineering. Although the past year has brought many challenges, GCI teams are continuing to innovate from home. One sophomore team is finding ways to improve computer hardware design to accommodate energy-intensive artificial intelligence programs. 
Blake Calvo ’23 (biochemistry and molecular biology), Jack Pauly ’23 (computer science), Ken Baierl ’23 (computer engineering), Patrick Hooverson ’23 (computer science), and Michael Efseaff ’23 (computer science) have always been interested in artificial intelligence. The GCI program gave them the opportunity to explore that interest more in-depth, and the group ultimately decided to focus on hardware aspects of computer design. After finishing literature reviews, the group decided to further narrow their focus to actually redesign the shape of the computer. 
They said, “This worked well for us as all of our group members are adept with computer hardware. Most of our knowledge comes from experience or various YouTube tutorials, but Ken is majoring in computer hardware and that was absolutely a boon for our success. Our group’s current objective stemmed from Michael’s idea to change the structure of the computer itself, opting for an improved design that would maximize the ratio of surface area to used space. This design has since then morphed into what is currently being modeled in the SolidWorks program. Our current objective revolves around finishing the design in this new program and having it fabricated out of high-grade aluminum.” 
All images are taken from an animation depicting an ideal version of their idea modeled and animated by Michael Efseaff ’23.
This image depicts what a single trapezoid may look like, each trapezoid is its own independent computing system, with cooling, power, and is externally covered with a mesh filter grill.
When six trapezoids are brought together it creates a hexagon, the 6 independent computing systems cluster together in order to improve computing power and efficiency. The center is where external cables, like a power cable, would enter and exit.
The cover photo shows the design when six trapezoids are brought together it creates a hexagon, the six independent computing systems cluster together in order to improve computing power and efficiency. The center is where external cables, like a power cable, would enter and exit.
As the group has moved forward with their project, they’ve been surprised to learn how far we are from the type of artificial intelligence seen in science fiction. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, the group continues to feel inspired to address challenges in the current development of AI. They also attribute their enthusiasm for the project to their particular group. Calvo explained, “Having the opportunity to work with a group that is so incredibly smart and motivated to see this project through has not only been exciting but a humbling experience. I look forward to all of my meetings with this group of guys, plus, tackling a challenge without a definite solution has been incredibly stimulating and exciting.” The group is also helped by the support from the GCI program itself. Solidworks, an advanced industry software, is the primary tool the group is using. Funding from GCI lets groups like this one have access to industry tools. 
The group members have expressed that they plan to continue working on this project past the end of their time in GCI. Beyond that, all the group members have diverse career goals, from attending dental school to becoming a high school teacher.
The Team 






				Blake Calvo ’23 (biochemistry and molecular biology)
				




				Jack Pauly ’23 (computer science)
				




				Ken Baierl ’23 (computer engineering)
				




				Michael Efseaff ’23 (computer science)
				




				Patrick Hooverson ’23 (computer science)
				

Blake Calvo’s goal is to enter into dental school and pursue a career in oral and maxillofacial surgery. He is interested in this kind of surgery because it lets him work with patients on a personal level, while also performing surgeries that are complex and challenging. 
Jack Pauly is exploring careers but ultimately would like to combine his major in computer science and programming with his interest in digital design.
Ken Baierl would like to take this project as far as he can, but also wants to directly work on the components of a computer. This GCI team has helped Ken look more into computers and how they can work in different ways using different components. 
Michael Efseaff wants to work in the game industry on either the engineering side or as a product manager. A dream of Michael’s since he was 8 years old has always been to develop a Star Wars game. 
Patrick Hooverson would like to pursue a career in computer science. He also hopes to minor in psychology. As of now, he is thinking he would like to be a high school teacher, teaching math or computer science.

SourceThe idea of creativity is often solely associated with humans.Our ability to draw, write, and innovate is rivalled by no other species. It’s what has allowed us to become as advanced as we are today.But soon, we might not be the only ones with the skill of creativity. Computers are catching up, and they’re catching up fast.Artificial intelligence (AI) has already given computers the ability to play Atari games and write like Shakespeare. They’ve even been able to create their own music and art.Creating art and composing music takes years for many to master. It requires consistent effort and dedication for a human to become skilled at performing such tasks.But computers can learn such skills in hours.It’s remarkable that a computer can learn extremely complex skills in such a short time, but how do they go about doing this? To understand the process, let’s observe how a computer can be taught to create its own handwritten digits.Big Data JobsBehold, the Variational Autoencoder!Imagine conveying the plot of a 500-page fiction novel in ten words. Having to convey so much information in so few words sounds impossible.But computers can perform similar feats relatively easily using variational autoencoders!A variational autoencoder, or a VAE for short, is an AI algorithm with two main purposes — encoding and decoding information. Although it isn’t their primary purpose, they can also generate new information using this encoding and decoding ability (more on this later).When encoding information, the VAE maps large amounts of information to smaller representations. This compressed representation of information is called the latent space of the VAE, as the original information is hidden in this compressed representation.Considering the example of encoding and decoding images of handwritten numbers, the VAE would take in an image of a handwritten number and compress it into a latent space.An example of how an input image would be decoded. The image of the number is 28px x 28px and thus consists of 784 pixels. The VAE can encode all of the information from the 784 pixels in just five numbers. Image created by author.What’s cool about the VAE, though, is its ability to work backwards. It can reconstruct the original input image by observing the latent space. In other words, the VAE decodes the latent space to reconstruct the input.The VAE can recognize the information stored in the latent space and use it to reconstruct the original image. It can thus work backwards. Image created by author.Being able to condense and reconstruct images is super cool, but not easy to do. The VAE has to teach itself how to properly map from an input image to a latent space. Because they’re really good at learning such mappings, we typically train an AI algorithm called a neural network to work as a VAE.A Brief Introduction to Neural NetworksA neural network is really good at identifying patterns from data. It’s typically visualized as a series of interconnected circles called nodes.Sample neural network architecture. SourceEach column of nodes is collectively referred to as a layer. Information usually enters a neural network through the leftmost layer, which is called the input layer.The information then gets passed to the middle layer, or hidden layer. More hidden layers in a neural network allow for the algorithm to learn more complex patterns in the input data.After using the hidden layers to identify these complex patterns, a final output layer returns the neural network’s findings.The way in which the input, output, and hidden layers are arranged is referred to as the neural network’s architecture. Different architectures can allow neural networks to perform different tasks. Because our VAE is created to encode and decode information, it requires a very specific neural network architecture to function.Trending AI Articles:1. Why Corporate AI projects fail?2. How AI Will Power the Next Wave of Healthcare Innovation?3. Machine Learning by Using Regression Model4. Top Data Science Platforms in 2021 Other than KaggleConstructing the VAEThe VAE’s architecture consists of two parts — the encoder and decoder.The encoder is utilized for mapping the input to a latent space, while the decoder maps the latent space back to the original input.Because the decoder is used to reconstruct input information, it’s built as the exact opposite of the encoder. Putting the encoder and decoder together makes the VAE’s signature bowtie-like shape.The architecture of the VAE. The left side layers form the encoder while the right-hand layers are used for the decoder. The latent space rests in between these two parts. SourceHowever, in the VAE, the encoder doesn’t directly map to the latent space. Rather, it first uses the input data to output two quantities called mu (the u symbol) and sigma (the o symbol).Mu and SigmaLet’s say we have two images of the number 7, both of which are fed to the VAE’s encoder. The latent spaces of both of these images should theoretically be similar, as both images contain the number 7.Surprisingly, though, that’s not the case. Visualizing encodings of handwritten number images showcases this phenomenon.The encodings of various images of handwritten digits. Each point represents an encoding of a single image. The color denotes the handwritten number that was in the encoded image. SourceNotice how scattered the encodings of the same numbers are. The points are quite distant from each other.This is bad news for our VAE. The VAE’s encoder should give similar encodings to similar images. By doing this, the VAE’s decoder can more accurately reconstruct the original image from the latent space.If one specific encoding is generated per input image, however, the VAE’s decoder will get overwhelmed. It’s like trying to memorize the exact definitions of a million different words; the decoder cannot possibly learn how to deal with millions of specific encodings — the more general, the better.To ensure that the decoder doesn’t have this problem, the VAE utilizes mu and sigma.Think of mu and sigma as the VAE’s way of creating more general encodings. Utilizing mu and sigma allows for two distinct images of the number 6 to have similar encodings.Two images of the number 6 encoded with mu and sigma. Notice how similar the latent spaces are. With mu and sigma, similar images get similar latent spaces. Image created by author.The generality of the encodings with mu and sigma can be seen when visualizing various latent spaces.The encodings of various images of handwritten numbers. Each dot represents an encoding of a single image. The color denotes what handwritten digit was in the original image. SourceNow, images of the same numbers have encodings that are clustered together. The decoder won’t have to undergo the monumental task of learning how to decode millions of specific encodings.But, unfortunately, the VAE isn’t created with the ability to create a meaningful mu and sigma that can successfully create more general encodings. It can’t even properly decode a latent space. Our VAE needs to train itself to efficiently perform these tasks.Training the VAEEvery AI needs a way to critique itself. This includes our VAE; it cannot improve without knowing how to improve. To understand its mistakes and figure out how to improve itself, an AI uses a mathematical function called the loss function.Thus, our VAE needs a loss function in order to learn how to properly function. It employs a very specific kind of loss function called the reconstruction loss.The original image is encoded into the latent space, which is then decoded to create a reconstructed image. The reconstruction loss measures the difference between the original and reconstructed image. Image created by author.The reconstruction loss measures the difference between an original image and a reconstructed image. A higher reconstruction loss corresponds to a higher lack of quality in the reconstructed image.By aiming to minimize the reconstruction loss, the VAE can understand why its reconstructed images are missing the mark. With this knowledge, the VAE can tweak itself and flawlessly reconstruct input images!Reconstruction loss can be calculated with a formula like the mean squared error, which compares the pixel-for-pixel similarity between the original and reconstructed image. Y corresponds to the input image while ỹ corresponds to the reconstructed image. SourceHowever, the reconstruction loss does not help with learning a better mu and sigma. Improving these quantities requires the use of an additional equation called the Kullback-Leibler Divergence, or KL-Divergence, which is used to learn a mu and sigma that can effectively create more general latent spaces.The formula for the KL-Divergence. Using mu (the u symbol) and sigma (the o symbol), the KL-Divergence can judge the efficacy of the VAE’s current mu and sigma. With the feedback from the KL-Divergence, the VAE tweaks its mu and sigma to get better latent spaces. SourceArmed with the KL-Divergence and the reconstruction loss, the VAE is ready to learn! Here’s what the final training process would look like if we wanted to train a VAE to encode and decode images:The VAE first takes in an input image, which it encodes into a mu and sigma.The mu and sigma are combined to create a latent space.The VAE uses its decoder to reconstruct the input image from the latent space.The reconstruction loss and KL-Divergence are calculated using the reconstructed image, input image, mu, and sigma.Using the reconstruction loss and KL-Divergence values, the VAE slightly tweaks its encoder, decoder, mu, and sigma.This process occurs repeatedly; the VAE encodes and decodes thousands of images, continually improving itself until, eventually, the VAE becomes really good at encoding and decoding images.Generating New Handwritten Numbers With the VAEWhile it may seem that the VAE’s sole purpose is for encoding and decoding data, it can also be used to create new data!Because the VAE is good at decoding general latent spaces, it can actually decode random latent spaces as well. Picking random numbers for a latent space and feeding them to the VAE’s decoder gives some pretty interesting results!An example of the output of a random latent space. Image created by author.The generated image will sometimes be fuzzy or even incomprehensible due to the use of a random latent space. You never know what kind of image the VAE will create!A bunch of different generated images! Some look really clear while others are, well, questionable. Image created by author.With the VAE, computers can begin to create their own handwritten numbers. And this is only the start. VAEs are beginning to express their creativity further, performing feats like creating their own clothes. Computers are becoming increasingly creative, and VAEs are playing a big role in furthering that creativity.Thank you for reading!

Artificial intelligence in female hands






 











Agnieszka Mikołajczyk, a PhD student from the Faculty of Electrical and Control Engineering, conducts research on AI algorithms and their Explainable AI. She is the originator and designer of an application that, if installed on a mobile phone, can diagnose skin nevi in terms of neoplastic changes.


Already during her engineering studies, she knew that she wanted to associate her scientific work with social issues. The subject of her engineering thesis was the diagnosis of skin nevi. In this way, an algorithm and an application were created, supported by artificial intelligence, which can be installed on an ordinary computer. The idea turned out to be innovative, and the engineering work was awarded in the ""Innovative Young"" competition organized by the PIAP Industrial Institute for Automation and Measurements.
The artificial intelligence algorithm used in the application was improved by the young researcher during her second-cycle studies - she improved the application and expanded the database, presenting promising results in her master's thesis, which was also awarded in the ""Innovative Youth"" competition and in the competition for the Prof. Romuald Szczęsny’s prize.
During her doctoral studies, Agnieszka Mikołajczyk focused on the so-called ""deep learning"". The aim of this research is the most effective development of neural networks in algorithms. A properly trained network can associate the acquired knowledge and demonstrate the expected results in the analysis of the provided data.
– Initially, I started working on data augmentation methods -says the doctoral student- that is, to put it in simple terms, artificially increasing their quantity. Medical data, which is sensitive data, is always difficult to obtain, especially if we are seeking data from sick patients. Thanks to the photorealistic style transfer method, I obtained 120,000 new photos of skin lesions. Deep learning, which is a subcategory of machine learning, is about creating and training neural networks in such a way that they generate the desired predictions on their own, based on the available data. In this case, on the basis of photos of skin lesions, they were able to recognize whether the nevus was malignant or benign.
However, training the AI algorithm is not easy, as it can take into account such artifacts that humans do not even pay attention to. The key to such training of neural networks is the reliability of the data, undisturbed by any tags that the algorithm may misinterpret. Data bias are the subject of research by the PhD student in a project financed by the Preludium grant from the National Science Center.
Agnieszka Mikołajczyk also eagerly uses her knowledge in other pro-social projects. She works, among others in the non-profit organization Women in Machine Learning & Data Science (WiMLDS)
– The organization aims to support and promote women in the field of artificial intelligence and data science. Together with two friends from WiMLDS, we have created an educational project ""Detect Waste in Pomerania"", which is a response to the problem of environmental pollution.
The aim of the ""Detect Waste in Pomerania"" initiative is to popularize science, the less waste approach, and above all, to educate and support women in their career development in the field of artificial intelligence. Nine participants with experience in Artificial Intelligence and five mentors - experienced machine learning specialists were involved in the project. The project started at the end of October 2020 and ended five months later in March 2021. Its participants are working on creating an artificial intelligence algorithm for the detection of waste (mainly plastic) in the natural environment.
The created algorithm is a pilot solution that in the future may improve, e.g. automating waste recycling, environmental monitoring (automatic search for illegal landfills and automated measurement of the level of environmental pollution), and even minimizing the costs of keeping the city clean.

Weak AI is sweeping the globe, from smartphone apps to the Internet to big data analytics..The name comes from the fact that these artificial intelligence systems are specifically designed to perform one mission. They are also known as 'Narrow AI' because of their limited approach and inability to perform tasks other than those assigned to them. This narrows their intelligence to a single task or group of tasks, enabling for more tweaking and optimization..Strong AI.Artificial general intelligence (AGI), also known as strong AI or deep AI, refers to the idea of a machine with general intelligence that can learn and apply its intelligence to solve every problem. In any given case, AGI can think, comprehend, and behave in a manner that is distinct from that of a person..Strong AI employs a philosophy of mind AI framework, which is defined as the ability to perceive other intelligent entities' desires, feelings, values, and thought processes. Even so, due to recent advances in nanotechnology, Strong AI, which is still in its infancy, holds a lot of promise. Moreover, Strong AI is being considered as a potential application for the development of an artificial neural network that can act as a proper human being..Super AI.As per a report, according to University of Oxford scholar and AI expert Nick Bostrom, when AI becomes much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills, we've achieved Artificial Super Intelligence..Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) can outperform human intelligence in all areas, including innovation, general intelligence, and problem-solving. Machines would be able to demonstrate knowledge previously only seen in the best of us. This is the kind of AI that many people are concerned about, and the kind of AI that Elon Musk believes will lead to humanity's extinction..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

            Tetherfi wins Artificial Intelligence Award for Telecommunications at SBR TEA 2021 
        

From surviving the pandemic to thriving: A Singapore-based CX Start-up, Tetherfi, enables enterprises to transition to a remote working model; no compromises on security, compliance or collaboration.When COVID-19 lockdowns forced millions to go virtual and work from home, contact centers were among the worst-hit. Enterprises suddenly needed to find ways to get their agents, supervisors and other business users to work from home. There was tremendous pressure on supervisors to monitor work-from-home agents to ensure maximum compliance and efficiency, remotely.Making this turnaround required profound innovation, particularly creating a unique solution that enabled a work-from-home contact center model just within days. It also needed building robust security and compliance modules without compromising employee experience or privacy norms.It required leadership in technology and on the field understanding of what customers, enterprises, and agents needed—the result: Tetherfi Work from Home (WFH) Solution.Tetherfi developed a unique work from home solution using real-time camera vision, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The technology was so agile that enterprises could switch to remote working in just a few days using their existing infrastructure. It even allowed businesses to track, alert, reduce risk and improve collaboration without compromising on customer service during these unprecedented times.

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly ubiquitous throughout all enterprises and industries. For this reason, it’s imperative that everyone in the organization understands how AI and machine learning can make them better at their jobs and help inform mission-critical decisions. But beyond a few specialized technical roles, AI literacy is currently lagging at most organizations.
So how can business leaders help encourage their non-technical employees to understand and effectively use AI in their daily work and to better collaborate with colleagues at all literacy levels?
Here are four ways to help make AI more approachable, useful, and impactful for all.
1. Make AI understandable
There is a common misconception that AI can be used and understood only by those with advanced technical or analytical skills. This mindset has deterred many otherwise strong business professionals from interacting with AI – what people don’t understand, they’re often resistant to.
Shifting this mindset must be a top-down initiative. It is the responsibility of the C-suite to educate employees on the usefulness and applicability of AI. Reframe and explain AI in relatable and simple terms and demonstrate its potential value and impact, while reinforcing the message that AI is a tool that enables better work, not a technology that’s going to replace them.
Once more employees understand what enterprise AI entails, how easy it is to use, and how its practical applications can enhance their own role and responsibilities, you will see an increased willingness to implement it.

2. Customize AI for teams
Enterprise AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The way non-technical teammates will use it varies – you cannot deploy a blanket approach across the board and hope for a successful outcome. Approaches and models must be tailored, adjusted, and optimized to meet the needs of specific departments – a daunting endeavor for teams that aren’t yet using AI.
One way to get started is to create small pilot programs and then scale those initial successes across the organization. In creating and testing experimental models, teams can refine and adjust algorithms to fit their departments’ needs, and team members can see firsthand how data can inform better decision-making.
For example, a marketing department might use several AI models to increase customer engagement, conduct accurate market segmentation, and predict churn rates. In contrast, a healthcare provider might adjust their AI models to detect insurance fraud detection, anticipate patient volumes, and predict staffing needs.
To successfully encourage non-technical roles to use AI, every employee should be able to see how it can make their job even a little easier.
3. Demonstrate AI's impact on productivity
Beyond increasing the bottom line, AI can positively impact the lives of employees by boosting their productivity and effectiveness. Software engineers, coders, and programmers are needed to create the initial AI model, but once the model is up and running, employees in many roles can use it to understand vital trends and to predict future outcomes.

Enterprise AI automates menial tasks and gives a clear picture of actionable insights, freeing employees to work strategically, creatively, and collaboratively. It’s not about replacing human workers but augmenting a team’s abilities and increasing the value of their labor.
4. Create a culture of accessible, responsible AI

Responsible use of AI requires that tools be inclusive. A human-centric approach to enterprise AI supports organizations in creating a global, interconnected, and collaborative workplace that uses AI effectively.
Noelle Silver, founder of the AI Leadership Institute, says, “Inclusive engineering isn’t all about the tech – in fact, in AI it is less about the tech, and much more about the human component and interactions.”
Non-technical roles that are slightly removed from development can provide valuable insight into the impact AI has on society. They bring important questions and discussions to the table, and often call out biases and inaccuracies in AI models.
Ensuring that all types of roles – and their different values and perspectives – are included from inception to implementation can ensure that these colleagues are not only on board, but actively contributing to the overall success of AI in the enterprise.

By Paul Mozur and Cade MetzPublished June 9, 2020Updated April 13, 2021阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版When the Defense Department launched Project Maven, an effort to remake American military technology through artificial intelligence, it leaned on a team of about a dozen engineers working at Google. Many of them, according to two people familiar with the arrangement, were Chinese citizens.The Pentagon was fine with that, they said, even amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. Classified data was not involved, the Pentagon reasoned, and the American military needed the most qualified minds for the job.The Trump administration is now moving to limit Chinese access to advanced American research, as relations between the United States and China reach their worst point in decades. That worries many of the companies and scientists in the heady realm of cutting-edge A.I., because much of the groundbreaking work coming out of the United States has been powered by Chinese brains.A new study from MacroPolo — a think tank run by the Paulson Institute, which promotes constructive ties between the United States and China — estimated that Chinese-educated researchers comprised nearly one-third of the authors of the papers accepted and promoted at a prestigious A.I. conference last year, more than from any other country. But it also found that most of them lived in the United States and worked for American companies and universities.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe study shows they are helping to power American dominance over a strategically important field, one that can enable computers of the future to make decisions, identify faces, find criminals, pick military targets and drive vehicles.Many studied in the United States, grew comfortable living there and found work with American employers. They now worry that the flow of students and professionals will come to an end.“Sacrificing international students is killing the goose that lays the golden egg,” said Lisa Li, a Chinese engineer who recently graduated from Johns Hopkins University. “It will eventually destroy the future competitiveness of America.”China sees artificial intelligence as a field of strategic importance. It has thrown vast amounts of money at researchers with an aim of getting them to work for Chinese companies and institutions.The United States has noted China’s technology ambitions with alarm. It has cracked down on espionage and bolstered enforcement of disclosure rules at American universities and institutions. Last month, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration planned to cancel the visas of Chinese researchers and graduate students who have direct ties to universities affiliated with China’s military.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEfforts that broadly block Chinese talent could undermine the American lead in A.I., said Matt Sheehan, an analyst with MacroPolo and a co-author of the study.“These are some of the brightest minds in China, and they’re choosing to work for American research labs, teach American students and help build American companies,” Mr. Sheehan said. “If the U.S. no longer welcomed these top researchers, Beijing would welcome them back with open arms.”MacroPolo looked at a sample of papers published last year at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. NeurIPS, as it is known, focuses on theoretical advances in neural networks and deep learning, which have anchored recent developments in A.I. It found that more than half of the papers were written by authors in the United States.






















Many top A.I. researchers start their academic careers in China, but they don’t stay there.

The think tank also looked at where the authors went to school. It found that nearly 30 percent of them pursued undergraduate degrees in China, more than any other country. But more than half went on to study, work and live in the United States.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTChinese A.I. researchers may have more opportunities in the United States. MacroPolo found that the top homes of the authors included Google, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Microsoft Research. Tsinghua University and Peking University, two of China’s best universities, were the only Chinese institutions among the top 25.Multiple studies indicate that Chinese nationals who studied A.I. in the United States were likely to remain. Through 2018, nine out of 10 who completed doctorate degrees stayed for at least five years after graduation, according to a study from Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.Those numbers showed no signs of decline, but some organizations say more recent tensions between the United States and China have already begun to affect talent flows.“I am terrified by what the administration is doing,” said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a high-profile research lab in Seattle, which has seen a significant decrease in the number of applications from Chinese researchers. “How many times can you push people out the door and put obstacles in their way before they say, ‘I am not going to try’?”Chinese-born researchers are a fixture of the American A.I. field. Li Deng, a former Microsoft researcher and now chief A.I. officer at the hedge fund Citadel, helped remake the speech recognition technologies used on smartphones and coffee-table digital assistants. Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford professor who worked for less than two years at Google, helped drive a revolution in computer vision, the science of getting software to recognize objects.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt Google, Dr. Li helped oversee the Google team that worked on Project Maven, the Pentagon effort. Google declined to renew the Pentagon contract two years ago after some employees protested the company’s involvement with the military. The Google team worked to build technology that could automatically identify vehicles, buildings and other objects in video footage captured by drones. In the spring of 2018, at least five of the roughly dozen researchers on the team were Chinese nationals, according to one of the people familiar with the arrangement.A certain amount of government restriction is natural. The Pentagon typically bars citizens of rival foreign powers from working on classified projects. China also has a long history of carrying out industrial espionage in the United States.A.I. is different, people in the industry argue. Researchers generally publish what they find, and anybody can use it. So what the industry is looking for is not intellectual property but the minds that conduct the research.“For much of basic A.I. research, the key ingredient in progress is people rather than algorithms,” said Jack Clark, policy director of OpenAI, a prominent lab in San Francisco, and a co-chair of the AI Index, an annual effort to track the progress of A.I. research, including the role of Chinese researchers.“There’s a lot of open-source technology lying around for researchers to use, but relatively few researchers with the sorts of long-term idiosyncratic agendas that yield field-changing advances,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPeter Chen, a prominent Chinese-born researcher who is a legal U.S. resident, said further government crackdowns could hurt companies across the community, including his start-up, a robotics company called Covariant.AI in Berkeley, Calif. “If this continues, there will be people we can’t get,” he said. “It will definitely affect our ability to recruit talent.”For many Chinese students, the decision to stay or go has been more personal than political. Robert Yan, a former Google employee, returned to China to work at an A.I. start-up. The Bay Area didn’t suit him. He hated driving and missed Chinese food. A native of Shanghai, he thought he could advance more quickly in his home culture.Still, Mr. Yan said, only about one out of 10 of his Chinese colleagues in the United States chose to go home. For those looking to do high-end theoretical research, many Chinese companies still weren’t the best place, he said.“Compared to Google I now have far less freedom,” Mr. Yan said. “At a start-up you need to have a reason to do each task. We’re chasing efficiency. That does not facilitate doing things because you’re curious.”Ms. Li, the Johns Hopkins graduate, helped organize a petition supporting foreign student access to the United States. She prefers living in the United States in part because China’s tech industry is riddled with sexism.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I’m big, and I’m loud,” Ms. Li said. “Respect for female engineers is very important to me.”Lin Qiqing contributed research.Paul Mozur is a technology correspondent focused on the intersection of technology and geopolitics in Asia.

Artificial Intelligence: Can We Trust Machines to Make Fair Decisions?

Data and Computer Scientists, Ecologists, Pathologists, and Legal Scholars Study AI’s Biases


by  Catherine Kenny

April 13, 2021










Artificial Intelligence touches almost every aspect of our lives, from mobile banking and online shopping to social media and real-time traffic maps. But what happens when artificial intelligence is biased? What if it makes mistakes on important decisions — from who gets a job interview or a mortgage to who gets arrested and how much time they ultimately serve for a crime? 
“These everyday decisions can greatly affect the trajectories of our lives and increasingly, they’re being made not by people, but by machines,” said UC Davis computer science professor Ian Davidson.




Computer science professor Ian Davidson poses with a GPU-based computer used for deep learning. “They are both the heroes and villains of AI, allowing us to do complex learning quickly, but also to learn complex surrogates for race and gender,” he says. (Gregory Urquiaga/UC Davis)

A growing body of research, including Davidson’s, indicates that bias in artificial intelligence can lead to biased outcomes, especially for minority populations and women.
Facial recognition technologies, for example, have come under increasing scrutiny because they’ve been shown to better detect white faces than they do the faces of people with darker skin. They also do a better job of detecting men’s faces than those of women. Mistakes in these systems have been implicated in a number of false arrests due to mistaken identity.
In fact, concern about bias in facial recognition technologies led to a number of bans on their use. In June 2019, San Francisco was among the first cities in the nation to ban the use of facial recognition technologies by the police and other city departments. The State of California followed suit in January 2020, imposing a three-year moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology in police body cameras.

Has racial profiling gone digital?
A number of technologies take facial recognition a step further, analyzing and interpreting facial attributes and other data to make risk assessments, identify threats or unusual behavior. In the world of data surveillance, this is called “anomaly detection.” Increasingly, these technologies are deployed by law enforcement, airport security, and retail and event security firms. 
In a recent study, Davidson and Ph.D. student Hongjing Zhang demonstrated that these types of anomaly detection algorithms are more likely to predict that African Americans or darker skinned males are anomalies.
“Since anomaly detection is often applied to people who are then suspected of unusual behavior, ensuring fairness becomes paramount,” Davidson said. “If one of these algorithms is used for surveillance purposes, it’s much more likely to identify people of color. If a white person walks in, it would not be likely to trigger an anomalous event. If a black person walks in, it would.” 



“The machine is not biased. It has no moral compass. It’s just seen more white faces in the data it was trained on before and so it’s learned to associate that with normality.”  — Ian Davidson, UC Davis computer science professor



That sounds a lot like computer-aided racial profiling.
“But it’s completely unintentional,” Davidson said. “The machine is not biased. It has no moral compass. It’s just seen more white faces in the data it was trained on before and so it’s learned to associate that with normality.”
Ensuring that AI is fair and free from bias is complex, he explained. His work shows that adding more people of color to the data the machine learns from helps, but it does not eliminate the issue. 




A UC Davis study showed that deep anomaly detection methods are unfair. When tested on facial images, the algorithm predicted most of the white faces to be normal, while many black faces fall in the group categorized as anomalies. There’s also a noticeable difference with gender. More females are predicted to be in the normal group, with more males predicted to be anomalies. (Courtesy)




Bias reflects an unjust world
Examples abound of technologies that don’t perform accurately for people with darker skin. In February, the FDA warned that the pulse oximeters used to monitor oxygen saturation levels for COVID-19 patients may be less accurate for people with darker skin pigmentation. A study from Georgia Tech also found that people of color were more likely to be hit by driverless cars because object detection systems they use to recognize pedestrians don’t work as well on people with darker skin.
“Bias reflects a world that is unjust,” said Computer Science Professor Patrice Koehl. He teaches an ethics course that’s required for all UC Davis students majoring in computer science and engineering. Part of the course focuses specifically on bias in AI and other technologies.
“I want students to have an awareness of the problem and to understand why there are biases in our decisions,” Koehl said. “For example, if all your colleagues are white male, you’re unlikely to discuss problems associated with machine recognition of dark skin.”




“The danger with bias comes from the fact that we consider AI as a system that can make decisions.” — Patrice Koehl, UC Davis computer science professor

This lack of diversity in the workforce has been a persistent problem in the technology sector. Nearly 80 percent of employees at Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are male and there’s been little growth in Black, LatinX and Native representation since 2014, according to Mozilla’s 2020 Internet Health Report. 
“The danger with bias comes from the fact that we consider AI as a system that can make decisions,” Koehl said. “You want that decision to be as informed as possible. If the information you provide is wrong or biased, the decision will be wrong.”
When it comes to developing future technologies, Koehl is optimistic that today’s students will do a better job. “The problem associated with AI was created in the last 20 years, partly by software engineers. If those engineers were able to create such a big problem, my hope is that the next generation of engineers will spend just as much time looking at the problems and identifying solutions,” he said.
Unraveling the tangled roots of bias
While there’s growing awareness of bias in artificial intelligence, there’s no simple solution. Bias can be introduced in a number of ways, beyond the software engineer developing a new technology. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms rely on data, which is not always representative of minority populations and women. That’s because behind the data, the decisions — about which data to collect and how to use it — are still made by people. 
“We cannot address bias and unfairness in AI without addressing the unfairness of the whole data pipeline system,” said Thomas Strohmer, director of UC Davis’ Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research, or CeDAR. 
CeDAR is a hub for research activity focused on using AI for social good, from better healthcare to precision agriculture and combating climate change. Fighting bias and standing up for privacy is a natural part of that mission, Strohmer said.




“Things like racial profiling existed before these tools. AI just enhances an existing bias."" — Thomas Strohmer, director of CeDAR

“Things like racial profiling existed before these tools. AI just enhances an existing bias. If you feed a biased data set into an algorithm, the result will be a biased algorithm.” 
Because new technologies are often adopted at scale, Strohmer noted, biases can quickly become widespread, and they’re not always easy to detect. To determine if there’s bias in a data set or an algorithm, you need access to the data and the algorithm. 
Facial recognition, video analytics, anomaly detection and other kinds of pattern matching are being used in law enforcement — often out of public view.
AI in the shadows
Elizabeth Joh, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law, says this hidden nature of AI is a major concern. 
“If there are problems in law enforcement, they are increasingly difficult for people to see,” said Joh, who has written extensively about technology, policing and bias. “Most people understand the utility of a firearm and a badge. If someone experiences excessive force by the police, we intuitively understand that. With technology, we might not even recognize that the problem exists. You might never know unless you become the target of that interaction.”
For this reason, she said accountability is crucial. She points to increasing experimentation with AI tools by police departments in towns and cities all across the country, all with little consideration for long-term consequences.
“We need to realize that these tools can quickly get out of hand or can be used in ways that are unexpected and have socially harmful consequences or disparate consequences,” Joh said. “A certain amount of bias has always existed in policing. Hidden technologies can exacerbate the problem immensely.”
Joh added it’s not too late for police departments and other organizations to take a step back and ask the most fundamental questions about the use of AI: Should we be using these tools at all?
Harnessing AI’s power for good

“Education, training and promoting diversity are key to addressing how technology is perpetuating bias,” said Pamela Reynolds, associate director of the UC Davis DataLab: Data Science and Informatics department. “Just as AI is contributing to these persistent societal problems, it can also be empowering for uncovering bias and finding solutions.”
In this regard, the DataLab leads by example. It supports a diverse faculty and affiliates program and hosts events for women and underrepresented individuals in data science. 

WHAT DO DATING TECHNOLOGY AND ALZHEIMER’S HAVE IN COMMON?

UC Davis neuropathologist Brittany Dugger, along with researchers at UC San Francisco, has found a way to teach a computer to precisely detect one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease in human brain tissue, delivering a proof of concept for a machine-learning approach capable of automating a key component of Alzheimer’s research. Read the research, and watch the video.​ 





“In data science, we are working with large sets of information and these inevitably reflect the structural inequalities of our society,” said Reynolds, who is an experimental ecologist by training. “Without a critical and inclusive approach to data and the AI tools it enables, we run the risk of reproducing past injustices.” 
The DataLab helps students and researchers understand the complexity of large data systems and how technologies and computational methods work. This has added value to a number of research projects, including a three-year study to improve early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s in women and communities of color, being conducted by Brittany Dugger, assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine, and her team at UC Davis Health. 
Trust will require transparency
The trend toward greater use of artificial intelligence shows no signs of abating  — whether it’s to improve healthcare, recommend movies via a streaming service, conduct surveillance, or any of a myriad of other uses.
For that reason, transparency in AI is more important than ever. According to Davidson, that will require fairness, explainability and privacy.
“As machines replace humans and make more decisions, we need to be able to trust them,” he said. “That includes understanding exactly how machine algorithms are processing information and how decisions are being made.”

The first AI application programs for playing checker and chess were developed in 1951. After the ’50s, AI was on the rise and fall until the 2010s. Over the years, there have been some investments in AI by vendors, universities, institutions. Sometimes, hopes were high and sometimes hopes were low. It was referred to as the artificial intelligence winter when there was not enough interest in AI from industries.For the last ten years, AI, especially Deep Learning (a subset of AI), has been on the rise after two successful events: First, IBM announced the Watson super system which defeated several Jeopardy multiple time winners, namely Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings on February 14–15 and AlexNet, the name of a convolutional neural network (CNN), competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge on September 30, 2012 and achieved the top in this challenge. Based on various market research, almost all institutions in different industries have started to invest in AI and they will increase investments in AI for different use-cases in upcoming years. Future jobs related to AI will be needed more based on the World Economic Forum’s ”Future of Jobs” report (October 2020). Moreover, according to Glassdoor online employment company, data scientist has been called one of the best jobs in the USA last 3 years.References to the phrase “cloud computing” appeared as early as 1996, with the first known mention in a Compaq internal document. The term cloud was introduced even before 1993. But modern cloud computing was created and popularized by Amazon in 2006 with Elastic Compute Cloud service. The first cloud delivery model was Infrastructure as a Service to provide pre-packaged IT resources to users. Later delivery models PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) were introduced. All these delivery models were used for different workloads including AI workloads. There are there cloud deployment models namely Public, Private and Hybrid. These deployment models are also important to locate AI workload based on functional and non-functional requirements and constraints. According to the World Economic Forum’s “The Future of Jobs” report, cloud computing is the highest priority for business leaders and until 2025, cloud computing will be adopted the most by companies.Though artificial intelligence started much earlier than cloud computing, cloud computing and its technologies have improved AI very much. Cloud computing has been an effective catalyst.Image by Kivanc Uslu, inspired by source AI dynamic forcesWe can see dynamic forces that have shaped AI: Data/datasets, processing capability including GPUs, models/algorithms, and talents/skills. Let’s look at how cloud computing has been taking part to advance and enrich AI ingredients:Cloud delivery modelso IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) helped AI practitioners to have an infrastructure environment — CPU, memory, disk, network, O/S easily so that a practitioner doesn’t lose time without waiting for an infrastructure team to prepare it. Moreover, cloud providers started to provide GPU resources later.o PaaS (Platform as a Service) helped AI practitioners to use AI and data science services including jupyter notebooks, data catalog services to develop new generation applications easily.o SaaS (Software as a Service) helped users to consume AI services within an application i.e. CRM, payment applications to create efficient results.Cloud technologieso Containers: As containers started to isolate applications from computing environments, containers provided the same interface and environment to all data scientists. Moreover, data scientist teams may run their containers on different cloud providers even with GPU capabilities that they preferred.o Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. As data scientists wanted to use containerized data science platforms in a scalable way, Kubernetes helped them. Kubernetes provides efficient usage of computing environment resources including GPU. Kubernetes also provides data science applications, platforms running on containers to run on different cloud providers without worrying about compute environment.o Data Sets consumption: Data is the most important ingredient of AI. You need to have rich data sets to run your algorithms, models. Whether data sets are shared or not from a cloud environment, once you got it that you could store them on public or private cloud environments to work on them easily.Talent/Skills availabilityo Although classical AI courses, educations were available in universities especially as part of computer engineering, computer science, applied mathematics, nowadays independent AI engineering bachelor and data science master programs have been available in different universities. Moreover, specialized data science courses are available from well-known universities. Coursera, Udemy also provides very successful courses about deep learning, machine learning courses on the cloud.o Competition platforms like Kaggle, CrowdANALYTIX run on cloud environment and where data experts collaborate & compete to build & optimize AI, ML, NLP, and Deep Learning algorithms. These platforms are open to everyone. Some Data sets are available. With these new platforms, new talents can be raised.DevOpso DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The term was the first time used in a conference with the same name. Although it is possible to use DevOps approach in any development environment, especially microservices architecture style development requires DevOps. DevOps addresses the application development lifecycle, not the Data Science life cycle. So ModelOps was coined by Gartner in 2018. Before ModelOps, MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) was used as an extension of DevOps.Almost all cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle so on) already provide complex extensive data science and machine learning platforms and API services (i.e. NLP, Vision, Automated Machine Learning) in their cloud environment. Moreover, strong analytic firms (IBM, SAS, RapidMiner) provide their data science and machine learning platforms on different cloud providers. Many data science platforms and AI API services are also available on premise with cloud native (Kubernetes) environments. It seems that cloud providers and analytic firms will enrich these services on the cloud platform in the future.ConclusionDifferent analysts and technology companies predict future AI usage in different industries with different use cases. Cloud delivery and cloud computing models will help much to shape to use of AI use cases effectively. Moreover, edge computing which extends the cloud capabilities to on premise with low latency even offline capabilities will provide more use cases (i.e. video analytics) as organizations will have large amounts of data with processing capability on premise. And quantum computing will be expected to advance AI, especially in machine learning.Sources and further readingThe Dynamic Forces shaping AIhttps://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-four-dynamic-forces-shaping-ai/IBM’s new tool lets developers add quantum-computing power to machine learninghttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ibms-new-tool-lets-developers-add-quantum-computing-power-to-machine-learning/Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning PlatformsMagic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning PlatformsThis report assesses 20 vendors of platforms that data scientists and others can use to source data, build models and…www.gartner.com",,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-role-of-cloud-computing-in-artificial-intelligence-507ffd68ca46,2021-04-13T03:40:28.606Z,2022-01-07T02:34:58.822Z,,The Role of Cloud Computing in Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Kivanc Uslu'],,,,507ffd68ca46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Published: Apr 11, 2021 11:44 AM ESTDonovan Alexander3 years ago0ShareChristie's/Wikimedia CommonsIn 2018, in late October, a distinctly odd painting appeared at the fine art auction house Christe’s. At a distance, the painting looks like a 19th-century portrait of an austere gentleman dressed in black. Contained in a gilt frame, the portly gentleman appears middle-aged; his white-collar insinuates that he is a man of the church. The painting seems unassuming, something expected at an auction house that sells billions of dollars of painting each year.  Bionic hands and laser rust removal, the best of IE this week

However, upon closer inspection, things get a bit odd. The work appears to be unfinished. The facial features are indistinct, as if the entire body of the subject was captured in motion. In fact, the whole composition is also somewhat displaced to the top left. The entire painting itself is soft but surreal. 
If you were at the auction house, you would read that the painting is part of a series of portraits of the Belamy family. The aforementioned piece is of Edmond de Belamy. But, who is Edmond de Belamy? Some famous family head? A renowned preacher? Someone of great wealth? Well, Edmond de Belamy does not exist. 
The answer to our mystery can be found at the bottom right of the portrait. There you will find the artist’s signature in cursive Gallic. It reads: 
Source: Christie’s/So Obvious
Our painter is a machine — an intelligent machine. Though the initial estimates had the portrait selling under $10,000, the painting would go on to sell for an incredible $432,500. The portrait was not created by an inspired human mind but was generated by artificial intelligence in the form of Generative Adversarial Networks or GAN. That’s right; machines are starting to take over the art world. 
Artificial Intelligence able to comprehend and create art would represent a big step in developing intelligent machines
The AI “painter” was engineered by the Paris-based collective Obvious. They fed their GAN (more on this later) a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries. Their algorithm analyzed the human-made images and proceeded to create its own art based on what it had learned from the thousands of portraits. 
AI art is nothing new. More than 150 years ago, the famous mathematician Ada Lovelace dreamt of developing a computer able to create music. Indeed, it seems that the rise of intelligent machines is imminent. AI is growing more prevalent, helping to analyze and categorize data and solve problems in a wide number of fields. Yet, artificial intelligence is also intruding into the creative world and is being used to develop music, paintings, and poetry.

Aside from its potential financial value, the research driving this field could take AI further than we’d previously thought possible. Artificial Intelligence that is able to create art indistinguishable from that created by humans could represent a big step in building machines that can think more like humans. After all, what is more human than making art? 
However, commercial projects like the Edmond Belamy portraits and similar experiments in computational creativity have sparked debates among engineers, artists, philosophers, and concerned citizens. 
Can artificial intelligence really create art? 
So, how would you go about teaching a computer algorithm how to draw a dog? Like a child trying to draw a dog for the first time, you could start by giving it various images of dogs, to get a general idea of what a dog looks like and what features make up a dog. By creating its own image of a dog, and then comparing it against the images in the data set, over time the algorithm would “learn” how to create a puppy portrait. This process of getting a machine to learn from past data without new programming is how machine learning works. 
This process uses what is known as a neural network, or a series of algorithms designed to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. As new data is added, the neural network can adapt to generate the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.
There are many different types of machine learning techniques and architectures used by researchers. However, when creating art, one commonly used technique is called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). For the sake of simplicity, we will primarily focus on GANs in this article.
What is a Generative Adversarial Network?
Originally developed by Ian Goodfellow and set out in a 2014 paper, GANs are a type of machine learning technique that uses two neural networks, pitting one against the other in order to generate an output that can pass for real data. GANs can be effectively used to create art, among other things. But how do they work?
Simply put, the two neural networks are called a Generator and Discriminator. Say we want to train our model to create its own 19th-century portrait of a dog. For the sake of our example, think of the Generator as an art forger and the Discriminator as an art authenticator. We will first need to show the Generator thousands of paintings of dogs in various sizes and breeds, so that it can learn what different elements can make up a dog. 
The Generator uses the information in the data set to create a painting of a dog. The Discriminator will then try to spot the difference between the synthetic painting and the human-created ones from the data set. When the Discriminator spots the “fake,” the Generator “learns” how its attempt failed and tries again. In the beginning, the Generator makes many paintings that do not look dog-like enough to fool the Discriminator. 
However, the Generator also learns from the Discriminator’s constant feedback. Eventually, it creates dog portraits that look more and more like dogs, until it can eventually fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real-life portraits. The end result is our art. 
One of the most extraordinary things about GANs is that you can take the underlying architecture and train the model on any data set that you want
This method can be used not just for art, but also for voices, text, and even faces. The viral website This Person Does Not Exist creates eerily realistic human faces using Generative Adversarial Networks, creating, as the name implies, faces of humans that do not exist, but which are almost indistinguishable from those that do. Factors like the size of the dataset, the underlying features of the data, the time you spend training your model, and the type of GAN model all affect the final output. By using different types of datasets, you can create something hyperrealastic like the images on the Does Not Exist website, or something dreamy and abstract like the Edmond Belamy portrait. 
There are various methods to this machine madness 
Artists, researchers, and data scientists are exploiting the power of Generative Adversarial Networks to create artistic masterpieces. One of the most prominent figures in this growing artistic field is the New Zealand artist and lecturer in computational design, Tom White. His artwork investigates, “the Algorithmic Gaze: how machines see, know, and articulate the world”. White has collaborated with AI systems to create art which depicts the world not as humans see it, but as algorithms do.

To humans, the pictures White’s algorithms create look like random arrangements of lines and blobs. But to the algorithms, they can be identified as specific objects: a shark, binoculars, a lawnmower. The images are created by choosing an object and then having a drawing system generate some abstract lines. This image is fed into a machine vision classifier, which tries to guess what the chosen object might be. Based on the guess, the drawing system then tweaks the image and feeds it through again. The process continues until the classifier guesses correctly.
However, much like Kadinsky, Picasso, and Miro, these are abstract paintings. They are not a human’s idea of what the object looks like, but a machine’s idea — they represent how the algorithm “sees” the world. And this, it turns out, is very different from how a human sees the world.
White’s work is just the tip of the iceberg. The German artist Mario Klingemann has developed neural networks the produce dreamlike antique-looking portraits that evolve and “come to life” in real-time. Another AI artist is Google’s former artist in residence, Sougwen Chung, who has created a system that draws alongside her to make stunning duet paintings. 
Outside the realms of painting, researchers have also managed to train AI to write poetry. In a paper published by the University of Toronto and IBM, the researchers describe how they used 3,000 sonnets to train an algorithm to write its own Shakespearean-style sonnets. This is one end result:
“With joyous gambols gay and still array
No longer when he was, while in his day
At first to pass in all delightful ways
Around him, charming and of all his days”
Not bad for a machine, right? But what if music is your preferred form of expression? AI can do that too. In the spring of 2019, classical music enthusiasts gathered for an unusual event. The musical experience featured music composed by Bach and by artificial intelligence. Audience members were tasked with deciphering which musical composition was created by the human and which was created by machine. 
Using a form of Generative Adversarial Network, researchers behind the project were capable of training AI to compose music that sounded like Bach himself came back to life. Even the lead on the project, Marcus du Sautoy, an Oxford mathematician, struggled to decipher the differences in the two compositions. 
But, is AI truly creating art?
Can artificial intelligence be creative? This question lies at the heart of the research driving this field. Let’s go back to our painting examples. Who is truly the author behind the paintings? The algorithm itself or the person behind it? For many, it is the former. We humans like to think that our creativity makes us unique, something that separates us from animals and machines. However, others argue that the vastness of human creativity can be condensed into a complex process that involves essentially solving problems.

Can a machine be taught to mimic the creative process? Professor Marcus du Sautoy, the author of The Creativity Code, doesn’t necessarily think so. If anything, Professor Sautoy believes we are asking the wrong question. Instead of thinking about AI as replacing human creativity, it’s beneficial to examine ways that AI can be used as a tool to augment human creativity. 
In the examples here, AI has been used to explore new perspectives on existing mediums. The machines we have seen so far may not be truly creative, as they still rely on humans for their initial data and parameters, their “sources of inspiration”. If anything, this new creative process is collaborative rather than adversarial. 
So rather than say, This Art was Created by AI, it would be more appropriate to say that This Painting Was Created with the Help of AI. It is just not as catchy.
Even if machines grow to be more intelligent, reaching some type of General intelligence, Professor Sautoy believes that their role in creating art will still be collaborative, exploring entire new creative realms that would likely not develop if either of them were working alone. 
You can create your own AI art 
Perhaps you could even sell one as an NFT? There is a wide range of tools out there that allow those with little to no background in programming or machine learning to create their own art. Tools like GANBreeder will enable you to take two images and create a new one using various GAN models and datasets. If you want a little more control, without coding, check out the semi-free tool, Runaway ML. You can import massive data sets and synthesize everything from galaxies that do not exist to your own pokemon. RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

Artificial intelligence experts from Tulane University and the University of Maryland have received a Google Scholar Research Award to develop better ways of promoting diversity and fairness in a variety of pipeline and selection problems, including hiring, graduate school admission and customer acquisition.
Nicholas Mattei, an assistant professor of computer science at Tulane, and John Dickerson, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, received the $60,000 award as part of the Google Research Scholars program, an initiative by Google to support early career professors who are pursing research in fields relevant to Google.
“Our work aims to operationalize and incorporate responsible AI practices and techniques into real-world systems, informed by data from real processes at our two universities,” Mattei said.  “We’re not going to develop a solution in a year. Our intention is to produce an open-source toolkit, preliminary studies and whitepaper to be discussed by policymakers.”
“This research directly addresses questions of transparency, constraints, and fairness when working with complex, multi-stage decision-making problems.""
Nicholas Mattei, assistant professor of computer science at Tulane
The work is an outgrowth of their recent paper, “We Need Fairness and Explainability in Algorithmic Hiring,” presented virtually at the 2020 Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems Conference.
“Our proposal focuses on graduate admissions but is broadly applicable to any problem where we need to expend a limited set of resources to validate and select a small group,” Mattei said.
In focusing specifically on graduate admissions, a form of academic hiring, Mattei and Dickerson will look at two key factors related to admissions — how to allocate aspects of the process, such as budget and interview slots, and how to explain decisions made by their algorithm in a transparent and compliant way.
“Several recent reports related to algormithic hiring, including one from the non-profit UpTurn, motivates us to focus on how to allocate additional human resources to these problems, and we feel that we must treat issues of bias and fairness as first-order concerns in any system that may have an impact on people,” Dickerson said.
“This research directly addresses questions of transparency, constraints, and fairness when working with complex, multi-stage decision making problems where we need to end up with a recommendation or selection at the end. This type of sequential decision-making problem is typically optimized using multi-armed bandit algorithms,” Mattei said. “But these algorithms may optimize for criteria that we may not intend, or may not even be legal.”
Such algorithms are in widespread use across many of Google’s core areas, including recommendation and advertising and hence understanding them in detail is critically important, he said.
Mattei and Dickerson believe their work will support their thesis that data-driven approaches to measuring and promoting fairness at a single stage of the talent sourcing process can be extended beyond graduate admissions. They said the technologies could be applied to internal product ideation and review, academic proposal reviewing, advertising selection or any setting that involves the collection of recommendations from experts.
“We envision these as algorithms and workflows that could be deployed both internally at Google or offered broadly as screening tools throughout GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and other Google products.”
Mattei and Dickerson have worked closely together for many years, and the fact that they work at two very different academic institutions — one a large public university in a wealthy geographic area and the other a smaller private university in a lower income part of the country — will actually be an advantage in their research.
“The student application profiles at both schools are very different, and will lead to different concerns and distributions of data” Mattei said. “We believe this diversity strengthens the results that will arise from the data-driven validation of our model.”

But it is still hard to understand. BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.In this article, we will go a step further and try to explain BERT Transformers. BERT is one of the most popular NLP models that utilizes a Transformer at its core and which achieved State of the Art performance on many NLP tasks including Classification, Question Answering, and NER Tagging when it was first introduced.Big Data JobsSpecifically, we will try to go through the highly influential BERT paper — Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding while keeping the jargon to a minimum.What is BERT?In simple words, BERT is an architecture that can be used for a lot of downstream tasks such as question answering, Classification, NER etc. One can assume a pre-trained BERT as a black box that provides us with H = 768 shaped vectors for each input token(word) in a sequence. Here, the sequence can be a single sentence or a pair of sentences separated by the separator [SEP] and starting with a token [CLS]. We will get into explaining these tokens in more detail in later stages.A very High view of BERT — We get a 768 sized vector for all words in our input sentence.What is the Use of a BERT Blackbox?A BERT model works like how most Deep Learning models for ImageNet work.First, we train the BERT model on a large corpus (Masked LM Task), and then we finetune the model for our own task which could be classification, Question Answering or NER, etc. by adding a few extra layers at the end.For example, we would train BERT first on a corpus like Wikipedia (Masked LM Task) and then Fine Tune the model on our own data to do a classification task like classifying reviews as negative or positive or neutral by adding a few extra layers. In practice, we just use the output from the [CLS] token for the classification task. So, the whole architecture for fine-tuning looks like this:We just use the [CLS] Token output for classification along with some added Linear and Softmax Layers.In other similarly published articles on transformers, all Deep Learning is just Matrix Multiplication, where we just introduce a new W layer having a shape of (H x num_classes = 768 x 3) and train the whole architecture using our training data and Cross-Entropy loss on the classification.We could have also acquired the sentence features through the last layer and then just run a Logistic regression classifier on top or take an average of all the outputs and then run a logistic regression on top. There are many possibilities, and what works best will depend on the data for the task.In the above example, we explained how you could do Classification using BERT. In pretty much similar ways, one can also use BERT for Question Answering and NER based Tasks. We will get to the architectures used for various tasks in a few sections below.Trending AI Articles:1. Why Corporate AI projects fail?2. How AI Will Power the Next Wave of Healthcare Innovation?3. Machine Learning by Using Regression Model4. Top Data Science Platforms in 2021 Other than KaggleHow is this Different Than Embedding?This is a great question. Essentially, BERT just provides us with contextual-bidirectional embeddings.Let’s unpack what that means:Contextual: The embeddings of a word are not static. That is, they depend on the context of words around it. So in a sentence like “one bird was flying below another bird”, the two embeddings of the word “bird” will be different.Bi-Directional: While directional models in the past like LSTM’s read the text input sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left), the Transformer actually reads the entire sequence of words at once and thus is considered bidirectional.So, for a sentence like “BERT model is awesome.” the embeddings for the word “model” will have context from all the words “BERT”, “Awesome”, and “is”.How Does It Work?Now that we understand the basics, we will divide this section into three major parts: Architecture, Inputs, and Training.1. ArchitectureThis is the most simple part to understand if you’re familiar with this post on Transformers. BERT is essentially just made up of stacked up encoder layers.In the paper, the authors have experimented with two models:BERT Base: Number of Layers L=12, Size of the hidden layer, H=768, and Self-attention heads, A=12 with Total Parameters=110MBERT Large: Number of Layers L=24, Size of the hidden layer, H=1024, and Self-attention heads, A=16 with Total Parameters=340M2. Training InputsInputs to BERT. SourceWe give inputs to BERT using the above structure. The input consists of a pair of sentences, called sequences, and two special tokens: [CLS] and [SEP].So, in this example, for two sentences “my dog is cute” and “he likes playing”, BERT first uses wordpiece tokenization to convert the sequence into tokens and adds the [CLS] token in the start and the [SEP] token in the beginning and end of the second sentence, so the input is:The wordpiece tokenization used in BERT necessarily breaks words like playing into “play” and “##ing”. This helps in two ways:It helps limit the size of Vocabulary as we don’t have to keep the various forms of words like playing, plays, player etc. in our vocabulary.It helps us with out-of-vocab words. For example, if plays don’t occur in the vocabulary, we might still have embeddings for play and ##sToken Embeddings: We then get the Token embeddings by indexing a Matrix of size 30000x768(H). Here, 30000 is the Vocab length after wordpiece tokenization. The weights of this matrix would be learned while training.Token Embeddings come by indexing a matrix of size VocabxH.Segment Embeddings: For tasks such as question answering, we should specify which segment this sentence is from. These are either all 0 vectors of H length if the embedding is from sentence 1, or a vector of 1’s if the embedding is from sentence 2.Segment embedding are all 0’s or all 1’s vector specifying 1st Sentence or 2nd Sentence.Position Embeddings: These are the embeddings used to specify the position of words in the sequence, the same as we did in the transformer architecture. So we essentially have a constant matrix with some preset pattern. This matrix has the number of columns as 768. The first row of this matrix is the embedding for token [CLS], the second row is embedding for the word “my”, the third row is embedding for the word “dog” and so on.Patterns are used to specify word position.So the Final Input given to BERT is Token Embeddings + Segment Embeddings + Position Embeddings.3. Training Masked LM:We finally reach the most interesting part of BERT here, as this is where most of the novel concepts are introduced. We will try to explain these concepts by going through various architecture attempts and finding faults with each of them to arrive at the final BERT architecture.Attempt 1: So, for example, if we set up BERT training as below:Attempt 1: Predict all words.We try to predict each word of the input sequence using our training data with Cross-Entropy loss.Can you guess a potential problem with this approach?The problem is that the learning task is trivial.The network knows beforehand what it has to predict, and it can thus easily learn weights to reach a 100% classification accuracy.Attempt 2: Masked LM: This starts the beginning of the paper’s approach to overcoming the previous approach’s problem. We mask 15% random words in each training input sequence and just predict output for those words. In Pictorial terms:Attempt 2: Predict only masked words.Thus the loss gets calculated only over masked words. So now the model learns to predict words it hasn’t seen while seeing all the context around those words.Please note, we have masked 3 words here even when we should mask just 1 word as 15% of 8 is 1 to explain in this toy example.Can you find the problem with this approach?This model has essentially learned that it should predict good probabilities for only the [MASK] token. That is at the prediction time or at the fine-tuning time when this model will not get [MASK] as input; the model won’t predict good contextual embeddings.Attempt 3: Masked LM with random Words:In this attempt, we will still mask 15% of the positions. But we will replace any word in 20% of those masked tokens by some random word. We do this because we want to let the model know that we still want some output when the word is not a [MASK] token. So if we have a sequence of length 500, we will mask 75 tokens(15% of 500), and in those 75 tokens, 15 tokens(20 % of 75) would be replaced by random words. Pictorially, here we replace some of the masks by random words.Attempt 3: Predict masked words and Random Words.Advantage: The network will still work with any word now.Problem: The network has learned that Input Word is never equal to the Output word. That is the output vector at the position of “random word” would never be “random word.”Attempt 4: Masked LM with Random Words and Unmasked WordsTo solve this problem, the authors suggest the below training setup.The training data generator chooses 15% of the token positions at random for prediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace the i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of the time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3) the unchanged i-th token 10% of the timeSo if we have a sequence of length 500, we will mask 75 tokens(15% of 500), and in those 75 tokens, 7 tokens(10 % of 75) would be replaced by random words, and 7 tokens (10% of 75) will be used as it is. Pictorially, we replace some of the masks with random words and replace some of the masks by actual words.Attempt 4: Predict masked words, Random Words and Unmasked Words.So, now we have the best setup where our model doesn’t learn any unsavory patterns.But what if we keep only Mask + Unmask Setup? The model will learn that whenever the word is present, just predict that word.4. Training Additional NSP TaskFrom the BERT paper:Many important downstream tasks such as Question Answering (QA) and Natural Language Inference (NLI) are based on understanding the relationship between two sentences, which is not directly captured by language modeling. In order to train a model that understands sentence relationships, we pre-train for a binarized next sentence prediction task that can be trivially generated from any monolingual corpus.So, now we understand the Masked LM task, BERT Model also has one more training task which goes in parallel while Training Masked LM task. This task is called Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). So while creating the training data, we choose the sentences A and B for each training example such that 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A (labelled as IsNext), and 50% of the time it is a random sentence from the corpus (labelled as NotNext). We then use the CLS token output to get the binary loss which is also back propagated through the network to learn the weights.Training BERT with NSP taskSo we have got the BERT model now that can provide us with contextual embeddings. How can we use it for various tasks?Fine Tuning for Relevant TaskWe already have seen how we can use BERT for the classification task by adding a few layers on top of the [CLS] output and fine tuning the weights.BERT Finetuning for ClassificationHere is how we can use BERT for other tasks, from the paper:Source: BERT PaperLet’s go through each of them one by one.Sentence Pair Classification tasks — This is pretty similar to the classification task. That is add a Linear + Softmax layer on top of the 768 sized CLS output.Single Sentence Classification Task — Same as aboveSingle Sentence Tagging Task — This is pretty similar to the setup we use while training BERT, just that we need to predict some tags for each token rather than the word itself. For example, for a POS Tagging task like predicting Noun, Verb, or Adjective, we will just add a Linear layer of size (768 x n_outputs) and add a softmax layer on top to predict.Question Answering Tasks — This is the most interesting task and would need some more context to understand how BERT is used to solve it. In this task, we are given a question and a paragraph in which the answer lies. The objective is to determine the start and end span for the answer in the paragraph.BERT Finetuning for Question-Answer TaskSo in the above example, we define two vectors S and E (which will be learned during fine-tuning) both having shapes(1x768). We then take a dot product of these vectors with the second sentence’s output vectors from BERT, giving us some scores. We then apply Softmax over these scores to get probabilities. The training objective is the sum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and end positions. Mathematically, for the Probability vector for Start positions:where T_weis the word we are focusing on. An analogous formula is for End positions.To predict a span, we get all the scores — S.T and E.T and get the best span as the span having the maximum Score, that is max(S.T_we+ E.T_j) among all j≥i.Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",,https://becominghuman.ai/bert-transformers-how-do-they-work-cd44e8e31359,2021-04-12T14:22:34.757Z,2022-01-07T02:37:57.194Z,,BERT Transformers — How Do They Work? - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['James Montantes'],,,,cd44e8e31359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Software for artificial intelligence 



Machine learning, neural networks and artificial intelligence have become dominant themes in the development of applications, bots, programs, and services. 
Regardless of whether you are a simple developer, a startup, or already a large company, you need the right tools to get the job done. That is why, Gartner predicted that 80% of emerging technologies will have AI foundations by 2021.
In addition, as a result of its popularity, the developer community itself has grown, which also led to the emergence of AI frameworks, making it much easier to study artificial intelligence!
Artificial intelligence (AI) is slowly becoming more mainstream, as companies amass large amounts of data and look for the right technologies to analyze and leverage it.
Large and small retailers can use data science to predict goods demand during a certain period of time and place or analyze sentiments about a company, product, and service, or brand.


So you may find it useful to visit this website and learn more about data science frameworks that can help you launch any data science project.
In this post, we’ll talk about the best software that can help you develop and learn about artificial intelligence.
TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open source, comprehensive machine learning platform. Like most deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow has a Python API on top of the C and C ++ engine, making it faster.
TensorFlow has a flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources. This allows researchers to use the most advanced ML technologies, and developers to create and deploy applications based on machine learning.
The platform provides intuitive high-level APIs like Keras with fast execution, allowing immediate model iteration and easy debugging.
Due to its multi-platform nature, the solution allows you to train and deploy models in the cloud and locally, regardless of the language used by the user.
PyTorch
PyTorch is an open source Python machine learning framework that provides GPU-accelerated tensor computing. The framework is suitable for rapid prototyping in research, as well as for hobbyists and small projects.
The framework offers dynamic computation graphs that allow you to handle variable length input and output, which is useful, for example, when working with recurrent neural networks.
By deeply integrating the framework with C ++ code, developers can program in C and C ++ using the FFI-based Python API Extension.
Unlike TensorFlow, PyTorch is less flexible in supporting multiple platforms. It also lacks native data visualization tools, but has a third-party counterpart called tensorboardX.
Keras
Keras is an open source deep learning framework written in Python. The framework is aimed at operational work with neural networks and is compact, modular and extensible.
Suitable for small projects, since it is difficult to create something large-scale on it and it will obviously lose in the performance of neural networks to the same TensorFlow.
Keras works on top of TensorFlow, CNTK and Theano and provides an intuitive API that our engineers believe is the best of its kind so far.
The framework contains numerous implementations of widely used building blocks of neural networks, such as layers, target and transfer functions, optimizers, as well as many tools to simplify the work with images and text.
Darknet
Darknet is an open source framework written in C using the CUDA hardware / software parallel computing architecture. It’s fast, lightweight and easy to use. Darknet also supports CPU and GPU computing.
The Darknet stores the trained weights in a format that can be recognized using different methods on different platforms. However, this can be a problem if you decide to train a model on one heavy duty equipment and then use it on another.
Since the framework is written in C and has no other API, then in the case when the platform requirements or your own preferences force you to turn to another programming language, you will have to additionally fuss over its integration.
In addition, it is only distributed in source format, and the compilation process on some platforms can be somewhat problematic.
Caffe
Caffe is a deep learning framework. It is made with the expectation of expressiveness, speed and modularity. Initially, the framework was created for machine vision projects, but has since evolved and is now used for other tasks, including speech recognition and working with multimedia.
The main advantage of Caffe is speed. The framework is entirely written in C ++, supports CUDA, and, if necessary, can switch the processing flow between the processor and the video card. The package includes a set of free and open source reference models for standard classification tasks.
Caffe2, the second iteration of Facebook’s Caffe framework, originally designed for machine vision, now includes other uses such as speech and multimedia. The main features of Caffe2 are speed and modularity, so the framework is written primarily in C ++.
Microsoft Azure ML Studio
Given the massive amount of data and processing power required for machine learning, clouds are an ideal environment for ML applications. Azure ML Studio allows you to create and train models, turn them into APIs to provide other services.
One user account can be allocated up to 10 GB of storage space, although you can connect your own Azure storage. A wide variety of algorithms are available, both created by Microsoft and third parties.
To try the service, you don’t even need to create an account, you just need to sign in anonymously, and you can run Azure ML Studio for eight hours.
Microsoft Azure ML Studio allows users to create and train models, turn them into APIs and use them in other services. The free version has 10 GB of storage for training data.
The service includes many training algorithms from both Microsoft and third-party companies.
AI means integrating more data sources and using that data to improve the prioritization, personalization and content of marketing campaigns using machine learning algorithms.
An effective AI will eventually become an integral part of a successful and profitable business.

This initiative by the Mumbai-headquartered Sapio Analytics, a data management company, for the restoration and preservation of Ajanta paintings with the help of modern technology is in tandem with efforts that have been in the process all around the globe.

The digitized form of these paintings, the Ajanta Caves in India's Aurangabad district, are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They are being preserved on an island called Svalbard, in Norway, as part of a project called Arctic World Archive.

Along with the Ajanta paintings, digital artifacts from around the world such as manuscripts from the Vatican library, political histories, masterpieces from different eras, scientific breakthroughs and contemporary culture treasures, are also being preserved.




Ajanta paintings are being preserved with the help of modern technology


If one was to delve a little deeper into the process of this initiative of digitization by Sapio Analytics, which also has its operations in the UK and Silicon Valley, they have used a dataset of reference work to develop the AI mannequin, called Ancient AI.

Balkrishna Choolun, Indian-origin co-founder of Ajantahc and chairman of UITV, based in London said, ""We believe that this is India's century, and our cultural history should be available to the world.""

He added, ""Both Sapio Analytics and UITV have joined forces to digitize, restore and preserve for eternity ancient Indian heritage associated with the culture, artworks, and artifacts of India and other Asian countries.""

""Furthermore, we are also going to promote contemporary Indian artists' works to our global audience,"" Choolun said.

Experts from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee who have been selected for this project, have developed this AI which uses a deep-learning technique to restore the damaged murals of the Ajanta Caves.

The experts believe that digital restoration does not alter the original artwork, and at the helm of this work are artwork historians who are well versed in the field so that the restoration aligns with the original work on the masterpieces.

Not just that, the team working on the restoration efforts also includes photographers, artists, and culture experts, including new-age technology experts.

How does this restoration work?

A damaged area of a mural, for instance, is restored by altering the pixels of the damaged elements through mathematical inference of the neighbouring undamaged part. High-end pixel-level scanning of documented photographs of the original artwork helps in the digitization process. This, therefore, is a combination of manual digital restoration and artificially intelligent trained restoration.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://swirlster.ndtv.com/travel/world-famous-ajanta-cave-paintings-are-being-preserved-using-artificial-intelligence-ai-2408966'}",,2021-04-15T14:54:42+05:30,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://swirlster.ndtv.com/search?q={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",,https://swirlster.ndtv.com/images/slogo.jpg,"['https://www.facebook.com/Swirlster-267394580446021', 'https://twitter.com/swirlster', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjxlc2qJZyugzZ6Dc3Xt8WQ', 'https://www.instagram.com/Swirlster_official']",,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://swirlster.ndtv.com/', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://swirlster.ndtv.com/travel', 'name': 'Travel'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://swirlster.ndtv.com/travel/world-famous-ajanta-cave-paintings-are-being-preserved-using-artificial-intelligence-ai-2408966', 'name': 'detail'}}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NDTV Swirlster,,,,,,

Amazon pushed back aggressively against critics on Twitter, at one point combatively deriding Rep.

April 14, 2021
SLIPPERY ROCK, Pa. — Computer science students at Slippery Rock University are now adding Pepper to their resumes. But we're not talking about the condiment they would put on their food. Rather, they are becoming ""seasoned"" programmers by working with Pepper, which is the name of a semi-humanoid, emotional robot manufactured by SoftBank Robotics.
SRU's College of Health, Engineering and Science acquired Pepper for use in the Computer Science Department's Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
""It's incredibly rare for a school like ours to have this type of robot,"" said Sam Thangiah, professor of computer science and department chair. ""Our students are very fortunate to get hands-on programming experience with an emotional robot like this. Working in this lab on this project is going to provide them with an important edge when they are looking for jobs or applying to graduate schools.""
Standing 4 feet tall and weighing 60 pounds, Pepper has human qualities such as a head with two eyes, a torso and two arms and hands with fingers. It's equipped with high-definition cameras, sonars, gyroscopes and others sensors that allow it to interact with humans and collect data by mapping its surroundings as it moves around on its wheeled base. Pepper communicates by voice and a 10-inch touchscreen display on its chest.
""Especially since (the COVID-19 pandemic), these robots continue to be more prevalent,"" Thangiah said. ""They are sanitizing warehouses and interacting with people in places like airports, telling people which gate number they should go to and other tasks. It can autonomously take over an entire job because it can understand speech.""
Students from Thangiah's Artificial Intelligence class this semester are programming Pepper to greet people on the second-floor hallway of SRU's Advanced Technology and Science Hall. For example, a visitor could ask to be directed to Thangiah's office or the Robotics/IA lab.
""It is definitely a unique experience to do this type of higher-level programming and troubleshooting,"" said Wayne Bloom, a senior computing major from Everett. ""There's a lot of self-learning and pushing through frustrations that goes into something that is fairly new technology. And it's cool to work with a piece of equipment that's able to talk back to you.""


   THANGIAH

For most of the students in the 400-level AI class, their time in the lab is the only in-person class activity they'll have all semester, with 80% of SRU's classes conducted online this semester because of COVID-19. Bloom, along with Christian Carr, a senior computing major from Pittsburgh, and Jeffrey McFarland, a senior computing major from New Castle, spend about four hours per week working together in the lab programming Pepper and using operating software called Choregraphe. Their IA class is conducted online.
""I can teach them things online, but to actually implement it on a real-life device takes a lot of dedication,"" Thangiah said. ""That is what employers are looking for, to know that they can give someone a project and that they can stick with it, see it through and deliver. (Our students) are learning skills like persistence and tenacity that they don't even realize.""
Carr was recently hired for a full-time, summer internship as an application developer for Highmark in Pittsburgh. He said his interviewers were particularly interested in his work with Pepper. Bloom and McFarland are also interested in software engineering positions.
In future semesters, more students will be able to work with Pepper in other classes and outside of class through a Robotics Group organized within the department. The Robotics/IA Laboratory at SRU already has several robot kits and 11 smaller, two-legged humanoid robots, called NAO, which were also developed by SoftBank Robotics.
""But something like (Pepper) is far more advanced,"" McFarland said. ""It's very exciting to be stepping into this world of AI and it's something I didn't expect when I signed up for this class.""
More information about computer science programs at SRU are available on the department's webpage.

Professor Sir Keith Burnett FRS writes following the Royal Society's recent workshop with the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Artificial Intelligence.


I would like to begin by saying how very pleased I was to be asked by the Royal Society to write this blog following our recent workshop with the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Artificial Intelligence (PDF).Beyond the impact of the pandemic - and partly accelerated by it - few subjects are as fundamental and challenging for Science and wider society than the impact of technology on our lives and work. Artificial intelligence in particular feels like a new frontier with uncertain consequences. Questions about the impact of AI on our lives abound. Many of them are sparked by the fear and insecurity which often accompany transformational change. Will I still be able to get a job or will technology make it redundant? Will AI ease our problems or create new and disturbing changes to our experience as citizens? What sort of privacy can we expect and who will decide how these technologies are used for good?Sometimes change comes into our lives without warning. Since the beginning of 2020, Covid-19 has been transforming the world we knew, and its implications are not yet fully clear. A major shift to greater reliance on technology feels inevitable in everything from retail to healthcare and education to the economy. There are other external changes to consider too. Sadly, we cannot help but be aware of heightened political tensions between China and the collection of very different nations we call ‘the West’.So it was an intense and timely pleasure to sit down, courtesy of Zoom, with leading scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Fellows of the Royal Society, to talk about the real issues and questions we see, rather than the lurid tales of science fiction and sensationalist headlines. We came together with a common understanding that technology and AI present some huge and significant challenges for the most important Science we can undertake. But we also recognised there were many unknowns. What can it actually achieve? What are its most important capabilities?As scientists who share a commitment to questions and seeking evidence, we were wary of assuming that our starting place is all it should be, no matter its promise. Are the AI tools we have at the moment really able to address the key problems of Science in this age? I sensed between us both possibility and trepidation. For hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, progress in Science has owed much to breakthroughs in technologies which allow us to explore the universe and ourselves - telescopes and microscopes, lasers and the great Hadron Collider. Just think of those who have opened new vistas of understanding, since the Royal Society was founded in 1660 as an ‘invisible college’ of natural philosophers and physicians committed to verify all statements by an appeal to facts determined by experiment. Let’s take one relatively recent example from the period of my own career as a scientist. A tool designed in the late 1980s to facilitate the sharing of information between physicists at CERN by my colleague Tim Berners-Lee, revolutionised the sharing of information across the world. The World Wide Web gave us an extraordinary ability to make connections and share our insights in new ways.These new technologies continue that trajectory of digital transformation. In recent years we have seen the triumphant success of data analysis and the importance of neural nets. Computer packages tailored for use by scientists have been underpinned by the phenomenal growth of cloud based super computers, amplifying our ability to analyse at speed. Yet as scientists, we are right to be wary of too much hype. We need to be sure we aren’t neglecting the areas where our current capacity is inadequate. Scientists in the UK and China are right to be especially mindful that we do not limit how we frame problems or constrain our understanding of how to address the challenges we face. We should admit that we still know very little about how AI really works within the wider context of Science and why it is so extraordinarily effective at resolving some problems and not others. At such a moment, we require humility and openness. This is another reason to come together with our colleagues from across the world. We are all at the foothills of this field of endeavour, and our own perspectives may be inadequate or vulnerable to cultural blind spots. This is a time to learn together. True the potential of AI is inspiring. In my own experience of mentoring early career scientists from around the world, I’ve had a ring-side seat at the extraordinary impact of machine learning techniques on Science and Medicine. For a young scientist, getting to grips with machine learning is now a capability in many fields. The importance of this fact has led Schmidt Futures to work with Neil Lawrence at Cambridge University on a new Centre to train scientists in these vital techniques. In China, similarly exciting work is underway. The Institute of Automation in Beijing has opened a new centre for brain-inspired intelligence and China has begun planning for new generation AI. This means closing the technology gap with leading countries, funding research, advancing technological development and applications at leading level by 2025, and aiming to be a global leader in research and ethical principles for AI development by 2030. This will demand a combination of basic research, technology development, infrastructure and education but - if our discussions at the Royal Society are anything to go by - there is serious commitment from China to achieving these aims. Yet how sad it would be for Science and the world if we undertook this work on parallel tracks rather than in dialogue with one another. The coming together of our two great scientific bodies is a precious signal that we want to avoid this error. We are thinking as colleagues about what we really need for the future from technology but also from ourselves. These are not necessarily technological questions, but human ones. What’s missing in our understanding? How can we ensure we do not overlook the significance of the ‘roads not taken’? Coming together from our different perspectives and cultures reminds us not to be complacent about how we frame such questions. I think of my long conversations over the years with my Chinese colleagues about the significance of Science to improving the lives of our fellow human beings, and it gives me hope that we can put this powerful technology to good use. Humility is an important starting point for each of us. Just think of the scale of work on AI in China, a country with 30 times the UK population. What would it mean for the world if China were, with us as partners, to truly understand the role of machine learning in smart cities, the efficient use of energy or assessing infection and disease in a vast and changing demographic? What matters is not the AI race but its human purpose. As Chinese and UK scientists came together, we reminded one another there are enormous benefits in having trusted collaborations. This means focusing on AI’s benefits and avoiding its risks – including those which we might not anticipate but are of concerns to others.But I would remind those of us in the UK, that it would be absurd to try contain thinking about AI in the UK or any political domain when almost every one of us has a handheld computer called a smartphone largely made in China. Instead, we need and want to understand how other nations will think about these issues. How will we have those crucial scientific, practical and ethical discussions? In my role as chair of the Nuffield Foundation, I have seen international efforts to create a place where issues can be addressed head on. It’s why we founded the Ada Lovelace Institute as an independent agency along the lines of the Nuffield Council for Bioethics, to consider issues on behalf of all our citizens. Public opinion on AI is also changing.  Western concerns for the primacy of individual privacy and autonomy, for example, are being revisited in the light of the potential to reopen society from the Covid lockdown. Newspapers report on debates about the potential value of vaccine passports, for example. Could we learn from one another now? I certainly listened carefully to the experiences our Chinese Academy of Sciences colleagues as they explained the benefits of health tracking to the citizens of Beijing. Health is, of course, the most immediate and obvious example of the benefits of AI. We have seen wonderful breakthroughs in the identification of diseases such as cancer. Machine learning is rapid and uniquely adept at finding the ‘needle in the haystack’ and in recognising tumours in the human body. By comparing individual images against vast data sets, diagnosis can happen with an accuracy and speed that allows for more effective early intervention. Now we are thinking about how it can help the fight against Covid as we race to contain infection and get ahead of new variants. The history of science teaches that it is very difficult to know where a new technology will lead, owing as much to those who deploy it as the technique itself. Development that are important to medicine, energy, the production of food or insights into the universe, have been used to improve lives and to destroy them. There is no simple way to ensure we make the right choices about how we use AI, but by working together, we will have a better crack at it.The history of the Royal Society is a proud one recognised and honoured by our Chinese friends. Its Fellows have included Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Hawking, Dorothy Hodgkin, Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Tim Berners-Lee. But our understanding is incomplete if we only look for answers within our own number. The mathematics we employ owes much to the Islamic world and the Middle-East. The great physicist Bose was of Indian ancestry, as was our former President Sir Venki Ramakrishnan. The transformative anti-malarial drug artemisinin has its origins in Chinese traditional medicine. It led to Youyou Tu being awarded the Nobel Prize in 2015 for discovering the properties of qinghaosu from the qinghao plant. Now more than ever our scientific endeavour needs to be shaped by a willingness to learn from one another. Of its proud history the Royal Society explains, “We backed James Cook’s journey to track the Transit of Venus. We published the first report in English of inoculation against disease, approved Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine and published Chadwick’s detection of the neutron that would lead to the unleashing of the atom.” As we stand now at another scientific frontier, I am deeply grateful that the Royal Society continues to look outwards, and that our endeavour is one which is open to the questions and insights of scientists of every nation. Our fellow scientists of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have much to teach us. It is this approach of learning from and with one another which will allow us to make the very best of the remarkable powers AI will give us.

The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a somewhat catch-all term that refers to the different possibilities offered by recent technological developments. From machine learning to natural language processing, news organisations can use AI to automate a huge number of tasks that make up the chain of journalistic production, including detecting, extracting and verifying data, producing stories and graphics, publishing (with sorting, selection and prioritisation filters) and automatically tagging articles.
These systems offer numerous advantages: speed in executing complex procedures based on large volumes of data; support for journalistic routines through alerts on events and the provision of draft texts to be supplemented with contextual information; an expansion of media coverage to areas that were previously either not covered or not well covered (the results of matches between ‘small’ sports clubs, for example); optimisation of real-time news coverage; strengthening a media outlet’s ties with its audiences by providing them with personalised context according to their location or preferences; and more.
But there is a flipside to the coin: the efficiency of these systems depends on the availability and the quality of data fed into them. The principle of garbage in, garbage out (GIGO), tried and tested in the IT world, essentially states that without reliable, accurate and precise input, it is impossible to obtain reliable, accurate and precise output.
News automation is the most visible aspect of this phenomenon and has undoubtedly given rise to the most heated debates within the journalistic profession. The idea of ‘robot journalism’ as it is often called has contributed to visions both dystopian and utopian.

At its worst, automation could threaten jobs and journalistic identity by taking over work usually done by humans. At its best, it could lead to a renewal of journalism by taking over repetitive and time-consuming tasks, freeing up journalists to focus on producing content with high added value.

But the automation of journalistic production methods is not limited to the generation of texts. The BBC recently introduced a synthetic voice to read aloud the articles published on its website; last year, Reuters launched an automated video system to cover sports matches.
No AI without human and financial resources
In his 2019 survey of 71 news organisations in 32 countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia, Charlie Beckett, director of the Journalism AI project, reported that nearly four out of ten organisations have already deployed artificial intelligence strategies. The main obstacles to the development of these technologies lie in cultural resistance linked to fears regarding job loss and changing work routines, and sometimes even general hostility to technology. But they are also linked to the high cost of development, which explains why larger companies have greater access to them.
In what could be seen as a charm offensive aimed at easing tensions with newspaper publishers who criticise Google for using their content without compensation, the Google Digital News Innovation Fund has made significant contributions to funding projects in Europe that explore the possibilities of new technologies. At the time of the fund’s launch in 2015, Carlo D’Asaro Biondo, president of strategic partnerships at Google Europe, said the following: “I firmly believe that Google has always wanted to be a friend and partner to the news industry, but I also accept we’ve made some mistakes along the way.” Google DNI has gone on to support no less than 662 projects to the tune of €150 million.
One such project is RADAR (Reporters and Data and Robots) in the UK, which received funding of €706,000. According to the project’s website: “We have built the world’s only automated local news agency. We provide data-driven articles to hundreds of news websites, papers and radio stations across the United Kingdom.” The service is not entirely automated: A team of journalists work closely with the algorithms to ensure editorial control.
In Italy, the SESAAB group received €400,000 to develop algorithms that organise content according to the behaviour of internet users. Its tailor-made recommendation system is intended to increase the volume of subscriptions and with it income so that the journalists at its regional newspapers are able to devote themselves to creating ‘high quality’ content.

There are ways to take advantage of AI tools that don’t require such substantial resources. In addition to technologies developed to meet the specific requirements of a given media outlet, natural language generation software packages are also available which are not particularly out of reach for a news organisation.

According to a report by consultancy firm Gartner, the cost of accessing these platforms ranges from US$250 to US$4,800 a year. Their main advantage lies in the control they offer their end users, who are able to determine the software’s parameters – from choosing data to the form that generated texts will take – without requiring specialised skills. Swiss media group Tamedia opted for this solution in order to automate reporting on popular vote results in Switzerland. The system is capable of generating around 40,000 articles within a few minutes. It took five political journalists two to three days of work to configure ‘Tobi’ as the textbot was called.
The challenges of employment and training
With experiments in automation on the rise, news agencies are amongst the most interested parties despite the rather limited areas that AI covers (sport, the economy, the environment and election results). In a 2017 study, Austrian journalist Alexander Fanta found that a majority of European news agencies had embraced automation. According to Fanta, “machine-written stories lack in depth and critical examination of the presented facts, but can provide a quick summary of news figures or a first version of a story.”
There is currently no evidence to suggest that the automation of news production is linked loss of employment. The only company that has resorted to mass redundancy in a move to ‘fully automate’ is tech giant Microsoft at its MSN News portal. But while rare, there is evidence to suggest that freelancers occasionally lose out on a job to automation, proof that there is no such thing as zero risk against a backdrop of economic fragility for the news media.
But while anxieties regarding employment are legitimate, it is important to remember that journalism is more than just the sum of its parts and the profession’s human character cannot be automated. Journalists provide more than just information. As former journalist and professor at the University of Porto Fernando Zamith argues: “Accuracy requires proper verification. Robots cannot get it right every time.”
Can a computer programme write better articles than a journalist? The Guardian reignited the debate in September 2020 when it published a text written entirely by GPT-3, a language generator developed by American company OpenAI. Despite the software’s prowess, capable of analysing 45 terabytes of data with its 175 billion parameters, it is not without limits. For example, the system does not understand what it is writing and is therefore susceptible to inconsistency. But GPT-3 has broken new ground by offering more in-depth narratives than more traditional language generators.

The danger here is that machines will take over work without human supervision, which is why it is important to develop new editorial skills to shape such systems.

According to researcher Nick Diakopoulos, the United States, which has been a pioneer in automated news, has already seen the emergence of new professional profiles, including work that is both upstream of automated systems (preparation of text templates to be automated, software parameterisation, data quality control) as well as downstream (monitoring of data and content quality).
Integrating these types of skills into journalism education presents a challenge given the large number of subjects that already make up a two-year master’s degree. It would require working on understanding what these algorithms are, studying elements of programming, statistics and probabilities, and addressing aspects related to linguistic engineering and data quality. It would also imply cultivating a necessary critical approach.
At the same time, many voices within academic circles are calling on journalists to develop computational thinking in order to facilitate dialogue with computer scientists. This type of thinking, which consists of breaking down logical problems into sequences, is comparable to journalistic routines, which are also characterised by a succession of choices (sources, angle, story) designed to solve a problem (telling a news story).
Embracing the phenomenon in order to shape its development
Considering that a computerised procedure is based on human choices, which are not neutral by definition, it is not absurd to think that the steps should also be taken in the opposite direction. The “new players in the world of journalism” are computer engineers, linguists and data scientists. Companies that provide the media with technological solutions do not consider themselves to be doing journalism even though they are actively involved in the journalistic production chain.
Professional organisations should reflect on how to conduct inclusive policies, insofar as the exercise of the news media’s social responsibility is as much individual as it is collective. The major challenges of integrating AI technologies into journalism are also in the field of ethics. As French economist Michel Volle writes: “The good and the evil lie in the intention, not in the tool.”
According to a 2017 study by the Tow Centre of Digital Journalism, AI technologies should integrate editorial values into their design. The report also stresses that “readers deserve to be given a transparent methodology of how AI tool were used to perform an analysis, identify a pattern, or report a finding. But that description must be translated into non-technical terms, and told in a concise manner…”.
At the end of 2020, the Council for Mass Media in Finland published a report recommending that the profession’s self-regulatory bodies should not delay in taking up the issues of data processing, choices in computerised procedures and transparency towards audiences. According to the report, if the media councils do not take the lead, others will: “And whoever it is – whether national legislators, the EU or platform companies – they might jeopardise the freedom of the press.”

This is definitely the future of journalism. Media house will need to invest more in media lab or Media academic for internal training and hire more young scientists with strong background in data and computing to drive the growing artificial Intelligence (AI) presence in news practice to power websites and raise the bar of journalism. It will mean more financial investment s at a time  traditional media is staring in a bleak future going by ongoing massive staff  retrenchments of seasoned scribes across the globe and made worse by Covid-pandemic.

The artificial intelligence industry is predicted to be worth $37.9 billion by 2024. Subsets and specialties within AI are developing at record speeds — especially in the remote work and work productivity sectors. Now, many executives are leaning on AI to enhance or support new remote work routines. 


For many executives, scheduling and email productivity may be impacted due to the sheer increase in the number of virtual meetings. So, how do busy executives find solutions to newly created problems? I spoke with Maitrik Kataria, cofounder of email platform Newton and Simform.com, and Dennis Mortensen, founder of scheduling platform x.ai to get their thoughts on how executives and their companies can better use emerging technology in an increasingly remote work environment. 

Shama Hyder: What are the biggest challenges facing executives in terms of time management, scheduling, and email management since Covid?

Dennis Mortensen: One of the more obvious challenges we’re facing is the transition from an asynchronous work environment to an asynchronous one. In a synchronous office setting, it’s easier to call for an impromptu meeting or collaborate brainstorming session. In an asynchronous one, it’s not as easy because you’re not in the same space as your team, so meetings have to be scheduled in advance. I think this is for the better. 

PROMOTED
Often, the need for an impromptu meeting is the symptom of a flawed process somewhere in the organization. We have to learn to better and more efficiently structure our companies to align with the new remote work environment. Communication is a big part of this. Try not to constantly interrupt people with a barrage of Slack messages, but plan out consistent meetings using software, like x.ai scheduling, to respect and empower your colleague’s preferences for when they would like to meet. 
Hyder: Do you think remote executives have struggled with the practice of not being in the office or having their executive assistant right outside their door? 
Mortensen: I think the Executive Assistant as we've known it is becoming a thing of the past. Working with an Executive Assistant is already a luxury that is only afforded to the very few. There are a lot of automated technologies available for communication and scheduling that complete tasks usually reserved for the Assistant.

Hyder: Why is AI part of the solution and how big of a role can it play with scheduling specifically?
Mortensen: I am a big fan of humans doing human work and machines doing machine work. Meaning, let technology automate and do what it does best, and give human beings the space to think creatively and collaboratively.

Hyder: The email management landscape is also changing because it’s an issue. How does Newton cater to an executive client?
Maitrik Kataria: The executive’s standard email experience typically involves more than one email address and device. Newton’s technology means no more switching back and forth: all your emails are in one place. It does more than just send and receive. You could snooze an email if you needed to and schedule an email you don’t want to send right away. Newton brings all the benefits of an executive assistant right into the place where you spend most of your day - your email.
Hyder: What “symptoms” signify that a mostly remote executive is experiencing issues with email and/or schedule?
Kataria: Focus and productivity are the most important benefits of a remote executive. In an office environment, you hire around an idea of offloading work and tasks that keep you on track. When an executive goes remote, they don’t have this support system to fall back on anymore and begin to be a lot more self-reliant. You don’t have anyone to remind you about that email you didn’t reply to, so Newton’s AI feature Recap intelligently detects these and reminds you. You don’t have anyone fielding your calls for you anymore, but Newton’s Tidy Inbox will filter your inbox on your behalf, removing all those spammy promo emails as distractions. With X.ai and Newton, you don’t even need a personal assistant to handle your calendar for you anymore, it’s right there, in your email, at the tap of a button. 
The future of automation and adaptive technologies is the future of work. As we continue to do business in environments that remain fully remote, and amid economic uncertainty, it is important to continually reevaluate your processes and see where you can be more efficient. That’s where these technologies come in and will continue to be major players in 2021 and beyond.

Robots are writing more of what we read on the internet. And artificial intelligence (AI) writing tools are becoming freely available for anyone, including students, to use. 
In a period of rapid change, there are enormous ethical implications for post-human authorship — in which humans and machines collaborate. The study of AI ethics needs to be central to education as we increasingly use machine-generated content to communicate with others.
Robots can write, too
AI robot writers, such as GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) take seconds to create text that seems like it was written by humans. In September, 2020 GPT-3 wrote an entire essay in The Guardian to convince people not to fear artificial intelligence.

AI does this through what’s called natural language processing and generation. This involves converting human language to computer commands and vice versa. To do this, machine algorithms study millions of text samples, words, sentences and paragraphs humans use to gain a general understanding of the context of human language. Then machines use that knowledge to put together text.
As recently as 2019, this kind of technology seemed a long way off. But today, it is readily available.
For example, the free Zyro content generator provides text for websites. I can select the categories “Health and Living” and “Personal Trainer” (I happen to be one, as well as an academic). In two seconds, the following text appears:

I am experienced with personal training, athletic performance, and nutrition. This includes working with children, pregnant women, older adults, people with disabilities, athletes, and anyone looking to achieve a competitive edge, improve their overall health, and overall performance. I also have an interest in alternative health, including wellness coaching and nutrition counselling. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family, the outdoors, and writing.

This sums me up (despite the program knowing nothing about me) and would be fine for my website, if I had one. I have the option to generate more responses, and in two seconds, the program offers:

I am experienced in working with adults and children to improve their overall physical and emotional well-being. I have a strong desire to help you reach your goal […] I love helping others achieve their goals. I love working with others to achieve their goals. I am a mother of two healthy children and a wife to two incredible people.

While this is repetitive and Zyro does not notice the apparent error in the last sentence, these issues would be easy to correct. Text, even for niche purposes, can now be generated in a few clicks. 
There are other digital tools such as paraphrasers and rewriters that can generate up to 1,000 articles from a single seed article, each of them substantially unique. Quillbot and WordAI, for instance, can rapidly rewrite text and make it difficult to detect plagiarism. WordAI boasts “unlimited human quality content at your fingertips”.
Questions for schools and universities
So what does this mean for education, writing, and society? 
Of course, there’s the issue of cheating on essays and other assignments. School and university leaders need to have difficult conversations about what constitutes “authorship” and “editorship” in the post-human age. We are all (already) writing with machines, even just via spelling and grammar checkers.
Tools such as Turnitin — originally developed for detecting plagiarism — are already using more sophisticated means of determining who wrote a text by recognising a human author’s unique “fingerprint”. Part of this involves electronically checking a submitted piece of work against a student’s previous work.
Many student writers are already using AI writing tools. Perhaps, rather than banning or seeking to expose machine collaboration, it should be welcomed as “co-creativity”. Learning to write with machines is an important aspect of the workplace “writing” students will be doing in the future.

      OK computer: to prevent students cheating with AI text-generators, we should bring them into the classroom




AI writers work lightning fast. They can write in multiple languages and can provide images, create metadata, headlines, landing pages, Instagram ads, content ideas, expansions of bullet points and search-engine optimised text, all in seconds. Students need to exploit these machine capabilities, as writers for digital platforms and audiences.
Perhaps assessment should focus more on students’ capacities to use these tools skilfully instead of, or at least in addition to, pursuing “pure” human writing.
But is it fair?
Yet the question of fairness remains. Students who can access better AI writers (more “natural”, with more features) will be able to produce and edit better text. 
Better AI writers are more expensive and are available on monthly plans or high one-off payments wealthy families can afford. This will exacerbate inequality in schooling, unless schools themselves provide excellent AI writers to all.
We will need protocols for who gets credit for a piece of writing. We will need to know who gets cited. We need to know who is legally liable for content and potential harm it may create. We need transparent systems for identifying, verifying and quantifying human content. 




      Read more:
      When does getting help on an assignment turn into cheating?




And most importantly of all, we need to ask whether the use of AI writing tools is fair to all students.
For those who are new to the notion of AI writing, it is worthwhile playing and experimenting with the free tools available online, to better understand what “creation” means in our robot future.

Artificial Intelligence in Logistics – Maximizing Operational Efficiency

By Mitul Makadia -   April 9, 2021 2 446 








With growing complexity and interconnectivity in the supply chain industry, technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning has become central to logistics management. Firms across the globe are increasingly implementing AI to streamline and optimize handling of logistics and inventory management.
Computers can handle huge sets of data at a time, which would otherwise be impossible to humanely take into a single decision-making process. This is why Artificial Intelligence is a boon to Supply Chain Management.
Using numerous data sets and applying intelligent algorithms, a machine can analyse endless possibilities that lead to effective strategizing. AI minimizes the risks of human error.
In short, with the help of AI, operational efficiency can be maximized and costs can be minimized. As per executives and experts within the field, the prediction is clear – AI is here to stay and will further transform these fields over the upcoming years.

Elucidated below are 8 ways AI is revolutionizing the supply chain and logistics management-


Inventory Management
Maintaining the Warehouse
Optimising Shipping Process
Supplier Relationship Management
Workforce Management
Transportation Management
Foreign Language Decoder
Reduced Customer Response Time

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
No business can run properly without a correctly maintained inventory. Both overstocking and understocking can be a detriment. With the right inventory management system, a business can simply concentrate on selling their product instead of managing its storage.
A crucial need for AI in inventory management, other than its ability to ensure the maintenance of stock, is its ability to predict demand. Algorithms are now capable of studying customer demands across vast chunks of data and understand which items will soon be in demand and which might fail to generate enough buzz. This is known as ‘demand forecasting’ and is widely used across businesses and online platforms around the world. Thus instead of relying on real-time demand, a business can be prepared beforehand and take stock accordingly. This has proven to be the most revolutionising aspect of AI in logistics.
MAINTAINING THE WAREHOUSE
With the rise in facial recognition in AI, machines are now capable of handling security. An unmanned warehouse can easily be kept safe by tracking all those who enter and leave it. Furthermore, machines can keep track of items being put on shelves and those leaving the warehouse by simply reading the barcode on the package and updating inventory accordingly.
Unmanned warehouses have taken the fancy of the bigwigs of the online selling game. So far, they have proven to be effective in emulating the methods of manned warehouses while being far more efficient by eliminating human error.
OPTIMISING SHIPPING PROCESS
The effectiveness of AI doesn’t simply diminish when the item leaves inventory. It is also used to predict the best possible shipping route. Machines use graph theory to predict the shipping routes that can balance between the fastest and most cost-effective for the company. This is especially handy for companies that service multiple customers as shipping routes are then predicted to minimise cost while maximising reach for as many customers as possible.
AI is also able to predict traffic conditions and peak hour situations. These are factors that affect a company’s shipping time. By avoiding peak hour traffic and scheduling delivery during the lightest traffic hours, one can ensure that their delivery executives spend less time waiting on roads and more time delivering to even more people. Thus, effectiveness, and in turn, profits are maximised.
SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT
Shipping and logistic management isn’t the only phase of the supply chain process that AI helps maintain. One of the most important aspects of any business is its supplier. Identifying the right suppliers and maintaining a list of each item, corresponding to those suppliers is important. When refilling inventory or recalibrating item needs according to demand, the relationship with one’s suppliers is the deciding factor of how smoothly the transaction will run.
AI can monitor supplier parameters such as cost, credit score, quantifiable past experiences such as delivery speed, and create a list of the best possible options for any given situation. This ensures that a business runs smoothly and the relationship between it and its suppliers remains effective, unbiased and cordial.
WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT
Needless to say, with an effective AI managing your supply chain, dependence on an administrative staff becomes minimum. However, this isn’t the only use case for AI in workforce management. Today, Artificial Intelligence is being effectively used in recruiting employees, training them on the job, monitoring day to day performance, rating their performance as well as segregating their strengths and weaknesses to ensure each employee is assigned to a task they are best suited for.
AI can help an organisation plan its hiring and training process more effectively. This allows for smooth day to day transactions on the floors of the organisation. It also makes the work assignments better suited, leading to happy employees.
TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT
It is usual practice for many businesses to enter into contracts with shipping companies to deliver their goods. Some bigger companies, such as Amazon also have their own shipping division. As we already discussed, AI makes the whole experience a lot smoother when it comes to time and efficiency management for shipping. However, there is a lot more that AI can do. Artificial Intelligence can take away all the issues arising from the human problem.

Whenever there are people driving delivery trucks, there is a limited amount of time they can function. Having multiple drivers on the same route, to cater to the need of a 24×7 delivery system, is expensive. This is where AI in logistics can prove to be a lifesaver by automating the whole driving function. In fact, one of the largest door to door delivery businesses in the world, Amazon, has already shown great faith in automated delivery vehicles. As of 2019, Amazon has a combined investment of over a billion US dollars in Tesla competitor Rivian and autonomous driving startup Aurora. If this is anything to go by, we can safely assume that AI will gradually play an even larger role in building a transportation management solution.
FOREIGN LANGUAGE DECODER
The world is a global village. Despite the language and cultural barriers, every part of the world is consuming everything the other parts serve. As a business today, you are expected to cater to a global audience. As a result, miscommunication is a common problem. And not just miscommunication between the business and the customer, understanding foreign products or market trends may be a problem, as well.
However, with AI, this barrier no longer exists. Moreover, AI customer support systems and chatbots are also far better equipped to handle foreign customers without a business having to go to the trouble of hiring too many offshore support executives. Overall, AI makes the job easier.
REDUCED CUSTOMER RESPONSE TIME
One of the aspects of AI that businesses across the world are now leveraging is its foray into customer service. Chatbots have reduced the customer response time to almost zero and have reduced the number of customer service representatives any business needs to support to a minimum. Apart from being always to the point, polite and effective, chatbots are also a blessing when it comes to dealing with foreign customers who aren’t native speakers of the languages a business supports. AI has ensured much faster and effective customer service and chatbots are one of the primary advancements of AI in logistics.
AI in Logistics Management – Need For Improvement
We have long discussed the advantages of having AI as a part of a business’ supply chain management. But there is still a need for improvement in certain areas of AI in logistics. One of the biggest drawbacks of integrating AI into your system is getting them to work with all the legacy software most established businesses work on. There is also the matter of skill gap. Most employees working with businesses are not well acquainted with the new age scripting languages that support AI and ML systems. This means the business must find apt talent to manage their systems.
Moreover, AI, in its current form, isn’t completely self-sufficient. It still needs human supervision. Given the large volume of data AI systems handle, any error in the system is crucial to spot and can hold a business at ransom if they are solely dependent on AI systems with no backup in place. As is the case with any computer software, there can be security issues affecting a system.
However, training and updating AI models over time with the right expertise can pave the path to determining superiority in the domain of supply chain management.
SOME LEADING COMPANIES THAT USE AI 

Rolls Royce
Back in 2017, Rolls Royce partnered up with Google to build autonomous ships. Using AI, much like self-driving cars, they tried creating ships that can function with a minimum crew. The idea was to replace crew members with intelligent machines that could load and unload cargo, navigate through the ocean, without needing human intervention. The final goal is to make shipping and delivery of goods even faster.
UPS
One of the leading parcel delivery companies, UPS, uses an AI-powered GPS called ORION (On-road Integrated Optimisation and Navigation) to find the fastest and most cost-efficient route for its fleet. With data submitted by customers, drivers, and vehicles, ORION uses an algorithm to detect the optimal route for each delivery. It is a real-time system that modifies the routes depending on current traffic and other conditions.
Marble
Marble is a logistics company that has taken the idea another step further. It uses robots that run on the same AI system as automated cars (LIDAR) to deliver goods to people’s doorsteps. It cuts down the risk of a driver, is environment-friendly, and a fast and cost-effective way of getting the work done.
Lineage
Lineage uses AI to manage its warehouses. The algorithm predicts which items will stay in the warehouse longer and which will leave soon. Based on this, the items that will stay longer are stored towards the back, and the ones that will leave quicker are kept in the front. Using this approach, Lineage has, in fact, increased its efficiency by over 20%.
THE FUTURE
Use of AI in logistics is a relatively new concept, and although it seems to be thriving, a very small percentage of businesses are using it as of now. The rise in the number of organisations that use AI has practically tripled over the past five to six years. By 2021, about 80% of the upcoming technologies will have their foundation in AI. The most investment in AI has been in customer relations as a part of supply chain management. In fact, more than 60% of people prefer to interact with chatbots than actual customer service representatives. 

Although the supply chain has taken a chunk of its volume, AI is hardly limited to warehouses and self-driving cars. It is there when Netflix or YouTube recommends a video or when Facebook shows you a holiday trip similar to the one you had been eyeing for months. AI is working in the background of our constant companions which is our phones. AI is everywhere.
Any business that does not leverage the best of AI in logistics, whether for shipping and logistics management or a transportation management solution, is simply giving up on its chance to grow and keep up with the competition. Choosing the right AI solution for your business is the first step towards future success.

The concern about an artificial intelligence, or AI, workforce shortage in the United States is rapidly becoming a top national security priority. Calls for additional legislative action are mounting as the national security community sees talent as a key enabler in outcompeting China. An increasing number of proposals, including those in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act and others based on the recommendations of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, have the goal of growing and cultivating the domestic AI workforce based on the premise of shortages. 
However, there is little data on actual U.S. AI labor market dynamics to inform whether there is an AI workforce shortage, and if so, what type and to what extent. Moreover, there is no standard definition of “AI workforce.” This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to determine which workers are in short supply and how to best address it.
Workforce shortages generally come in two distinct forms, which is important for targeting policy. The first is a skills shortage in the traditional economic sense: an insufficient supply of talent with specific, in-demand skills often due to high barriers to entry. For example, a critical AI occupation often discussed synonymously with “AI workforce,” computer research scientists, requires years of advanced education and training. Domestic supply is limited, and as a result, the United States also relies on foreign talent.
The second type is a local talent shortage, in an organization or geographic area. There are many possible reasons for local shortages — workers’ geographic preferences, state occupational licensing requirements and, at the organizational level, limited career advancement opportunities, poor hiring practices, uniquely specific skills and/or experience requirements, below market average wages and compensation, among others.
New CSET research provides insight into the reality of U.S. AI talent shortages. We assess the state of the U.S. AI workforce, analyzing traditional economic indicators like employment and wages. We use an occupation-based definition of the AI workforce, enabling analysis using occupational data collected by the federal government over time. We also consider the entire team of talent involved with the design, development and implementation of AI. 
To assess the extent of shortages, we focus on five key occupations: Computer and information research scientists; software developers; mathematicians, statisticians and data scientists; user experience designers and project management specialists.
Although it is difficult to make an evidence-based determination, we find three variations in workforce dynamics across the five occupations. First, extremely strong employment and wage growth for computer and information research scientists over 2015 to 2019, coupled with high barriers to entry, likely indicates there is more demand than supply. Second, in other high-demand occupations such as software developers and data scientists, our analysis suggests existing education pipelines have responded as designed to meet rising demand. Over 2015 to 2018, for example, computer science and engineering were the fastest growing undergraduate majors, adding more than 200,000 new graduates. Third, in the case of project management specialists and user experience designers, we do not find evidence of a gap in demand relative to supply. 
The divergent trends within the AI workforce have implications for future policy. Importantly, we need to prioritize growing, cultivating, and attracting the highest tier of AI talent. Previous CSET research recommends increasing graduate education scholarships and reforming and streamlining immigration pathways for top AI talent entering the U.S. This also involves a better understanding of STEM workforce pipeline leakages domestically, which start early and continue throughout the entire education lifecycle and well into one’s career. 
For technical occupations where talent pipelines are working, we need to ensure their sustainability; for example, by incentivizing AI companies to closely partner with state workforce boards and universities to help schools prepare students with the necessary skills. For nontechnical AI occupations, the diversity of potential backgrounds suggests prioritizing AI literacy education for everyone.
Finally, in the quest to expand the talent pipeline, the prevailing wisdom of the need for a four-year college degree should be carefully considered. The current proliferation of certifications, coding academies and other online courses aimed at upskilling U.S. workers provide an alternate pathway for some. However, it is unclear if most employers are accepting these alternative credentials. This creates a risk of leaving many potentially qualified workers on the sidelines, if non-college graduates are less able to compete.


Effective education and workforce policy requires understanding the relevant labor market dynamics, including insights on the existence of workforce shortages. Our research suggests that policies aimed at equipping America’s talent for tomorrow’s jobs cannot and should not be a one-size-fits-all approach.

April 9 (UPI) -- The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence vice chair said on Friday the United States lacks a strategy to compete with China in military AI.
""The first thing is we have got to do is to take this competition seriously, and we need to win it,"" Robert O. Work, commission vice chair, told reporters at the Pentagon.

He recommended that the Defense Department should spend at least 3.4 percent of its budget on identified AI priorities through its Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.
Work noted that the United States is currently the world leader in AI, but that China has structured its army, private sector and academia to overtake it.

""We have a generational opportunity here for AI to be our future,"" Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Michael S. Groen, JAIC director, added, noting that beyond defense initiatives, AI will be a driver of the U.S. economy.
""We must act now. We need to start putting these pieces into place now,"" Groen said.
Work and Groen spoke Friday after the publication of an NCSAI report suggesting that AI is a groundbreaking and long-term technology, and urging that U.S. dominance in the area is crucial.

""The United States must act now to field AI systems and invest substantially more resources in AI innovation to protect its security, promote its prosperity, and safeguard the future of democracy,"" the 10-page report says in part.
According to the report, the U.S. government is lagging behind competitors at organizing and investing in AI development, and may not be prepared to defend against ""AI-enabled threats and rapidly adopt AI applications for national security purposes.""
""This will be expensive and require a significant change in mindset. America needs White House leadership, Cabinet-member action, and bipartisan Congressional support to win the AI era,"" the report said.
The report calls AI-enhanced capabilities ""the tools of first resort"" for defending against missile and cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns and swarming unmanned enemy aircraft, all of which could occur at speeds that ""human operators will not be able to keep up.""
Its recommendations include military AI readiness by 2025, a digitally literate U.S. workforce and a White House-led strategy for technical competition.
""Our armed forces' competitive military-technical advantage could be lost within the next decade if they do not accelerate the adoption of AI across their missions,"" the report reads.
In March, Groen told an industry conference that the U.S. military must scale up its artificial intelligence use or be left behind by adversaries.

He said that data must be standardized, cloud services must be adopted and AI must be integrated into military operations, adding that while current military use of AI ""is a step in the right direction, we need to start building on it.""
Groen noted that China has said it intends ""to be dominant in AI by 2030,"" while the Pentagon has focused on five-year program objective memorandums looking toward 2027.

Lt. Gen. Michael Groen, leader of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, promoted the efficiencies of AI, particularly for business systems, on the same day the Biden administration announced a topline defense budget proposal of $715 billion, which amounts to an overall decrease, when adjusted for inflation.“In an era of tightening budgets and focus on squeezing out things that are legacy and are not important in the budget, the productivity gains and the efficiency gains that AI can bring to the department, especially through the business process transformation, actually becomes an economic necessity,” Groen said at a press briefing. “So in a squeezed play between modernizing our warfare that moves at machine speed and tighter budgets, AI is doubly necessary.”The JAIC, tasked with increasing the use of artificial intelligence across the department, wants to drive the Pentagon to operate more like a data-driven software company. That includes establishing data feeds and algorithms that are shared across the department.Groen said that implementing those practices would create productivity gains, new insights and improved management across the department.“It really represents a transformation of our operating model,” Groen said. “That operating model will have to create a common data environment where data is shared, data is authoritative, [and] data is available.”He added, “it’s about making our organization, the Department of Defense in this case, as productive and efficient as any of these modern successful data-driven enterprises.”Earlier this month, Groen warned that the department’s biggest strategic threat was its own technological obsolescence and called for the department to invest more in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and resilient networks, that will define the future of warfare. Artificial intelligence and associated technologies underpin the DoD’s plans to stay competitive,  and it’s the JAIC’s responsibly to provide best practices and services to assist organizations on their AI efforts.Providing those services is core to the organization’s pivot to JAIC 2.0, in which it focuses more on providing broad AI-enabling services to department components rather than developing AI products.Under the JAIC 2.0, “we measure our success in the success of others,” Groen said.“We come in as archivists of best practice across the department, and say, ‘Hey, show us how you’re doing that. Let us learn from you,” he said. “And then we can share, ‘Hey, you know, there’s another agency in the department that has a problem very similar to yours and here’s how they’re addressing that.’ So we played broker for information and expertise across agencies, across services across combatant commands.”That shift has recently manifested itself through the release of solicitations to industry for test and evaluation help and data readiness services in an effort to boost its ability to help department components implement artificial intelligence.The JAIC is also viewed as central to AI efforts at the Pentagon by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a congressionally mandated organization that provided recommendations to boost the country’s AI readiness. The report urges the department to be “AI ready” by 2025 and suggests the JAIC take on a broad range of responsibilities, from developing workforce initiatives to advising components on AI development.The JAIC’s prominence has also increased because of a provision in the most recent National Defense Authorization Act that elevated the center’s reporting responsibility to the deputy secretary of defense, a move Groen said gives the JAIC more insight into department priorities and boosts the stature of the center internally.The move allows the deputy secretary and the “rest of the department leadership access to the tools and processes to reinforce their priorities, underline our ethical foundations, integrate our enterprises and transform our business processes,” he said.Bob Work, former deputy secretary of defense and vice chair of the NSCAI, echoed Groen’s comments at the press conference, arguing that AI leadership is core to the department’s future competitiveness.“You have to have top down leadership, you cannot say AI is important and let all of the agencies and subordinate departments figure out what that means,” Work said.About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.

There are abundance of literature on examining the best sci-fi movies ever made and speculating their conversion into reality in times to come..However, though not a sci-fi movie in its truest sense, this genre of children literature provides a vision on artificial intelligence under the garb of a fairy-tale. It would not be wrong to say that this movie is the love child of fairy tale and technology which is typically Tim Burtonesque..The Charlie and the chocolate factory theory .The initial scene in the movie was a tragic one which showed how the boy's father lost his job because machines have replaced the human workforce to screw toothpaste caps. While this scene was a gentle reminder of the fact that machines, robots and humanoids will soon be substituting humans..But the vision doesn't end here as the plot itself has been enveloped in technological advancements..As we slowly enter into the chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka, no other human except the kids and him, falls into our sight. It is only then one of the tourists of the factory raises a question, &quot;if not humans then who runs the factory?&quot;.This very question was striking when the movie itself was released in the year 2005 when the world was not yet familiar with artificial intelligence. However, the answer to it given by Willy Wonka was even more striking to the point of being indigestible..Willy Wonka, clearly fabricated a story about the oompa-loompa tribe. No such tribe exists. Not even in other planets in the galaxy..Clearly, the oompa-loompas were Lilliput humanoids crafted by Willy himself, using artificial intelligence. The oompa-loompas all looked the same performing different tasks and the entire factory was run by those petite humanoids, who in turn were running the machines to manufacture chocolates..In one of the scenes, we saw how the naughty and disobedient children were trapped in television screens. This rings a bell with augmented reality. But the children in fact were not naughty. They were only trying to satiate their curiosities..This resonates with how AI companies perform these days..Moving on, the tour of the factory that was given to the visitors and the audience was actually a tour of the possible technological advancements that were on their ways and in ways they could be adopted by companies to boost sales. The machines that were being used to craft chocolates of different kinds proved that handling too many creative moves is not humanly possible. This adheres to Ledger's &quot;quick creativity&quot; theory. To sum it up, it intends to teach its audience that how chocolate making can be an art..Try to recall that it was made clear that Willy Wonka was the best selling chocolate brand than the others. It was superior to all but its business strategy was mysterious to all as well..Did the movie show us the future?.Tech experts today always re-iterate that the future is digital and AI will be dominant. Charlie and the chocolate factory only held up a mirror of what is the present reality today..It also teaches us the importance of exposing kids to advanced technologies know-how's so that a nation could see the birth of innovations in even triviality..Who knows? May be this movie along with many others were the reason why AI is picking up speed in progress today..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

COLLAGE: Kazi Akib Bin Asad


Despite Klara and the Sun (Faber, 2021) coming out on my birthday, and soft science fiction being not only a genre I regularly read but write, I found myself with no real connection with the Nobel Prize-winning author's latest work. Kazuo Ishiguro, for me, has always been one of ""those writers""; the kind who you're sure write perfectly good stories, but the sheer amount of praise they receive from just about everyone leaves you a little sceptical. (Novel titles like Never Let Me Go surely didn't help). Or maybe it's just me. What I have found, though, once I actually leafed through the pages—and I'm sure this won't come as a surprise to any fans of the author—is that my opinion, one might call it bias, was completely unsubstantiated.



What I found in the 307 pages was indeed the deep meditation several reviewers promised. What I found were the exact many qualities the writer has always been celebrated for, that this particular reviewer had always dismissed with a shrug. The prose, elegantly simple, is as efficient and to-the-point as is Isaac Asimov's, though nowhere near as soulless. The spirit, the ""heart"" that the book's back cover takes great space to write of, was not unlike the humanity you find in a Bradbury or a Le Guin—but its focus, centred so fixedly at the base of human existence, is its own. What I found was a work of  science fiction with no direct analogue, no immediate referent, save for its own maker's. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
""To some extent as a writer you're always in dialogue with your earlier books"", Ishiguro told TIME. ""Part of me wanted to reply to Never Let Me Go (Faber, 2005), which is a very sad book. It's not pessimistic exactly, but it's very sad. I wanted to reply to that vision"". With a story similarly examining the hypothetical, and not wholly unrealistic, future rounded out by artificial intelligence, both novels approach and ultimately deal with the subject in their own ways. If you are anything resembling this reviewer, please do not conceive any notions based on the insipid film adaptations of Never Let Me Go (2010) and the thoroughly fine, if unremarkable, Remains of the Day (1993).



Don't be dissuaded, either, by the platitudes surrounding this novel's release. ""What does it mean to love?"" is a quote you'll find tied around its marketing. The back of the first edition pulls out the quote, ""Do you believe in the human heart?"", which sounds more like a Cher song than the circumstances in which the question is asked in the novel—in the middle of a taut, confused conversation the protagonist has three-quarters of the way through, spoken more literally than may seem without context.



The novel, which follows the narration of ""Artificial Friend"" Klara, far exceeds the sum of its parts. At its core, the story doubles as a Toy Story-coming of age tale, with central figure Josie, the terminally-ill adolescent, kicking the plot into gear. Klara, who is from the start more human than human, is our moral compass and audience surrogate. In pulling off this age-old SF trick, setting the parameters of the narrative around the android's naivety, Ishiguro transforms what might have been ""sick lit"" under lesser hands into a fully realised humanistic portrait of our modern, digitally-enhanced life.
Klara and the Sun, Ishiguro told Publishers Weekly, originally began life as an illustrated children's book, ""about a child who isn't well; confined to her room. She and her doll watch the sun go down until one night they are able to leave the room and visit outside"". It was when his daughter, writer Naomi Ishiguro, interjected that he changed courses. ""She said, no way. You cannot tell this story to children; you would traumatize them"".
Indeed, there is material enough in the novel to cause tremble to the most seasoned adults. We find out how in this world children are ""lifted"", an uncertain process involving genetic modification, and schooled thereon only through phones and tablets (""oblongs"", as Klara identifies them); parents hold ""interaction meetings"" to ensure socialisation; and those families that can't afford their children's ""lifting"" are seen immediately as members of different society.



There is little attempt to mask the technophobia present in the writing, but all the cruel things and cruel people that appear in the book appear in full three dimensions. Characters will often seem hateful, and they will later seem full of love. The advancement of technology is more hindrance than blessing, but Klara, who observes and absorbs humanity, is often the most compassionate in any given situation. Ishiguro has said in the past how in his writing he seeks to make a universal statement, and Klara and the Sun, his first novel in six years, is just that. There is nothing grandiose about it. He doesn't approach it with kid-gloves, nor does he yank our shoulders blaring his message. There is a gentleness to his writing, an assured sense of direction, that makes me regret, above all, my neglecting of his work.

The Fine Art of Creating a Top-Quality AI Whisky

Mackmyra partnered with Finnish technology company Fourkind to develop an AI system that augments and automates some of the tasks of the distillery’s master blender, who is responsible for whisky flavor and product development.

PROMOTED
Master blenders spend their time meticulously tasting and experimenting to create the best flavors possible, and that process can be time-consuming. Mackmyra wanted machine learning to work its magic in sifting through massive amounts of data to find new combinations.
Fourkind created their AI system using Machine Learning Studio and Microsoft Azure, then fed the system datasets that included:

●    Evaluations from whisky experts
The AI system analyzed 70 million possible combinations and created a framework for creating innovative new recipes that taste great.
After the first batch of recipes, Macmyra's master blender, Angela D'Orazio, provided feedback so the AI system could learn more about whisky combinations that work for the palette and sell well in the market.
In each round, the distillery narrowed down their options and increased the quality of the recipes. At the end of the process, D'Orazio selected recipe #36 as the final pick for their innovative new product.
AI Can't Replace the Human Touch
Master blenders aren't going anywhere, though. Even the most sophisticated AI system cannot replicate or replace the intelligence and discernment of the human senses. The human side of whisky-making is here to stay.
Instead, Mackmyra embarked on their AI-created whisky experiment to see if they could augment the skills of their master blender to create an innovative new recipe.
The AI technology that allowed Fourkind and Mackmyra to sift through vast amounts of data to develop new formulas and recipes could have all kinds of other applications. Be on the lookout for new AI software in industries like perfumes, desserts, medicines, and clothing.
Companies are looking for ways to partner with AI technology companies to augment and expand what their internal experts can do, so they can get the most out of every new product they develop, and reduce some of the heaviest data analysis and learning from their employees' shoulders.
The end result of the next consumer AI experiment? It might just have notes of toffee, pear, apples, and creamy vanilla with a light tone of oak.

Commanders could use an artificial intelligence advocate by their side to explain how to use the new technology in combat, former deputy secretary of defense Robert Work said Monday.
Work, who served as vice-chair of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, compared the position to that of a staff judge advocate “at all levels of command” in the war on terror. He explained that, like the staff judge advocate, this member of the staff would advise commanders of the implications of their decision and “this could happen” in selecting targets. The advocate would also express concerns over possible collateral damage and ensure that they are operating within “universal humanitarian laws” in carrying out the mission.
Commanders “don’t have to be experts” in all aspects of artificial intelligence, he said during an online forum sponsored by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. But they do have to be familiar with it and other new technologies.
In an answer to a follow-up question about educating commanders, the former under secretary of the Navy stressed that he didn’t “want to overload” professional military education with another set of required courses for officers and noncommissioned officers.
Work did call for assessing all enlisted and officer for occupational skills on all entrance exams to the military services. It also means overhauling the personnel system to delineate career paths for enlisted, officers and civilians who have these needed skills.
Those paths don’t exist now, he and the other panelists agreed.
Harrison Schramm, a senior fellow at CSBA and Naval Academy graduate, said that in the sea services “all paths to success [promotion] go through command.”
The sea services and the Pentagon are not alone in this regard, Jose-Marie Griffiths, president of Dakota State University and a member of the commission, said. “Very few parts of the government track AI [or technological skills] through career paths” for their workers. “The government doesn’t even know … who has those skill sets,” she said.
In his opening remarks, Work said the commission recognized that “AI is a group of technologies” that starts with talent and runs through integration.
The biggest issue is that while the government can attract “young men and women who are digitally savvy”, they can spend months waiting to get hired and even longer for security clearances, then get placed “in jobs where they don’t practice their skills.” All of this translates into them leaving for the private sector.
Work added that the Office of Personnel Management does not have a way of classifying an applicant who is experienced in coding, but lacks a college degree, yet has skills that could fill an important role in government.
Likewise, “we don’t even know how to score our talent for the military” in those areas, he said.
“The big idea” from the commission, according to Work and Griffiths, is creating a digital corps to work in all agencies and departments of the government. Young people “want to graduate from college without crushing debt. We think that would be an enormous attraction” for them to join, Work said.
Included in that idea is the creation of a digital service academy with a seven-year course of instruction, operated in a similar way to the service academies, but designed for the civilian side of the government. “It’s not trying to duplicate the service academies,” Work said. He added that a reserve digital corps would also be established and function in a way that is similar to the military’s reserve components: one weekend a month of training; two weeks a year on assignment as an agency intern or observer.
He estimated the cost at about $70,000 per year for students at the academy, comparable to the military service academies; but the digital academy would not require as large a faculty or staff for things like intercollegiate athletics or need for training ranges.
To succeed in the long term, career paths are required for these government employees, the panelists said.
Griffiths said that a new National Defense Education Act, based upon the lessons learned from the first bill passed after the Soviet Union’s successful launch of the Sputnik satellite, is also needed to improve kindergarten through 12th-grade education. She later emphasized the need for science, technology, engineering and mathematics in middle schools and the continuing education of teachers to keep them current in technological developments.
She also called for more investment in National Science Foundation scholarships and fellowships to build the domestic talent pool in artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing and engineering.
Griffiths and Work said the most politically charged commission recommendations lay in overhauling immigration laws “to remain the world’s magnet for technological talent” and “it’s not an easy problem” to get through Congress. Griffiths noted that one-quarter of American patents in recent years have gone to immigrants. Work added that 79 percent of the graduate students in computer science in American universities are from other countries.
“There’s a great deal more demand than supply” in the domestic tech industry and globally, Schramm said.
Work said the commission recognized security concerns over technology transfers to competitors like China that could arise from issuing more Green Cards to foreign-born doctorate holders from American institutions. He said those concerns also exist among insiders wanting to profit by selling their expertise. Even more common now is the pirating of proprietary technology information through cyber intrusion.
For the military, Schramm said, there is a “glamorous aspect” to artificial intelligence, but also a mundane aspect to it that can address Navy and Air Force problems and achieve immediate results, like personnel rotations and household moves.
Schramm added that another area worth exploring is using it to enhance aviation safety. Data in that area “is well-curated” and can be used in building recommendations for new practices that enhance safety.

Does the Future of Artificial Intelligence Favor Authoritarianism?

 


Photo Credit: Seeedstudio.com
In our networked world, artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies can be copied and pasted with minimal modification until they become geopolitical forces. On April 8, 2021, the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released its Global Trends 2040 report, noting more centrally than ever that AI is not only an isolated technology but also an increasingly indivisible character of the global system due to its potential to disrupt every aspect of civilization by processing and analyzing data faster and more imaginatively than the human mind. The report summarizes new trends in AI, such as converging seemingly unrelated technologies, accelerating development timelines, and compounding first adopter advantages particularly in standards setting.[i] Yet, the report concurrently highlights dark undertones of these seemingly neutral trends, such as the increasing inequality and raw power imbalance between knowledgeable states who create technology versus those who use and amplify said technological capabilities. The ODNI is concerned that the diffusion of digital technologies and their rapid ‘copy-paste’ proliferation means that more authoritarian states will have access to and take advantage of this new domain, giving them the capacity to shape the development of the field and the norms and structures related to it in their image.[ii] This begs the question: are these AI technologies truly neutral forces?
Political powers play a role in determining the direction of accelerating and disruptive technologies as technology and technological capacity are increasingly recognized as geopolitical power. [iii] This is particularly concerning as authoritarian regimes employ AI and possess distinct advantages over non-authoritarian governments. Firstly, not only can they coerce or self-select individuals into government service to generate strong technologically-savvy talent pools, but they can also use AI to centralize and amass data without having to consider political restraints and/or individual liberties.[iv] As such, authoritarian systems can deploy AI at the national level with little consent of their population or intra-bureaucratic wrangling. Secondly, authoritarian systems will be able to rapidly advance existing technologies, as scientists and technicians integrate capabilities to disrupt competitors by centralizing financial resources and statecraft behind state-backed enterprises. Thirdly, because AI exists in a world where it is first deployed and then evaluated, meaning that consequences and standards setting can become secondary to development, “corporations and states at the forefront of emerging technology will shrink timelines and choose to develop technologies before the implications of these choices are fully known.”[v] Authoritarian economies closely managed by the state may be better prepared to react quickly and fund new and risky technologies, while open economies rely heavily on private sector funding for innovation and are vulnerable to planned economies who are able to buy, steal, or develop any successful AI methodology. Lastly, the basic building blocks of operating systems require logs that record every process within a computer, inherently generating an almost perfect surveillance opportunity for authoritarians wishing to crush dissent.

Even assuming that authoritarian regimes produce fewer innovators in AI, as quantity and lack of constraints can sometimes overcome quality, what advantage is openness if it enables the instant theft and deployment of new AI models by authoritarian states? Open societies will not be able to use innovation to compete with these authoritarian coercion tactics or AI data reservoir advantages, as adversarial learning allows authoritarian systems to leverage state-backed cyber operations that will increasingly be automated to identify, collect, and iterate technologies that instantly gain access to systems, collect intellectual property, and secure data in automated ways that advance state power.[vii] As a result of these power imbalances, could AI development favor authoritarianism?
US policymakers must question the intent and consequences of AI technologies with a critical eye in order to protect US national security. In an AI-enabled future, labor and societal forces will be disrupted by transformational change that will move faster than human minds and traditions can tolerate, and democratic governance must work to navigate these accelerating currents. The ODNI report notes that “although many countries will develop strict rules on the use of personal data, there will be debate on whether these rules can coexist with the full realization of AI capabilities.” As is visible today, when personal data protection is limited, states and corporations work to bypass controls with a push-pull of data collection, sophisticated spyware, and enhanced decryption techniques to enhance their data reservoirs.[viii] US policymakers must look inward and develop strategic objectives before applying AI results to ensure that use cases serve collective goals. Leaving AI development to authoritarian competitors is an unacceptable abdication. Instead, agile prototyping, funding, and scaling of national security innovation by organizations like the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) is desperately needed. [ix] AI will be vital to securing future national security interests and handling the complexity of future systems; but, AI for national security must remain lean—able to continue to pivot and innovate at every stage of development, self-evaluate, and evolve in real time while deployed.
Moreover, AI technologies–statistical, rules-based systems unlike the natural world they model–advance and become more complex, they become relatively more dynamic but conversely less human intelligible; fewer individuals understand end-to-end what data and data pipelines rely on to operate.[x]  Mathematical complexity can thus obscure policymakers and citizens from the bias and inaccuracy of AI while limiting accountability and enabling only large, hierarchical organizations to foster cutting-edge development. Because AI that works in a corporate setting may create unacceptable risks and inaccuracies in the context of national security, the U.S. must educate and attract AI expertise to public service.[xi] 
Overall, policies must not be shaped by the needs of the AI training sets; AI exists as a human tool, and loss of human-centrism risks further “exacerbating inequalities within and between states.”[xii] As such, democratic states should apply AI’s potential to take advantage of weaknesses in authoritarian systems by exposing corruption, breaking through propaganda narratives, and delivering better outcomes for their citizens. It is critical that AI development becomes agile and adaptable to the needs of individual teams and missions within the government instead of shaping and being shaped by organizations that serve what best suits the algorithm.

This interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning, April 18, to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.)It’s not altogether surprising that a company earning billions of dollars a year making the chips that power today’s hyperrealistic video games has a business plan inspired by a science-fiction novel. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, the nation’s most valuable semiconductor company, with a stock price of $645 a share and a market cap of $400 billion, is out to create the metaverse, what Huang describes “a virtual world that is a digital twin of ours.” Huang credits author Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash, filled with collectives of shared 3-D spaces and virtually enhanced physical spaces that are extensions of the Internet, for conjuring the metaverse.  This is already playing out with the massively popular online games like Fortnite and Minecraft, where users create richly imagined virtual worlds. Now the concept is being put to work by Nvidia and others. Partnering with Nvidia, BMW is using a virtual digital twin of a factory in Regensburg, Germany, to virtually plan new workflows before deploying the changes in real time in their physical factory. The metaverse, says Huang, “is where we will create the future” and transform how the world’s biggest industries operate.From their roots in the gaming industry, Nvidia chips are now an important component of many of the world’s most powerful computers, powering AI, drug discovery and the coming generation of autonomous vehicles. Huang joined TIME for a video conversation this week to talk about the chip shortage, the future of the car industry and his belief in the goodness of human nature. Subscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.(This interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been condensed and edited for clarity. Note: Some of Huang’s comments, below, are from a keynote speech he gave earlier this week and the press conference that followed.)You describe the latest iteration of AI as “the modern Big Bang.” Can you share your view of the transforming potential of AI?AI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans’ fundamental technology is intelligence. We’re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that’s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It’s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We’re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We’re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we’re going to see the automation of automation.Not to make any value judgments about the importance of video games, but do you find it ironic that a company that has its roots in entertainment is now providing vitally important computing power for drug discovery, basic research and reinventing manufacturing?No, not at all. It’s actually the opposite. We always started as a computing company. It just turned out that our first killer app was video games. At the time video games was a zero billion-dollar market, and we postulated that this new industry called video games, with 3-D graphics that are really rich and beautiful was going to be one of the largest technology industries in the world. The condition is extremely rare that a market is simultaneously large and technologically demanding. It is usually the case that the markets that require really powerful computers are very small in size, whether it’s climate simulation or molecular-dynamics drug discovery. The markets are so small, it can’t afford very large investments. That’s why you don’t see a company that was founded to do climate research. Video games were one of the best strategic decisions we ever made. AI is a watershed moment for the world.What’s your philosophy regarding entering new markets?Our primary preference is that we don’t build something. If somebody else is building it, we’re delighted to use it. That allows us to spare our critical resources in the company, and focus on advancing the industry in a way that is rather unique and advance the industry in a way that nobody else does. Why are recommendation algorithms so hard and so important?Recommender systems are the most important AI system of our time, the most important machine-learning pipeline in the world today. It is the engine for  search, ads, online shopping, music, books, movies, user-generated content, news.  They are processing hundreds of petabytes of data and moving toward terabytes. One of the most important things that intelligent people do is make recommendations. Recommender systems predict your needs and preferences from past interactions with you, your explicit  preferences, and learned preferences using methods called collaborative and content filtering. Trillions of items to be recommended to billions of people.How has the chip shortage affected the car industry?One of the dynamics that COVID exposed is a weakness in the supply chain of the automotive industry, which has too many components built into cars. When it shut down abruptly because of COVID, the recovery process—the restart process—was far more complicated than anybody imagined. It is very clear that the car has to be rearchitected, and instead of thousands of components, it really wants to be a few centralized components, because you could keep your eyes on four things a lot better than you can keep an eye on 1,000 things or 10,000 things coming from different places. We're going to see the automation of automation.Beyond the chip shortage, you work closely with major car companies: How will AI impact the automotive industry?The car industry could start thinking about their cars not as vehicles that they sell, but as part of their fleet and their installed base. They could provide software services over the course of the 15, 20 years that these cars are on the road. So the business model is transformed. How important is the advent and the adaptation of digital twins for manufacturing, business and society at large?In the future, the digital world or the virtual world will be thousands of times bigger than the physical world. There will be a new New York City. There’ll be a new Shanghai. Every single factory and every single building will have a digital twin that will simulate and track the physical version of it. Always. By doing so, engineers and software programmers could simulate new software that will ultimately run in the physical version of the car, the physical version of the robot, the physical version of the airport, the physical version of the building. All of the software that’s going to be running in these physical things will be simulated in the digital twin first, and then it will be downloaded into the physical version. And as a result, the product keeps getting better at an exponential rate. The second thing is, you’re going to be able to go in and out of the two worlds through wormholes. We’ll go into the virtual world using virtual reality, and the objects in the virtual world, in the digital world, will come into the physical world, using augmented reality. So what’s going to happen is pieces of the digital world will be temporarily, or even semipermanently, augmenting our physical world. It’s ultimately about the fusion of the virtual world and the physical world.Do you worry about bad actors getting their hands on all this powerful technology and using it to sow chaos, perpetrate evil and disrupt this utopian vision of the future? The best way is to democratize the technology in order to enable all society, which is vastly good—and to put great technology in their hands, so that they could use the same technology—and, ideally, superior technology—to stay safe.

The administrative staff, management, teachers, and students are all using AI in different ways to achieve similar goals. During the last few years, AI has spread its roots much wider and deeper in this sector..Markets and Markets&nbsp;has predicted that the global market share of&nbsp;AI in education&nbsp;is estimated to reach $3.68 billion by 2023 at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 47%. Another platform,&nbsp;Market Search Engine, has predicted that the share will reach $5.80 billion by 2025..Though we haven't seen humanoids replacing teachers, we sure are seeing AI systems taking over teaching and guiding students during their online courses. Whether it is automating tasks or personalized training courses based on students' capabilities, AI is changing the way people look at education..Before we say the various ways in which artificial intelligence is contributing to the education sector, let us look at how an educational institution should implement AI in its establishment..How to Implement AI in the Educational Sector?.Do you want to implement&nbsp;artificial intelligence solutions&nbsp;in your educational institution? You will first need to define the long-term goals and understand the limitations of the existing system. Without knowing what you want to achieve, investing in AI will not be beneficial..Then, you will either have to hire AI experts to bridge the talent gap or outsource the responsibility to a&nbsp;machine learning consulting company. If you want to hire a third-party company, it is recommended to do so in the beginning. This will ensure that your institutional goals and the company's services are aligned and in sync with each other.&nbsp;Well-known institutions such as Nuance (Massachusetts), Querium (Texas), Kidsense (California), and many others have successfully adopted AI models in their educational systems..Identify Needs:&nbsp;What do you expect AI to do in your establishment? Which processes do you want to automate? Which training areas do you want to focus on?.Determine Objectives:&nbsp;Are you aware of how AI works? Do you know the drawbacks of using AI systems? How do you plan to overcome the challenges in adopting artificial intelligence?.Align Processes:&nbsp;The&nbsp;AI solutions&nbsp;you choose should create the right environment to align your establishment's talent, technology, and work culture. You need to convert your institution into an analytical-based model that focuses on actionable insights to make better decisions..Control the Environment:&nbsp;The new work environment should accommodate and allow humans and AI systems to work in tandem. The processes should be transparent, efficient, effective, and secure..Role of Artificial Intelligence in Education.Automating Administrative Tasks.Is there an establishment that can function without backend work by the administrative department and the teaching faculty? Whether it is filing paperwork, sending emails and messages, contacting students and their parents, or making periodic reports, the administrative staff constantly works from morning to evening..Similarly, the teachers and professors have to mark the homework, test papers, create a teaching schedule, prepare for the next classes, etc. Do you know that a teacher spends less than half their time actually teaching the students?&nbsp;According to an article posted by The Telegraph, teachers spend only 43% of their time on teaching..The remaining time is allotted to marking test sheets, planning future lessons, and completing the administrative work. The&nbsp;artificial intelligence consultant&nbsp;will help you create an AI system that will allow the staff and the teachers to be more productive at work.&nbsp;Teachers can use smart question generators like PrepAI that help them set better question papers for the tests and save time in the process..Personalizing Learning for Students.Personalized learning is pretty much similar to personalized recommendations offered by online marketplaces or Netflix. The courses and subjects are recommended based on the interests and preferences of the students.&nbsp;AI for online learning&nbsp;doesn't replace teachers. Instead, it helps teachers understand the abilities and limitations of each student. It makes things easier for the students and teachers to create an exclusive course plan for each student..Smart tutoring systems also offer instant personalized feedback to help students understand how they can do better. Teachers can convert their lessons into interactive sessions and flashcards so that students will take more interest in learning the subjects..Creating Smart Content.Smart content is a popular topic in the education sector. It is nothing but creating virtual content by digitizing textbooks, notes, creating video lessons and lectures, developing interactive training sessions, and more.&nbsp;Artificial intelligence in education&nbsp;helps create customizable interfaces for the students to learn easily and understand better. Be it the elementary level or the postgraduate level, smart content can be developed for any subject and any class..Microlearning and skills mapping are two concepts that belong to this category. Skills mapping is the process of creating a visual representation of the skills needed by students to perform well in their studies. Microlearning is a skill-based learning module that deals with specific areas to achieve expertise in the field..Breaching the Geographical Barriers.Online courses have made it possible for students from any region to join a course from any other country. The physical barriers between countries have been eliminated in terms of online education. Technology made it possible to acquire specialized skills from the best teachers, no matter where they are located..Now, students have even better chances of updating their skills through AI-powered training sessions. Information Technology is one area where numerous courses are using AI. That shouldn't be surprising since artificial intelligence is an inherent part of the industry. Students and professionals who wish to become AI and ML experts are enrolling for these courses..Education Made Easy for People with Special Needs.It has always been a challenging task to create a learning program for people with special needs. Though there are exclusive schools for students with hearing, speech, and visual impairment, the teaching process could have been more effective..Also, students with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, etc., have to be enrolled in special schools to help them deal better. But why can't these students continue to be a part of regular schools? Is there a way teachers can understand and pay more attention to these kids? Artificial intelligence is making it possible for kids with special needs to study most comfortably. SpeakIt!, Widex's Evoke, and Empower Me are a few examples of AI in education that cater exclusively to kids with special needs..Providing 24*7 Access to Learning and Study Material.Wouldn't it be wonderful if a student can study anytime he/ she wants to? We aren't talking about studying at home with the books a student owns. Several teachers would have gotten calls from students asking for references or study materials even in the middle of the night. What if students can directly access the online library and download the material? What if students can rely on AI-powered sessions to learn a difficult concept instead of troubling the faculty at odd times?.People need rest, but systems don't. AI strategy consulting for educational institutions provides solutions to these questions by creating a model that is accessible 24*7 by students. In fact, the student's training schedule can be created based on when he/ she is most productive and likely to pay the maximum attention to what's being taught..Increase Student Engagement and Interest.Taking a lead from the previous point, artificial intelligence also provides a solution to make learning interesting. Even the best faculty can have some tough moments when students just don't pay enough attention to the class. It could be the lack of interest in the subject, the teaching approach, or the environment (be it at school or online classes). One teaching program doesn't fit all, and it's time to focus on customizing learning sessions..You can use artificial intelligence to create interactive modules and lessons suited to different types of students. Visualization is a great way to make students understand a concept. Graphs, charts, 3D images, etc., keep kids interested in learning. Interactive training through touchscreens is now fast becoming a part of online education..Reducing Workload for Teachers and Students.One of the major advantages of hiring artificial intelligence consulting services is that the AI-powered systems and processes can reduce the workload for teachers and give them enough space to focus on making education better. We have already discussed how automating administrative tasks can cut down the work of the office staff..The same theory is applied to students as well. Students can create schedules that allow them to work at their own speed. They don't need to feel burdened about completing multiple assignments for the same day. This allows everyone involved to breathe easily and give their best shot. The pressure to learn at the same pace as other students is also eliminated. This gives students more confidence to study even those subjects they are usually terrified of..Helping Teachers Understand Students' Abilities and Limitations.With many students in each class, it can be difficult for teachers to pay attention to individual students and understand the limitations of each one of them. Artificial intelligence solves this problem by creating a model training session for each student. Teachers and students can work together with the help of AI-powered tools to improve the comprehension skills and fine-tune the abilities of each student..When a teacher is in a better position to understand their students, it will create a healthy relationship between both parties and enable effective communication. The teacher can rely on AI to chart the next course program from the students and use it as a basis to plan their lessons..Creating a Virtual Learning Environment.An AI business consultant can create a virtual learning environment where students can clear their doubts by asking the chatbots and virtual assistants instead of contacting the teacher. If a student feels susceptible to get their doubts cleared by the teacher, they can take the assistance of technology. There is no need to feel demotivated or give up on the subject because of these reasons..The topics that students don't understand at school or cannot be properly explained by parents are better handled by artificial intelligence. The same virtual environment can be used to conduct online exams as well..There are already various such test tools for recruitment. The same is implemented in the educational sector as well. AI services can be used to build a secure online examination tool that allows the teachers to create and customize test forms..The students can attempt the tests from their existing locations at any time they choose. These tests are evaluated by the system rather than by the teachers. The teachers can, of course, track the entire process..Increased Security Using Facial Recognition.Security has become a point of concern in many schools, especially in the US. China has started using facial recognition systems to scan the identity of the students and confirm it before allowing them to enter the campus. Instead of the regular student ID cards, the scanners are used to recognize the student and mark their entry, be it at school, library, or the canteen..With CCTV cameras not being enough to provide security at educational institutions, the establishments are working with the leading AI solutions company to revamp and upgrade their security systems and provide a safer work environment for the staff, teachers, and students. Schools across the globe are looking at this development with an eagerness to implement it in their establishments..However, AI in the educational sector is not entirely a rosy picture. Excess use of technology can make students, especially young kids, get addicted to smartphones and computers. This can harm their physical, emotional, and psychological health if parents and teachers are not alert at right times. The increase in cyberbullying is another aspect you need to consider before adopting artificial intelligence in your educational institution..Conclusion.As machine learning algorithms improve and refine themselves to become even more accurate, the education sector will depend more on technology to create a holistic learning environment for students and teachers to interact..While the future of AI in education is still not fully defined, we can be assured that students of abilities and limitations will have better chances of learning and proving themselves. As new AI tools are developed, students can plan their career paths with clarity and work in achieving their goals. Educational institutions can build smarter next generations by investing in artificial intelligence..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

With the arrival of industrial revolution 4.0, businesses of all sizes and types are increasingly capitalizing on advanced, intelligent technologies. They are taking advantage of automation to reduce time-consuming, tedious tasks, especially automating assembly line work. However, as such intelligent technologies are better performing than humans, it is necessary businesses must think of knowledge management for their employees. Knowledge is significantly a crucial aspect in achieving high-quality performance for employees. The field of knowledge management consists of psychology, epistemology, and cognitive science. Gaining information provided by artificial intelligence can play a crucial role in helping business employees make timely decisions..Knowledge grows when used and deflates when kept under lock. That's true! Artificial intelligence provides the mechanisms that enable machines to learn. It allows them to gain, process and utilize knowledge to perform tasks. AI also enables machines to unlock knowledge that can be delivered to humans to improve the decision-making process..Employing Artificial Intelligence in Your Business.Artificial intelligence has a crucial role to play in modern businesses. Every year, a fresh trove of companies emerge implementing AI-driven solutions across business processes. Many executives believe employing AI in their businesses will help both people and machines, and enable them to work together to improve operations. Furthermore, reports indicate that the increasing development and adoption of AI will boost the global GDP by up to 14% by 2030..AI allows people in organizations to make effective business decisions, ensure customer loyalty and avert expensive production downtime. It does so as advanced forms of AI are programmed into insight engines and knowledge management systems. Insight engines emerged recently from the world of search, work with data stored in multiple silos within an organization and connect them together to populate answers in search results..Insight engines work as an intelligent solution that makes information to be found resource-efficient and available to the user in the right context for their respective business case. These systems are equipped with artificial intelligence that helps obtain and glean existing corporate knowledge, excerpt the information, and show correlations between the individual pieces of data to provide a comprehensive overall picture. With the help of natural language processing (NLP) and natural language question answering (NLQA), insight engines can deliver search queries in more innate language and be processed directly. These intelligent solutions assess and interpret structured metadata and text content and use this to accurately determine what the user needs. Most knowledge management systems use these technologies along with the semantic processing of content that enables natural human-machine interaction..Leveraging Knowledge Management.Most companies around the world perceive knowledge management as an IT project. They try to convey information from one place to another. Nonetheless, knowledge management is more about comprehending the resource and getting aware of how to leverage it for business growth. It is like an intellectual asset for the business..In his book, &quot;The Fifth Discipline&quot;, Peter Senge, a lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, points out that learning organizations are always intensifying their knowledge, finding new ways of creating knowledge, moving it seamlessly throughout the organization, and transforming it so that people have insights into what they need to do. This requires a knowledge infrastructure involving numerous components such as databases, internal experts, libraries, research centers, outside information agents, and other knowledge-based sources for filling the knowledge gaps within the organization. There is also a need to measure and manage the value of knowledge so that it fits efficiently within the organization. Many companies have positions like Chief Knowledge Officers or Chief Learning Officers to help drive this process..Above all, the new developments in intelligent systems will enable businesses to make effective use of enterprise search and knowledge management. Employees can use artificial intelligence that allows them to unlock knowledge to improve the decision-making process and generate high ROI..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

AI is gradually becoming a part of our daily lives, from fast recommendations on search engines and auto-focus in smartphones to robot waiters at coffee shops and the list goes on. AI has a lot of room for creativity and growth, and it will continue to change the world in a variety of ways in the future..The news media industry has changed dramatically as a result of technological advances. Furthermore, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning has reshaped the ramifications of technology across a wide range of journalism fields. In this area, the growth of the robot reporter and automated journalism has developed rapidly..Automated Journalism.By using computer algorithms to translate raw data into news reports that resemble those written by humans, automated journalism is upending conventional journalism and the position of the news reporter. From satellite communications to the Internet and social media, the media has long been an integral part of technological progress. With the rise of AI and big data, it was only a matter of time before journalism underwent a transformation in terms of production and distribution..Automated journalism raises the bar for media-machine interaction to new heights. It automates every phase of the news production process, from research to final production and distribution. Automated news reports work better with reality stories, in which organized and accurate data can be translated into content that is not only cheaper and faster to generate, but also tailored, to the reader's preferences. It's no surprise that it's seen as a challenge to conventional journalism standards and efficiency, as well as a source of job insecurity in the industry..What effect does it have on the media?.While this may seem to be a grim update in the face of what seems to be a shrinking market, it allows journalists to concentrate on the most critical stories, speeding up the process. The small items, on the other hand, can be easily handled by AI. Furthermore, repetitive and boring work, such as data, can be easily avoided, and it eliminates the possibility of human error, resulting in more reliable and precise reporting. Programs can also strip out fake news, guaranteeing the reports are as accurate as possible, which is critical because readers aren't as willing to fact-check media outlets..There is also a growing demand for robotic journalism to encourage more contact between readers and reporters, which it does by responding to feedback and inquiries for more real time information, as well as handling content to mask insulting comments. Overall, this recent advancement is expected to continue to expand, as it provides the industry with more reliable, up-to-date, and simpler reporting..Artificial intelligence (AI) Tools for the Automated Journalism.Connexun- news api.Users can use Connexun's news API to get real-time multiple languages headlines, posts, and interactive overviews from thousands of reputable online news sources all over the world. It keeps improving intelligent tools that analyse vast datasets of aggregated information using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Its ability to create overviews from aggregated papers automatically can save reporters a lot of time and energy when it comes to describing and creating original material..The New York Times — Editor.According to Medium, BBC'S Juicer technology is not the only semantic discovery tool out there. In 2015 The New York Times implemented its experimental AI project known as Editor. When writing an article, a journalist could use tags to highlight a phrase, headline, or main points of the text. Over time, the computer learns to recognize these semantic tags and learns the most salient parts of an article. By searching through data in real time and extracting information based on requested categories, such as events, people, location and dates Editor can make information more accessible, simplifying the research process and providing fast and accurate fact checking..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

At the time of writing the company has five robotic picking arms powered by computer vision, and other machine-learning systems that can identify the products that need to be packed and use suction power to grab them. Further advances, undertaken in conjunction with two European academic-led projects, are in the pipeline.
Picking and packing aren’t easy if you’re a robot. “From a human’s perspective, it is a fairly simple task to pick and pack, and it doesn’t require an awful lot of training,” says Alex Harvey, chief of advanced technology at Ocado Technology. “For a computer and for a robot, the dexterous manipulation involved is far beyond the state of the art today to be able to pick and pack the full range of items that we do.”
Ocado’s Robotic Suction Pick (RSP) machine is a vacuum cup, powered by an air compressor, that sits at the end of an articulated arm. It uses computer vision and built-in sensors to select items gathered by a bot and place them into a shopping bag. Ocado.com sells a vast range of products, running into the tens of thousands. In terms of outward physical appearance, some are much the same: a tin of chopped tomatoes, for example, is not that different from a tin of lentils. But a tin of chopped tomatoes is very different indeed from a pack of yoghurts, which in turn are more sturdy than, say, a bunch of grapes. And, of course, even grapes aren’t all the same – they vary according to their variety and state of ripeness. Get the pressure of the vacuum cup wrong and the RSP will either drop or crush the item it is attempting to manipulate. Get the sequence wrong and there’s a danger that the tin of tomatoes will squash the grapes.
At present, the company is expanding the number of items its robotic suction system can pick. “There’s no point having for 60,000 different items, 60,000 different control pieces of code,” Harvey says. “What we want at Ocado is generalised control strategies.” But challenges remain. “We need to fit a robot into the same square footage that the person sits in or operates in, and we need the robot system to achieve the same throughput.”
Until a robot can pick and pack as many items in an hour as a human being – Harvey says this is around 600–700 items – it is unlikely to be widely adopted: the impact on productivity would damage service and profits. It also has to be affordable, which means, on the one hand, scaling the technology to the point where it becomes economically worthwhile, and, on the other hand, not over-speccing it (for example, by using a camera with an unnecessarily high resolution). “When we’re deploying stuff in the real world, we want it to be economical in the way that we’re deploying it,” Harvey says. “I don’t want to deploy a supercomputer next to every robot picker.”
Whether or not such AI will ultimately replace humans is the billion-dollar question. Many now believe AI will work alongside humans. Obviously, AI offers the promise of greater efficiency, but so far, at least, this tends to hold good only where the environment is relatively controlled and predictable. Production lines and warehouses may well become fully automated. But where processes interact with the outside world – with all its randomness – it’s harder to envisage a wholly AI future. Delivery drivers, for instance, have to take into account such factors as the weather and the erratic behaviour of some pedestrians. It’s possible that there will be a future without them. It’s also possible, though, that AI will control lorries and delivery trucks on major highways where conditions are relatively predictable, and that human drivers will take over the driving as they reach the outskirts of the villages, towns and cities set as their destinations.
Arguably, it’s the medical sphere where AI’s potential and its limitations have been most apparent – and where its possible future relationship with humans has been most clearly demonstrated. Take one of Google’s computer-vision systems, for example. It’s capable of spotting diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes that can cause sight loss. In lab conditions, it can achieve an accuracy rate of 90 per cent and provide results in ten minutes.
When put to a real-world test in Thailand, however, the deep-learning set-up often struggled. The 11 clinics that operated it used different technology. Only two had a dedicated eye-screen room that could be made dark enough for patients’ pupils to enlarge to the point where high-quality fundus photos could be taken. Most had to make use of nurses’ offices or general-purpose rooms.
Emma Beede, the lead Google Health researcher evaluating the technology, described one room where, because dental checks and patient consultation were going on, it was essential to leave the light on. “That makes sense for them,” she says. “That makes sense when you’re under-resourced.”
Poor internet connection caused problems, too – at one clinic it dropped out altogether for two hours. One way and another, during the first six months of the trial, 21 per cent (393) of the 1,838 images put through the system proved to be of an insufficiently high quality. Nurses and patients felt frustrated. “I’ll do two tries,” one nurse said. “The patients can’t take more than that.”
And then there was the human factor. At one clinic half the patients earmarked for the study declined to be involved after finding out that although the results would be virtually instantaneous (previously some results had taken ten weeks to arrive), a positive diagnosis would see them being referred to a hospital an hour’s drive away. One member of medical staff told the Google researchers that patients “are not concerned with accuracy, but how the experience will be – will it waste my time if I have to go to the hospital?”
There’s little doubt that the technology works: tests in the trial proved accurate when conditions were right. And when things were going well, Beede says, senior nurses felt they had more time to spend with patients and speak to them about their health and lifestyles. But the unpredictability of the everyday world and the needs and concerns of humans cannot be ignored.
“I think the main takeaway from this research is that we need to be designing AI tools with people at the centre,” says Beede. “We need to be considering our success beyond the accuracy of the model. We need to understand how it’s actually going to work for real people in context.” She argues that as more AI is implemented in the real world, more pilot studies will be required to ensure that it works for everyone involved. “That implementation is of equal importance to the accuracy of the algorithm itself, and cannot always be controlled through careful planning,” the Google report concludes.
The need for a proper and carefully considered partnership between humans and AI has been well demonstrated by Finale Doshi-Velez, a Harvard University computer science professor who leads its Data to Actionable Knowledge Lab. In one experiment, she and her colleagues recruited 220 psychiatrists to study case notes for hypothetical patients supposedly suffering from major depressive disorder. Each set of case notes described that particular patient’s condition and was then followed by either an independently verified correct AI-generated recommendation for treatment, an incorrect recommendation or no recommendation at all. Where an AI diagnosis was given, it was accompanied by an explanation for that diagnosis, which varied in length, quality and detail.
What we found was that when the recommendation was correct, overall, everything improved,” Doshi-Velez says. Doctors and AI decisions proved to be a formidable team. “Humans may have already had an idea, the recommendation reinforced it or caused them to change their mind to that idea.” However, when the recommendation presented to the volunteer doctors was incorrect, it tended to lead to poorer forms of decision-making. The psychiatrists were influenced by incorrect recommendations from the AI, leading to lower levels of treatment selection accuracy. This is scarcely a new phenomenon.
It’s long been known that if we put machines in charge of simple tasks, humans will, without continuous training, forget how to do them. Hence, at an everyday level, why digital contact books in phones have caused us not to remember phone numbers any more. Hence, at an extreme level, why on June 1, 2009 the pilots of Air France Flight 447, who had come to rely heavily on the plane’s autopilot features, could not cope when the systems failed, and so presided over a crash in which 228 people perished. With AI this “paradox of automation” is only going to become more pronounced.
The way in which information is presented is also an important factor in determining the success or otherwise of the final outcome. “Certain forms of explanation are more effective at preventing a wrong decision,” Doshi-Velez says. It’s something the Google Health researchers have noticed, too. In their field trial in Thailand, says Google product manager Lily Peng, a system notification that an image was ungradable and that there should be a referral could very easily be misinterpreted. “For some people it means being referred to retinal specialists, which is at the higher end of care, versus refer for human review, which is what ended up being part of the protocol,” she explains.
It’s not just about the machine-learning part, it’s about figuring out how to present the information as well,” Doshi-Velez argues, stressing the point that conclusions reached by an AI system need to make humans think. Such conclusions can’t be too easy to accept or they risk becoming relied upon without that crucial element of critical thinking. By the same token, they can’t be too hard to digest or humans will simply ignore or gloss over them. “Models need to be transparent in their limitations, highlighting situations in which the AI prediction may not be accurate or valid,” the Harvard study concludes.
But when humans and AI are in sync, the potential benefits are huge. The more positive outcomes of the Harvard project, for example, suggest AI could eventually help with diagnosis for a mental health condition that is often missed and for which treatments vary wildly. They start to offer hope for the more than 264 million people around the world who battle with depression.

What, then, does the future hold for AI and the world of work in the medium term? It’s likely to be a mixed bag of results. There have been and will continue to be disappointments and failures as use of the technology expands.
In 2018 IBM had to ditch a multi-million-dollar project designed to help the treatment of cancer patients after it was found to be giving clinicians bad advice. During the coronavirus pandemic Walmart abandoned the use of robots to scan shelves and assess levels of stock when it realised humans were just as effective. An October 2020 study conducted by the MIT Sloan Management Review and the Boston Consulting Group, which surveyed more than 3,000 business leaders running companies with annual revenues above $100 million, discovered that only in ten per cent of cases did people feel that the investment they made in AI produced a “significant” return.
AI will cause disruption, too. “Better-educated, better-paid workers will be the most affected by the new technology, with some exceptions,” research from the Brookings Institution found in November 2019. Those whose jobs currently involve a close focus on data will be particularly vulnerable: market researchers, sales managers, computer programmers and personal finance advisers among them. Those whose jobs involve a lot of interpersonal skills, such as those in education and social care, will probably be less affected: AI is very unlikely to replace human compassion and empathy. That said, in Japan care robots are already used to help the country’s ageing population. And in any case, it’s dangerous to make sweeping generalisations. The fact is that AI adoption will vary around the world according to local culture and social attitudes. Automation in finance in Singapore is likely to be very different from automation in finance in Pakistan.
If Google’s work with computer vision or Harvard’s study with psychiatrists are anything to go by, though, it seems likely that the general trend will be for AI not to replace existing jobs but to transform them – and to create new ones, too. Already, thousands of roles exist that would have been unimaginable at the turn of the century. Scores of people now work on AI labelling, helping to compile datasets that train machine learning. Thousands of individuals have been taken on at companies such as Facebook and YouTube to moderate content that might be breaking their platforms’ rules, which has in many cases been initially flagged by an AI.
Researchers at MIT Sloan and Boston argue that those companies poised to benefit most from AI are those who use it to augment and shape traditional processes rather than replace them. In other words, they create an environment in which humans learn from AI and AI learns from humans. The toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker is one example. It has started using computer vision to check the quality of the tape measures it manufactures. The system flags defects in real time, spotting problems early in the production cycle and so reducing wastage. But humans are still on hand to inspect and make judgement calls on the worst faults.
Experts are key to creating trustworthy AI systems, says Ken Chatfield, the vice-president of research at Tractable, an AI firm that uses computer vision to help make decisions about insurance claims after car crashes – its AI is being used in the real world by some of the biggest insurance companies. The company initially trained its AI on thousands of images of vehicles that had been in accidents – involving damaged door panels, broken windscreens and more.
But it saw the biggest improvements in the system’s performance when the damage highlighted in images had been labelled by specialists, with years of experience in assessing crash reports. And it is human insurance agents who take over once the AI has reviewed images and suggested what the next steps should be. “The data in itself is not enough, and also our knowledge as researchers is not enough – we really need to draw on the knowledge of experts in order to be able to train models,” Chatfield explains. “Involving the expert is also what we need to build up trust”.
The London-based lawyer Richard Robinson, the CEO of Robin AI, has struck a not dissimilar balance in the legal field. He quit his job at a large law firm when he became convinced that many of the repetitive tasks that went into contract work could be automated. “A lot of what I would spend my time doing as a lawyer felt like it didn’t need much brain power,” he explains. His view was that machine learning could be utilised for reviewing some types of contract, such as those concerned with employment conditions. The tasks involved seemed simple enough.
It didn’t, however, turn out that way. “The truth is it was much more difficult than we anticipated,” Robinson says. “There are so many random things that could be in that document, that you can’t be confident that the AI will always identify them.” What he therefore did was to create a system in which AI works with human lawyers rather than instead of them. The company’s system has been trained on historical contracts – both those in the public domain and documents provided by clients – and taught to look for particular elements. It’s therefore able to detect whether a non-compete clause has been sneakily added into a business contract, or whether an employment contract stipulates non-standard working hours.
If it finds anomalies, the system alerts a human lawyer via email and they then check the document. The same thing happens if the system is unable to interpret a particular clause or contract. A recent assignment the company took on was checking contracts between big fast-food retailers and their suppliers during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, to find out what each party’s obligations were in the event of a crisis.
Robinson’s view is that lawyers find checking contracts tedious. At the same time, it’s dangerous to rely wholly on AI, because even if it’s getting things right 96 per cent of the time, that’s not good enough when companies’ and individuals’ lives and livelihoods are at stake. “We want to use AI to make the first attempt at everything in situations where it’s really easy for a person to check and see if it’s wrong or right,” he says.
However organisations end up using AI, there’s no doubt that as it spreads it will become easier to access and operate. At present most AI deployments involve handcrafted technology. In the future, a company’s AI requirements may be handled by a third party, using software that seems as straightforward as that inside word processors or slideshow builders.
A company that wants to use AI to analyse specific datasets or images will be able to use a template to create this. The algorithm it picks may not have been created by the third-party service they’re buying the template from, but from another company further up the chain of businesses developing and industrialising AI. The technology will become plug-and-play. By that point we may hardly notice its interaction with our daily lives.
Once this happens the world really will change significantly. People’s workplaces will face automation at a greater scale than at any point so far this millennium. For many the entire nature of work may change. How we interact with businesses and government services will also be transformed.
Societies that deploy AI will need to learn how people react to the technology and what their expectations of it are. At the same time, individuals will only follow the directions given by an AI if the system works efficiently, is understandable – and can be trusted.

Trust is going to be essential to the broad adoptionSave this storySaveSave this storySaveGetty ImagesAt the warehouses of British online grocery technology company Ocado, robots, guided by AI, whizz around on rails at speeds of up to four metres per second, picking a 50-item order in minutes. The journeys then taken by Ocado’s delivery trucks are optimised by a neural network that makes more than 14 million last-mile routing calculations per second, and adjusts delivery routes each time a customer places a new order or adds extra items to their shopping lists.But Ocado’s most ambitious automation efforts involve packing robots. At the time of writing the company has five robotic picking arms powered by computer vision, and other machine-learning systems that can identify the products that need to be packed and use suction power to grab them. Further advances, undertaken in conjunction with two European academic-led projects, are in the pipeline.AdvertisementPicking and packing aren’t easy if you’re a robot. “From a human’s perspective, it is a fairly simple task to pick and pack, and it doesn’t require an awful lot of training,” says Alex Harvey, chief of advanced technology at Ocado Technology. “For a computer and for a robot, the dexterous manipulation involved is far beyond the state of the art today to be able to pick and pack the full range of items that we do.”Trending NowCES HQ 2021: Artificial Intelligence in American DefenseOcado’s Robotic Suction Pick (RSP) machine is a vacuum cup, powered by an air compressor, that sits at the end of an articulated arm. It uses computer vision and built-in sensors to select items gathered by a bot and place them into a shopping bag. Ocado.com sells a vast range of products, running into the tens of thousands. In terms of outward physical appearance, some are much the same: a tin of chopped tomatoes, for example, is not that different from a tin of lentils. But a tin of chopped tomatoes is very different indeed from a pack of yoghurts, which in turn are more sturdy than, say, a bunch of grapes. And, of course, even grapes aren’t all the same – they vary according to their variety and state of ripeness. Get the pressure of the vacuum cup wrong and the RSP will either drop or crush the item it is attempting to manipulate. Get the sequence wrong and there’s a danger that the tin of tomatoes will squash the grapes.At present, the company is expanding the number of items its robotic suction system can pick. “There’s no point having for 60,000 different items, 60,000 different control pieces of code,” Harvey says. “What we want at Ocado is generalised control strategies.” But challenges remain. “We need to fit a robot into the same square footage that the person sits in or operates in, and we need the robot system to achieve the same throughput.”Until a robot can pick and pack as many items in an hour as a human being – Harvey says this is around 600–700 items – it is unlikely to be widely adopted: the impact on productivity would damage service and profits. It also has to be affordable, which means, on the one hand, scaling the technology to the point where it becomes economically worthwhile, and, on the other hand, not over-speccing it (for example, by using a camera with an unnecessarily high resolution). “When we’re deploying stuff in the real world, we want it to be economical in the way that we’re deploying it,” Harvey says. “I don’t want to deploy a supercomputer next to every robot picker.”Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDWhether or not such AI will ultimately replace humans is the billion-dollar question. Many now believe AI will work alongside humans. Obviously, AI offers the promise of greater efficiency, but so far, at least, this tends to hold good only where the environment is relatively controlled and predictable. Production lines and warehouses may well become fully automated. But where processes interact with the outside world – with all its randomness – it’s harder to envisage a wholly AI future. Delivery drivers, for instance, have to take into account such factors as the weather and the erratic behaviour of some pedestrians. It’s possible that there will be a future without them. It’s also possible, though, that AI will control lorries and delivery trucks on major highways where conditions are relatively predictable, and that human drivers will take over the driving as they reach the outskirts of the villages, towns and cities set as their destinations.Arguably, it’s the medical sphere where AI’s potential and its limitations have been most apparent – and where its possible future relationship with humans has been most clearly demonstrated. Take one of Google’s computer-vision systems, for example. It’s capable of spotting diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes that can cause sight loss. In lab conditions, it can achieve an accuracy rate of 90 per cent and provide results in ten minutes.When put to a real-world test in Thailand, however, the deep-learning set-up often struggled. The 11 clinics that operated it used different technology. Only two had a dedicated eye-screen room that could be made dark enough for patients’ pupils to enlarge to the point where high-quality fundus photos could be taken. Most had to make use of nurses’ offices or general-purpose rooms.Emma Beede, the lead Google Health researcher evaluating the technology, described one room where, because dental checks and patient consultation were going on, it was essential to leave the light on. “That makes sense for them,” she says. “That makes sense when you’re under-resourced.”Poor internet connection caused problems, too – at one clinic it dropped out altogether for two hours. One way and another, during the first six months of the trial, 21 per cent (393) of the 1,838 images put through the system proved to be of an insufficiently high quality. Nurses and patients felt frustrated. “I’ll do two tries,” one nurse said. “The patients can’t take more than that.”And then there was the human factor. At one clinic half the patients earmarked for the study declined to be involved after finding out that although the results would be virtually instantaneous (previously some results had taken ten weeks to arrive), a positive diagnosis would see them being referred to a hospital an hour’s drive away. One member of medical staff told the Google researchers that patients “are not concerned with accuracy, but how the experience will be – will it waste my time if I have to go to the hospital?”There’s little doubt that the technology works: tests in the trial proved accurate when conditions were right. And when things were going well, Beede says, senior nurses felt they had more time to spend with patients and speak to them about their health and lifestyles. But the unpredictability of the everyday world and the needs and concerns of humans cannot be ignored.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIRED“I think the main takeaway from this research is that we need to be designing AI tools with people at the centre,” says Beede. “We need to be considering our success beyond the accuracy of the model. We need to understand how it’s actually going to work for real people in context.” She argues that as more AI is implemented in the real world, more pilot studies will be required to ensure that it works for everyone involved. “That implementation is of equal importance to the accuracy of the algorithm itself, and cannot always be controlled through careful planning,” the Google report concludes.The need for a proper and carefully considered partnership between humans and AI has been well demonstrated by Finale Doshi-Velez, a Harvard University computer science professor who leads its Data to Actionable Knowledge Lab. In one experiment, she and her colleagues recruited 220 psychiatrists to study case notes for hypothetical patients supposedly suffering from major depressive disorder. Each set of case notes described that particular patient’s condition and was then followed by either an independently verified correct AI-generated recommendation for treatment, an incorrect recommendation or no recommendation at all. Where an AI diagnosis was given, it was accompanied by an explanation for that diagnosis, which varied in length, quality and detail.What we found was that when the recommendation was correct, overall, everything improved,” Doshi-Velez says. Doctors and AI decisions proved to be a formidable team. “Humans may have already had an idea, the recommendation reinforced it or caused them to change their mind to that idea.” However, when the recommendation presented to the volunteer doctors was incorrect, it tended to lead to poorer forms of decision-making. The psychiatrists were influenced by incorrect recommendations from the AI, leading to lower levels of treatment selection accuracy. This is scarcely a new phenomenon.It’s long been known that if we put machines in charge of simple tasks, humans will, without continuous training, forget how to do them. Hence, at an everyday level, why digital contact books in phones have caused us not to remember phone numbers any more. Hence, at an extreme level, why on June 1, 2009 the pilots of Air France Flight 447, who had come to rely heavily on the plane’s autopilot features, could not cope when the systems failed, and so presided over a crash in which 228 people perished. With AI this “paradox of automation” is only going to become more pronounced.The way in which information is presented is also an important factor in determining the success or otherwise of the final outcome. “Certain forms of explanation are more effective at preventing a wrong decision,” Doshi-Velez says. It’s something the Google Health researchers have noticed, too. In their field trial in Thailand, says Google product manager Lily Peng, a system notification that an image was ungradable and that there should be a referral could very easily be misinterpreted. “For some people it means being referred to retinal specialists, which is at the higher end of care, versus refer for human review, which is what ended up being part of the protocol,” she explains.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDIt’s not just about the machine-learning part, it’s about figuring out how to present the information as well,” Doshi-Velez argues, stressing the point that conclusions reached by an AI system need to make humans think. Such conclusions can’t be too easy to accept or they risk becoming relied upon without that crucial element of critical thinking. By the same token, they can’t be too hard to digest or humans will simply ignore or gloss over them. “Models need to be transparent in their limitations, highlighting situations in which the AI prediction may not be accurate or valid,” the Harvard study concludes.But when humans and AI are in sync, the potential benefits are huge. The more positive outcomes of the Harvard project, for example, suggest AI could eventually help with diagnosis for a mental health condition that is often missed and for which treatments vary wildly. They start to offer hope for the more than 264 million people around the world who battle with depression.Read more: Could The Simpsons replace its voice actors with AI deepfakes?What, then, does the future hold for AI and the world of work in the medium term? It’s likely to be a mixed bag of results. There have been and will continue to be disappointments and failures as use of the technology expands.In 2018 IBM had to ditch a multi-million-dollar project designed to help the treatment of cancer patients after it was found to be giving clinicians bad advice. During the coronavirus pandemic Walmart abandoned the use of robots to scan shelves and assess levels of stock when it realised humans were just as effective. An October 2020 study conducted by the MIT Sloan Management Review and the Boston Consulting Group, which surveyed more than 3,000 business leaders running companies with annual revenues above $100 million, discovered that only in ten per cent of cases did people feel that the investment they made in AI produced a “significant” return.AI will cause disruption, too. “Better-educated, better-paid workers will be the most affected by the new technology, with some exceptions,” research from the Brookings Institution found in November 2019. Those whose jobs currently involve a close focus on data will be particularly vulnerable: market researchers, sales managers, computer programmers and personal finance advisers among them. Those whose jobs involve a lot of interpersonal skills, such as those in education and social care, will probably be less affected: AI is very unlikely to replace human compassion and empathy. That said, in Japan care robots are already used to help the country’s ageing population. And in any case, it’s dangerous to make sweeping generalisations. The fact is that AI adoption will vary around the world according to local culture and social attitudes. Automation in finance in Singapore is likely to be very different from automation in finance in Pakistan.If Google’s work with computer vision or Harvard’s study with psychiatrists are anything to go by, though, it seems likely that the general trend will be for AI not to replace existing jobs but to transform them – and to create new ones, too. Already, thousands of roles exist that would have been unimaginable at the turn of the century. Scores of people now work on AI labelling, helping to compile datasets that train machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence in the Hiring Experience Stack Can Create Efficiency Without Bias

Updated: Apr 1, 2021




The past year has seen major disruption in nearly every aspect of our work lives, and that disruption was perhaps felt the most in HR departments. With complicated COVID-related reopening measures, furloughs and layoffs, facilitating communication, reevaluations of benefits, and the current rehiring process, HR professionals have needed to alter their strategies and adopt a more agile, digital-first approach in the process.

One emerging technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, has been instrumental in helping to streamline processes for HR departments, particularly in the hiring process. Though this new addition to the HR toolkit isn’t without controversy, it has the ability to create a more equitable and scalable hiring and candidate evaluation process that benefits all parties, including the candidates themselves.



It should be noted that AI is already integrated into certain aspects of the HR process, though it’s important to think about this AI as artificial intelligence 1.0. HR professionals can use chatbots and other basic machine learning structures to help prospective and new hires get answers to questions that require a basic back-and-forth communication. HR portals can incorporate questions for prospective candidates on benefits, employment policies, compensation, general questions about the position, and other “Level 1” support queries that can help save HR professionals’ time. This task automation is already a part of HR, helping to create an integrated approach to address all HR-related questions, both pre- and post-hire.

	



AI has gone beyond the realm of task automation, however, and is now being integrated into other more strategic facets of HR, namely the talent decision process. As companies begin restaffing with further reopening measures, AI can be a crucial component in streamlining the evaluation in the hiring process.



The Current State of AI in Candidate Evaluation
When we talk about AI and machine learning in candidate evaluation, it’s important to create a distinction between where we currently stand and where the industry is heading, as well as find commonalities between these two phases. Where we are now, AI is learned about and improved on based on historical behaviors. Where we’re headed will be more focused on the outcomes of a hire, which can truly unlock the potential of this technology to optimize workforces in the future.



At the start, it’s important to understand what we mean when we talk about AI and machine learning on a base level. It’s not common knowledge, but CAPTCHA represents a prime example of AI-powered learning. Picture an image array of fire hydrants; through a repetition of responses—a feedback loop from actual human respondents—a program can begin to understand patterns of recognition. So, going forward, future humans interacting with the same CAPTCHA parameters will select the same photos of fire hydrants. This human feedback loop reinforces the program, which can be used to authenticate future respondents.



Within the hiring process, AI can be used to track patterns in successful respondents; within recorded video interviews, hiring managers or recruiters can create baselines of responses they deem successful and use those data to optimize future ideal responses. Of course, this AI is only as good as the humans creating this feedback loop within the process. HR departments are an essential component to sorting out instances of bias and make the AI function as close to a human as possible.




When executed successfully, this human-led, AI-driven approach to candidate evaluation works for both HR professionals and candidates. Instead of qualified candidates’ application materials sitting at the bottom of a stack of 1,000 other applicants (as they currently do), AI can give HR departments the ability to accommodate large-scale hiring efforts without glossing over or frustrating qualified applicants.



Furthermore, when there are biases within AI—specifically with regard to race and gender—they can be excluded through analysis. The biases in human HR recruiters, however, will continue to exist; think of an HR professional favoring a candidate who went to the same college, for example. For the best results for this type of AI, it should rely on a diverse array of recruiters reviewing hundreds of candidate video responses, teaching the system and canceling out bias from the beginning, and then continually monitoring the program to ensure it remains unbiased.



The way HR can currently deploy AI within the hiring experience stack is certainly a scalable step forward to ensuring all candidates are evaluated, particularly for high-volume jobs. However, this AI is based on information that determines a successful hire, not necessarily a successful employee. The next frontier is the potential of AI to predict an employee’s outcome instead of replicating recruiter behavior.



Effective Ways to Set Up AI Within the Hiring Stack
When AI is leveraged in the hiring process, current methodology is primarily deployed to determine which candidate would be the best fit within a company based on past hiring. Yet we know from experience that the wrong people are hired all the time; we also know that the cost of hiring the wrong person can be substantial—conventional wisdom says it can cost 150% of an employee’s salary.



What if AI could be leveraged based on the parameters set by other employees who have demonstrated success in a position? Say after 3 months, for example, an employee has demonstrated aptitude for a position and has proven himself or herself to be a cultural and performance fit; AI can then be used to favor the traits that have been proven successful in that employee’s hiring.




While again, the applications for this brand of AI may work better for large-scale hiring efforts for high-volume, similar jobs, in the future, it will be able to be applied across many more specialized positions across multiple companies. Instead of a single-source employer testing its current employees against prospective ones, a plurality of HR professionals can amass data on successful traits of positions across entire industries, creating an AI-driven employee evaluation process that works for everyone.



The important thing to remember, however, is that AI needs constant auditing. Without ongoing oversight, it can fall victim to the same biases as humans or the unintended biases of machines. When deployed successfully, however, AI can streamline the candidate evaluation process at scale for employers while giving all candidates an equal opportunity.

Computers have written and recorded a new song in the style of Nirvana.

Ever since Kurt Cobain‘s death in 1994, Nirvana fans have hypothesized about the music he would have made had he lived. But other than “You Know You’re Right,” the scabrous, throat-shredding meditation on confusion that Nirvana recorded a few months before his suicide, and a few comments he told confidants about potentially collaborating with R.E.M.’s Michael Stipe or going completely solo, he mainly left behind question marks.
Now an organization has created a “new” Nirvana song using artificial-intelligence software to approximate the singer-guitarist’s songwriting. The guitar riffs vary from quiet, “Come as You Are”–style plucking to raging, Bleach fury à la “Scoff.” And lyrics like, “The sun shines on you but I don’t know how,” and a surprisingly anthemic chorus, “I don’t care/I feel as one, drowned in the sun,” bear evocative, Cobain-esque qualities.

But other than the vocals — the work of Nirvana tribute band frontman Eric Hogan — the song’s creators say nearly everything on the song, from the turns of phrase to the reckless guitar performance, is the work of computers. Their intention is to draw attention to the tragedy of Cobain’s death by suicide and how living musicians can get help with depression.

The tune, titled “Drowned in the Sun,” is part of Lost Tapes of the 27 Club, a project featuring songs written and mostly performed by machines in the styles of other musicians who died at 27: Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Amy Winehouse. Each track is the result of AI programs analyzing up to 30 songs by each artist and granularly studying the tracks’ vocal melodies, chord changes, guitar riffs and solos, drum patterns, and lyrics to guess what their “new” compositions would sound like. The project is the work of Over the Bridge, a Toronto organization that helps members of the music industry struggling with mental illness.

“Drowned in the Sun” (In the style of Nirvana)

“What if all these musicians that we love had mental health support?” says Sean O’Connor, who is on the board of directors for Over the Bridge and also works as creative director for the advertising agency Rethink. “Somehow in the music industry, [depression] is normalized and romanticized … Their music is seen as authentic suffering.”
To create the songs, O’Connor and his staff enlisted Google’s AI program Magenta, which learns how to compose in the style of given artists by analyzing their works. Previously, Sony has used the software to make a “new” Beatles song, and the electropop group Yacht used it to write their 2019 album Chain Tripping.

For the Lost Tapes project, Magenta analyzed the artists’ songs as MIDI files, which works similarly to a player-piano scroll by translating pitch and rhythm into a digital code that can be fed through a synthesizer to recreate a song. After examining each artist’s note choices, rhythmic quirks, and preferences for harmony in the MIDI file, the computer creates new music that the staff could pore over to pick the best moments.
“The more MIDI files you input, the better,” O’Connor says. “So we took 20 to 30 songs from each of our artists as MIDI files and broke them down to just the hook, solo, vocal melody or rhythm guitar and put those through one at a time. If you put whole songs through, [the program] starts to get really confused on what [it’s] supposed to sound like. But if you just have a bunch of riffs, it’ll put out about five minutes of new AI-written riffs, 90 percent of which is really bad and unlistenable. So you start listening through and just finding little moments that are interesting.”
O’Connor and his team used a similar process for lyrics, using a generic AI program called an artificial neural network. They were able to input the artist’s lyrics and start off with a few words and the program would guess the cadence and tone of the poetry to complete it. “It was a lot of trial and error,” O’Connor says, adding that the team examined “pages and pages” of lyrics for turns of phrase that syllabically fit the vocal melodies Magenta produced.
 









“Man, I Know” (In the style of Amy Winehouse) 

Once the compositions were in place, an audio house arranged all the different parts to evoke the musician. “A lot of the instrumentation was MIDI with different effects added to it,” O’Connor says of the finished recordings. Then they started recruiting singers. “Everyone that we brought in, for the most part, were working tribute artists for these bands, so they could kind of do the inflections and make it sound as realistic as possible,” O’Connor says.
Eric Hogan has been fronting Atlanta’s Nevermind: The Ultimate Tribute to Nirvana for the past six years. The band started out as a one-off lark for Halloween; an excuse for Hogan and his friends to perform Foo Fighters, Stone Temple Pilots, and Nirvana tribute sets. But when they saw the huge reaction their Nirvana set got, they went full grunge. When the Over the Bridge team asked him to sing on “Drowned in the Sun,” he thought the project sounded both unbelievable (in the most literal sense of the word) and cool. “After the conversation, I still didn’t really think it was a real thing,” he says. “And then they sent me files and money.”
When he first heard the music, he was dumbfounded. “I was like, ‘I don’t know how to [sing] this,'” he remembers. “I had to have the guy who came up with the AI track mumble and hum [the tune]. I would feel weird trying to assume what [Cobain] would do. They had to give me a little bit of a roadmap, and then from there, it was fine.”

O’Connor and his staff put about a year into research and development for the songs and another six months to get recordings finished. As they worked, they sought out superfans of the artists to help police themselves for potential plagiarism. They worried that the Doors-esque tune, “The Roads Are Alive,” might sound a bit too much like that group’s “Peace Frog,” but ultimately decided it didn’t. “An audio engineer took ‘Peace Frog’ and played it for us,” O’Connor says. “He’s like, ‘This is what “Peace Frog” is doing; this is what this is doing.’ It’s different. OK, now we’re comfortable with it.”
“The Roads Are Alive” (In the style of the Doors)

Nirvana proved to be one of the harder artists for the machines to approximate. Whereas an artist like Hendrix often built songs like “Purple Haze” and “Fire” with easily definable riffs, Cobain frequently played chunky, punky chord progressions that confused the computers. “You tended to get a wall of sound,” O’Connor says of the Nirvana-inspired music Magenta produced. “There’s less of an identifiable common thread throughout all their songs to give you this big chunk of catalog that the machine could just learn from and create something new.”
 









“[‘Drowned in the Sun’] is accurate enough to give you that [Nirvana] vibe, but not so accurate to where someone’s going to get a cease-and-desist letter,” Hogan claims. “If you look at the last quote-unquote Nirvana release, which was, ‘You Know You’re Right,’ this has the same type of vibe. Kurt would just sort of write whatever the hell he felt like writing. And if he liked it, then that was a Nirvana song. I can hear certain things in the arrangement of [‘Drowned in the Sun’] like, ‘OK, that’s kind of an In Utero vibe right here or a Nevermind vibe right here. … I really understood the AI of it.”
Hogan says he especially appreciated the lyrics that the computer concocted. In his opinion, Cobain’s words were always “sort of a hodgepodge,” but he feels these lyrics are more direct without losing sight of Cobain’s typical messages. “This felt like a complete thought,” he says.
“The song is saying, ‘I’m a weirdo, but I like it,'” he says. “That is total Kurt Cobain right there. The sentiment is exactly what he would have said. ‘The sun shines on you, but I don’t know how’ — that’s great. Essentially, what I get from the song is, ‘I’m F-ed up, and you’re F-ed up. The difference is that I’m OK with it and you’re not.'” (When Hogan heard the music, he offered to play the guitar himself, but the producers declined, opting for a machine.)
So then is “Drowned in the Sun” some kind of Frankenstein creation, existing in defiance of God and the universe? “I don’t know if I’m the best guy to talk to about ethics,” Hogan says with a laugh. “I mean, I travel around the country pretending to be somebody.
“You’re Gonna Kill Me” (In the style of Jimi Hendrix)

 
“I think that you’re going to have a lot of people who are going to vilify this and are going to look at it like, ‘Oh, it’s the death of real music,'” he continues. “But I’m totally fine with it. Used as a tool, I think it’s pretty cool. I don’t know what’s going to happen legally in the future. Once you start going down the road of where it starts to really sound good, maybe then you start to have an issue with that.”
 









Over the Bridge’s intention is to simply raise awareness about mental health resources; the organization runs a Facebook page that offers support, as well as Zoom sessions and workshops to educate artists and make them feel less alone. (They have no plans to sell the tracks.) “Sometimes just the acknowledgment of one other person saying, ‘I’m feeling the same way that you are’ is enough to take people at least feel that they’ve got some sort of support,” says Michael Scriven, a rep for Lemmon Entertainment whose CEO is on Over the Bridge’s board of directors.
Scriven hopes the project also raises awareness about just how much work goes into AI music. “There’s an inordinate amount of human hands at the beginning, middle and end to create something like this,” he says. “A lot of people may think [AI] is going to replace musicians at some point, but at this point, the number of humans that are required just to get to a point where a song is listenable is actually quite significant.” Each song required work from O’Connor, a Magenta technician, a music producer, an audio engineer, and the vocalists. “We’re not going to push a button and replace these artists,” O’Connor says.
“I hope [the Over the Bridge people] go deeper with AI,” Hogan says. “There’s so much more in this category that you can do.”

Melanoma is a type of malignant tumor responsible for more than 70 percent of all skin cancer-related deaths worldwide. For years, physicians have relied on visual inspection to identify suspicious pigmented lesions (SPLs), which can be an indication of skin cancer. Such early-stage identification of SPLs in primary care settings can improve melanoma prognosis and significantly reduce treatment cost.
The challenge is that quickly finding and prioritizing SPLs is difficult, due to the high volume of pigmented lesions that often need to be evaluated for potential biopsies. Now, researchers from MIT and elsewhere have devised a new artificial intelligence pipeline, using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and applying them to analyzing SPLs through the use of wide-field photography common in most smartphones and personal cameras.










              

            How it works: A wide-field image, acquired with a smartphone camera, shows large skin sections from a patient in a primary-care setting. An automated system detects, extracts, and analyzes all pigmented skin lesions observable in the wide-field image. A pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) determines the suspiciousness of individual pigmented lesions and marks them (yellow = consider further inspection, red = requires further inspection or referral to dermatologist). Extracted features are used to further assess pigmented lesions and to display results in a heatmap format.

DCNNs are neural networks that can be used to classify (or “name”) images to then cluster them (such as when performing a photo search). These machine learning algorithms belong to the subset of deep learning.
Using cameras to take wide-field photographs of large areas of patients’ bodies, the program uses DCNNs to quickly and effectively identify and screen for early-stage melanoma, according to Luis R. Soenksen, a postdoc and a medical device expert currently acting as MIT’s first Venture Builder in Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare. Soenksen conducted the research with MIT researchers, including MIT Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) faculty members Martha J. Gray, W. Kieckhefer Professor of Health Sciences and Technology, professor of electrical engineering and computer science; and James J. Collins, Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science and Biological Engineering.
Soenksen, who is the first author of the recent paper, “Using Deep Learning for Dermatologist-level Detection of Suspicious Pigmented Skin Lesions from Wide-field Images,” published in Science Translational Medicine, explains that “Early detection of SPLs can save lives; however, the current capacity of medical systems to provide comprehensive skin screenings at scale are still lacking.”
The paper describes the development of an SPL analysis system using DCNNs to more quickly and efficiently identify skin lesions that require more investigation, screenings that can be done during routine primary care visits, or even by the patients themselves. The system utilized DCNNs to optimize the identification and classification of SPLs in wide-field images.
Using AI, the researchers trained the system using 20,388 wide-field images from 133 patients at the Hospital Gregorio Marañón in Madrid, as well as publicly available images. The images were taken with a variety of ordinary cameras that are readily available to consumers. Dermatologists working with the researchers visually classified the lesions in the images for comparison. They found that the system achieved more than 90.3 percent sensitivity in distinguishing SPLs from nonsuspicious lesions, skin, and complex backgrounds, by avoiding the need for cumbersome and time-consuming individual lesion imaging. Additionally, the paper presents a new method to extract intra-patient lesion saliency (ugly duckling criteria, or the comparison of the lesions on the skin of one individual that stand out from the rest) on the basis of DCNN features from detected lesions.
“Our research suggests that systems leveraging computer vision and deep neural networks, quantifying such common signs, can achieve comparable accuracy to expert dermatologists,” Soenksen explains. “We hope our research revitalizes the desire to deliver more efficient dermatological screenings in primary care settings to drive adequate referrals.”
Doing so would allow for more rapid and accurate assessments of SPLS and could lead to earlier treatment of melanoma, according to the researchers.
Gray, who is senior author of the paper, explains how this important project developed: ""This work originated as a new project developed by fellows (five of the co-authors) in the MIT Catalyst program, a program designed to nucleate projects that solve pressing clinical needs. This work exemplifies the vision of HST/IMES devotee (in which tradition Catalyst was founded) of leveraging science to advance human health.” This work was supported by Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health and by the Consejería de Educación, Juventud y Deportes de la Comunidad de Madrid through the Madrid-MIT M+Visión Consortium.

Decisions once made by people are increasingly being made by machines, often without transparency or accountability. In “A.I. Nation,”(link is external) a new podcast premiering on April 1, Princeton University and Philadelphia public radio station WHYY have partnered to explore the omnipresence of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and its implications for our everyday lives.

“A.I. Nation” is co-hosted by Ed Felten(link is external), the Robert E. Kahn Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs and founding director of Princeton’s Center for Information Technology Policy(link is external), and WHYY reporter Malcolm Burnley. Over the course of five episodes, the pair will investigate how artificial intelligence is affecting our lives right now, and the impact that technologies like machine learning, automation and predictive analytics will have on our future.
The podcast will also consider how we, as digital citizens, can protect ourselves from the inherent biases of artificial intelligence, and work towards fairness and social justice.
“We spent a long time figuring out how to make a podcast that is compelling without being superficial, and connects everyday life to the deep and important issues raised by the A.I. and computing revolution,” said Felten. “There were several false starts and some pilots that got progressively closer to the vision. Then we connected to the team at WHYY, and found the recipe.”
“This partnership with WHYY is the first of its kind for Princeton, and we couldn’t be more excited,” said Brent Colburn, vice president for communications and public affairs at Princeton. “As Philadelphia’s neighbor to the north, we share an intellectually curious community that is craving insightful audio content. Princeton’s cutting-edge research, together with WHYY’s world-class reporting and production, has resulted in a podcast that is timely, engaging and forward-thinking(link is external).”
Felten and Burnley will explore the incredible advances A.I. has engendered, including the rapid development of the COVID-19 vaccine. They will also delve into its darker sides, uncovering how A.I. can be “human in all the wrong ways” and exhibit biases that lead to wrongful arrests or political misinformation.
In the first two episodes, which launch today, Felten and Burnley investigate natural language processing and automated vehicles. Natural language processing, or NLP, is a computer’s ability to communicate using human language as opposed to computer code, and is responsible for things we use every day, like autocorrect or Google’s predictive search. In episode one(link is external), Felten and Burnley experiment with GPT3, an NLP technology developed by Open AI, a research lab founded by Elon Musk and funded by Microsoft. While GPT3’s capabilities are incredible — it can write everything from novels to news stories — it can also be inconsistent. What is more alarming, however, is that the technology is capable of spreading misinformation. This, as Felten and Burnley discuss, is one of the reasons why Open AI believed its previous version of the model, GPT2, was too dangerous to release to the general public.

In episode two(link is external), “A.I. in the Driver’s Seat,” Burnley and Felten consider the safety, security and ethical implications of automated machines. Burnley tours a Princeton drone lab with Anirudha Majumdar, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, to witness the A.I. behind drones in action.  Felten and Burnley also discuss some of the reasons why self-driving vehicles, a technology that has been in development for decades, are still not available to the public and how they might be used in the near future.  
New episodes ­­— on “The Next Pandemic” (April 15), “Biased Intelligence” (April 22) and “Echo Chambers” (April 29) — will be released throughout the month.

The basic ordering agreement would allow those components and federal partners to issue task orders for the work to get data in shape for artificial intelligence — that could include everything from capturing data to sorting it for storage to modeling how employees will use it with AI to get better insights.The Data Readiness for Artificial Intelligence Development (DRAID) Services ordering agreement will “help the DoD and Government users prepare data for use in AI applications by providing an easily accessible path to access the cutting-edge commercial services needed to meet the complex technical challenges involved in preparing data for AI,” the solicitation read.“The services addressed by the DRAID span the entire AI data preparation lifecycle, from data ingestion, through labeling, right up to before model training begins,” an April 1 blog post from the JAIC states. “Through access to these services, the DoD will be positioned to effectively prepare AI data to support the full range of AI activities across the DoD and do so in a responsible manner.”Task orders under the basic ordering agreement will fall under these areas:Project and program managementData scienceData engineeringData architectureData acquisition and curationData quality and analysisSynthetic data generation and data anonymizationSoftware development, modification and configurationEnterprise information management and governanceCloud integration and alignmentThe JAIC requires that all AI data created through the agreement adheres to published government standards so the data is interoperable with other cloud and AI development platforms across the department.“DoD AI data services acquired or developed under this PWS [performance work statement] and data processed by those services will frequently be required to integrate and interoperate with new or existing AI cloud platforms. ... In most cases, AI data produced under this BOA will be required to be made available on cloud platforms for reuse in other AI projects,” the PWS says.The BOA will remain active for five years.The JAIC blog post about the agreement emphasized that the organization took steps to ensure the RFP could attract nontraditional contractors, such as startups. The solicitation includes an accessibility guide outlining preliminary steps new contractors have to take before responding, while also highlighting revisions the JAIC made to the draft RFP to make it more inclusive for new vendors. For example, the blog says JAIC reformed experience requirements to be more inclusive of startups and other nontraditional contractors. “In developing the DRAID, we have taken effort to ensure that the best providers — regardless if this is their 1st or 101st time interacting with the Federal government — will be able to participate in the RFP process,” the request stated.The RFP asks for technologies that support ethical use of AI, including a solutions that would contractors to demonstrate how products integrate the DoD’s AI ethical principles.“The quality of the AI data determines the quality of the resulting AI system,” the blog post stated. “With the DRAID, the JAIC seeks to leverage the American commercial enterprise to create a strong foundation of AI-ready data for the DoD.”About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.

Entering that world felt like taking a step into the mysteries and secrets of the future. I was mind-blown by the promises of intelligent machines, capable of solving tasks forever reserved to us. I was deep-diving into the amazement of the mind through the familiar passages of technology.I had just finished my bachelor’s in aerospace engineering and wanted to leap towards AI. It was late 2017 when I met the great Geoffrey Hinton and Andrew Ng. Their lectures at Coursera were the open door that led me to my first job at an AI startup in 2018.AI promised a lot. So many movies of robots dominating the world and machines enhancing us to be demigods. But it didn’t deliver for me. Maybe I was too naive. I believed the mask behind which the real AI was hiding.After 3 years working in AI, I’ve fallen out of love. And I don’t think I’ll be coming back soon.

Meanwhile, people keep on being better when it comes to abstract and creative tasks. Over a recent couple of years, we've seen the rise of AI in art giving birth to many artificial intelligence artists..These unpredictable algorithms are making interesting (and in some cases frightful) works of art. They're producing dazzling visuals, significant poetry, extraordinary music, and surprisingly practical film scripts. However, work by these AI artists are bringing up issues about the idea of artificial intelligence in art and the job of human creativity in future societies..Creativity appears to be baffling because when we have innovative thoughts it is hard to clarify how we got them and we frequently talk about obscure ideas like &quot;motivation&quot; and &quot;instinct&quot; when we try to explain creativity. The fact that we are not aware of how a creative thought shows itself doesn't really suggest that a scientific explanation cannot exist. In actuality, we don't know about how we perform different activities, for example, pattern recognition, language understanding, etc., yet we have better art created by AI ready to duplicate such activities..In March 2019, an AI artist called AICAN and its maker Ahmed Elgammal took control over a New York exhibition. The exhibition at HG Commentary showed two series of canvas works depicting nerve racking, dream-like faceless pictures..The gallery was not just credited to a machine, yet rather ascribed to the joint effort of a human and machine. Ahmed Elgammal is the Founder and Head of the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers University. He considers AICAN to not exclusively be an autonomous AI artist, yet in addition a collaborator for artistic endeavors promoting artificial intelligence art..How did AICAN make these scary faceless portraits? The framework was given 100,000 photographs of Western art from more than five centuries, permitting it to become familiar with the style of art via machine learning. It at that point drew from this historical knowledge and the order to make something new to make a work of art with AI without human mediation..Recently, Hanson Robotics' female AI robot named Sophia became the world's first machine artist to sell her Non-Fungible Token (NFT) digital paintings named 'Sophia Instantiation' at an auction on premier marketplace Nifty Gateway. Her AI art pieces, which were bought utilizing Ethereum blockchain exchange, were made in collaboration with the UK-based Italian art specialist Andrea Bonaceto, who sold Beeple's Everyday at Christie's for $69 million. NFTs, in the resemblance of the digital money, comprise unique codes and can be stored in records or digi wallets. Artificial intelligence robot Sophia's auction of NFT AI art pieces denoted the first breakthrough between a human and a robot trading..Sophia is internationally known for being a worldwide celebrity doing a lot of TV appearances across the world including the Jimmy Fallon Show in the US and the Ivan Urgant show in Russia. Sophia is likewise an Innovation Champion for the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the first robot to get citizenship of a country. Recently, her computational works were introduced at the Neurips AI conference in the neural inventiveness workshop, and in the poster session at the AAAS yearly gathering. This will be the first series of AI artworks promoted by Sophia and her maker Dr. David Hanson..Dr. Hanson says, &quot;We made Sophia herself as a work of art as well as an AI development platform. Her intelligence is a group of algorithms and people working together like a hive. For this show, Sophia made the art totally utilizing neural networks and symbolic AI, responding to her impression of Andrea Bonaceto's works as well as to information from her &quot;life&quot; experiences, under direction from the Sophia team's designers and programmers. How she reacted to Andrea's art just excites me. I'm one pleased dad.&quot;.Sophia digitally made her own picture utilizing artificial intelligence art and did what the roboticist David Hanson portrays as 'an artistic revolution.' &quot;The experience of teaming up with Sophia and Hansen on the project at Nifty Gateway has been stunning.  Grown so much as an artist since we began this undertaking&quot;, Bonaceto tweeted. Then, humanoid Sophia plans to &quot;study the most noteworthy bidder's face&quot; who will buy her work and will add one final emphasis to her AI artwork..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

NEW DELHI, INDIA (Metro Rail News): Artificial Intelligence (AI) emphasizes the development of technologies or machines which is working like a human being. AI serviced working like a human recognition, problem solving, learning, planning, data prediction, chat-box and many more.
Few AI Solutions which we use in our daily routine is:
SIRITESLANETFLIXALEXAGOOGLE etc.
There are some Industries which using Artificial Intelligence again and again that is:
Business: In business industries use Artificial Intelligence services in the form of spam, filters, voice to text features, security surveillance etc.Education: By using services like Acuity, MS Team, Doodle, Google Duo and many more.Automobile: By using Navigation option, Driver Assist, Alexa etc.Healthcare: By using Digital Consultations, Robotics Surgery, MRI/CT scan machines etc.
As we all know India is a developing country which simply means we need this type of development more which grew the nations in terms of technology. Artificial Intelligence services reduces the human work and it saves time and cost both. Now a day’s people need updating for example in past time people communicate with another people through writing a letter, plays etc. but now we communicate through social media with different social networking applications like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and many more. As like that when time changes technology also upgrades. It helps us to develop our lifestyle.
