Such is the nature of an economy continuously influenced by new technology, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to transform the workplace once again.

But while some herald in the AI revolution with unbridled enthusiasm, excited by the opportunities and enriching work it could create, others are more pessimistic. However, both parties agree that AI has widespread application, from automating routine tasks to making complex decisions instantly. The debate is not so much about the power of the technology itself – all agree it’s revolutionary - but rather the role of the people that will work alongside it.
PROMOTED
Either way, experts all agree that the workplace is about to change forever. Here are two ways that AI will change careers for young professionals.
Optimists say AI will create more jobs

A study of 1,000 companies revealed that AI systems created new jobs in 80% of the organizations they were implemented in. In fact, a 2017 Gartner report predicts that  AI will create 500,000 more jobs than it will displace over the next three years, ushering a slew of employment opportunities for medium-to high-skilled workers.
As the global economy gears up for the widespread adoption of AI solutions, competition grows fierce for employees with the scarce skills required to implement, manage and work alongside this new technology. Developing these skills is therefore vital for any young professional wishing to remain relevant in an increasingly automated workplace.

And as this skilled workforce drives the AI industry forward at an accelerated pace, the demand for even more highly trained professionals will grow alongside it. This will result in a workplace comprising of adaptable people - according to Gartner - whose jobs are reimagined, enriched or facilitated by the technology they work alongside.
While it’s true that many low-skill jobs will fall by the wayside, replaced by the sophisticated automation AI enables, new careers and industries will emerge that haven’t been invented yet. Just as our parents struggled to predict the emergence of fields like social media or blogging, so, too, are we incapable of comprehending the jobs AI will create.
Pessimists say AI will replace workers completely
In contrast to this optimistic view, Gallup suggests that  Millennials are the most vulnerable generation to the threats AI poses, with 37% of Millennials being at risk of redundancy. But redundancy isn’t just a short-term problem for young professionals. A McKinsey report states that half of today’s work activities could be automated by 2055, or in more extreme scenarios, up to 20 years earlier.
The relative job security of older generations (only 32% are at risk of redundancy) is in part due to the senior positions they hold within their companies. After all, it’s easier to replace somebody in the infancy of their career rather than replace entire branches of management or executive leadership. Not to mention that it’s often these senior staff members who are in charge of decisions surrounding AI implementation in the first place, and they’re unlikely to replace themselves.
How then can young professionals prepare for this wave of unprecedented redundancy? Optimistically, only low-level, repetitive tasks will be automated in the near future. This means that Millennials with developed and adaptable problem-solving and decision-making skills can insulate themselves from the immediate threat of redundancy, and aim to work alongside AI in more senior management positions over the long term.
Pessimistically, widespread redundancy is unavoidable and will usher in a new philosophy regarding the role of human work in society. If machines are able to perform cognitive functions that were previously too difficult to automate successfully, no jobs are safe.
Theorists suggest a universal basic income as a solution, whereby governments provide their citizens with a living wage to combat their inability to secure employment. And while hotly contested, pilots are already under way in Finland.
Key takeaway
Artificial Intelligence is still in its infancy, and is yet to reach the point of mass adoption. As such it’s difficult to predict the extent to which it will redefine the workplace or the jobs of the young professionals within it.
The most likely scenario, however, is a combination of both the optimistic and pessimistic views. An economy that prizes highly-skilled, well-trained, and adaptable employees who work alongside very smart machines. And a large segment of low-skilled workers whose skills are made redundant at an alarming rate.
While we can appeal to the better nature of organizations to nurture and prepare their staff for an inevitable technological transition, Millennials should heed the warning signs, take initiative, and equip themselves with the skills needed to survive a potentially tumultuous economic evolution.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Daniel MarlinI'm a managing partner of SOMS Consulting, a firm that designs business processes and software to make companies a pleasure to manage.

Congratulations are in order. You, yes you, dear reader, have been part of something incredible. Thanks to your hard work, millions of books containing pretty much the sum-total of human knowledge have been successfully digitised, saving their texts for future generations. All because of you.No, seriously.You know how occasionally you’ll be prompted with a “Captcha” when filling out a form on the internet, to prove that you’re fully human? Behind the scenes of one of the most popular Captcha systems - Google’s Recaptcha - your humanoid clicks have been helping figure out things that traditional computing just can’t manage, and in the process you’ve been helping to train Google’s AI to be even smarter.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksSherumThis New AC Cooler Cools the Room In SecondsSherumLearn MoreUndoAnd you thought you were merely logging into some website or other.LATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar

OriginsRecaptcha (or “reCATCHA” if you prefer) started out as a collaboration by a number of computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, first released in 2007 - and it was quickly snaffled up by Google in 2009. The premise was as described above: by marrying up users who need to prove they are human to data that needs transcribing, both sides get something out of it.So instead of digitising books by having one person carry out the very boring task of typing or checking a whole book manually, instead millions of people can unknowingly collaborate to achieve the same goal. Remember how it always used to be two words you had to enter? Conceivably, only one was the “real” test, and the other was a new word that was yet to be transcribed - but as the user you wouldn’t know which was which, so you’d have to attempt to do both accurately.The Google Books app on Android. Recaptcha can even check its own work. By showing the same words to multiple users, it can automatically verify that a word has been transcribed correctly by comparing multiple attempts from multiple users across the world.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Amazingly, thanks to Recaptcha boxes appearing on thousands of major websites and receiving tens of millions of completions a day, by 2011 Recaptcha had finished digitising the entire Google Books archive - as well as 13 million articles from the New York Times back-catalogue dating back to 1851.So what did Google do next, with no books left to digitise? In what was perhaps a happy coincidence, this coincided with the growth of artificial intelligence and machine learning.Training montageIn 2012, Google started including not just words, but snippets of photos from Google Street View - making users transcribe door numbers and other signage. And in 2014, the system became all about training AI.Essentially, the way machine learning works is that you hand the machine a bunch of data that is already sorted - say, a bunch of images of cats that you have tagged as cats, and then it uses this information to build a neural network that enables it to pick the cats out of other images. The more pictures of cats that you feed it, the more accurate the AI becomes at picking out cats from other images.A cat. Just in case you weren't sure. Google has countless reasons to want to train AI to recognise objects in images: better Google Image Search results, more accurate Google Maps results, and enabling you to search your Google Photos library for all of the photos you have taken of a specific object or place. Oh, and the small matter of making sure that your driverless car doesn’t hit anything. You know when Recaptcha asks you to identify street signs? Essentially you’re playing a very small role in piloting a driverless car somewhere, at some point in the future.So it is hugely convenient then that Google has as its disposal hundreds of millions of internet users to work for it: by using Recaptcha to tackle these problems, Google can use our need to prove we’re human to force us to use our very human intuitions to build its database.Google's Waymo driverless car system. This is why currently, instead of simply throwing up some text, Recaptcha is giving users more image-related tasks: “Click all of the images of cats”, “Click all of the boxes on the grid overlaying an image that contain a cat”, and so on. For thousands of different objects.This is a particularly useful asset for Google, as it competes with other internet giants to grow its machine learning datasets and algorithms: The more data it can analyse, the better results will be - giving its current and future products a competitive advantage.Using AI to beat AIAmusingly, there is only one problem with using captchas to train machine learning algorithms. What’s to stop, for example, people who want to get around captchas from using machine learning against captchas?Last year developer Francis Kim built a proof of concept means to beat Recaptcha by using Google’s machine learning abilities against it. In just 40 lines of Javascript, he was able to build a system that uses the rival Clarifai image recognition API to look at the images Google’s Recaptcha throws up, and identify the objects the captcha requires. So if Recaptcha demands the user select images of storefronts to prove their humanity, Clarifai is able to pick them out instead.Conceivably too, this sort of thing would also be possible using Google’s own technology. Because Google wants to sell its clever tech to other companies, it opens TensorFlow up to developers through an API itself. This means that you could conceivably use TensorFlow to trick the Captcha that trains TensorFlow. This wouldn’t work 100% of the time - but once an AI is sufficiently well trained, it should be able to do the trick in a large number of cases.What’s clear from Recaptcha is not just that it is an ingenious idea, but also that thanks to our hard work, it is getting increasingly difficult to separate us humans from the machines.TechRadar's AI Week is brought to you in association with Honor.

Not only have humans spent decades of research perfecting the mathematical calculations to make these wonderfully complex learning algorithms work but during this time we have looked further than our own species as inspiration to make the next generation of intelligent presence on our planet. Mother Nature, and all that it encompasses, has it’s roots firmly planted in the workings of Artificial Intelligence — and it’s here to stay.Aren’t Sir David Attenborough’s wildlife documentaries just incredible? They go into incredible, high definition detail about the behaviours and properties of the Earth’s many inhabitants, and they allow us to understand how they fit into the natural ecosystem and work together in order to allow our planet to flourish — to make it Earth. Now I’m no Sir David Attenborough, but I’m still going to take you on a wildlife documentary of my own. The star creatures in question are none other than those Artificial Intelligence algorithms that are inspired directly by Mother Nature’s own. But first, I need to introduce you to two algorithm concepts. Search/Pathfinding and Predictive Modelling.SEARCH (PATHFINDING) ALGORITHMSSearch algorithms are essentially programs that are designed to find the best/shortest route to an objective. For example, the travelling salesman problem is a typical search optimisation issue where you are given a list of cities and distances between those cities. You must search for the shortest route for the travelling salesman, whilst visiting each city once to minimise travel time and expenditure (ensuring that you return to the origin city). Real world applications of this problem are delivery trucks. Imagine 100 people in London made an online order and all the boxes are loaded into one van. The courier (let’s say…DPD), must now calculate the most efficient route (balancing distance/time taken) to deliver those packages from the depot (eventually returning to the depot) to ensure that the company is wasting as little time and money as it can during the delivery process.PREDICTIVE MODELLING ALGORITHMSToday, predictive modelling is where all the hype is. Data Scientists everywhere are shouting ‘Neural Networks!’ from the rooftops of their cosy office buildings and companies like Google are running around trying to solve the world’s problems with different variations of these complex little ‘artificial brains’. Essentially predictive modelling uses statistics in order to predict outcomes. You often hear Data Scientists attempting to solve two kinds of predictive modelling problems, Regression and Classification. Regression is the dark art of finding the correlation between two sets of variables, and classification is the process of determining the probability of a dataset belonging to a different set.5 BIOLOGICALLY-INSPIRED LEARNING ALGORITHMS1. ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKSFeed Forward Neural Network — the most basic type of Neural Network.Algorithm Type: Predictive ModellingBiological Inspiration: Cognitive Brain Function (Neurons)Use-cases: Sentiment Analysis, Image Recognition/Detection, Language Correction, RoboticsLet’s start with the most commonly known Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm of them all. Neural Networks are part of a sub-category of AI called Machine Learning. They have been designed and built to mimic brain function on a Neuron level, interacting with Axons and Dendrites in order to pass information through a system to generate a predictive output through a series of ‘layers’. Each layer provides an extra layer of data representation and allows you to model most complex problems.Neural Networks are probably the most widely used Machine Learning algorithms and is the hottest trend in Data Science and Machine Learning to date. The concept initially came to fruition in 1958, known as the Perceptron, later refined by Geoffrey Hinton and popularised by companies such as Google and Facebook. Neural Networks can be used to solve a wide range of problem types including Natural Language Processing, and Visual recognition. This supervised learning algorithm can support both Regression and Classification problems and examples of its use can be found in regular consumer products including smartphones, and connected home devices.2. GENETIC ALGORITHMSReproduction of individuals in a Genetic AlgorithmAlgorithm Type: Search/PathfindingBiological Inspiration: Survival of the Fittest/Evolution (Cell Reproduction)Use-cases: Data Mining/Analytics, Robotics, Manufacturing/Design, Process OptimisationGenetic algorithms take a ‘survival of the fittest’, evolutionary-like approach among a series of individuals over consecutive generations in order to solve a search problem. Each generation contains a population of strings that mimic chromosomes that we see in our DNA. Each individual within a population represents a point within the search space, therefore each is a possible candidate solution. In order to improve the population of solutions, we put the individuals through a process of evolution.Each individual in the population will compete for resources and mates.The individuals most successful in each competition will (often) produce more individuals than those that perform poorly.Genes from more ‘ideal’ candidates propagate through the population so those good parents will often produce offspring with even greater potential.3. SWARM/COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCEExample of Ant Colony Optimisation — a type of collective intelligence algorithm.Algorithm Type: Search/PathfindingBiological Inspiration: Ant Colonies/Schools of Fish/Flocks of BirdsUse-cases: Robotics, Video Game AI, Manufacturing, Route PlanningAnt Colony Optimisation and Particle Swarm Optimisation are the two most commonly known algorithms that conform to the bounds of the ‘collective intelligence’ concept. On a basic level, the algorithms in question all utilise multiple working agents. Each working agent exhibits very basic behaviour that collectively (as a pack) works together to bring out more complex, emergent behaviour in order to solve the problem.Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) is very different to Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO). Both aim to achieve emergent behaviour but go about it in two different ways. Like real ant colonies, ACO utilises a pheromone scent to guide individual agents onto the shortest path. Initially, a random pheromone is initialised across the problem space. Individual agents will begin to traverse the search space, dropping pheromone scent as they go. Throughout each time-step, the pheromone will decay at a defined rate. Single Agents make their decisions based on the strength of pheromone scent in front of them in order to traverse the search space. The stronger the scent in a particular direction, the more likely it is to travel that way. The best-known solution will end up being the one with the strongest pheromone scent.PSO looks more to the overall direction of the pack. A number of single agents are initialised and they begin in random directions. At each time step, each agent needs to make a decision on whether or not to change direction. The decision will be based on the direction of the best-known solution (known as pbest/global best), the direction of the best nearest neighbour (local best), and the current direction of travel. The new direction of travel is typically a good ‘compromise’ of all these values.4. REINFORCEMENT LEARNINGAgent Behaviour within a Reinforcement Learning Environment.Algorithm Type: Predictive ModellingBiological Inspiration: Classical ConditioningUse-cases: Video Games, Controlling Autonomous Vehicles, Manufacturing Line Software, Financial SystemsWith groundings in psychology and a process reminiscent of classical conditioning, Reinforcement Learning (RL) supports the idea of providing a positive numerical response to a favourable action taken by an agent. Learning the concept of Reinforcement Learning is often easier when compared to the popular classical conditioning example; Pavlov’s Dogs. It was a piece of research conducted in the 1890’s where Russian Psychologist Ivan Pavlov was looking at the salivation in dogs in response to being fed. An excellent article explaining the matter can be found here. Essentially, if an RL agent takes a good action, one that makes a step towards completing the task required, it is given a numerical reward. The agent will learn using a policy — for example; to maximise the reward given at each individual step. The application of raw inputs into the algorithm allows the agent to develop its own sense of the problem, and how to solve it in the most efficient manner.It is common to see RL algorithms paired with other Machine Learning technologies — such as Neural Networks. This is often referred to as Deep Reinforcement Learning. Neural Networks are often used to estimate the reward given to an RL agent when it makes a particular decision. Deep Mind, now a Google company, has made great progress within this space, using a Deep Q Learning approach to tacking more generic problems (such as the ability for one algorithm to play an entire library of Atari games, unassisted and beat the World Champion itself at the game ‘Go’. They are now adapting this approach to be able to tackle more complex games such as Starcraft II.For reference, Q Learning is a model-free version of the Reinforcement Learning algorithm. It can be used to find the optimal action-selection policy for any finite Markov Decision Process. Upon program initialisation, the Q values for each action-value pair are defined by the developer and updated by the RL algorithm at each time step. The following image is an example of the equation to update the Q action-value pair.Q Learning Value Update Equation5. ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMSComponents of an Artificial Immune SystemAlgorithm Type: Predictive ModellingBiological Inspiration: Immune SystemsUse-cases: Security Software, Autonomous Navigation Systems, Scheduling Systems, Fault Detection SoftwareAn immune system is a system that protects the body against substances and pathogenic organisms by producing an immune response. Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are adaptive systems, inspired by theoretical immunology and observed immune functions that are applied to problem-solving. AIS is a subfield of biologically-inspired computing and natural computation with links to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. There are multiple algorithms commonly associated with AIS:Clonal SelectionDendritic CellNegative SelectionArtificial Immune RecognitionLike the biological immune system, AIS is able to categorise all ‘cell’s within a system as ‘self’ or ‘non-self’ cells. A distributed task force of intelligence is used to take action upon all cells. The two most important types of cells involved in immunisation are B-cells and T-cells (white blood cells to you and me). T-cells come in three types; one type to activate B-cells, one type to bind to and destroy foreign invaders and a final type to suppress auto-immune issues. B-cells are responsible for producing antibodies which are specific proteins that bind to an antigen — a toxic/foreign substance. Artificial Immune Systems are often used to defend against cyber attacks by monitoring intrusion detection and are often integrated into enterprise-grade software. Unlike the other algorithms mentioned in this article, free online learning material on this subject is very limited and is likely the least-developed.LET’S WRAP UP…So I’ve given 5 examples of how Mother Nature inspires our research and enhances our technology.

When I introduce myself as a data scientist, I often get questions like “What’s the difference between that and machine learning?” or “Does that mean you work on artificial intelligence?” I have responded enough times that my answer easily qualifies for my “rule of three”:






The fields do have a great deal of overlap, and there is enough hype around each of them that the choice can feel like a matter of marketing. But they are not interchangeable: most professionals in these fields have an intuitive understanding of how particular work could be classified as data science, machine learning (ML), or artificial intelligence (AI), even if it is difficult to put into words.So in this post, I’m proposing an oversimplified definition of the difference between the three fields:Data science produces insightsMachine learning produces predictionsArtificial intelligence produces actionsTo be clear, this isn’t a sufficient qualification: not everything that fits each definition is a part of that field. (A fortune teller makes predictions, but we would never say that they are doing machine learning.) These also aren’t a good way of determining someone’s role or job title (“Am I a data scientist?”), which is a matter of focus and experience. (This is true of any job description: I write as part of my job but I’m not a professional writer).But I think this definition is a useful way to distinguish the three types of work, and to avoid sounding silly when you are talking about it. It is worth noting that I’m taking a descriptivist rather than a prescriptivist approach: I’m not interested in what these terms “should mean,” but rather how people in the field typically use them.Data Science Produces InsightsData science is distinguished from the other two fields because its goal is an especially human one: to gain insight and understanding. Again, not everything that produces insights qualifies as data science (the classic definition of data science is that it involves a combination of statistics, software engineering, and domain expertise). But we can use this definition to distinguish it from ML and AI.The main distinction is that in data science there is always a human in the loop: someone is understanding the insight, seeing the figure, or benefitting from the conclusion. It would make no sense to say “Our chess-playing algorithm uses data science to choose its next move,” or “Google Maps uses data science to recommend driving directions.”This definition of data science thus emphasizes:Statistical inferenceData visualizationExperiment designDomain knowledgeCommunicationData scientists might use simple tools: they could report percentages and make line graphs based on SQL queries. They could also use very complex methods: they might work with distributed data stores to analyze trillions of records, develop cutting-edge statistical techniques, and build interactive visualizations. Whatever they use, the goal is to gain a better understanding of their data.Machine Learning Produces PredictionsI think of machine learning as the field of prediction: of “Given instance X with particular features, predict Y about it.” These predictions could be about the future, but they also could be about qualities that aren’t immediately obvious to a computer. Almost all Kaggle competitions qualify as machine learning problems: they offer some training data, and then see if competitors can make accurate predictions about new examples.There’s plenty of overlap between data science and machine learning. For example, logistic regression can be used to draw insights about relationships (“the richer a user is the more likely they’ll buy our product, so we should change our marketing strategy”) and to make predictions (“this user has a 53% chance of buying our product, so we should suggest it to them”).Models like random forests have slightly less interpretability and are more likely to fit the “machine learning” description, and methods such as deep learning are notoriously challenging to explain. This could get in the way if your goal is to extract insights rather than make predictions. We could thus imagine a “spectrum” of data science and machine learning, with more interpretable models leaning toward the data science side and more “black box” models on the machine learning side.Most practitioners will switch back and forth between the two tasks very comfortably. I use both machine learning and data science in my work: I might fit a model on Stack Overflow traffic data to determine which users are likely to be looking for a job (machine learning), but then construct summaries and visualizations that examine why the model works (data science). This is an important way to discover flaws in your model, and to combat algorithmic bias. This is one reason that data scientists are often responsible for developing machine learning components of a product.Artificial Intelligence Produces ActionsArtificial intelligence is by far the oldest and the most widely recognized of these three designations, and as a result it’s the most challenging to define. The term is surrounded by a great deal of hype, thanks to researchers, journalists, and startups who are looking for money or attention. This has led to a backlash that strikes me as unfortunate, since it means some work that probably should be called AI isn’t described as such.Some researchers have even complained about the AI effect: “AI is whatever we can’t do yet.” (It doesn’t help that AI is often conflated with general AI, capable of performing tasks across many different domains, or even superintelligent AI, which surpasses human intelligence. This sets unrealistic expectations for any system described as “AI.”)So what work can we fairly describe as AI?One common thread in definitions of AI is that an autonomous agent executes or recommends actions (e.g., Poole, Mackworth and Goebel 1998, Russell and Norvig 2003). Some systems I think should be described as AI include:Game-playing algorithms (Deep Blue, AlphaGo)Robotics and control theory (motion planning, walking a bipedal robot)Optimization (Google Maps choosing a route)Natural language processing (Bots - by “bots” here I’m referring to systems meant to interpret natural language and then respond in kind. This can be distinguished from text mining, where the goal is to extract insights (data science) or text classification, where the goal is to categorize documents (machine learning)Reinforcement learningAgain, we can see a lot of overlap with the other fields. But there are also distinctions. If I analyze some sales data and discover that clients from particular industries renew more than others (extracting an insight), the output is some numbers and graphs, not a particular action. (Executives might use those conclusions to change our sales strategy, but that action isn’t autonomous.) This means I would describe my work as data science: it would be cringeworthy to say that I’m “using AI to improve our sales.”The difference between AI and ML is a bit more subtle, and historically ML has often been considered a subfield of AI (computer vision in particular was a classic AI problem). But I think the ML field has largely “broken off” from AI, partly because of the backlash described above: most people who choose to work on problems of prediction don’t like to describe themselves as AI researchers. (It helped that many important ML breakthroughs came from statistics, which had less of a presence in the rest of the AI field). This means that if you can describe a problem as “predict X from Y,” I’d recommend avoiding the term AI completely.Case Study: How Would the Three Be Used Together?Suppose we were building a self-driving car, and were working on the specific problem of stopping at stop signs. We would need skills drawn from all three of these fields.MI: The car has to recognize a stop sign using its cameras. We construct a dataset of millions of photos of streetside objects, and train an algorithm to predict which have stop signs in them.AI: Once our car can recognize stop signs, it needs to decide when to take the action of applying the brakes. It’s dangerous to apply them too early or too late, and we need it to handle varying road conditions (for example, to recognize on a slippery road that it is not slowing down quickly enough), which is a problem of control theory.Data science: In street tests we find that the car’s performance isn’t good enough, with some false negatives in which it drives right by a stop sign. After analyzing the street test data, we gain the insight that the rate of false negatives depends on the time of day: it is more likely to miss a stop sign before sunrise or after sunset. We realize that most of our training data included only objects in full daylight, so we construct a better dataset including nighttime images and go back to the machine learning step.David Robinson is a data scientist at Stack Overflow, and works in R and Python.

These and many other fascinating insights are from Stanford University’s inaugural AI Index (PDF, no opt-in, 101 pp.). Stanford has undertaken a One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) looking at the effects of AI on people’s lives, basing the inaugural report and index on the initial findings. The study finds “that we’re essentially “flying blind” in our conversations and decision-making related to Artificial Intelligence.” The AI Index is focused on tracking activity and progress on AI initiatives, and to facilitate informed conversations grounded with reliable, verifiable data. All data used to produce the AI Index and report is available at aiindex.org. Please see the AI Index for additional details regarding the methodology used to create each of the following graphs.

The following ten charts from the AI Index report provides insights into AI’s rapid growth:

The number of Computer Science academic papers and studies has soared by more than 9X since 1996. Academic studies and research are often the precursors to new intellectual property and patents. The entire Scopus database contains over 200,000 (200,237) papers in the field of Computer Science that have been indexed with the key term “Artificial Intelligence.” The Scopus database contains almost 5 million (4,868,421) papers in the subject area “Computer Science.”

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are eating up workloads at IT help desks, in cybersecurity, and other IT tasks, stirring significant concern over the long-term impact AI will have on jobs — even in the IT industry.
And the concern isn’t unfounded. According to a recent report from Tata Consulting Services, in 12 out of the 13 major industry verticals, IT is the most frequent user of AI, with more than 46 percent of IT organizations at large corporations incorporating AI into their work portfolios.
But that doesn’t mean IT jobs are about to go the way of telephone switchboard operators. Instead, the day-to-day activities of enterprise technology professionals will evolve alongside AI and new skills may be required.

Two years ago, when Scot Whigham, the company’s director of global IT service support, came on board, IHG had 35 people working in first- and second-tier tech support, helping hotel employees and corporate staff deal with problems with reservations and other back-end systems, as well as general hardware and software issues.
 
 
 













 
 

The staff had difficulty keeping up with the round-the-clock needs of the company and handling emergencies, says Whigham.So, in early 2016, the company launched a major transformation to provide better self-service options, and to be able to scale up when needed.
“AI was part of our transformation strategy,” he says.
IHG deployed IPSoft Amelia, an AI-enabled IT service desk agent that can hold intelligent conversations, answer questions, perform common support tasks and, more importantly, learn from experience.
 
 
 













 
 

The company did not lay off staff. Instead, it increased headcount from 35 to 115. However, without the platform, IHG would have had to hire an additional 120 agents to fill demand, says Whigham.

“Our metrics are much improved over what we had before we started,” he says. “And our usage of the self-help and the AI platform has increased tremendously.”
IHG’s experience provides a glimpse of AI’s future impact on IT work, one in which productivity is enhanced and new career opportunities open up, but with some caveats on the types of tasks and roles that may no longer be necessary for humans to complete in the future.
 
 
 













 
 

Training up
Unlike most chatbots, Amelia doesn’t just work from a canned list of questions and answers, he says. “I can have a conversation with her, and she understands the intent of the conversation, and also learns from that conversation,” he says. “If she can’t answer your question or resolve your request, she will transfer it to a live human agent — and stay in that conversation, observe the exchange that takes place, and learn from it.”
Amelia can follow the thread of a conversation and pick up on a question after a long gap.
“If you had a life-change event and needed to update your insurance, and you had to get off the phone to do something else, she can pick that conversation back up the next time you come back,” he says. “Even a year later.”
 
 
 













 
 

With Amelia handling this “zero tier” support, humans can focus on more difficult issues and unusual situations. Some have also begun transitioning to roles where, instead of responding to calls, they are monitoring Amelia and training her.
“We’re leveraging their expertise in the soft skills and hard skills in technical support,” says Whigham, who hasn’t seen pushback from staff concerned about training robots that will eventually take their jobs.
“They embraced it,” he says. “It became the go-to place — everyone wanted to join. My skills are going to increase; this is the direction things are going.”
 
 
 













 
 

To get the employees up to speed on the new technology, IHG sent them to training from IPSoft, as well as that provided by other vendors, including IBM.
But the company has decided against developing its own AI technology from scratch, he says.
“If you are not in the AI or cognitive industry, you shouldn’t be trying to build a cognitive strategy,” he says. “I’ve seen other organizations try to get involved with it, and they seem to be overwhelmed. You should have a business strategy that this technology is just a part of.”
 
 
 













 
 

AI-related opportunities will expand
For IT pros, AI technologies present significant opportunities. By becoming expert at deploying AI technology for maximum business value, and integrating it with other tools and services, new career paths will open up. But even at a rudimentary level, AI will free up IT pros for higher-value tasks by taking over repetitive work.

“I wouldn’t use it to automate a person’s job per se, but make something better,” says Mike Fitzmaurice, VP of workflow technology at Nintex Group.
AI is particularly good at massively repeatable tasks, he says.
 
 
 













 
 

“At huge amounts of scale, people get tired and are terrible at pattern recognition,” he says. “Any kind of repetitive task, even if it looks creative, if it’s pattern based, it could be something AI could do.”
Nintex, for example, is adding third-party AI components, such as Microsoft’s sentiment analysis service, to its workflow automation offering. This allows companies that are not necessarily expert in AI to add these capabilities to a wide variety of routine tasks.
“In earlier years it was a specialty thing that only people with a lot of knowledge and scale and resources could do,” he says. “That’s not true anymore. AI is for everybody; you just need to know where to look. I think 2018 is the year when AI becomes something we can all use if we have the foresight and motivation and vision to use it.”
 
 
 













 
 

According to Gartner, by 2019, more than 10 percent of IT hires in customer service will mostly write scripts for bot interactions, and, by 2020, 20 percent of companies will dedicate workers to monitor and guide neural networks.
Some companies will also benefit from a more in-depth use of artificial intelligence, which could require training beyond that offered by bootcamps or vendors.
PayPal, for example, uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to add efficiencies to everything from risk management to customer life cycle management, says Nolwenn Godard, PayPal’s director of pricing product.
 
 
 













 
 

But there is a lack of AI talent, compared to demand, she says.
Another challenge is diversity and cognitive bias.

“There is a lack of women representation in AI,” she says. “We need ethical controls and tools for bias mitigation within the datasets and algorithms.”
 
 
 













 
 

She expects to see exceptional growth in the use of AI in the next few decades, allowing for more natural language use, larger data sets processed in real time, and more connections between systems.
AI developers will also focus on enhancing the human experience, she says. “For example, having AI that can talk, see, respond or proactively provide recommendations, while augmenting human abilities.”
The coming AI economy
For most firms, using products from Google, Microsoft, IBM and other vendors makes more sense than, say, building their own translation engines, chatbots, or image recognition systems.
 
 
 













 
 

“But companies also need to be looking at what their unique differentiation is, and see if AI can be applied,” says Bruce Molloy, CEO of Springboard.ai. “If they have to do with, for instance, product manufacturing, there could be a lot of insights that could give these companies an advantage into creating these products.”

There are possibilities for AI-powered companies, business models, and products and services that didn’t exist before, he says.
There’s also a defensive aspect, as well, he added, since AI powerhouses like Amazon have made it clear that they’re targeting many sectors that are ripe for transformation, such as, for example, retail sales and food delivery.
“This is their strategy,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

Google and Tesla are other examples of companies using new technologies to challenge incumbents in a wide variety of industries, says Gregg Gordon, VP of the data science program group at Kronos.
“For companies that are slow to change, they will first feel the slow drain of profitability that comes from running less efficient operations than others,” he says. “They will then continue to ignore trends but react to the financial pressure caused by those inefficiencies in the form of cost-cutting. This will only accelerate them toward their demise. These companies have confused underinvesting with operational efficiency.”
But the threat isn’t just from the brand-name AI leaders.
Gartner predicts that, by 2019, startups will overtake Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft in driving the AI economy with disruptive business solutions, and AI platform services will cannibalize revenues for 30 percent of market-leading companies.
For companies that take advantage of the new technologies, AI can free IT pros from routine tasks. Those people can now shift to higher-value activities, which may also require additional training.
According to the TCS report, 80 percent of executives surveyed are currently investing in AI, and almost 100 percent plan to do so by 2020.
Future-proofing your IT career for the AI era
Experts recommend that IT pros looking to future-proof their careers should broaden their skill sets to include business or communication skills, growth areas like cybersecurity, or develop deeper industry expertise.
In cybersecurity, for example, there are about two million jobs that are going to go unfilled in the next few years, says Ian Doyle, executive security advisor for the U.S. federal government at IBM.
But AI is going to be a big component of cybersecurity, since the technology can help make security professionals more effective.
IBM recently conducted a survey to find out what the federal government is thinking about AI, and about half want to be leaders, and half want to be followers — but there was almost unanimous interest in using AI for cybersecurity.
Application development is also going to remain a strong area, says Matthew Mead, CTO at Chicago-based SPR, a consulting company focused on digital transformation.
“We’re going to try to incorporate more AI in what we do, but for the typical developer, the idea that the job will be majorly changed in the near future, that is absolutely false,” he says. “I think things are actually a little bit hyped in some ways. I’m not saying that there aren’t going to be a lot of transformations, but there’s a lot of hype and embellishment in this realm.”
Maybe in 100 years, AI systems will be creating new applications from scratch and taking over all other IT functions, he says.
“I’m not saying it’s all rosy, but in the next 20 years, in terms of job declining in IT, I don’t see that,” he says.
According to McKinsey, AI could help create 20 to 50 million new jobs globally in both in-house IT workers and external or outsourced tech consulting jobs.
Cloud, automation bigger threats than AI
Some traditional IT jobs might go away, experts say, but the culprit won’t be artificial intelligence — at least, not yet.
Instead, regular old automation, outsourcing and cloud technologies will have a bigger short-term impact, says Anand Rao, partner and global AI leader at New York-based PricewaterhouseCoopers.
“A number of factors are increasing productivity,” he says.
Take for example, CRM systems. Companies used to do CRM in-house, or with on-premises software. As they switched to Salesforce, all the in-house CRM-related support and administration jobs disappeared.
Many companies are still running legacy systems, systems that still work and that the companies have invested heavily in.
“But at a certain point, it collapses under its own weight,” Rao says. “Either the business goes broke, or they decide to start over with a fresh infrastructure. And the cost of packing up and starting something brand new has been decreasing substantially. It’s just a matter of time before they’re forced to upgrade.”
Is it all just hype?
With all the news reports recent advances in speech recognition, language translation, image processing, pattern recognition, and, of course, self-driving cars, many people are predicting an AI-powered cataclysm where humans become obsolete.
“People claim the world will be transformed overnight,” says Rao. “I don’t think that’s happening. At the same time, it’s not just all made-up vapor ware and will all just die down. It’s somewhere in between.”
Manual, repetitive, and routine tasks will be automated, he says. “And when all of those things are automated, you want to be in place where you can add value.”

VADER showcases its data analytic capabilities: a map view of distribution feeder; machine learning based power flow estimating voltages; radial configuration detector identifying switch states; and electric vehicle load flexibility visualization.







Today, utilities have limited ability to see the impact of higher amounts of solar photovoltaics (PV) in a given area of the distribution system, which can be problematic for system planning and operation. New research efforts from the Energy Department’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford University are using artificial intelligence (AI) applications to help utilities better integrate their solar resources and make more informed planning decisions for enhancing grid reliability, resiliency, and security.In September 2017, SLAC researchers announced that they won a research award from the Energy Department’s Grid Modernization Initiative to explore the creation of an autonomous grid that can absorb power fluctuations(link is external) from renewable sources and respond to major grid disruptions with solar generation. Selected as a part of the Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium effort to enhance the resilience of distribution systems, the team aims to develop a solution that employs data analytics and AI technologies, enabling automatic identification and strengthening of weak spots on the grid and faster recovery times after grid disturbances. The resulting solution has the potential to automatically optimize solar resources on the grid, reconfiguring itself for either normal or emergency operations.This effort stems from the same team’s successful, first-of-its-kind software platform that was funded by the Solar Energy Technologies Office and was designed to address PV distribution challenges with a unified, data-driven solution. The platform uses data from PV systems and smart meters that continuously updates and accurately models the electricity load and the behavior of  distributed energy resources (DERs) like a solar system on a home or business. The VADER platform, or Visualization and Analytics of Distribution Systems with Deep Penetration of Distributed Energy Resources, integrates a myriad of data streams for real-time monitoring, analytics, and visualization and control of DERs in a consistent and user-friendly manner. Through machine learning, the VADER platform can model potential changes in connectivity and the behavior of DERs on the grid, enabling the real-time optimization and automation of distribution planning and operation decisions for utilities.  The VADER platform is scalable and open-source, meaning that users can freely access the original source code to further refine it and contribute their improvements to the platform’s code library. In March 2017, the SLAC research team held a hands-on workshop for managers and engineers from California utilities, researchers from several national labs, and representatives from the growing number of companies operating in the data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence fields. The platform already serves as the foundation for the SLAC team’s autonomous grid effort and startups are beginning to consider how they can leverage the newly available tools.Learn more about the Grid Modernization Initiative and the grid integration research from the Solar Energy Technologies Office.

Insights How AI is changing game development

By Raka Mahesa -   January 16, 2018 - 12:00 am 3179 0 










4 min readArtificial intelligence is transforming many areas, but one of the most interesting and underrated is gaming. It’s not that surprising; after all, an AI last year beat the world’s top Go player, and it’s not a giant leap to see how artificial intelligence might be used in modern video gaming. However, things aren’t straightforward. This is because applying artificial intelligence to a video game is different from artificial intelligence applied to the development process of video game. Before we talk further about this, let’s first discuss artificial intelligence by itself.
What exactly is artificial intelligence? Artificial intelligence is, to put it simply, the ability of machines to learn and apply knowledge. Learning and applying knowledge is such a broad scope though. Being able to do simple math calculations is learning and applying arithmetic knowledge, but no one would call that capability artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence is a shifting field
Surprisingly, there is no definite scope for the kind of knowledge that artificial intelligence must have. It’s a moving goalpost, the scope is updated whenever a new breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence has occurred. There is a saying in the artificial intelligence community that “AI is whatever hasn’t been done yet,” meaning that whenever an AI problem is solved and figured out, it no longer counts as artificial intelligence and will be branched out to its own field. This has happened to searching algorithm, path finding, optical character recognition, and so on.
 So, in short, we have a divide here. When experts are saying artificial intelligence, they usually mean the most cutting-edge part of artificial intelligence like neural networks or advanced voice recognition. Meanwhile, problems that are seen as solved, like path finding, are usually no longer being researched and not counted as artificial intelligence anymore.
And it’s also why all the advancement that has happened to artificial intelligence doesn’t really impact video games. Yes, video games have many, many applications of artificial intelligence, but most of those applications are limited to problems that have already been solved like path finding and decision making. Meanwhile, the latest artificial intelligence technique like machine learning doesn’t really have a place in video games.
Things are a bit different though for video game development. Even though video games themselves don’t use the latest and greatest artificial intelligence, their creation is still an engineering process that can be further aided with the advancement in AI. Do note that most of the artificial intelligence used for game development is still being explored and still in an experimental phase.

 There has been research done recently about using an intelligent agent to learn about level layout of a game and then using that trained agent to layout another level. Having an artificial intelligence handle the level creation aspect of a game development will definitely increase the development speed because level designers now can just tweak existing layout instead of starting from scratch.
Automation in game development
 Another aspect of video game development that already uses a lot of automation and can be aided further by artificial intelligence is quality assurance (QA). By having an artificial intelligence that can learn how to play the game will great assist developers when they need to check for bugs and other issues. But of course, artificial intelligence can only detect stuff that can be measured like bugs and crashes, and they won’t be able to see if the game is fun or not.
Using AI to improve game design
 Having an AI that can automatically play a video game isn’t only good for testing purposes, but it could also help improve game design. There was a mobile game studio that uses artificial intelligence to mimic human behavior so they can determine the difficulty of the game. By checking how the artificial intelligence performs on a certain level, designers can project how real players would perform on that level and adjust the difficulty properly.
 And that’s how AI is changing game development. Despite all the advancement, there is still plenty of work to be done for artificial intelligence to truly assist game developers in their work. That said, game development is one of those jobs that don’t need to worry about being replaced by robots, because more than anything, game development is a creative endeavor that only humans can do. Well, so far at least.

From software development to construction to logistics and finance, every company has projects that need planning, managing and monitoring. But the tools we use to do that are often complex, designed for specialists and don’t do as much as they could to warn about potential problems. Could AI-powered decision support systems and automation make more of your projects successful by reducing costs and mistakes, analyzing risks, making things more efficient or keeping things on time and on budget?
Here is an early look at how artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics could affect project outcomes in the years to come.
Thinking about risk
Managing a project well takes more than just making a great plan in advance and sticking to it. Interdependencies within your project and external changes make outcomes unpredictable. Estimates and many forecasts are at best intuition; at worst, guesses and handwaving. Modern management techniques such as agile and continuous delivery aim to reduce uncertainty by working incrementally, but that still doesn’t guarantee final delivery. Portfolio management selects a mix of projects that balance risk and reward (because it’s hard to stay competitive if you only play it safe), but that means assessing risk accurately, which is hard.

“The risk in a project is always probabilistic and the human mind is not good at doing risk-based probability management, especially when we’re combining many different probabilities,” Aptage CEO John Heintz tells CIO.com. It’s easy to confirm your own opinions; “I got the answer I expected, and I agree with myself.”

We’re also prone to what he calls “hope-based planning.”
“It’s natural: We’re to some degree all optimistic; we all see the positive path forward, the way this could work, and we don’t have evidence to prove it can’t work, so we hope it’s going to go the way we want it to,” Heintz says.











 
 
 
Aptage uses machine learning to predict the outcomes of projects using data you already have, such as the planned start and end date of various phases of the project (and, if you have them, estimates about any backlogs) to learn the completion rate of the team and predict the likelihood of delivering on time. Estimates are always uncertain, so you can put in upper and lower bounds for how long tasks will take (or the software can model it using the golden ratio). You also need to put in some information on the source of risks: “Don’t just blame the last person holding the problem; figure out what’s going wrong,” as Heintz puts it.
That’s information most teams will have, he suggests. “Teams that don’t have a tremendously rigorous process can still use our tool right away. If a team has a backlog that are seven things written on a napkin, we can still give them some help. If a team has a complete best case/worse case analysis and work breakdown structure for the whole project, we can give even more advice,” Heintz says.
Aptage uses visualisations of confidence, feasibility and whether the risk is going up or down over time to help you switch between what Heintz calls fast and slow thinking.  “We had to create these visuals because we need to connect with the fast-thinking, intuitive mind to help people see things in a way that lets them make good intuitive decisions. If the project starts getting a whole lot more red, the lizard brain should have some fear. Maybe we still decide to go forward with that project, but we’ve thought about it and we’ve been triggered to think about the right things. ‘That might hurt but we have a safety net; if we have to spend 20% more on this project, we’ll still have a good probability [of success]; let’s take the risk.’”











 
 
 
The algorithms and models Aptage uses were designed for software development but also fit construction projects. The first (rather basic) integration is with Jira and in time Heintz hopes to put the visualisations inside tools project teams use on a daily basis such as Microsoft Project, Primavera construction planning, Trello, or even feature roadmaps and KPI dashboards in Salesforce or Power BI. “If I put a task into Trello or ServiceNow, when might I expect and with what level of confidence is the estimate? Give me the 90 percent confidence date.”

Generally, the goal is to avoid getting to the end of a project and being surprised. “If you knew today that the project was at 60 percent risk of not being done and done well, what would you do differently? We point you to the source of the risk and what you might do about it.”
Aptage won’t fix problem projects but it should warn you about them, Heintz says. “It’s the ability to collaborate and talk about ‘This is a high-risk project and we’re managing it well’ versus ‘We don’t know what the risk is; we’re just going to promise it’s going to be done and at the last minute we might say no.’”











 
 
 
Resource management
Some of the AI tools businesses are already adopting, such as predictive maintenance, can help make projects more efficient and reliable, says Lance Olsen, director in Microsoft’s Cloud AI team. “One of the most common things that can throw a project out of whack in terms of its schedule and risk is unforeseen failure in systems that you’re relying on in the project.”
In general, he believes that AI will be most helpful by removing risk in projects, “whether that’s prediction for the project up front or removing risk in the execution.” That’s going to make projects more efficient: “There’s so much uncertainty and how we deal with it now is that we create giant buffers,” he says.
AI can already help track progress and performance, especially if you take a broad view of what project management is, suggests Nadya Duke Boone, director of product management for platform at New Relic, which recently added what it calls applied intelligence to its performance monitoring tools. “A lot of project management is going on where there’s nobody who officially has that title or role and there’s a new set of project management tools we don’t think of consciously that way.”











 
 
 
With incremental projects, success isn’t always determined at the end of a project; it’s more likely to be on-going KPIs around quality and reliability. “Customers asking ‘Are we on track?’ are using metrics like how many deployments can I do? How reliable are my deployments? Am I having regression errors? Is my performance where I want it to be?” Boone says. “AI could identify slowly ramping trends in that stream of data that are significant but hard to see — or easy for humans to ignore even if they see them.”
New Relic Applied Intelligence includes a tool called Radar that looks for these patterns and issues, suggests actions and learns from what users pick up on. “It’s helping us find things like a week-over-week slowdown; something trending in the wrong direction where we wouldn’t have caught it because the project is so focused on day to day,” she says.
AI, Boone suggests, could help make sure we pay attention to bad news. “I’ve known cases where metrics have shown things are trending in the wrong direction but it’s hard for people to acknowledge that.”











 
 
 
It can also help with automation, leaving project managers more time to actually manage. “A large part of AI in any industry right now is removing the work that’s tedious and letting the humans focus on the part machines don’t do well. So much work in project management is not number crunching; it’s about do we have clear goals, is everyone moving in the same direction and is their work coordinated.”
New Relic, for example, uses a chatbot to remind managers to manage capitalizable hours. Boone also speculates that natural language analysis of how people phrase status updates might help to determine how confident they are about progress.
“Reducing monotonous and time-consuming tasks that aren’t necessarily high value but show up in every project” doesn’t just free up time, Olsen points out; it also reduces errors.











 
 
 
Rick McEachern, vice president of business development at Software AG, sees robotic process automation (RPA) taking over a lot of the mundane, repetitive, high-volume tasks from project managers, like merging data from different systems to coordinate deliveries and other logistics and updating case management systems. “There’s a ton of work that could be done as far as transferring data, moving it around between different systems, handling mass emails, doing reporting and file and document processing,” McEachern says. “Robots are great at that sort of activity.”
“You could have robots looking at different updates and status reports and data and doing alerting if a file was supposed to be here on a certain date and it didn’t arrive,” McEachern suggests. “If someone hasn’t submitted their latest estimate, you might use a robot with the case management system to ping them to say, ‘It’s two days away from deadline and I’m going to send you an hourly reminder’. And when they upload the new schedule, I can invoke a robot to extract the data I care about and put it into the master project schedule.”
Predicting and experimenting
RPA could also be useful for resource optimization and scheduling, if you can define business rules or create data models that they can use to evaluate and report exceptions. That could be particularly useful for transportation and logistics, he said; “There are lots of different optimizations where you can use machine learning, like least cost routing for minimizing fuel costs or optimizing loads.”











 
 
 
“You can use forecasting as a way to fine-tune project execution and have fewer misses,” Olsen says, but if you really want to use AI to improve projects you have to look for ways to experiment and improve. “These kinds of practices are going to be what really differentiate organizations in the next five years. These are systems of intelligence and CIOs have to design these to drive the rate of experimentation.”
“Part of that loop is saying, ‘We got 75 percent accuracy last month; what about the other 25 percent? Maybe weather is a predictor for us; let’s get a weather feed and add it to the model and maybe we get to 80 percent.’ Look at your rate of experimentation and your rate of learning as a key metric for success on your projects. How are you being systematic about getting that learning and driving more experiments?” Olsen says.
It’s tempting to think that you could use machine learning to make forecasts about which projects will succeed and fail, but that could be a long way off, he warns.











 
 
 
“What we see people focusing in today is components within the project; the resources and progress against the resources, or the health or performance of resources. As that matures, a logical next step is to go up a level and what about the whole project itself — how can we make that more efficient?” That will mean gathering detailed information about a lot of projects, he warns.
“To get predictions about projects you have to be capturing data about the project itself and feeding that into a model and saying what were the anomalies or common traits in the project that made it successful?” Olsen says.
Boone also sounds a note of caution on how accurate predications can be, noting that some project tasks are easier to estimate than others because they’re more repetitious. When working as a project manager she found experienced electrical engineering estimators were very accurate, and not just because of how long the construction industry has had to build up knowledge.











 
 
 
“The difference between engineering and building software is that we don’t know the unit of work; in engineering that’s a foot of conduit or a yard of concrete but we just don’t have that in software. Laying asphalt is laying asphalt no matter where and when you’re doing it but even adding a column to a database can be very different depending on where you are in the project and who is doing it,” Boone says.
For large, complex projects with a lot of staff where the final goal is something repeatable, like setting up a new data center or moving applications to a container platform, Boone believes there could be enough data for machine learning to identify outliers, anomalies or correlations. “Here are three interesting correlations we’ve found; you might want to dig into them. That’s treating AI as a partner to the project manager and letting them apply their human-level and emotional intelligence.”

Today the word “Luddite” describes anyone who opposes technology. The Luddites were English weavers and textile workers who destroyed weaving machinery to protest the automation of jobs in the Industrial Revolution.
The CIO job is arguably to provide data, infrastructure and tools to increase the productivity of people. Innovative technology means changes in how people do those jobs. With disruptive innovations this often means job destruction.
People largely accept this because it feels like you cannot stop progress. But also, because there was a feeling that progress will create other, often better paying jobs and we tend to remain confident that we personally benefit from all the upheaval.
 
 
 













 
 

Artificial intelligence and an interconnected series of other automation technologies are going to put that confidence to the test. Machine learning, robotics, IoT sensors and self-driving vehicles are just some of the technologies that can accelerate the reduction of labor and effort, even among high paying white collar and technical jobs.

The World Economic Forum predicts that over 5 million jobs will be automated by 2020. Gartner Group recently announced that they expect five hundred thousand more jobs will be created than will be eliminated by that point. But this more optimistic view is still the minority prediction. Another group of experts believes that 40% of the world’s 500 biggest companies could disappear.
AI projects have all the traditional barriers that CIOs have faced with other technologies – resistance to change, immature, complex technology, trouble aligning requirements across the organization – but have the added challenge of remarkably bad press. How do CIOs get buy in from their partners across the enterprise if they become viewed as primarily focused on technology that will destroy jobs, albeit in the name of efficiency?
 
 
 













 
 

Expect resistance. If your corporate culture still equates career success and influence with the size of budgets and staff, then there will be people that won’t get on board. You will not win over everyone.
If AI is to develop further, investment will be needed…and that will have to come from increased profitability. Focus on revenue generating project and projects that improve efficiency of staff before painting a vision of empty offices.
Partner with human resources early and often
Access to top talent is as critical to AI success as with any other initiative that IT owns. But HR is also an essential partner in ensuring effective communication across the enterprise and to transition people between roles. Encourage staff and management goals that encourage efficiency, quality and profits. Mangers with goals that focus on effort instead of business outcomes are much more likely to resist new technology.
 
 
 













 
 

Partner with HR to evaluate how you eliminate jobs. AI has the potential to shift staffing strategies for many industries fundamentally and permanently. The cost benefits can be huge and long-term. Argue to proactively reinvest some of it back into retraining and outplacement programs. Argue for more generous severance programs. It will lengthen the period for a return on your AI investments, but argue for senior leadership to look at the big picture. Your organization if people view it as being sensitive to the human impact.
Be the evangelist
Adding to the problem, the AI industry is doing a terrible job of PR. There is no single, high-profile person driving the vision for the huge benefits we will get out of AI related technologies. Instead we have celebrities like Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates expressing alarm and news stories in major media outlets that reference Skynet from the Terminator films.
Stories abound about AI improving everything from medical care to customer service. There are real benefits so highlight that. Transformation is not built on technology alone. It is built on shared vision and enthusiasm. The CIOs need to paint a picture that envisions this new world. Not only is this new world inevitable, but it is also massively beneficial.
 
 
 













 
 

Win over key influencers across the enterprise
Get buy-in in advance of initiative from business leaders and those with organizational influence. Enlist them to help you spread the word and set the tone. Understand their goals and listen for ways to demonstrate improvements that they value and will celebrate. Leave a positive impact on employees, by giving them new job opportunities.
Do not forget to engage managers and ensure they feel good about the initiatives. Their jobs are tough, and automation is a new set of tools that will help them to do those jobs better. By handing over their mundane jobs to AI can add quality to their lives.
Manage expectations
Expectation for AI are sky high. We still need to hit the Gartner “trough of disillusionment” where difficult reality makes public opinion turn pessimistic on a technology before it matures. There will be errors and mistakes and delays. Every complex initiative has them. Keep people focused on the vision and ensure your influencers stay in line. Communicate often and share the small victories. Promise progress not immediate revolutions.
 
 
 













 
 

Automation is transforming many parts of our world. It is necessary, and your organization needs to be a leader. But the path will be difficult and there will be a human toll. Stay focused on communicating with people and you can lead the way without creating that new generation of Luddites.

The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the future of work and organizations was a hot topic for visitors to MIT Sloan Management Review’s website in 2017. Although MIT SMR publishes content on a wide range of management topics, 25% of the 20 most-read pieces of new editorial content on the MIT SMR website in 2017 dealt with AI — including the most popular article from the magazine, the most popular report, and the most popular blog post.
But AI wasn’t the only subject on readers’ minds in 2017. Other widely read pieces of new content addressed timely issues like digital transformation and design thinking — as well as perennially important topics such as innovation, strategy execution, problem formulation, and negative emotions in the workplace.

AloneBy Andrew BurtJan. 4, 2018Share full articleRead in appCredit...Kiyoshi Ota/BloombergDecember was a big month for advocates of regulating artificial intelligence. First, a bipartisan group of senators and representatives introduced the Future of A.I. Act, the first federal bill solely focused on A.I. It would create an advisory committee to make recommendations about A.I. — on topics including the technology’s effect on the American work force and strategies to protect the privacy rights of those it impacts. Then the New York City Council approved a first-of-its-kind bill that once signed into law will create a task force to examine its own use of automated decision systems, with the ultimate goal of making its use of algorithms fairer and more transparent.Perhaps not coincidentally, these efforts also overlap with increasing calls to regulate artificial intelligence along with claims by the likes of Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking that it poses a threat to humanity’s literal survival.But this push for broad legislation to regulate A.I. is premature.To begin with, even experts can’t agree on what, exactly, constitutes artificial intelligence. Take the recent report released by the AI Now Institute, aimed at creating a framework for ethically implementing A.I. While itself focused on A.I., the report also acknowledges that no commonly accepted definition of A.I. exists, which it describes loosely as “a broad assemblage of technologies … that have traditionally relied on human capacities.”“Artificial intelligence” is all too frequently used as a shorthand for software that simply does what humans used to do. But replacing human activity is precisely what new technologies accomplish — spears replaced clubs, wheels replaced feet, the printing press replaced scribes, and so on. What’s new about A.I. is that this technology isn’t simply replacing human activities, external to our bodies; it’s also replacing human decision-making, inside our minds.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe challenges created by this novelty should not obscure the fact that A.I. itself is not one technology, or even one singular development. Regulating an assemblage of technology we can’t clearly define is a recipe for poor laws and even worse technology.Indeed, the challenges A.I. poses aren’t entirely new. We’ve already successfully regulated it in the past — we just didn’t call it “artificial intelligence.” In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, the financial industry began to rely on complex statistical modeling and huge computerized databases to make credit decisions, automating what had been a more manual process of approving or denying credit to borrowers.Those ethical and legal challenges associated with these models so captivated the public’s attention that in the summer of 1970, Newsweek ran a cover story titled “Is Privacy Dead?” detailing the “massive flanking attack” of computers on modern society. Growing awareness of that threat led to broad appeals that echo modern proposals to regulate A.I. “Eventually we have to set up an agency to regulate the computers,” Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina said in 1970.But instead of regulating all computers, the government sought a targeted approach tailored to specific problems, passing regulations like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act in 1974. That act was meant to reduce credit discrimination against minority groups and to increase consumers’ ability to understand what the models were doing — if consumers didn’t like their credit score, thanks to the act they could at least know how it could be improved.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThat law and others offer valuable lessons today, illustrating the importance of focusing on specific issues — in this case, transparency in credit decisions — and tailoring their solutions accordingly. Any regulation aimed at the range of systems we call “A.I.” should seek to be just as specific.With the thorny exception of cybersecurity, the way the United States regulatory system has approached information technology is arguably the most successful model for regulating technology in existence — fostering innovation while ensuring that the technology we use doesn’t break or seriously jeopardize our safety. The backbone of this approach comprises regulations tailored to the explicit problems created by any given technology.Within the United States’ vast framework of laws and regulatory agencies already lie answers to some of the most vexing challenges created by A.I. In the financial sector, for example, the Federal Reserve enforces a regulation called SR 11-7, which addresses the risks created by the complex algorithms used by today’s banks. SR 11-7’s solution to those challenges is called “effective challenge,” which seeks to embed critical analysis into every stage of an algorithm’s life cycle — from thoroughly examining the data used to train the algorithm to explicitly outlining the assumptions underlying the model, and more. While SR 11-7 is among the most detailed attempts at governing the challenges of complex algorithms, it’s also one of the most overlooked.This is not, of course, to suggest that artificial intelligence should never be regulated. But if the past is any guide, treating it as a collection of separate technologies, in separate sectors, is destined to be the most effective way to control the benefits it creates — and the dangers it poses.Andrew Burt is chief privacy officer and legal engineer at Immuta, a data management platform for data science, which enables companies to create and manage A.I. and machine learning models.

Let the robots have the damn jobs—all of them!

The past year was marked with increasing concerns about the effects artificial intelligence and automation will have on human employment and labor. Not a month goes by without one (or ten) articles warning about robots driving humans into unemployment and causing economic and social chaos.
But maybe we’re looking at things from the wrong perspective, through the lens of the laws that govern our current world. In a world where robots perform all tasks, many of the rules that we live by today might become obsolete. And it might not be such a bad thing.
RELATED: How artificial intelligence will disrupt the employment landscape
The value of human labor
In today’s world, we value most products (or services) by their scarcity and the human labor that goes into them. For instance, diamonds are scarce and that’s why they’re so expensive. But in most cases, we’re paying for the human labor that goes into creating goods and services. For example, when you buy grocery, you’re not paying for the scarcity of food. You pay for it because a lot of human labor goes into producing it, packaging it, transporting it and selling it to you in the store.
By human labor, I do not necessarily mean physical toil. It can also be cognitive functions. When you acquire a software or an online service, you pay for it because a lot of human labor goes into programming it and maintaining it. Those services in turn must pay for other services that support them and are running on human labor.
Each of us has a specific set of skills, which we sell to afford other people’s skills. For instance, I develop software and write articles to earn money and buy food and pay the rent. These activities account for a considerable part of our everyday lives. We’re still in a better situation than our ancestors, who had to spend the entire day hunting for food.

With artificial intelligence and machine learning earning a more prominent role in every industry and domain, the need for human labor, both physical and cognitive, is dwindling. Self-driving trucks will eventually replace truck drivers, and smart vending machines fast food workers. Robots can flip burgers just as well as cooks and harvest crops better than field workers. Amazon’s automated retail store will obviate the need for cashiers, and smart drone deliveries might even make stores excessive. Even doctors, lawyers and news reporters can someday surrender their professions (or a large part of it) to artificial intelligence. We’re already seeing the glimmers of AI algorithms that create their own AI. Maybe one day, even AI researchers will go extinct.
In every case, we can expect robots to perform faster, better and cheaper than humans. They can work for longer periods (sometimes incessantly), improve their skills over time, and pass on their experience to their peers in real time.
RELATED: IoT and machine learning are invading our lives. Is it a good thing?
As automation removes humans from the loop, the costs for human labor will gradually fade. A transportation company doesn’t need to pay its self-driving trucks as it used to do its truck drivers. However, it must pay for their maintenance (which still costs less) because the task still involves human labor. That too will cost next to nothing once the development and maintenance of the trucks and their AI software becomes automated as well. The same goes for everything else.
What happens to all the humans?
Eventually, we’ll achieve a self-sustaining economy, where AI and robots perform absolutely every task and there’s zero-need for human labor. Without humans slowing down the process, AI will be able to find better ways to optimize and speed up production. We can already see how internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence can deal with the planet’s food scarcity problem or make healthcare accessible to more people across the world.

In a fully-automated economy, the cost of living will drop to zero. Money will likely lose its value and raison d’être. What will we do with our 9-5 time then? There are fears that with no tasks left for humans, we’ll have no purpose in life. They’re wrong. In fact, when we no longer worry about putting food on the table, we’ll be able to discover the true meaning of being human.
Some things can never be automated. AI might be able to create art and music that rivals or outperforms that of human artists. But we humans often find attachments to the humans behind those creations rather than the creations themselves. A robot athlete might be better than any human alive, but we like athletes because of their personal struggles, their lives, and how they achieve their perfection through their toil, not how much they score on the field.
We will have plenty of time and opportunity to manifest our creative side, to socialize, to interact with other humans as human beings. We will have no reason to try to make profit off each other, to wage wars over natural resources and wealth. Humanity will thrive when robots take all the jobs.
As DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says, “If AI can help us as a society to not only save the environment, cure disease and explore the universe, but also better understand ourselves — well, that may prove one of the greatest discoveries of them all.”
RELATED: The future of artificial intelligence
The transition can be painful
While the fully-automated economy can perfectly provide the Utopia we deserve, one problem remains. Before we reach the final stage, there will be a period where jobs will become scarce yet not disappear altogether. This means that, while minimal, the costs of life will remain, while without jobs, people won’t be able to pay for those costs.
The fears from automation are rooted in the fact that without jobs, humans won’t be able to afford their lives. It can lead to a spike in inequality. The companies who will drive innovations in artificial intelligence will own the robots and the wealth and the entire economy, while the rest of the population will spiral into poverty and unemployment.
Those fears are well placed. If things go wrong, that’s exactly one of the ways events can unfold, especially if big tech companies will continue the greedy trend of hoarding wealth and making money for the sake of making more money. That will lead to chaos, strife and eventually, their own undoing.

There are several ways we can deal with the troubles that lie ahead during the transition to full automation. Some experts and companies are exploring basic income, the centuries-old idea of giving unconditional money to all citizens, enough for them to live their lives. Other thought leaders such as Bill Gates are proposing robot taxes, where companies that use automation pay certain fees for the jobs they take away from humans. Other solutions might emerge.
Automation will continue to move forward at an accelerating pace. We don’t need to fear about the destination. Instead, we must prepare ourselves for the rocky road ahead. I’m not worried about the robots taking all the jobs. I’m worried about them leaving some to the humans.

When Will We Finally Achieve True Artificial Intelligence?



By Thomas Hornigold
January 1, 2018 







The field of artificial intelligence goes back a long way, but many consider it was officially born when a group of scientists at Dartmouth College got together for a summer, back in 1956. Computers had, over the last few decades, come on in incredible leaps and bounds; they could now perform calculations far faster than humans. Optimism, given the incredible progress that had been made, was rational. Genius computer scientist Alan Turing had already mooted the idea of thinking machines just a few years before. The scientists had a fairly simple idea: intelligence is, after all, just a mathematical process. The human brain was a type of machine. Pick apart that process, and you can make a machine simulate it.
The problem didn’t seem too hard: the Dartmouth scientists wrote, “We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.” This research proposal, by the way, contains one of the earliest uses of the term artificial intelligence. They had a number of ideas—maybe simulating the human brain’s pattern of neurons could work and teaching machines the abstract rules of human language would be important.
The scientists were optimistic, and their efforts were rewarded. Before too long, they had computer programs that seemed to understand human language and could solve algebra problems. People were confidently predicting there would be a human-level intelligent machine built within, oh, let’s say, the next twenty years.
It’s fitting that the industry of predicting when we’d have human-level intelligent AI was born at around the same time as the AI industry itself. In fact, it goes all the way back to Turing’s first paper on “thinking machines,” where he predicted that the Turing Test—machines that could convince humans they were human—would be passed in 50 years, by 2000. Nowadays, of course, people are still predicting it will happen within the next 20 years, perhaps most famously Ray Kurzweil. There are so many different surveys of experts and analyses that you almost wonder if AI researchers aren’t tempted to come up with an auto reply: “I’ve already predicted what your question will be, and no, I can’t really predict that.”
The issue with trying to predict the exact date of human-level AI is that we don’t know how far is left to go. This is unlike Moore’s Law. Moore’s Law, the doubling of processing power roughly every couple of years, makes a very concrete prediction about a very specific phenomenon. We understand roughly how to get there—improved engineering of silicon wafers—and we know we’re not at the fundamental limits of our current approach (at least, not until you’re trying to work on chips at the atomic scale). You cannot say the same about artificial intelligence.
Common Mistakes
Stuart Armstrong’s survey looked for trends in these predictions. Specifically, there were two major cognitive biases he was looking for. The first was the idea that AI experts predict true AI will arrive (and make them immortal) conveniently just before they’d be due to die. This is the “Rapture of the Nerds” criticism people have leveled at Kurzweil—his predictions are motivated by fear of death, desire for immortality, and are fundamentally irrational. The ability to create a superintelligence is taken as an article of faith. There are also criticisms by people working in the AI field who know first-hand the frustrations and limitations of today’s AI.
The second was the idea that people always pick a time span of 15 to 20 years. That’s enough to convince people they’re working on something that could prove revolutionary very soon (people are less impressed by efforts that will lead to tangible results centuries down the line), but not enough for you to be embarrassingly proved wrong. Of the two, Armstrong found more evidence for the second one—people were perfectly happy to predict AI after they died, although most didn’t, but there was a clear bias towards “15–20 years from now” in predictions throughout history.
Measuring Progress
Armstrong points out that, if you want to assess the validity of a specific prediction, there are plenty of parameters you can look at. For example, the idea that human-level intelligence will be developed by simulating the human brain does at least give you a clear pathway that allows you to assess progress. Every time we get a more detailed map of the brain, or successfully simulate another part of it, we can tell that we are progressing towards this eventual goal, which will presumably end in human-level AI. We may not be 20 years away on that path, but at least you can scientifically evaluate the progress.
Compare this to those that say AI, or else consciousness, will “emerge” if a network is sufficiently complex, given enough processing power. This might be how we imagine human intelligence and consciousness emerged during evolution—although evolution had billions of years, not just decades. The issue with this is that we have no empirical evidence: we have never seen consciousness manifest itself out of a complex network. Not only do we not know if this is possible, we cannot know how far away we are from reaching this, as we can’t even measure progress along the way.
There is an immense difficulty in understanding which tasks are hard, which has continued from the birth of AI to the present day. Just look at that original research proposal, where understanding human language, randomness and creativity, and self-improvement are all mentioned in the same breath. We have great natural language processing, but do our computers understand what they’re processing? We have AI that can randomly vary to be “creative,” but is it creative? Exponential self-improvement of the kind the singularity often relies on seems far away.
We also struggle to understand what’s meant by intelligence. For example, AI experts consistently underestimated the ability of AI to play Go. Many thought, in 2015, it would take until 2027. In the end, it took two years, not twelve. But does that mean AI is any closer to being able to write the Great American Novel, say? Does it mean it’s any closer to conceptually understanding the world around it? Does it mean that it’s any closer to human-level intelligence? That’s not necessarily clear.
Not Human, But Smarter Than Humans
But perhaps we’ve been looking at the wrong problem. For example, the Turing test has not yet been passed in the sense that AI cannot convince people it’s human in conversation; but of course the calculating ability, and perhaps soon the ability to perform other tasks like pattern recognition and driving cars, far exceed human levels. As “weak” AI algorithms make more decisions, and Internet of Things evangelists and tech optimists seek to find more ways to feed more data into more algorithms, the impact on society from this “artificial intelligence” can only grow.
It may be that we don’t yet have the mechanism for human-level intelligence, but it’s also true that we don’t know how far we can go with the current generation of algorithms. Those scary surveys that state automation will disrupt society and change it in fundamental ways don’t rely on nearly as many assumptions about some nebulous superintelligence.
Then there are those that point out we should be worried about AI for other reasons. Just because we can’t say for sure if human-level AI will arrive this century, or never, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t prepare for the possibility that the optimistic predictors could be correct. We need to ensure that human values are programmed into these algorithms, so that they understand the value of human life and can act in “moral, responsible” ways.
Phil Torres, at the Project for Future Human Flourishing, expressed it well in an interview with me. He points out that if we suddenly decided, as a society, that we had to solve the problem of morality—determine what was right and wrong and feed it into a machine—in the next twenty years…would we even be able to do it?
So, we should take predictions with a grain of salt. Remember, it turned out the problems the AI pioneers foresaw were far more complicated than they anticipated. The same could be true today. At the same time, we cannot be unprepared. We should understand the risks and take our precautions. When those scientists met in Dartmouth in 1956, they had no idea of the vast, foggy terrain before them. Sixty years later, we still don’t know how much further there is to go, or how far we can go. But we’re going somewhere.

Or even perhaps an entirely new career? With the progress in the field of machine learning and automation in 2017, you could be forgiven for some concern over what new work you might do and whether those jobs will be automated by the time you are qualified.Fear of automation is not new. The industrial revolution took away people’s jobs, with the luddites famously destroying machines to protect human work. Automation happened, people lost jobs, new jobs were created (often higher paid jobs) and aside from a difficult transitionary period, things got better.The same thing is happening today. Machine learning and robotics are finding better or cheaper ways of doing the same things humans are employed to do in various areas. As this happens, we can move human workers to different roles. Again, as with the industrial revolution, the transitionary period is unlikely to be pain-free, with people needing re-training and time taken for new roles to be invented for the newly available workforce. If anything, it’s happening faster today so the transition may be even more painful than before.Trending AI Articles:1. TOP 100 medium articles related with Artificial Intelligence2.

A machine which is at least as good as a human in everything we can do? Provided it can do the same things as a human at a lower cost, free market economics will essentially guarantee that all jobs go to AI. The issue only gets worse if we explore the possibility of Super Intelligence, an AI which is orders of magnitude better than a human at everything we can do. Provided the cost doesn’t go up proportionally with ability, it would seem we mere humans would be in a pretty bad place. But this is a guide about how to guarantee your job well into the future! So, what should you be doing?Lying— Legislation like the rapidly approaching GDPR regulation mandates a ‘right to explanation’. This regulation demands that machines explain the thought process behind any decision they have made, and that the people designing these systems must ensure they are able to explain their thought processes quickly and honestly. Humans on the other hand have been lying to each other for millennia. Long after machines are banned from lying to humans, humans may continue lying to one another.Likelihood of remaining employable in 2050–95%Killing — Like international bans on chemical and biological weapons, I believe we are headed towards an international agreement banning the use of lethal autonomous weapons. While I don’t doubt that machine could be very good at killing humans, probably fulfilling the ‘faster, better, cheaper’ criteria, we have too many ethical hang-ups about directly delegating the power over which humans live and die to allow lethal autonomous machines. There has been a market for killing other humans since society began. Perhaps an AI government would establish world peace, but if historical evidence is anything to go by the market will remain well into the future.Likelihood of remaining employable in 2050–80%Doing things badly — There’s still some chance that people will prefer to build human made products for emotional reasons. People have long chosen artisanal processes over factory based mass production for the sense of occasion or story they associate with a handmade product. Swiss watches are a great example. They command a high price, they’ve very difficult to make, go wrong often and have in all technical regards been superseded by quartz watches. Collectors however still prize swiss watches, exactly for that appreciation of the artisanal process and the story they associate with a product. There is still some risk with this type of work, as a general or super intelligence can do everything a human can, and possibly do it a lot better than us. That might include making desirable and charming mistakes that humans love, or even making an artificial back story which resonates with us better than any genuine human one.Likelihood of remaining employable in 2050–50%So, there you go. Perhaps we will still have jobs in the future. Unfortunately, these jobs look no better than the unemployed alternative.

In Memoriam: Charles Rich, Computer Science Professor and Artificial Intelligence Pioneer







January 04, 2018



Charles Rich, professor of computer science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and a pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction, died Jan. 3.
Rich, who was also affiliated with the university’s Interactive Media and Game Development, Learning Sciences and Technologies, and Robotics Engineering programs, joined the WPI faculty in 2007 having already earned widespread recognition for his work in artificial intelligence, software engineering, and human-computer interaction, particularly as a principal research scientist at MIT and a founding member and distinguished scientist at the Mitsubishi Electronic Research Laboratories (MERL).
“At WPI Chuck not only built upon his many professional accomplishments to continue impactful research,” said Craig Wills, professor and head of the Department of Computer Science, “but he had a tremendously positive influence on the students and faculty within Computer Science and IMGD as a teacher, mentor, and colleague.”
In his work with computers and robots, Rich pursued the goal of improving our interactions with technology of all kinds by making them more intuitive, natural, and productive. Motivated in part by images in science fiction of intelligent assistants and companions that could simplify and enrich our lives, he hoped to enhance our experiences with everything from robot helpers to online learning programs.
“If human-like robots are ever going to move freely among us in a broad range of situations (assisting the handicapped and elderly, conducting search-and-rescue operations, or playing roles in sales and entertainment),” he wrote in a research highlight for the National Science Foundation (NSF) website, “we will need to do more than make them safer; we will need to understand how to program them to collaborate with us smoothly and naturally.”
After earning a BASc in engineering science at the University of Toronto and an SM and a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, Rich joined the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory as a research scientist in 1980. At MIT, he founded and directed the Programmer’s Apprentice project, which aimed to develop a theory of “how expert programmers analyze, synthesize, modify, explain, specify, verify, and document programs,” according to a research overview he co-authored in 1993. “This research goal overlaps both artificial intelligence and software engineering.”
In 1991, Rich joined the staff of MERL, the North American subsidiary of the corporate research and development organization of Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. Located in Cambridge, MERL conducted research in a wide range of fields within electronics and information technology. Rich and his wife, Candace Sidner, a research professor in computer science at WPI, worked in the area of collaborative agents. Their aim was to develop intelligent agents that could provide a unified conversational interface for all the appliances in a home.
As part of that project, Rich and Sidner created a software platform called COLLAGEN, an application-independent collaboration manager. The platform, which has had an important influence on subsequent work in dialogue processing, was used to develop a number of collaborative agents, including DiamondHelp, a finalist in two design competitions in 2005.
In a 1998 paper in the journal User Modeling and User-Adapter Interaction, Rich and Sidner talked about the principles that guided the development of COLLAGEN. “Our most fundamental underlying assumption is that a human-computer interface based on familiar human discourse rules and conventions will be easier for people to learn and use than one that is not,” they wrote. “Although we cannot yet confirm this assumption by our own empirical studies, we are encouraged by an analogy with the direct-manipulation paradigm for graphical user interfaces, whose success we believe is due, in large part, to users’ familiarity with the rules and conventions of object manipulation in everyday life.”

At WPI, Rich continued to explore his interest in collaborative and conversational agents. In a 2008 essay in WPI’s research magazine, he described an NSF-funded project in which he explored techniques for helping robots work more effectively with humans by emulating human verbal and nonverbal communications. The research made use of a humanoid robot named Melvin, which Rich helped design while at MERL. With a moveable head and arms and an expressive face, Melvin became a platform for a wide range of research and undergraduate projects at WPI on human-robot collaboration.
In “Robots and Avatars as Hosts, Advisors, Companions, and Jesters,” a 2009 article in AI Magazine, Rich and Sidner surveyed the state of research on the use of AI to create intelligent human companions, focusing, in the conclusion, on one promising application. “Obviously, as robots become able to use their hands and arms safely in close proximity to humans, many physically assistive applications, such as helping the elderly, will become feasible. Furthermore, as compared to the partially competing approach of ubiquitous computing, in which the entire environment is instrumented and automated, a humanoid robot can also offer companionship (emotion and social relationship). Evidence already suggests that people respond positively to such robots.”
With funding from the NSF, Rich and Sidner set out to fulfil that promise by building virtual agents that can serve as companions for the elderly in their homes. These “always on” agents were designed to be available around the clock to provide support and friendship while also promoting healthy behaviors. One agent, named Karen, evolved from a graphical interface on a computer screen to a small robot. It was designed to learn from its interactions with its human companion and anticipate his or her needs “Karen is much more than a simple stimulus-response system,” Rich said. “She has long-term goals for the relationship and a memory of past activities, and she can plan for the future.”
A senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Rich was honored for his early work in artificial intelligence by being elected a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 1992.
He was the co-author, with Richard Waters, of Readings in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering (Morgan Kaufmann, 1986) and The Programmer’s Apprentice (Addison-Wesley, 1990). He held four patents, including one for systems for collaborative interfaces (with Candace Sidner) and over 70 refereed journal and magazine articles and conference presentations. He served as chair of the 1992 International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, co-chaired the 1998 National Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the 2010 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, and was program co-chair of the 2011 International Conference on the Foundation of Digital Games.
In addition to his prolific accomplishments as a researcher, Rich was known as an excellent classroom instructor who pioneered a number of new courses at WPI, including “Artificial Intelligence for Interactive Media and Games” and “Serious Games.” He was also a valued mentor who supervised or advised more than 30 graduate students at WPI and MIT and served as a faculty advisor for more than a dozen undergraduate Major Qualifying Projects.
Michael Gennert, professor of computer science and former director of the Robotics Engineering Program, says he will remember Rich for his “exuberant personality and playful attitude, which had a wonderful effect on everyone he met. He also had keen insight and boundless curiosity. You could always count on Chuck to ask a profound question at any CS colloquium, whether it was in his research area or not.”
In his profile on the WPI website, Rich offered a glimpse of what motivated his research and his on-going quest to develop computers and robots that can work collaboratively and intelligently with people. “What gets me out of bed in the morning,” he wrote, “is the hope that I will one day interact with a true artificial intelligence and the belief that part of what I will do today contributes to that goal.”
Funeral services will be held on Monday, Jan. 8, at 10 a.m. at the Wilson Chapel at the Andover Newton Theological School, 234 Herrick Road, Newton, MA 02459. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.

12 mind-blowing AI advances and 12 critical takeaways to put AI in perspective by Thomas Frey | Jan 3, 2018 | Artificial Intelligence


 It was rare to find a tech columnist last year that didn’t make some reference to artificial intelligence. But it was also rare to find a writer who could clearly differentiate between the hype and true relevance of these accomplishments.
Keep in mind, even after decades of tech progress, we still get lost with our GPS, our digitally translated documents are often unreadable, and our smartphones still drop calls.
Even relatively simple computational tasks like scanning documents with optical character recognition is still not 100% accurate.
Still, many well meaning thought leaders have issued impassioned warnings of the dangers of general AI, which is not anywhere in sight. This does not mean we are without danger, just not that kind of danger. Not yet.
Perhaps the earliest dangers will come on the job front. The efficiencies that AI gives us will eliminate the need for many tasks, and even though many will be tedious jobs, working in undesirable conditions that few can point to as their dream position, they do serve as a current basis for employment, affecting countless lives.
At the same time, few jobs are truly secure with most continually morphing along with their industries. 70% of the tasks software engineers did in 2000 didn’t even exist in 1990.
Farmers, switchboard operators, and assembly-line workers in the 20th century were replaced by computer specialists, accountants, and dental hygienists. Over the coming decades we’ll see drone command center operators, data optimizers, experience designers, and other jobs that we can’t yet imagine.
Millions of unemployed workers will need to be retrained, but we don’t have a great track record here. With the vast majority of higher ed money going to colleges, the U.S. government spends a smaller share of resources on retraining than all but two other OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.

12 mind-blowing advances made by AI
It’s important to consider the dishwasher analogy. While dishwashers do offer significant efficiencies, their role in the average household is quite different than what was originally intended. In addition to being dishwashing machines, they provide an out-of-sight staging area for dirty dishes and a higher bar for all-around kitchen cleanliness.
With AI, rather than witnessing a mass elimination of jobs, we will likely see a higher bar – more thorough analysis, more control, and more certainty in the way jobs are performed.
With that in mind, here are some of the mind-blowing advances made by AI over the past year.
1. Self-taught AI beats doctors at predicting heart attacks
As most doctors will tell you, our tools for predicting a patient’s health are no match for the complexity of the human body. Heart attacks are particularly hard to anticipate. Stephen Weng, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom showed that computers capable of teaching themselves perform far better than established medical processes, significantly increasing prediction rates. Once implemented, the new method will save thousands, perhaps even millions of lives a year.
2. NASA uses A.I. to discover of two new planets
Scanning space is intensely boring work. For this reason, NASA tried a new approach and used machine learning to discover two new planets. Working with old data from the Kepler space telescope, it was able to locate two new additions to our galaxy. This wasn’t the first time researchers applied AI to sift through the massive amount of data NASA’s telescopes collect, but it is a promising example of how neural networks can leverage even some of the weakest signs of distant worlds. Thanks to AI, NASA discovered a whole new planetary system.
3. AI is learning what makes you cry at the movies
AI is no expert at human emotions, but some visionary filmmakers have found a way to use it to gain insights on how to increase a story’s emotional pull. Through this process they were able to identify musical scores or visual images that help trigger the right feelings at the right time! In the storytelling industry, understanding the cause and effect relationships between stimuli triggers and human reactions is a powerful tool.
4. Using AI to converts images of food into a list of ingredients
Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have developed an AI algorithm to analyze food photos and match them with a list of ingredients and recipes. Starting with more than a million annotated recipes from online sites, their neural network sifted through each list of ingredients and a number of images associated with it. In the future, this kind of tool will help people learn to cook, count calories, and track our eating habits.
5. Amazon develops an AI fashion designer
Amazon has developed an algorithm that can design clothing by analyzing a series of images, copying the style, and then apply it to new garments generated from scratch. In-house researchers are working on several machine-learning systems that will help provide an edge when it comes to spotting, reacting to, and perhaps even shaping new fashion trends. Since Amazon has stated, they want to become “the best place to buy fashion online,” this seems like a logical move.
6. Resistbot, an ingenious AI chatbot will contact lawmakers for you
If you’re looking for a more efficient way for your voice to be heard, pay close attention to Resistbot. This AI-powered chatbot makes it easy to contact your political representatives. Users simply text the word “resist” to 50409. The automated bot will ask for a name and zip code to determine which public officials to contact. Since users create their own messages, creativity and clarity are critical for this service that pride’s itself on avoiding standard “form letters.”
7. China is using AI to predict who will commit crime next
Taking a page out of the movie “Minority Report,” China is developing predictive analytics to help authorities stop suspects before a crime is committed. With their unchecked access to citizens’ histories, Chinese tech companies are helping police develop artificial intelligence they say will help them identify and apprehend suspects before criminal acts are committed. By tapping into facial recognition tech, and combining it with predictive intelligence, they hope to notify police of potential criminals based on their behavior patterns. Even though it sounds like promising tech, applications like this are getting tons of scrutiny.
8. AI beats world’s top poker players
Humankind has just been beaten at yet another game, this time Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold’em poker. Since poker is a game of uncertainty, players don’t know what cards the other players have or what cards will be dealt in the future. In a game like chess or Go, all players can see the board, meaning that everyone has complete information. This makes chess and Go much easier to program than poker. Poker also requires understanding the psychology of the other players – are they bluffing, should I fold, or should I bluff? Poker also involves betting – when should I bet, how much should I bet? Does this mean the gambling industry is doomed?
9. Researchers create a lip-reading A.I.
If you wonder why NFL coaches are now covering their mouths when they talk into their microphones, it’s because someone or something might be reading their lips. Working with Google’s Deep Mind neural network, researchers developed an elaborate training process using thousands of hours of subtitled BBC television videos. The videos showed a broad spectrum of people speaking in a wide variety of poses, activities, and lighting to simulate real life conditions. While still not perfect, their algorithm achieved promising results.
10. ‘Mind reading’ AI is able to scan brains and guess what you’re thinking
Carnegie Mellon University scientists have developed a system that can read complex thoughts based on brain scans, even interpreting complete sentences. Using data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, the team was able to demonstrate different brain activations being triggered according to 240 complex events, ranging from individuals and settings to types of social interaction and physical actions. Using the smart algorithms they developed, the team was able to discern a person’s thoughts with 87% accuracy.
11. AI learns to write its own code by stealing from other programs
A team of researchers at Microsoft and the University of Cambridge created a system called DeepCoder for solving coding challenges like those used in most programming competitions. Without teaching it how to code, DeepCoder uses a technique called program synthesis to piece together lines of code taken from existing software, similar to what most programmer do. Framing the outcome around a list of inputs and outputs for each section of code, DeepCoder learned which pieces of code were needed to achieve the desired results.
12. Google’s AI was used to build it’s own AI, and it outperformed those made by humans
The creation of an AI capable of building its own AI does raise more than a few concerns. For instance, what’s to prevent the parent from passing down unwanted biases to its child? What if it creates systems so fast that society can’t keep up? It’s not very difficult to see how it could be employed in automated surveillance systems in the near future, perhaps even sooner than regulators could put something in place to control such systems. 
12 critical takeaways to put AI in perspective
After scanning through each of these accomplishments, it’s easy to assume that AI is right around the corner. But a successful experiment does not a finished product make.
We are very much in the primitive early stages of AI. People in the future will often look back shaking their heads saying, “what were they thinking?”
Here are some important takeaways to help sort the reality from the hype.
A. AI is based on algorithms
Even though today’s AI’s algorithms are very sophisticated, giving them the appearance of “humanness,” they’re still only fallible machines.
B. AI skills will be developed in a fraction of the time of human skills
Go-master Lee Sedol began serious training when he was 8 years old for 12 hours a day. In just a few days, AlphaGo reviewed over 30 million human games and played an additional 30 million practice games with itself before taking on Lee Sedol. That means AlphaGo received at least 500 times as much practice as Lee to win the competition.
C. There’s no such thing as a perfect AI solution
Researchers have had much more success tailoring individual AI systems to specific problems than building a logic machine capable of general intelligence. Just as AlphaGo could never be used to pilot a driverless car, AI algorithms are designed to work on specific problems.
D. AI is forcing us to rethink what it is that makes us human
We live in a very human-centric world. Human need is what creates our global economy. There is generally no economy for things that do not benefit humankind. But what is it that sets us apart from AI and the machines that use it? We’re still a long ways from understanding where AI capabilities end and uniquely-human skills begin.
E. As AI grows progressively ubiquitous, it’ll become increasingly invisible
AI will touch virtually every aspect of our lives, finding its way into our cars, TVs, phones, lighting, and music. With this level of ubiquity, we will quickly lose our reference points as to what life was like before AI.
F. As we become more reliant on automation we will experience a degrading of skills and readiness when things go wrong
And yes, something will always go wrong, eventually!
G. Blind faith in technology will cause blindness to danger as well
Once something works well, we begin to trust and rely on it. However, there is no perfect technology and the complexity of AI will make the true danger of hidden flaws nearly undetectable until it is too late.
H. Artificial intelligence can never achieve 100% accuracy
It may indeed be quantum leaps better than anything we’re using today, even surpassing six-sigma reliability, but 100% is still not possible.
I. The greatest dangers associated with AI will involve human failure
Sometimes the danger will stem from human ignorance, lack of oversight, or poor monitoring, but we must be constantly vigilant when it comes to spotting the purposeful failures that nefarious coders bury deep within a system.
J. Businesses that become over-reliant on AI will fail
Admittedly there is a fine line between being over-reliant and not-reliant-enough, but hard lessons will be learned by those who fail to employ the proper checks and balance systems to oversee their AI operations.
K. Human-based common sense will remain indispensable for the foreseeable future
Humans will continue to surpass machines for some time in areas like appreciating contextual nuances, weaving together disparate ideas, comprehending human motive and intent, integrating interdisciplinary conceptions of the world, and general intelligence. AI is simply not at our level yet.
L. AI will soon prove to be just as good at job creation as it is at job destruction
There are currently 1 million truck drivers in the U.S., earning on average $21 an hour. It’s hard to imagine a future where those numbers don’t dwindle. But that’s only half of the story. Properly directed, AI will be able to tell us where humans are most needed in every system, process, and business operation. But beyond that, AI will be able to roadmap emerging technologies and identify the skills needed for new positions months if not years before the openings occur.
Final Thoughts
Every new technology brings its own set of dangers, and AI is no different. However, with this level of complexity, the types of danger become exponentially more difficult to understand.
It’s important to understand the symbiotic relationship, if the human economy collapses, so will the AI economy.
While we’re not going to let the bots take over just yet, it’s clear that bots are going to be meeting many of our needs, offering proactive advice, and serving us in favorable ways. Since the best possible interfaces come from the inside out, working with AI will be far less about us trying to understand the technology and far more about technology trying to understand us.
Over the past decade, the digital revolution was about us becoming accustomed to using computers all day, sending texts, connecting with each others over social media, and even learning to code.
In the AI era, technology will slide further behind the curtain into more of an assistive role, one that is not meant to be all about shiny new gadgets and operating system updates. Over time, the gadget craze will subside, as we shift our collective attention to rethinking the human experience.

    Every year, poachers kill about 27,000 African elephants—an astounding 8 percent of the population. If current trends continue, these magnificent animals could be gone within a decade.The solution, of course, is to stop poachers before they strike, but how to do that has long confounded authorities. In protected areas like wildlife preserves, elephants and other endangered animals may roam far and wide, while rangers can patrol only a small area at any time. “It’s a two-part problem,” explains Milind Tambe, a computer scientist at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles. “Can you predict where poaching will happen? And can you [target] your patrols so that they’re unpredictable, so that the poachers don’t know the rangers are coming?”To solve both parts of the problem, Tambe and his team created an artificial-intelligence system called PAWS, which stands for Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security. A machine-learning algorithm uses data from past patrols to predict where poaching is likely to occur in the future. And a game-theory model helps generate randomized, unpredictable patrol routes. The system has been field-tested in Uganda and Malaysia with good results, and in 2018 its use will expand to China and Cambodia. In addition, Tambe says, the PAWS system could soon be integrated into an existing tracking tool called SMART, which wildlife conservation agencies have deployed at most sites worldwide to collect and manage patrol data.In a one-month trial with the Wildlife Conservation Society in Uganda’s Queen Elizabeth National Park, rangers patrolled two areas that they rarely visited but that PAWS indicated had a high probability of poaching. Much to the rangers’ surprise, they found numerous snares and other signs of illegal activity. A later 8-month trial looked at the entire park. Again, the patrols verified the model’s predictions: In the high-probability areas, they found about 10 times as much poaching as in the low-probability areas. A new trial in Uganda’s Murchison Falls National Park is checking whether PAWS will work equally well in a different location.Video: A.J.Plumptre/Wildlife Conservation SocietyAndrew Plumptre, director of science for the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Africa program, is collaborating with Tambe’s group on the Uganda field trials. He says that on normal patrols, rangers enter data about what they’re seeing, using a smartphone app called Cybertracker. About once a month, that data gets uploaded to SMART. “You’re able to map where patrols have searched, where they found snares and carcasses of elephants and whatever,” says Plumptre. “But there’s nothing proactive about it. Ranger patrols alone aren’t sufficient to stop poaching.” He’s hoping that PAWS’s predictive abilities will make those patrols as efficient and effective as possible.The PAWS system grew out of work Tambe and his students started doing more than a decade ago for port, airport, and airline security. The U.S. Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department have all deployed AI systems developed by Tambe’s group. And he cofounded Avata Intelligence, in Venice, Calif., to commercialize this research.About six or seven years ago, Tambe was at a World Bank meeting and saw a talk on the dire plight of tigers, fewer than 4,000 of which survive in the wild. “I guess I’d heard about such things, but I never appreciated the scope of the problem. I suddenly realized the potential of AI to help,” Tambe says. He quickly got in touch with conservation groups.Fei Fang, a former student of Tambe’s who is now an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon, had worked on a Coast Guard system to protect the Staten Island Ferry, in New York City, before turning to PAWS. The two scenarios are similar, she notes. “There is a defender, which is the wildlife ranger or the Coast Guard, and there is an attacker, which is a poacher or a terrorist, and they’re interacting with each other in a way that you’re trying to predict.”Predictive Patrols: Fei Fang, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon, shows off a tiger snare discovered in a wildlife preserve in northeast China. Fang and Milind Tambe of the University of Southern California developed a machine-learning algorithm to predict where poachers are most active.Photo: Yongchao JingFor the PAWS team, the field trials drove home an important reality of wilderness policing: The world is not flat. When the team began working in Malaysia, Fang says, they didn’t factor in the densely forested, mountainous terrain. “In our first model, we took a map, divided the whole area into grid cells, drew a line on the grid, and said, ‘Patrollers, please follow this line,’ ” she recalls. “We’d have Skype calls with them, and they’d tell us: ‘No, no, no, this is not going to work.’ We didn’t understand.”Only when the PAWS team visited the Malaysian reserve did they get it. “We walked the route with the rangers, and it took us about 8 hours to go a couple miles,” Fang says. A subsequent refinement of PAWS takes into account geographical features that are easy to walk on, like ridge lines, streambeds, and old logging trails. “We built a virtual street map for the conservation area and then plotted routes based on the map.” Patrollers following the new routes found “all kinds of signs of animal and human activity,” Fang says.At press time, Fang was in the midst of a three-month field trial of PAWS in northeast China with the World Wildlife Fund, where the animal of greatest concern is the Siberian tiger. Fang says one enhancement they’re working on is to help rangers make decisions while on patrol. “They may see footprints and tree marks, which indicate the direction the poachers are heading,” she says. “And they need to decide, Should I chase the poachers? What is the best strategy for changing plans if they see new information?”Tambe and Fang are also collaborating with a wildlife conservation service called Air Shepherd, which uses drones equipped with infrared cameras to search for poachers at night. Their AI-based video-analysis system is automating what is otherwise a tedious and difficult task for humans: reviewing hours and hours of grainy black-and-white footage and then alerting rangers when illegal activity is detected.The next step for PAWS is to make it available to other NGOs, ideally by integrating the algorithm into existing tools, like Cybertracker and the SMART system. “We’re probably never going to completely stop poaching,” says Plumptre. “But we can get it down to a lower level, so that populations don’t decline.”AI is usually applied to problems of modern technology, Tambe notes, but this work is different. “We’re using AI to save the natural world—these stunning landscapes and animals that we hope won’t disappear,” he says. “These are important treasures.”From Your Site ArticlesAI Is Helping to Stop Animal Poaching and Food Insecurity ›",,,,,,,,"{'@id': 'https://spectrum.ieee.org/this-ai-hunts-poachers', '@type': 'WebPage'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technological advances associated with the fourth industrial revolution – including artificial intelligence – allow the automation of an increasingly wide array of processes in increasingly interactive and sophisticated ways. These advances will likely give rise to many opportunities for economic and social development in developing countries, for instance by increasing food production.
But the new technologies also involve important risks, which have special significance in developing countries. They may build upon and exacerbate existing inequalities – both within developing countries as well as between developing and more developed regions. 
Three of these inter-related risks are worsening unemployment, increasing concentration of economic power and wealth, and the spread of biases in influential algorithms. They will manifest in different ways and require different responses in diverse contexts. A cross-cutting problem is that too few developing country governments are giving these risks serious attention.
Risk 1: Worsening unemployment
The concern that new technologies – especially artificial intelligence – will lead to widespread job losses has been widely discussed. Of course, the fear that new technologies replace workers is an old one. But it’s been pointed out that historically new technologies have often given rise to more new jobs than the ones that have been automated away. 
What’s perhaps different now is that the new, interconnected digital technologies will likely have a broader and more far-reaching array of abilities. And so the prospect of new kinds of jobs may well be diminished or limited to increasingly sophisticated domains, such as machine learning. 
In addition, new technologies are now not just replacing jobs, but they are also enabling the disruption and restructuring of entire industries. For instance, Uber has already pulled the rug from underneath the conventional taxi industry in many places. Imagine the possible consequences of Uber’s shift to driver-less cars.
Lower labour costs in many developing countries mean that investments in job replacing technologies will be lower. But other aspects of developing countries’ contexts increase the possible severity of this risk. 
First, the dearth of effective education systems and skills in countries like South Africa will make it more difficult for people to be retrained for the  technology intensive new jobs that will become available. Secondly, all governments are struggling to grapple with the implications of new technologies and associated new business models. This struggle is particularly strong in developing country governments. The case of Uber in South Africa reflects this.
Risk 2: Increasing concentration of wealth
Many developing countries are characterised by high levels of inequality within their populations. Elites within these countries will be more likely to make use of AI and other new technologies. This will further increase returns to capital widening the gap between elites’ productive capacity and that of everyone else. 
A similar effect is likely at a global level. It’s no coincidence that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has identified AI as the new terrain for global competition between nations.
New technologies’ advantages for capital are not just due to increasing productivity, but also because they allow new business models that may control or even dominate entire sub-sectors and stifle competition. For instance, it could become possible for a single company to control large fleets of automated vehicles in one or more large areas.
Again, much will depend on whether states can keep up with these developments and respond effectively. Particular attention will need to be paid to intellectual property and competition law. For instance, the strict enforcement of intellectual property rights for AI algorithms may well support increasing economic concentration. It’s also likely that national governments may have less and less influence over such decisions and trends. Even so, many developing country governments are not giving these developments their due attention.
Risk 3: Bias baked into algorithms
Finally, the AI algorithms that are at the centre of the fourth industrial revolution will reflect and perpetuate the contexts and biases of those that create them. Difficulties faced by voice recognition software in recognising particular accents are a relatively innocuous example. Of course, the promise is that AI will enable such systems to learn to address such issues. But the learning process itself might be influenced by racial, gender, or other prejudices. 
AI algorithms are developed almost entirely in developed regions. Thus they may not sufficiently reflect the contexts and priorities of developing countries. Ensuring that AI algorithms are appropriately trained and adapted in different contexts is part of the required response. It would be even better if developing countries become more engaged in the development of new technological systems from the get-go.
Governments need to act
These three risks require that academics, businesses, and civil society actors attend to the role of new technologies in developing countries. But a special responsibility lies with governments. For the most part, they seem to be distracted. 
Governments ought to carefully assess the above risks in their national context and then establish corresponding policies and programs. This includes national skills development and work placement platforms, intellectual property and competition policies, and local technology adaptation and development.

Fears of the rise of robots swooping in to steal jobs abound, stoked by the confluence of artificial intelligence, machine learning and other technologies that automate routine tasks traditionally performed by humans. The reality is that job replacement will happen more gradually than the media headlines suggest, and eventually AI will create more jobs than it eliminates, say Gartner researchers.
“I try to step back and wait for the boomerang because there always will be one,” says Gartner analyst Craig Roth, of the hype surrounding job cannibalization via automation. “Once it goes too far to one side, people wake up and realize, ‘you know, maybe it’s not that bad.'”
Make no mistake, AI and robotics will have a profound impact on the job market long term. As many as 39 to 73 million jobs will be usurped by automation, according to research McKinsey Global Institute released in November. Yet the consultancy also says that workers will perform new tasks or reskill as tasks become automated, leading to millions of new jobs. Gartner estimates that by 2020 AI will create more jobs than it eliminates — 2.3 million to 1.8 million. By 2025, job creation related to AI will top 2 million net-new jobs, including new positions of highly skilled, management and even the entry-level and low-skilled variety, Gartner says.

Such statistics contradict the panic-inducing headlines that millions of jobs will evaporate. One reason for this is that people tend to conflate job automation with automation of certain tasks, which is a much more accurate snapshot of the current corporate climate, Roth says. In other words, robots and other machines aren’t replacing humans outright, but sharing the workload.

Robots and humans making pizza together
Take a pizza business that employs robots to work alongside humans. Maybe the robots perform roughly 10 of 20 tasks it takes to build, bake and deliver a pizza, says Roth. In fact, such a business already exists in Zume Pizza, a Mountain View, Calif.-based startup that uses several robots to help humans assemble and bake pizzas. 
Humans prepare and divide the pizza dough, put it into a dough press and then onto a moving assembly line. When orders come in, one robot applies sauce and another spreads the sauce before handing it off to a human to smooth out imperfections, says Zume CTO Josh Goldberg. The human worker then adds cheese and toppings, which requires fine-motor skills robots are, for now, largely incapable of. “Humans do it today because it’s a pretty highly skilled thing to do,” Goldberg says.











 
 
 
Another robot takes the finished pie and places it into a par-bake oven, which heats the pizza at 800 degrees to kill the active yeast in the dough before transferring it to trucks, Goldberg says. Beyond saving humans from burns, Zume’s value proposition is fresh, farm-to-oven ingredients and speed. Zume is using trucks equipped with “bake-on-the-way” technology that begins cooking pies shortly after they are ordered; the average delivery time is around 22 minutes. 
Zume uses optical targeting and computer vision technology to inform the automation for the base robots, which are made by ABB, and has developed custom tooling to enable the robot’s manual operations. Roth says Zume offers a glimpse of the human-machine labor division typical today.
What the future of AI means for work
You can think of AI, robotics and even robotic process automation (RPA) as endowing humans with certain “superpowers,” enabling them to get more tasks accomplished in less time, Roth says. Gartner calls this “AI augmentation,” and posits that one in five workers engaged in mostly non-routine tasks will rely on AI to do a job by 2022.











 
 
 
The growing application of AI technology to automate tasks also means IT leaders must take into consideration what jobs will be lost, what jobs will be created, and how staff will collaborate and get work done. CIOs may have to reskill employees and reposition them for other services that provide greater value for customers, Roth says. Ultimately, CIOs must prepare their organizations for an automation boom that will trigger significant, though hard to quantify, changes.

Ask




To that end, Roth advises:

Avoid hype. Don’t get distracted by shiny new AI technologies or dread-inspiring headlines that say robots are taking over the world.
Watch what you say. When talking about the automation capabilities of a certain technology, don’t hammer home the fact that it could lead to headcount reduction. Maintaining a low-key, sober approach is crucial in conversations with employees. You don’t need to incite a panic.
Keep societal impacts out of the equation. Consider how AI and other automation capabilities can fortify the business and drive competitive advantage, but don’t worry about the societal impact these technologies portend. Figuring out the right technology decisions for the business is hard enough without falling into a moral quandary. That’s for academics to worry about, Roth says.
Approach AI lightly. Given their disruptive potential, don’t rush into AI and automation.
Avoid the “nuclear AI” problem. Another reason to proceed with caution is the potential for something to go awry, leading to a public relations disaster that sets the AI and automation markets back years. For example, Microsoft didn’t do the AI software sector any favors when it’s chatbot Tay unleashed racist, sexist and other incendiary comments on social media. One possible scenario: What if a self-driving delivery car operated by Zume Pizza gets into a serious car accident? “There’s a risk that some employers make stupid decisions about AI that could cause a backlash,” Roth says. “There are so many opportunities for that to happen.”

Bottom line: “If [CIOs] can sprinkle [AI and automation] in lightly and in a humanistic way over time, that will do a lot more for society than trying to solve the challenge at the societal level,” Roth says. “And if a CEO or CIO could convince their peers to follow suit, that will have the most impact.”

Your iPhone 6 now sleeps in your closet. But…what if you can upcycle it by combining it with AI?At the workshop held in Waag Society on December 7th 2017, we did an ideation session to “phonvert” retired smartphones with AI.What is “phonvert”?The word “phonvert” is a made-up word that combines phone and convert. As big corporations create new models of smartphones each year, many capable yet less desirable retired smartphones pile up.IDC estimates that of the 1.4 billion smartphones sold in 2015, more than 280 million working smartphones were replaced without being recycled.While many of these still work and have usable sensors, most of them remain unused or worse yet, end up in landfills.Through spreading the word, project phonvert is building a movement and a community that is dedicated to finding alternative usages for old phones.From a microscope for smart diagnostics in Uganda to an earthquake monitor in Japan, new ways of phonverting are being developed around the world.This project was acclaimed internationally and was exhibited at Design of the Year 2016 at the London Design Museum.Workshop to uncover the potential of AI running on old phones.In the workshop, we explored the potential of combing retired smartphones with image recognition system that can see and identify objects, powered by Google Cloud Vision.Each group worked with an old smartphone with an application which data from multiple sensors were visible. To demonstrate the potential of image recognition, we used the Thing translator by Dan Motzenbecker.It detected a bottle in less than 3 secondWe also had badges for the sensor data and the things that can be detected. At each session the participants drew random contexts cards to decide on which social context they would phonvert in. The context card ranged from developing countries to government and politics.phonvert workshop toolkitPeek into a world where things understand usThe ideas that came from the workshop went beyond the idea of repurposing retired smartphones. It made us realize we are entering an age where intelligent cameras recognize the world like we do.These intelligent cameras on small devices brings in a new power balance into our society. One idea that came from the participants illustrated this problem clearly.Pet detector across the cityAccording to the participant, this is a lost pet finder. By feeding several pictures of your pet animal to the system, it detects where your pet is through the eyes of the smartphones attached across the city.At a glance this is a funny innocent idea. However when you consider that this can also be used to track people, it opens up a lot of other questions.Visual recognition system everywhere soon.When a system that can do complex image recognition is in the hands of everyone, what could happen?Since most of the image recognition system work cloud-based, we found out that it works perfectly on a 5-year-old android smartphone as long as it has the latest version of Google Chrome.Google has just released their AIY toolkit for makers to tinker with visual recognition system. I expect in a year or two the world will be filled with apps and devices that use it. This could mean “big brothers” everywhere that perform actions based on what it recognizes.Peaceful protest measuring systemSome dystopian ideas by the participant — a protest sensor. This read the emotions and texts in the protest to measure their violence level to be used to ensure a “peaceful protest”.What are your ideas? Share them with us.Overall, the workshop was a huge success where we collectively tried to figure out what is possible with AI on retired smartphones. We also had an interesting debate over ethical concerns surrounding it.Thanks for joining the workshop!Project phonvert will continue to develop this workshop further, so anybody who is interested in joining/hosting this workshop please feel free to contact me through here.",,,,['Tomo Kihara'],,2018-01-02T15:20:43.731Z,d9f22776df85,https://becominghuman.ai/phonvert-repurposing-retired-smartphones-with-ai-d9f22776df85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It predicted Beijing would take the lead thanks to the ""insurmountable"" advantage of offering its companies more flexibility in how they use data about its citizens.Theresa May is expected to meet US President Donald Trump at the Davos event on Thursday.'Unthinkable advances'The prime minister based the UK's claim to leadership in part on the health of its start-up economy, quoting a figure that a new AI-related company has been created in the country every week for the last three years.In addition, she said the UK is recognised as first in the world for its preparedness to ""bring artificial intelligence into government"".Getty ImagesDeepMind's game-playing AI experiments are among the UK's highest profile success storiesHowever, she recognised that many people have concerns about potential job losses and other impacts of the tech, and declared that AI poses one of the ""greatest tests of leadership for our time"".""But it is a test that I am confident we can meet,"" she added. ""For right across the long sweep of history from the invention of electricity to advent of factory production, time and again initially disquieting innovations have delivered previously unthinkable advances and we have found the way to make those changes work for all our people,"" Mrs May said.This includes through a new UK advisory body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation.Academics and tech industry leaders differ in opinion about the risks involved.At one end of the scale, Prof Stephen Hawking has warned that AI could ""spell the end of the human race"", while Tesla's Elon Musk has said that a universal basic income - in which people get paid whether or not they work - has a ""good chance"" of becoming necessary as jobs become increasingly automated.Getty ImagesFacebook's AI chief has played down the risk of robots destroying humanityBut Facebook's AI chief Yann LeCun has said society will develop the ""checks and balances"" to prevent a Terminator movie-like apocalypse ever coming to pass.And earlier this week, Google's former chief Eric Schmidt told the BBC he did not believe predictions of mass job losses would occur.""There will be some jobs eliminated but the vast majority will be augmented,"" he explained.""You're going to have more doctors not fewer. More lawyers not fewer. More teachers not fewer.""But they are going to be more efficient.""Eric Schmidt thinks AI will enhance jobs rather than destroy them en masseWhile many tech industry leaders acknowledge there will be a need for new rules and regulations, they also suggest it may be premature to introduce them in the short term.Microsoft, for example, has launched a book called The Future Computed to coincide with the Davos event.It proposes that it be given time to develop rules to govern its own AI work internally before legislation is passed.Analysis: AmazonMuch of the AI research involved in developing Amazon's Alexa voice assistant was done in the UKBy Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondentIs the UK really on track to lead the world in Artificial Intelligence?Well the United States and China might have a thing or two to say about that.Both are engaged in an AI arms race and are investing the kind of sums that would make Chancellor Philip Hammond's - or even Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's - eyes water. Still, it is true that in London and Cambridge some of the world's leading AI scientists are at work. It was here that the Alexa digital voice assistant was developed and where a computer was trained to defeat champion players of the Chinese game of Go.The trouble is that those scientists were employed by Amazon and by Google, which brought up the DeepMind AI business when it was still in its infancy. That's a pattern frequently repeated in the UK technology sector. A Chinese AI investor on a trip to the UK this week expressed surprise that the government had not done more to protect these AI assets. Now there is to be another AI body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, joining in a global conversation about the moral challenges posed by AI.

But successfully putting AI into action isn't exactly a walk in the park -- it requires a fundamental rethinking of the business. The pressure is on -- 53 percent of executives responding to a recent survey said their industry has ""already experienced disruption"" due to AI. An example that applies to potential AI-driven disruption in the retail sector is Amazon's Go store in Seattle, which employs AI to operate with no checkout clerks or lines -- purchases are tracked as shoppers remove items from the shelves.








Building from the inside out with AI

Along with signaling disruption, a recent survey of 1,000 business and IT leaders commissioned by Infosys which finds AI -- as we know it today -- has moved beyond the experimentation stage, and is delivering real benefits. The vast majority of the executives surveyed, 86 percent, say their organizations surveyed have ""middle"" or ""late-stage"" AI deployments, and view AI as a major facilitator of future business operations. In addition, 73 percent agreed or strongly agreed that their AI deployments have already transformed the way they do business, and 90 percent of C-level executives reported measurable benefits from AI within their organizations.
Believe it or not, AI is more than just automation. While a majority of organizations in the survey, 66 percent, start off using AI to automate routine or inefficient processes, it becomes a factor in innovation and differentiation as time goes on and experience is gained. For example, 80 percent of IT decision makers at organizations in later stages of AI deployment reported that they are using AI to augment existing solutions, or build new business-critical solutions and services to optimize insights and the consumer experience. The same percentage of C-level executives said their future business strategy ""will be informed through opportunities made available with AI technology."" Another 42 percent also expect significant impact in research and development in the next five years.
PROMOTED
As Mohit Joshi, president of Infosys, puts it in the forward to the report: ""So far, the arc of AI leans toward empowerment and giving humans the tools necessary to automate redundant tasks, detect and analyze hidden patterns in data and generally make possible revolutionary insights that will make our lives better.""
As mentioned above, AI is already becoming a disruptive force. Two-thirds of executives in the telecom sector say AI is disrupting their industry, along with 63 percent of banking and insurance executives. A majority of retailers, 54%, also are feeling the impact. (Amazon Go, mentioned above, is just one example.) The only industry not feeling the heat from AI is public sector or governmental organizations.
If AI is a disruptive force, it will act as any disruptive force will, and threaten the very existence of companies that don't keep up with more nimble competitors.  By extension, yes, it is a job-killer. However, at the same time, it opens up new opportunities for forward-looking companies and startups -- and all the employees they hire -- to adopt new ways of thinking, new ways to better meet the needs of customers -- rapidly and assuredly.

Incredibly enough, a majority of enterprises appear to be taking actions to assure their employees' job futures as AI takes hold across basic decision-making functions. No less than 53 percent of respondents report their organizations have increased training in the job functions most affected by AI deployments. Even more are sympathetic and optimistic that AI will enrich, not replace, jobs. Seventy-seven percent were confident that employees in their organizations could be trained for the new job roles AI technologies will create.
Ironically, it is the implementors of AI, the IT departments, who are seeing AI impinging the most upon their jobs.  IT (61 percent) will continue to be the most affected job function over the next five years, as indicated by 61 percent. However, AI is beginning to have a growing impact on marketing and communications (32 percent), human resources (29 percent) and legal departments (15 percent) as well. AI leaders will become fixtures in the C-suite and throughout the organization as an overwhelming majority (95 percent) of IT decision makers from organizations in the late stages of digital transformation said that their organization plans to have a dedicated team of AI professionals.
Business leaders are optimistic that AI technologies will ultimately create more opportunity for employees than they will eliminate, with C-level executives widely agreeing that AI technologies will have a positive effect on their workforce (70%) and equally benefit customers (45 percent) and employees (43 percent).
Sixty-nine percent of C-level executives reported that employees within their organization are concerned AI technologies will replace them. However, 48 percent believe AI has augmented human skills to make their people better at their work, and 45 percent said AI is freeing up employees' time for higher value work.
A majority of business leaders, 80 percent, were confident that their executive teams have the ability to adapt their leadership skills as AI technologies are adopted. Executive training is still called for, with three-fourths of IT decision makers felt that their executives would benefit from formal training on the implications of AI technologies.
Alain Dehaze, CEO of The Adecco Group, a global staffing company, prefers to call AI ""augmented intelligence,"" noting that once blended with human input, will bring about ""a deeper focus on innately human skills – critical thinking, emotional intelligence and value judgments. In the platform economy, technology is connecting people of all backgrounds and abilities with more opportunities. It is also accelerating the employment of both skilled and unskilled workers in the era of digital transformation, making the world work for everyone.""
What stands in the way of this glorious future of AI-driven organizations? Data, or not the right kind of data. Nearly half of IT decision makers (49 percent) reported that their organization is unable to deploy the AI technologies they want because their data is not ready to support the requirements of AI technologies. The opaqueness of AI's internal processes also bothers executives, and a majority of executives, 52 percent, worry about losing transparency into their business.Joe McKendrickFollowingFollowI am an author, independent researcher and speaker exploring innovation, information technology trends and markets.

Pressure for using AI responsibly won’t be on tech companies alone. Invasion of privacy, algorithmic bias, environmental damage, threats to brands and the bottom line — the fears around AI are numerous. Fortunately, a global consensus is emerging around what constitutes responsible AI. These principles can safeguard organizations — and position them to reap economic benefits. Public- and private-sector institutions are likely to collaborate on AI’s societal impact, and collaboration among businesses in self-regulatory organizations may also take root.

AI will hit employers before it affects employment. AI probably won’t devastate the job market in the long run — and it certainly won’t do so in 2018. But it will change the nature of work. Job losses in certain industries, especially in roles with manual and repetitive tasks, will be offset by new jobs that are performed by centaurs: human–machine hybrids. To prepare, businesses will need to bring together teams and data from different disciplines, and many organizations will also need to start retooling.

AI will ramp up its presence in the workplace. AI is already automating increasingly complex processes, identifying trends to create business value, and providing forward-looking intelligence. The result? Less busywork for humans and better strategic decisions. Organizations will want to home in on specific problems they can solve with AI as well as consider new measures to assess business value.

AI will help answer the big ROI question about data. Many investments in data technology and integration have failed to answer the big question: What’s the return on investment for big data initiatives? However, with data now being used to solve specific business problems, AI solutions that draw more heavily on data will become easier to develop and fund. The catch? Some organizations are still struggling with data fundamentals. This year, businesses need to finally get their data infrastructure in order.

Technologists alone won’t decide the AI talent race. There’s a bidding war right now for computer scientists, but they won’t be the deciding factor in AI success. Companies will face an increasing need for domain experts: retail analysts, engineers, accountants, and others who know how to prepare and contextualize data, and who can work with AI and AI experts. Organizations will need to find ways to train these employees in the specific data skills they need.

Because of AI, cyberattacks will be more damaging — and cyberdefense will be more effective. Techniques such as advanced machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks enable computers to find and interpret patterns. They can also allow hackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities. If an organization’s IT department or cybersecurity provider isn’t already using AI, it has to start thinking immediately about AI’s short- and long-term security applications. Cyberdefense may be the portal through which many enterprises get their first taste of AI.

Opening AI’s black box will become a priority. Users may not trust AI if they can’t understand how it makes decisions. Companies will face growing pressure from end users, clients, and regulators to deploy AI that is explainable, transparent, and provable. However, documenting and explaining every step makes the process slower and more expensive. Companies will need a framework to assess concerns around business, performance, regulatory, and reputation to determine how much information each AI application should produce about its decisions.

Nations will spar over AI. Countries, not just companies, are competing on AI, with many governments working to make sure their countries lay claim to a big piece of the pie. China is investing especially heavily and may soon take the lead. Canada, Japan, the U.K., Germany, and the UAE are also moving fast. In some areas, international collaboration is on the horizon. Companies will need to keep an eye on the international competition, and governments will need to increase funding.

Work, speaking on the Center for a New American Security’s Brussel Sprouts podcast on Jan. 9, explained that while the acquisition hierarchy within the Pentagon is changing, thinking within the department regarding the Third Offset remains consistent with his original vision. The Third Offset was a plan, led by Work, to address the erosion of the U.S. military’s technological superiority and focused on technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and data analytics. “You are going to see the strategic capabilities office continue, DIUx continue … I believe we are going to see an AI Center of Excellence, or something like that,” Work said. Such a center would help the department cement relationships with research universities, laboratories, and the commercial sector that are driving technological innovation in AI. According to Work, “the DOD already has over 100 different relationships with universities, there are University Affiliated Research Centers, like Johns Hopkins applied physics lab and Lincoln Labs.” By tapping into these talent sources, Work said he hopes the United States will be able to be a leader in AI innovation and autonomous technology. The former deputy secretary warned his successors that, “if you cannot tap into [those sources], then there is no way you’re going to be the fast leader you need to be in this very competitive environment. There are going to be lots of fast followers because this stuff is going to be available to anybody because it is primarily commercial so you want to be the fast leader and have people responding to you rather than reacting to them.” Work has previously explained his vision for AI and autonomous technology as being more like Iron Man than the Terminator, but also discussed innovative ways AI can be used to strengthen the NATO alliance.Because AI and other methods of algorithmic warfare are much less expensive than conventional weapon systems, “even the smallest country can add a lot of value to [a potential] NATO operational fires network because [they] have this algorithm that will make the communications go faster and will change automatically security levels and change automatically English to French and French to German. So I think it’s an extremely alliance friendly offset strategy and hopefully we’ll start talking and seeing some real meat on the bones in NATO.”About  Daniel CebulDaniel Cebul is an editorial fellow and general assignments writer for Defense News, C4ISRNET, Fifth Domain and Federal Times.Share:More In Intel/GEOINTSouth Korea to deploy laser weapons to intercept North Korean dronesThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration said it will deploy at least one anti-air laser weapons system — called “Block-I” — this year.US to send Tomahawks, hypersonics, other long-range fires to GermanyThe move is in-line with the Army's plan to provide such capability to its Multidomain Task Force there.Beavers takes reins from Sherman as acting DOD information officerAs the most senior IT advisor to the secretary of defense, Beavers is taking over from former CIO John Sherman.Quieting Discord: A new frontier in military leaks and extremismFrom secret Pentagon leaks to radicalization in the military community, Discord is continuing to grapple with keeping bad actors off the popular platform.Astronauts say Boeing space capsule can safely return them to EarthNASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Starliner capsule early last month.",,,,,,,,"{'type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.c4isrnet.com/intel-geoint/2018/01/23/bob-work-has-an-idea-to-improve-artificial-intelligence/'}",,,,,,,,/resources/img/c4isrnet-logo-white.png,https://www.c4isrnet.com/#publisher,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/C4ISRNet', 'https://twitter.com/c4isrnet']",,https://www.c4isrnet.com/intel-geoint/2018/01/23/bob-work-has-an-idea-to-improve-artificial-intelligence/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Professor Lee Cronin, from the University of Glasgow, recently visited Imperial to present some of his new multidisciplinary 'chemputing' research.
Professor Cronin’s exciting, popular and somewhat controversial talk was the latest in the 2017–18 Highlight Seminar Series from Institute for Molecular Science and Engineering (IMSE). Through this series, the Institute brings eminent speakers to Imperial to discuss cutting-edge work that spans the interface between molecular science and engineering.



Every chemist needs to become an engineer, and every engineer needs to become a chemist.
– Professor Lee Cronin
University of Glasgow Regius Chair of Chemistry




As a pioneer in the so-called chemputing space, Professor Cronin has many ambitious goals. Most formidable, perhaps, is his quest to create artificial life in the laboratory. In this IMSE Highlight Seminar, however, he focused on two different aspects of his work: artificial-intelligence-driven synthesis and the digitisation of chemistry.
Professor Cronin sees the lack of reproducibility in chemical synthesis as one of the major problems in chemistry. Given the modern digital tools available to researchers, however, he believes that this is something that should – and can – change.
3D-printing chemistry
Professor Cronin and his collaborators have thus been working to devise new methods – combining computer programing and 3D printing technologies – to increase the universality of chemical synthesis processes. The value of 3D printing – also known as additive manufacturing – is already widely recognised, especially in the aerospace, medical device and automotive industries. In his work, however, Professor Cronin, is using these modern printing techniques in an innovative, non-standard way to do chemistry.

By combining aspects of chemistry and chemical engineering, Professor Cronin’s group have already developed a methodology for autonomous 3D printing of ibuprofen. To do this, they use process-control software to fabricate the reactionware, as well as a computer script that prescribes the chemical processing and synthesis steps. 
More recently, in brand-new work published in Science, Professor Cronin and his co-authors have successfully demonstrated their digital chemistry methods for relatively complex chemical synthesis schemes. Looking to the future, this kind of approach could allow specific chemicals to be fabricated, in a simple and cheap manner, by the masses – thus adding a certain level of resilience to the pharmaceutical industry, for example.
Marrying artificial intelligence and chemistry
In the second part of his talk, Professor Cronin spoke about another strand of his research – that of discovery. In particular, Professor Cronin is driven to explore chemical space, in an unbiased way, to find truly novel molecules.




Professor Lee Cronin




For example, he and his team have recently published work in which they used a robot equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) to autonomously create a range of oil-in-water droplets and to evaluate their behaviour with image recognition methods. As the behaviour of the droplets is sensitive to the precise formulation of the oil and water mixtures, the observation of unpredictable, yet desirable properties can lead to the discovery of novel and useful compositions. Furthermore, as the whole system is digitised, it is simple to manufacture the oil-in-water droplets, with exactly the same optimised properties, again and again.
“This work is particularly exciting because it shows we can use machine learning and a novel robotic platform to understand a system in a way that cannot be achieved with conventional laboratory methods”, explained Professor Cronin.
Going forward
Ideally, Professor Cronin would love to create a capable system where he can “let the robot do all the hard work, and leave me with time to think up new ideas”. He is also excited about using AI to help chemists explore new molecules, and sees the Dial-A-Molecule EPSRC Grand Challenge Network at Imperial as a natural place to collaborate. Ultimately, it is his aim to make cheap hardware and software for discovery and synthetic chemistry accessible to everyone.
Upcoming IMSE seminars
IMSE’s Highlight Seminar Series will continue on 22 February 2018 when Professor Jas Pal Badyal FRS (Durham University) will speak on ‘Functional nanocoatings for technological and societal applications’. The full Series is available here.

“I can’t help you with that right now. But I am always learning”
My family has a digital assistant working in our home that is incredibly smart, never takes a break, and never complains about its job. Recently, we purchased a Google Home mini to integrate with other smart products in our home, and my family has found some fun ways to use it, especially with our toddler.
My son is learning different animal sounds, and his favorite sound to make is “moo.” We discovered that our Google Home will make animal noises on command, and he loves to hear its sounds. A few weeks back, we asked our Google Home to make a number of different animal sounds, and it’s response to one that it couldn’t find struck me. “I can’t help you with that right now. But I am always learning.”
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging field of technology defined as non-biological intelligence, where a machine is programmed to accomplish complex goals. Popularly known examples are Google Home, Apple’s Siri, and Amazon’s Alexa. But there are far more advanced AI systems than these being used in a variety of applications, such as business, medicine, and finance.
Recently, a set of videos went viral on the internet from Google’s DeepMind and Boston Dynamics. These AI based systems were doing things that astonished most viewers and even many in the AI field. From an AI teaching itself how to walk and jump without human intervention to a humanoid robot doing back flips and crossing rough terrain, AI systems have become so advanced that many are starting to wonder what these systems will be able to accomplish in the future as they become smarter and human intervention becomes less necessary. This is not a sci-fi fantasy. It’s reality.
Not just fun and games
The term “artificial intelligence” was coined in the 1956 by John McCarthy, who is considered the father of AI. That year he organized the “The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence,” which was a gathering of experts for brainstorming about the reality of AI. In the last few years, the complexity of these systems has grown faster than most believed possible.
Google’s DeepMind created an AI system called AlphaGo that recently dethroned the reigning Go champion. Go is an ancient abstract strategy board game that is played on 19×19 inch board with black and white stones. The game was created over 2,500 years ago in China and is still played by over 40 million people in 75 different countries. The game is extremely complex even though it has very simple rules. It is believed that there are at least 2 x 10170² possible moves on the game board which leads most players to use their intuition rather than rote memory to win the game.
Prior AI was developed using “expert systems” that had not been able to take on a challenge like the game of Go based on complexity. These systems dealt with facts rather than ideas. Examples are IBM’s Watson and Deep Blue that played chess. They became “experts” for a given problem but were not able to transcend the task they were designed to accomplish, meaning they could not be applied to other tasks.
The AlphaGo project was formed by Google’s DeepMind around 2014 to research the ability of AI systems to use “deep neural networks” for learning rather than expert systems. This type of machine learning was new to the AI field because it was programmed to function similar to a human brain. In March 2016, AlphaGo beat world champion Lee Sedol 4 to 1 in a 5-game match. AlphaGo surpassed all expectations for AI systems and helped show what the future of AI might hold. The possibilities are seemingly limitless for what AI is able to learn to do.
AI and work?
We might be tempted to think that AI systems are sci-fi fun and games, but AI is so much more. One example is how AI systems are revolutionizing our workforce through various types of automation and data processing that leads many AI researchers, government heads, and industry leaders to question how we have thought about the workforce and the role of computer systems. Many jobs previously thought untouchable by machines are now on the brink of being augmented by or replaced completely by AI in the near future.
AI systems are being used to supplement, and in many cases, take over entire factories. An AI system is able to do the jobs of thousands of factory workers while working 24/7 without breaks. These systems are often overseen by a single operator and a few human workers that clean up after the robots. These AI-based factories are producing higher quality products at rates that far exceed that of their human counterparts and are doing all of this cheaper, making the company more money. Many people have been put out of work because of these advanced systems, and the rate of job replacement is projected to continue exponentially as AI continues to learn and grow ever more complex.
Many researchers and developers now proclaim that we have entered the “second machine age” where machines can rival their human counterparts in many areas never thought possible.

The church must be proactive in learning about Artificial Intelligence, as well as participating in the larger discussion about the future of AI research and development.

Expendable humanity?
While a complete AI takeover of society is not imminent, it is very likely that within the next 20-50 years we will see society completely revolutionized by these systems. From the workforce to healthcare and art, the influence of AI is growing at an exponential rate. The church must be proactive in learning about Artificial Intelligence, as well as participating in the larger discussion about the future of AI research and development.
Large groups of AI researchers and technology giants are now gathering to discuss AI safety research and how we want to implement this technology in the future. Most of these discussions revolve around the concept of human dignity in light of the rise of stronger AI systems. Topics range from upgrading humanity with machine components allowing us to live longer or perform tasks outside of basic human ability and strength, to how an AI system is to be treated by society as these systems are beginning to function more autonomously. What role should AI systems have in government, military, and business applications? Do AI systems live under the same type of morality code that we as humans have as a society? Should these machines be treated similar to humans with basic rights if they are able to outperform humans in many tasks or surpass human knowledge?
The church has the ability to be a part of these discussions much earlier than most ethical issues that we have faced in the past, such as the horror of abortion. In the 1970s, many evangelicals did not speak out against abortion and its legalization, yet now are boldly advocating for pro-life legislation and caring for women in crisis pregnancy situations. Today, instead of being reactive to technological trends, we should seek to be proactive in these discussions, proclaiming that human dignity is not based on what we do but on who we are as created in the image of God. AI systems and machines might one day outperform us in every type of task and maybe even replace us in the workplace, but they will never have a soul and will never be able overtake their creators in terms of dignity and worth.
AI is always learning, the question is, how will we respond?

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is transforming practically every human activity: the way we make things; the way we use the resources of our planet; the way we communicate and interact with each other as humans; the way we learn; the way we work; the way we govern; and the way we do business. Its scope, speed and reach are unprecedented. Think of it: Just 10 years ago, there was no such thing as a smartphone. Today, no one leaves home without it. Just a few decades ago, the internet connected computers at just a few sites. Today, practically every human being can connect to a network that spans the entire globe and provides access to the greatest repository of information and knowledge ever created by humankind. Enormous power entails enormous risk. Yes, the stakes are high. If we get the revolution right, digitalization will benefit the nearly 10 billion humans inhabiting our planet in the year 2050. If we get it wrong, societies will be divided into winners and losers, social unrest and anarchy will arise, the glue that holds societies and communities together will disintegrate, and citizens will no longer believe that governments are able to fulfill their purpose of enforcing the rule of law and providing security. That's why the Fourth Industrial Revolution is not just about technology or business; it's about society. It is fascinating when a computer beats the best human GO player, when bots write texts, and machines ""talk"" to each other. Nevertheless, we humans define the algorithms that govern machines and not the other way around. And make no mistake about it: we are now writing the code that will shape our collective future. That's happening in manufacturing right now. What we call Industrie 4.0 enables manufacturers to create a ""digital twin"" of the entire manufacturing environment – from lab to factory floor, from showroom to service. Manufacturers can design, simulate, and test sophisticated products in the virtual domain before making the first physical prototype, before setting up production lines, and before starting actual production. Software helps optimize every process and every task, whether performed by humans or machines. Once everything works in the virtual world, the results are transferred to the physical world, the machines, and they close the loop by reporting back to the virtual world. This seamless integration of the virtual and the physical worlds in so-called cyber-physical systems – that is the giant leap we see today. It eclipses everything that has happened in industry so far. As in previous industrial revolutions but on a much larger scale, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will eliminate millions of jobs and create millions of new jobs. And because manufacturing accounts for 70% of global trade, this really is about ""the wealth of nations"", to quote Adam Smith. That raises the question: what can we do to make sure as many citizens as possible benefit from the Fourth Industrial Revolution? First, we can learn from the past and lay the conceptual foundation for an inclusive society. In the middle of the 20th century, thought leaders such as the economist Alfred Müller-Armack developed the so-called social market economy, Germany's model of success to this day. He envisioned an open society that aims to ""unite the principle of the free market with that of the fair distribution of prosperity"". This vision is more relevant today than ever before because it points the way to an inclusive form of capitalism and to a sustainable model of economic and social well-being. I believe that the next step on the path to inclusiveness is to significantly raise standards for business as far as social responsibility and sustainability are concerned. Contrary to Milton Friedman's maxim, the business of business should not just be business. Shareholder value alone should not be the yardstick. Instead, we should make stakeholder value, or better yet, social value, the benchmark for a company’s performance. Today, stakeholders – customers, shareholders, suppliers, employees, political leaders, society as a whole – rightfully expect companies to assume greater social responsibility, for example, by protecting the climate, fighting for social justice, aiding refugees, and training and educating workers. The business of business should be to create value for society. At Siemens, we call this ""business to society"".Second, because the Fourth Industrial Revolution runs on knowledge, we need a concurrent revolution in training and education. Here, both government and business must join forces to provide workers with the skills and qualifications they need to participate in the digital economy, for instance, by being able to tap the opportunities created by artificial intelligence. If the workforce doesn't keep up with advances in knowledge throughout their lives, how will the millions of new jobs be filled?Third, we must encourage innovation and the ability to adapt. Digitalization has demonstrated its disruptive power in the past; it has turned entire industries upside down. You know the saying, ""The internet cuts out the middleman"". Digital technologies enable completely new business models – and now we see that they enable new social models. One of these is the sharing economy. It challenges one of the fundamental precepts of our economic order: the prominent role of property. Whether you consider this good or bad, it’s reality. Fourth, as leaders we must summon the courage to address the tough questions. And there are plenty of them. How can we secure the future of those whose jobs will be eliminated by machines? Do we need a guaranteed basic income? Should we impose taxes on software and robots? Do companies that provide global IT platforms have to comply with national rules and regulations? If so, how can they be enforced? What freedoms and rights should individuals have in the digital age?These are the tough questions we face today. And I don't think longing for the alleged ""good old days"" will yield good answers. In his book ""Retrotopia"", the Polish sociologist and philosopher Zygmunt Bauman maintains that many have lost all faith in the idea of building a future society and turn to the ideas of the past, buried but not dead. Instead, we should look forward, point out both the opportunities and risks of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and then roll up our sleeves and create answers that really work for us and future generations.

By all accounts, the store is a technological marvel: Instead of checking out, shoppers check in with their cell phones at a series of gates that resemble those used for subways. When they're finished, shoppers exit through the same gates without the need to pull out a credit card or cash. Instead, the items are simply charged to the shopper's Amazon account. The ease of one-click-purchasing brought to a bricks-and-mortars experience, thanks to sensors and artificial intelligence systems powering the store.For some, this represents a fun technological novelty offering more convenience for busy professionals. For others, it is symbol of dire concern: the rise of smarter machines that will bring about mass unemployment. Will the technology that powers Amazon Go lead to 3.5 million cashiers to lose their jobs?By now, it is almost routine to see columns sounding the alarm about millions of existing jobs at risk of being automated. However, the real risk is that we do not have a system ready to equip people with the skills needed to fill millions of new and modified jobs that will result from the rise of AI.AI is going to change the labor market in three important ways. First, automation will erode jobs further up the skills ladder. For example, Enlitic uses AI to analyze medical images such as with CT scans. In a test against three expert radiologists, Enlitic's system was 50 percent better at classifying tumors and had a false-negative rate of zero, compared to 7 percent for the human experts.Second, AI will redefine many existing jobs. A Burning Glass analysis found a surge of ""hybrid jobs"" that blend technical skills with other skills or domains. For example, digital marketing combines technological tools with the domain of marketing. American manufacturers are now posting more jobs for software developers and engineers than production workers.Third, AI will raise the skill level required for all jobs. Low-skilled jobs become higher-skilled when evolving AI tools become part of the work. Those who were formerly cashiers are still needed at an Amazon Go store, but for higher-skilled roles such as customer assistance. Human capital from education and training programs will depreciate at a faster pace, requiring continuous upgrading of skills to keep pace with the ways AI changes job functions.The Best Cartoons on the EconomyView All 221 ImagesYes, some jobs will be eliminated as part of this wave of automation. But the more pressing threat is that the country is woefully unprepared to equip individuals with the skills required to fill millions of jobs that will either be created or already exist but will evolve. We already see glimpses of this within labor market and wage data. According to the National Federation of Independent Business, 54 percent of small-business owners reported difficulty finding qualified workers. New jobs are also demanding higher levels of skills. The Center on Education and the Workforce estimates that over 95 percent of jobs created after the Great Recession went to workers with at least some college education. That, in turn, is driving up wages for higher-skilled jobs. The average income difference between those who have a college degree and those who don't has never been larger. That gap will widen unless our workforce system becomes more agile in responding to employer needs and more flexible in serving students across all ages and backgrounds. K-12 students will need multiple pathways to careers, not just college. Alex Hernandez, a partner at Charter School Growth Fund, compares our current education system to a game of ""Chutes and Ladders,"" where career and technical education has been a chute, ""an off-ramp for students who ... were not succeeding in 'traditional' education."" Career and Technical Education should become an option for all students, not just for those that the system has sorted as not being ready for college. For example, Carmen Schools of Science & Technology offers career-preparation programs to all students. In addition to traditional high school classes, students can earn certifications and college credits and even participate in apprenticeships with local companies. Promising models like Kenzie are also worth considering. The new Indianapolis-based venture is creating a new type of program that combines work and school to teach nontechies, between the ages of 19 and 40, how to do software engineering. Students initially spend four hours a week learning programming, mostly through projects instead of lectures. At the end of six months, students will have enough training to be junior front-end developers, and then junior full-stack developers after another six months. Kenzie also offers a paid apprenticeship program where ""Kenzie Studio Fellows"" work on projects for companies. That's important for giving students real-life work experience, but also in helping with student placement. A student could conceivably work for an employer for 18 months before being hired.Humans Can Survive RobotsRobot alarmists discount history, capitalism and our ability to adapt.Brian Hamilton Oct. 18, 2017While it's necessary to create more opportunities for people to learn new skills, it's also important to train companies to hire people based on skills. Opportunity@Work is developing pathways for overlooked Americans to gain skills that will open access to technical jobs around the country. Their TechHire initiative creates local ecosystems with job seekers, training providers, and employers working to identify needed skills and open positions, along with the training to secure those skills, and a system to verify the attainment of those skills.

First, while the skills gap may be a national problem, skills-training partnerships must be local to reflect regional employer needs. Second, these programs leverage project-based work, often with real employers, not only to better engage students but to ensure the curriculum is current and relevant. Finally, many of these systems are leveraging Income Share Agreements, which create a financial incentive for the providers to ensure students are employable and, ultimately, hired. Policymakers, employers and community leaders must come together to not only improve the existing education and workforce system but also experiment with new models and approaches to help meet the diverse needs of employers and workers.Tags: robots, economy, Amazon.comRead MoreMore OpinionOpinionWe Can Engage Turned-Off Youth Voters.OpinionPolitics 'Silly Season' Roils the WorldOpinionIt’s Not Just About You, America",,https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/2d19215/2147483647/thumbnail/80x60/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F38%2F33e61685e8399bfd9518c5f3ce7ec8%2Fmedia%3A6916ed62ba1f4be28f8450a003afc630Amazon_Cashier-less_Store_38222.jpg,,,,2018-01-23T13:45-0500,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', 'name': ""Artificial Intelligence's Real Jobs Challenge"", '@id': 'https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/articles/2018-01-23/artificial-intelligences-real-jobs-challenge', 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/articles/2018-01-23/artificial-intelligences-real-jobs-challenge'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1030.0,"Amazon Go, a cashier- and cash-free shopping experience from Amazon, officially launched this week.

If you were a brilliant artificial intelligence (AI) expert just graduating from a doctoral program at a prestigious school, would you pursue that startup you’ve been thinking about, join a company that wants to build cutting-edge AI applications, or use your expertise to help scientists in other fields conduct basic research? 
Admittedly, this is a bit of a silly question. The opportunities presented by the first two options are outrageous, and growing more outrageous by the day. With more than 2,000 startups absorbing much of the top-tier AI talent — estimated by some to be just 10,000 individuals worldwide — the combination of great scarcity and even greater demand for talent is driving salaries through industry roofs. Some businesses offer seven-figure compensation packages for elite AI talent. 
Plus, it’s never been a better time to launch an AI startup. Investment in AI-focused ventures has grown 1,800% in just six years, from $282 million in 2011 to more than $5 billion in 2016, according to CB Insights.
The sanity behind these numbers comes, in part, from the fact that companies expect AI to allow them to move into new business segments or to maintain their competitive advantage in their industry. Driving this expectation is the idea that AI will enable them to dramatically improve the efficiency or effectiveness of their operations and offerings.
Despite the lucrative financial opportunities in these first two career paths, the alternative choice — to collaborate with scientists in other fields — may be more pivotal to how nations and businesses compete over the long term. 
Conventional wisdom, based on no small amount of research, holds that AI-driven automation will create technological unemployment in a variety of sectors in the next five to 10 years. Optimists believe that this won’t be a big deal for the labor sector as a whole because corporate adoption of AI (and other digital trends) will create new industries and new job categories that will replace whatever AI-driven losses occur in labor sectors of the current economy. But there are two open questions about this hypothesis:

How will these new industries be created?
How soon will they come, if they come at all?

The creation of new industries frequently depends on dramatic advances in science and technology that can take decades to move from discovery to commercial application to new industry.

Am going to speak on more psychological part of AI and impact on the senior generation.

There have been many skeptics when it comes to AI and creation of new job opportunities.  

No doubt that AI; using a more creative approach; will benefit many people especially the younger generation. 

To some ""older"" generation, AI seem to create more fear rather than ""good news"" - fear of being left behind, the fear of being terminated and fear of having to learn something more advanced etc. 

Despite these may not be accurate at some point, the need to  be more creative and most importantly; sending the right information to the prevailing workforce especially those who have served for too many years.

Again, as I speak now, with all due respect; I still see some corporations and manufacturers are using AI as an easy path to ""sack"" more workers under the pretext of ""cutting cost"".

Perhaps a more friendlier way to approach this delicate matter is required. For example, designing the AI elements to be more user-friendly which comes together with induction, reassignment or review of current job description to match the AI requirements, transfer of staff to branches or other units/departments etc. 

After all, spending on AI is always linked to profitable corporations which definitely  have branches nation or worldwide.

Create a blue rather than red ocean in the context of AI.

If this issue is not properly addressed, then the wrong perspective will go on forever. It will not be in line with the technological advancement era.

Just my 2 cents worth.

So useful, in fact, that we are left to wonder why so anyone might be bothered with the advancement of physical robotics when software seems to really do it all.Trending AI Articles:1. Cheat Sheets for AI, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Big Data2. Data Science Simplified Part 1: Principles and Process3. Getting Started with Building Realtime API InfrastructureWith artificial intelligence on IoT on the rise, is there really a market for physical robotics any more? Let’s take a closer look at how we use these two technologies today.The Difference Between Artificial Intelligence and RoboticsIs AI part of robotics? Is robotics part of AI? What exactly is the difference between these two terms?You’ve probably seen the two used interchangeably in a variety of settings, adding to the widespread confusion. We can blame pop culture for this one.Artificial intelligence and robotics serve two very different purposes. However, it is not uncommon for people to get them confused. This may be because the overlap between them that gets the vast amount of the media’s attention: Artificially Intelligent Robots.Let’s set the record straight.Artificial IntelligenceAI, or artificial intelligence, is a branch of computer science. This branch involves the development of software programs to complete specific tasks that would otherwise depend on human intelligence. The main goal of AI algorithms is to tackle logical reasoning, language understanding, problem-solving, perception, and learning.AI is used all around us in our modern world. For example, AI algorithms are used in SatNav route finders, Amazon’s recommendation engine, and Google Searches.Most of the AI programs used today do not control robots. And when AI is used in robotic technology, AI algorithms are only a piece of a larger robotic system.RoboticsTo put it simply, robotics is the branch of technology that handles robots. Robots are known as programmable machines. These machines carry out certain actions autonomously and semi-autonomously.We can typically classify a technology as a robot if it meets these 3 components:Robots have the ability to interact with the world around them via actuators and sensors.Robots are programmable.Robots perform semi-autonomous and autonomous actions.It is not unusual to hear experts argue over just what constitutes a “robot”. Some people believe that robots must be able to “think” for itself and make decisions.However, requiring that a robot “thinks” suggest that it holds some level of artificial intelligence. While robots can be implemented with AI technology, AI alone is not grounds for a robotic classification.Artificially Intelligent RobotsRobots that are artificially intelligent bridge the gap between AI and robotics. AI software and programs control these robots.Most robots today are not artificially intelligent. Until recently, industrially designed robots could only carry out a series of repetitive movements based on programming. As mentioned previously, repetitive motions do not require the use of artificial intelligence.Therefore, robots without intelligence are rather limited in functionality. To allow a robot to perform tasks that are more complex AI algorithms are required.However, AI robots are not completely unheard of.Sophia, the artificially intelligent robot designed by Hanson Robotics, stunned the world this past year (2017) and it wasn’t just in regards to her ability to converse and speak her mind. The fact that she was given a national citizenship had the world wondering if this type of technology is really necessary and how it might affect our future.Looking ForwardIs it possible that robots will change the way that we live? It’s an interesting question to ask when robots are already shaping the way that we live today. From the first time that the world saw a toaster pop up by itself, we’ve accepted the fact that robots can be trusted to perform certain actions that make our lives easier.Today robots run our cars, play our music, cook our food, and record our shows. Many of us simply don’t realize it because they don’t have a face that we can talk to.Technically speaking, robots are simply automatic motorized tools that are programmed to perform specific physical actions. The key here is physical because AI intelligence by itself does not concern itself with physical actions.While flashy AI robots like Sophia can be a little unnerving, to say the least, it’s more about the technology behind her and how it can be applied to change our future for the better. We’re not just talking entertainment, think about real physical labor in dangerous places, elderly care, and even a telepresence in tourism, shopping, and assistance.Imagine sitting at home on your computer and walking a video game character through a market or mall, except it’s not a game, it’s a personal robot shopping for you in London while you sit comfortably in New York. Imagine a robot’s ability to assist at a disaster site, clean up wreckage from a highway in just seconds, and provide relief assistance to the elderly and less-abled.In today’s day in age, modern technology is designed to bring the world to you through the Internet, our televisions and phones, but if this trend continues, robots will soon have the ability to bring you to the world — all at a speed of thought.So do we need physical robots when we have AI on IoT technology?The answer is yes. While the two has existed separately for some time now, we can only watch and wait to see just what robotics, AI, and IoT technology will shape the way that we approach problems, care for others, and live our daily life.",,,,['Munawar Abadullah'],,2018-01-24T14:12:16.749Z,b29faabd2d10,https://becominghuman.ai/do-we-need-physical-robots-or-ai-on-iot-will-do-the-job-b29faabd2d10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Doxel Introduces AI Solution to Boost Construction Industry 
      Productivity




Andreessen Horowitz Leads Investment in Computer Vision and 
      Artificial Intelligence Disruptor






January 24, 2018 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Approximately $10 trillion is spent every year on the construction 
      industry – 13 percent of the global GDP – yet productivity levels for 
      this industry have trailed other sectors for decades.
    
.@Doxel_ai introduces #AI solution to boost #construction industry productivity; #VC round led by @a16zPost this

      Addressing this enormous challenge, Doxel today unveiled an artificial 
      intelligence and computer vision-based system that delivers significant 
      productivity increases to commercial construction projects. Doxel uses 
      autonomous devices to visually monitor every inch of a project, then 
      feeds this data to its proprietary deep learning algorithms. The 
      algorithms then inspect the quality of installed work and measure 
      installed quantities in real time. This enables project managers to 
      react to inefficiencies almost immediately and boost productivity as 
      much as fifty percent.
    

      In addition, Doxel announced a $4.5 million investment led by Andreessen 
      Horowitz, with Alchemist Accelerator, Pear Ventures, SV Angel and 
      Steelhead Ventures participating.
    

      “You can’t improve what you can’t measure. Without real-time visibility 
      into quality and progress, managers simply can’t boost productivity. Our 
      turnkey solution literally tracks progress for hundreds of thousands of 
      line items in project budgets and schedules, comparing actual 
      performance to original plans,” said CEO and Co-Founder Saurabh Ladha. 
      “This is transformative for an entire capital project team. With Doxel’s 
      system in place, project managers can react in minutes, not months, 
      increasing productivity by fifty percent and bringing in projects 
      twenty-five percent under budget.”
    

      Doxel offers progress tracking and transparency to an industry in 
      desperate need of productivity improvements. According to McKinsey & 
      Company, ninety-eight percent of large-scale construction projects are 
      delivered, on average, eighty percent over budget and twenty months 
      behind schedule. This happens because project managers don't have 
      real-time visibility into the biggest factor affecting project outcomes 
      – labor productivity.
    

      Labor productivity is hard to predict. While managers often know how 
      many person hours are being spent on a project, they don’t have an 
      accurate measure of how much work is accomplished, or if that work is 
      being done correctly. It isn’t difficult to know why – most construction 
      projects involve several teams that are installing millions of 
      components to high accuracies. With so much to inspect, it's nearly 
      impossible for managers to track progress accurately. This leads to 
      nasty surprises where managers realize several weeks or months later 
      that they’ve been spending a lot more person hours or, in other words, 
      more time and money, than they expected for a given amount of work.
    

      Doxel uses autonomous devices to monitor a site every day, both outdoors 
      and indoors, with LIDAR and HD cameras. Their proprietary artificial 
      intelligence algorithm then processes this visual data, inspects 
      installation quality, and quantifies how much material has been 
      installed correctly. Doxel’s cloud-based dashboard then provides project 
      managers with real-time feedback on productivity, as well as how actual 
      costs and time spent are comparing to the original budget and schedule. 
      As a result, managers can better control outcomes and keep their 
      projects on time and on budget. This information allows CFOs to get 
      real-time data on earned value for hundreds of thousands of line items 
      in a project budget, while enabling field teams to track schedule at a 
      hyper granular level and in real time.
    

      At the heart of Doxel’s solution is a major breakthrough in computer 
      vision software; one that allows artificial intelligence to understand 
      the world not just in 2D, but like people do, in 3D.
    

      “Construction projects involve millions of similar-looking components, 
      packed tightly together in a dark environment. It’s a Molotov Cocktail 
      of challenges for computer vision software,” said CTO and Co-Founder 
      Robin Singh. “Usually, the amount of training data such an algorithm 
      would need would be enormous, and even then, the results may not be 
      reliable. With our proprietary 3D semantic algorithms, we’ve been able 
      to get more reliable results with a fraction of the training data. Our 
      algorithms recognize and contextualize objects not just based on color, 
      but also based on shape, location and size.”
    

      In addition to tracking progress against schedule and budget, Doxel also 
      detects errors almost immediately. As per the Construction Industry 
      Institute, about ten percent of construction time is spent just fixing 
      mistakes. Using a design-intent 3D model that shows the intended 
      location, size and shape of every component, Doxel can alert managers if 
      field work doesn’t match designs.
    

      The means to track construction site progress in real time is helpful 
      for foremen, superintendents, project managers, CFOs and executives – 
      anyone who has a financial stake in increasing job site productivity.
    

      “If you could have an alarm that went off when your project was going 
      over budget or off course, wouldn’t you want to use it considering the 
      millions of dollars you could save?"" asked Lars Dalgaard, General 
      Partner at Andreessen Horowitz. ""For an industry that is notorious for 
      cost overruns and delays, we see Doxel as the canary in the coalmine for 
      construction projects. We expect Doxel to help owners and builders 
      increase productivity, save money, and bring projects in on time with 
      the highest levels of quality.”
    

      The construction industry currently manages project inspection through a 
      combination of clipboards, physical measurement, or even simple visual 
      inspection. With Doxel's real-time, AI-based solution in place, builders 
      and building owners can track progress accurately and in real-time – all 
      while actually reducing the amount of time spent doing these activities 
      manually.
    

      “On-site productivity can be increased by as much as 50 percent by 
      implementing a cloud-based control tower that rapidly assembles accurate 
      data in near real time that is both backward-looking and predictive (for 
      example, using plan conformance and other variability and inventory 
      metrics). Importantly, owners need to ensure that the right data flow 
      through the various owner, contractor, and subcontractor systems.”
    

Reinventing 
      Construction: A Route To Higher Productivity, McKinsey Global 
      Institute
    

      Doxel works with many parties in the construction industry – builders to 
      contractors to project managers, to the building owners themselves: 
      whoever carries the financial risk in the success of a large 
      construction project. Doxel can be deployed at any stage of 
      construction, from the time the first hole in the ground until the keys 
      are handed over.

We have some of the most automated ports, some of the most automated mines in the world.""We are actually already punching well above our weight in this field, and so we should take advantage of that.""China already leading in some areasProfessor Walsh said according to some measures, Chinese companies were already outperforming their rivals — but there was still room for improvement.""In terms of the pure output, the number of papers and patents and so on, China is now actually ahead of the US,"" he said.Could a robot do your job?Search our database of every Australian occupation to find out how difficult it will be for artificial intelligence to do your job.Read more""If you look more closely at the data, look at the quality of the work, look at things like the citations, you can still see that the US is still ahead of China.""The quality of the work is perhaps a bit higher in the US.""However while China is interested in how the technology can be used to improve living standards, it remains clear-eyed about the potential military applications of AI.The Government's strategy makes it clear information on technological developments is to be shared between civilian and military researchers.Professor Walsh, who has been involved in efforts calling for a worldwide ban on so-called ""killer robots"", said global efforts to regulate AI would be necessary.""We're not going to be able to stop the technology being developed, because actually it has very potentially good uses — the same technology that goes into your autonomous car will go into your autonomous drone,"" he said.""We're not going to stop the development of the technology, but we can make sure it's used for good.""Translations by Bang Xiao and Jason Fang, Asia Pacific Newsroom.Posted 25 Jan 201825 Jan 2018Thu 25 Jan 2018 at 2:28am, updated 25 Jan 201825 Jan 2018Thu 25 Jan 2018 at 2:36amShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesHow Google's new AI can teach itself to beat you at the most complex gamesCan an ancient board game give Google the keys to the Middle Kingdom?Google AI wins final Go match, gets 'divine' rankingMore on:AustraliaChinaComputer ScienceInternetRoboticsScience and TechnologyUnited StatesTop StoriesThe red flags at the centre of AFP's suspicions about the couple charged with spying for RussiaPicasso estate responds to MONA's faked artworksAnalysisVice-President Trump and President Putin of Ukraine — Joe Biden's gaffes keep coming, but he says he's not budgingSeven stand-out moments from Joe Biden's high-pressure press conferenceCFMEU boss John Setka steps down 'Time is running out': Collingwood's premiership defence on thin ice after loss to Geelong in crucial clashBritish man sentenced to life in prison for attempted kidnap and murder of UK presenter Holly WilloughbyWhy Shelley Duvall disappeared from HollywoodBenji apologises to fans after the Tigers are smashed 58-6 by CronullaVenice's debated tourist fee expected to increase 'in coming years', says tourism councillorAussie killed in Ukraine among many 'lulled' to fight war without military trainingRussian-Australian woman charged with spying offences was well-travelled, made lifestyle videosPhilippines police open special investigation into suspected murder of Australian couple as hunt for suspect continuesDubbed the 'Star Wars Project', South Korea plans to use drone-melting lasers against North Korea'All they took was two pies', says Gippsland bakery owner after armed robbers tie up staff in early morning raidPopular NowDon't miss news that matters to you.

Kentaro Sonoura, national security adviser to PM Shinzo Abe, told TOI in an exclusive chat, ""You should expect to see increased bilateral cooperation between us to develop unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and robotics."" The strategic sphere is where the bulk of India-Japan convergence lies. After the nuclear agreement was ratified by the Japanese parliament late 2017, Sonoura said India and Japan would be setting up a joint task force for commercial agreements by the end of January. With the legislation behind them, the Japanese minister said Tokyo was keen to get this going. ""The two PMs agreed to launch a working group, which will work on cooperation between nuclear companies. Japan's intention is to start this quickly, possibly by the end of this month,"" he said.With an aggressive and expansionist China growing as a challenge to both India and Japan, the two countries are increasingly looking at the world from a similar lens. While the latest buzzword in international geopolitics, 'Indo-Pacific', might sound American, its actually Japanese in origin, having been articulated by Abe himself as far back as 2007.In 2018, Japan's is aiming for a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"", a theme Sonoura expounded on at the recent Raisina Dialogue. This, he told TOI, was a coming together of Japan's Indo-Pacific policy and India's Act East policy. ""We need to share the importance of rule of law and freedom of navigation among related countries. The next step is infrastructure development based on global standards, so that connectivity among countries is increased. The third step would be maritime law enforcement and disaster management that would ensure the stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. Therefore, we would like to connect and combine our Indo-Pacific strategy and India's Act East policy as a one big picture. That's the synergy we seek,"" Sonoura said. This is the kind of grand strategy that incorporates a stronger bilateral relationship as well as a multilateral one, between Japan-India-US, Japan-US-Australia and the Quadrilateral, Japan-US-India-Australia, seeking to tilt the strategic balance away from China.Working with India in the quadrilateral, Sonoura said, the aims were slowly crystallising. ""Among these four countries, we have the same standards in terms of maritime strategy and basic values. So it's important to realise these values - non-proliferation, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Its important to utilise the strengths of these countries and use it. Rather than frameworks, its important what we can do - to create concrete results which should be visible to the world,"" he said. For India, the key aims of the quadrilateral is to come together on non-proliferation and on freedom of navigation. To counter China's growing influence in India's neighbourhood, India has encouraged the presence of Japan and the US in South Asian countries, actions that might have elicited mild protests earlier. Consequently, New Delhi was remarkably quiet when Japanese foreign minister Taro Kono recently visited Pakistan, Maldives and Sri Lanka, increasing Japanese presence in these countries. Japan has already ramped up its involvement in Bangladesh and Myanmar, both countries on China's radar. Questioned on this, Sonoura said, ""Foreign minister Kono visited Maldives for the first time and Sri Lanka for the first time in 15 years. Last year I visited Mauritius, Madagascar, Kenya and Mozambique. If you place this within the rubric of Japan's Indo-Pacific strategy, you will get the larger picture."" In Islamabad, Sonoura said, the Japanese message was clear that Pakistan had to take action on terrorism and terrorists. ""With Pakistan, we have an older relationship. But in terms of counter-terrorism, our foreign minister told the Pakistanis they need to do more,"" he said.

Departments search for deputy director to coordinate work and design Grand Challenge for artificial intelligenceTwo central government departments are setting up a joint Office for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in an effort to make the most of the economic and service opportunities in the technology.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DMCS) and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) have made the plan public through a job advertisement for a deputy director.It follows an emphasis on the importance of AI in the independent review of the issue, published by the two departments last October.The job advertisement, which quotes a salary of £65,000 to £80,000 on a two-year contract, says the role will bring together the leadership teams in the DCMS Tech Policy Directorate and the BEIS Business Growth Directorate.It will involve setting up the team, designing the Government’s Grand Challenge to transform AI in the UK, and developing a detailed implementation plan for commitments within the Government’s Industrial Strategy. Other responsibilities will include leading delivery of the AI Sector Deal – taking in skills, governance and security – and promoting the adoption of AI in the public and private sectors.The advertisement says the appointee will not have to be an expert in AI but will need experience in the technology sector.DCMS has indicated that the new body will complement the work of the Alan Turing Institute in the field. The AI review recommended that the institute should become the national institute for AI and data science, and work with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Science and Technology Facilities Council, and Joint Information Systems Committee (Jisc) to coordinate demand and computing capacity for research into the technology.This story was amended on 30 January on receipt of further information from DCMS.Image by Many Wonderful Artists, public domain through flickr

Artificial intelligence can change how recruiters do their jobs. But robots like SoftBank's Pepper... [+] aren't a threat yet. (Credit: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg)





While it might seem ironic, artificial intelligence and machine learning are well on the way to lending a helping hand when it comes to solving the problems of human capital management. Recruiting is one of the toughest issues businesses face today. Finding the right talent is critical for business success, but it’s challenging to say the least, and hiring the wrong person is expensive. Recent estimates put the cost to find and hire a new employee at a quarter of a million dollars – a cost that can quickly become astronomical if that person turns out to be wrong for the role.  With the ever increasing data available about candidates and employees, some innovative AI companies are taking on the challenge of helping improve talent acquisition efficiency and effectiveness.

Recruiting efficiency: the low hanging fruit
Recruiting is a high-touch activity that involves stakeholders across the organization. AI startups are significantly reducing the operational burden by automating low level tasks and providing better information for decision makers. An example of this can be seen with X.ai  a solution that can help tackle the administrative nightmare of scheduling interviews. ClearFit saves recruiters sourcing time by automatically finding and ranking candidates and Filtered can help assess technical candidates through auto-generated coding challenges  (also improving their effectiveness). While these might not be killer apps for HR, they can deliver immediate value while helping AI companies gather data to expand into new areas.
 Recruiting effectiveness: the challenging holy grail
The big prize for enterprises comes with improved effectiveness. To tackle this, companies need better data and intelligence that allows them to find the right people for the job and focus on the right indicators when screening.
PROMOTED
With each recruiting process, there is a substantial amount of data created, but it isn’t being captured for future reference. When companies need new talent, they post a job, source candidates, screen them across different interviews and eventually pick one to fill the position. Every single time either companies or candidates go through this process, they have to start from scratch, losing not only time but also valuable information across recruiting events. Wade & Wendy is trying to address this problem with a virtual assistant that is the first point of contact with applicants that goes on to build a trail of each interaction the applicants have with the company.

When it comes to sourcing, companies still struggle to get their message through and target the right candidates at the right time. AI startups are leveraging existing data to tackle this very aspect. Textio aims to helps companies create better job postings that will help differentiate them, while Engage Talent allows them to discover passive job seekers, and target them with personalized messages at the right time.
Screening tends to rely on resumes which are both an indirect indicator of a person’s skills and an incomplete picture of their achievements and capabilities. Harver is creating a new type of screening by generating engaging tests that assess candidates on tasks they’ll have to do on the job, while Ansaro is unifying all the data companies have about their employees to build predictive models that will help them hire in smarter way.

The business model challenge
AI startups can provide significant value to both companies and applicants, but they need to understand how this value is created when they define their business model. Recruiting is a two-sided market where high value is created in very discrete time intervals (i.e. when a person is recruited). This creates a challenge for tech companies. While they are used to recurring revenue streams, their customers are likely to prefer to pay on a per job/position rather than a typical SaaS model. There are ways to overcome this, either by targeting segments that have high recruiting needs (e.g. high turnover businesses/temporary workers) or creating a product that can deliver recurring value, but startups and investors will have to consider a commission-based model in the early days and to think about how to make the transition to a recurring model if at all.
AI can make recruiting smarter
While companies have increasing amounts and diversity of data they can leverage to try to identify the best fit for each position, the recruiting process is still stuck in the past, based on standardized resumes and (potentially biased) interviewers’ opinions, and companies are suffering because of that. Even though we are talking about people, machines seem to be able to help not only source but also screen applicants. In fact, studies have shown that humans are notoriously bad at picking the right applicant and a meta-analysis illustrated that algorithms can outperform human experts in hiring.
Even though AI is far from being able to autonomously decide who a company should hire when it comes to figuring out who the best person is for the job, you might want to check out how AI is make recruiting smarter.Valley VoicesFollowingFollowEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

Americans Upbeat on Artificial Intelligence, but Still Wary
by RJ Reinhart







Story Highlights

76% of Americans say AI will change the way people work and live
77% of these U.S. adults say those changes will be positive
However, 73% say AI adoption will result in net job loss


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Three in four Americans (76%) agree or strongly agree that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally change the way people work and live over the next decade. Among those who expect this transformation, a similar 77% believe these changes will be ""mostly"" or ""very positive.""


Attitudes on the Impact of the Adoption of Artificial Intelligence
Overall, do you believe artificial intelligence will have a mostly positive, mostly negative, or neither positive nor negative impact on how people work and live in the next 10 years? (among Americans who say AI will fundamentally change people's lives and work in the next 10 years)

Northeastern University/Gallup survey, Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017





These data come from a new Northeastern University/Gallup survey of Americans' attitudes toward AI and its effect on their lives and work. The mail survey of 3,297 U.S. adults took place Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017. In the survey, AI is defined as computers, robots or other technology that can accomplish tasks humans can do, as well as learn and accomplish tasks that humans may not be able to do.
Similar proportions of white-collar workers (those working in largely salaried industries) and blue-collar workers (those working in industries largely composed of hourly wage earners) strongly agree or agree that AI will fundamentally alter the way people work and live -- 80% vs. 77%, respectively. However, white-collar workers who expect it to have an impact are more optimistic than blue-collar workers are about how it will affect people's lives, with 78% saying those changes will be very or mostly positive, compared with 68% of blue-collar workers who expect AI to have this level of impact.
In line with occupational differences, Americans' optimism about the effect of AI also differs according to their level of education. Among those who expect AI to have a fundamental impact, 82% with a bachelor's degree or higher, vs. 74% of those without a bachelor's degree, say the impact of AI will be very or mostly positive.

Americans Anticipate Negative Effects From AI Adoption
While the public largely believes the impact of AI will be positive, it also anticipates that the technology will have some significant downsides. Chief among these is job loss, with 73% of Americans saying the adoption of AI will result in a loss of more jobs than it creates. White-collar workers (71%) are less likely than blue-collar workers (82%) to say AI adoption will result in a net job loss.

Northeastern University/Gallup survey, Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017





In addition to expecting job losses, a majority (63%) of Americans believe the adoption of AI will widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Among white-collar workers and Americans with a bachelor's degree or higher, two in three (66%) of both groups say AI will widen the gap.


Americans' Opinions on the Impact of AI Adoption on the Gap Between Rich and Poor
Which of the following do you believe is true? Artificial intelligence will widen the gap between the rich and poor, narrow the gap between the rich and poor, or have no impact on the gap between the rich and poor in the United States.*

Northeastern University/Gallup survey, Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017




Americans' views on AI may be at least partly related to a lack of familiarity with the technology, with slightly more than half (55%) saying they have an ""excellent"" or ""good"" understanding of what AI is, but 45% saying their understanding is ""only fair"" or ""poor.""
Implications
The media have reported extensively about the potential for AI to eliminate large numbers of jobs across the U.S. economy, and Americans agree, with more than seven in 10 saying AI will eliminate more jobs than it creates. While Americans agree that AI adoption will result in a net loss of jobs, they remain largely positive about the impact the new technology will have on their lives and work over the next decade.
Developing and implementing policies that pre-emptively tackle or respond to the negative effects of AI adoption will prove a key challenge for government, industry and education. Encouraging Americans to prepare to succeed in this rapidly changing economy by obtaining the additional education necessary to work with AI will also prove a major task. However, not doing so would only exacerbate the disruption of people's lives and work that the adoption of AI is already likely to create.

Survey Methods
Results for the Northeastern University/Gallup survey on artificial intelligence are based on surveys conducted by mail from Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017, with a random sample of 3,297 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The survey package included an English and a Spanish survey to provide respondents with the flexibility to reply in their preferred language.
Gallup selected the sample of U.S. residents using address-based sampling (ABS), a sampling technique used to select households from a list of all households on file with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Gallup chooses respondents within the household at random based on which household member would have the next birthday. Gallup used a series of postcard reminders to encourage participation in the survey.
Gallup weighted the data to match national demographics of gender, age, education, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education and region.
All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting.

Let him explain why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ScienceThis psychologist’s “gaydar” research makes us uncomfortable. That’s the point.Michal Kosinski used artificial intelligence to detect sexual orientation. Let him explain why.by  Brian ResnickJan 29, 2018, 12:00 PM ESTFacebookLinkGetty ImagesBrian Resnick was Vox’s science and health editor and is the co-creator of Unexplainable, Vox’s podcast about unanswered questions in science.In September, Stanford researcher Michal Kosinski published a preprint of a paper that made anoutlandish claim: The profile pictures we upload to social media and dating websites can be used to predict our sexual orientation.Kosinski, a Polish psychologist who studies human behavior from the footprints we leave online, has a track record of eyebrow-raising results. In 2013, he co-authored a paper that found that people’s Facebook “likes” could be used to predict personal characteristics like personality traits (a finding that reportedly inspired the conservative data firm Cambridge Analytica).For the new paper, Kosinski built a program with his co-author Yilun Wang using a common artificial intelligence program to scan more than 30,000 photos uploaded to an unnamed dating site. The software’s job? To figure out a pattern about what could distinguish a gay person’s face from a straight person’s.When choosing between a pair of photos, the resulting program accurately identified a gay man 81 percent of the time and a gay woman 71 percent of the time. The researchers also asked humans to do the same task — and they fared worse, guessing correctly 54 to 61 percent of the time.More controversially, Kosinski and Wang’s paper claimed that the program based its decision on differences in facial structure; that gay men’s faces were more feminine and lesbian women’s faces were more masculine. They suggested this finding was in line with the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation, which suggests our sexuality is, in part, determined by hormone exposure in the womb. This conclusion is hotly contested by some of their colleagues, who say the research is confounded by the fact that the photos were uploaded by the users themselves and not taken in a neutral lab setting. (Read a thorough critique of those conclusions here). But even if the algorithm is just picking up on personal choices, the result feels unsettling, like the first stone on a path to a Black Mirror future.LGBTQ rights groups decried the research, saying it’s based in pseudoscience and poses a danger to members of the LGBTQ community around the world. Other researchers in psychology decried it as physiognomy, the long-defunct pseudoscience of attributing personality traits to physical characteristics. The paper is expected to run in a February edition of Personality and Social Psychology. Kosinski insists his intent was never to out anyone, but rather to warn us about the rapid extinction of privacy.And sexual orientation, he argues, is a start. Many more aspects of our inner lives — like personality traits — may be encoded in our faces. This is also a controversial idea, which harks back to the pseudoscience of physiognomy.When I spoke to Kosinski in November at his Stanford office, I was most interested in learning why he’s asking these controversial research questions, and whether his “warning” of a loss a privacy is actually just a blueprint to achieve it. He argues these technologies are already being used and have a huge potential for misuse.Industries, governments, and even psychologists can mine the digital footprints we leave everywhere and learn things about ourselves we wouldn’t necessarily be willing to share. “Basically, going forward, there’s going to be no privacy whatsoever,” he says.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.Kosinski wants to study human behavior via digital footprintsAlfred Pasieka/Science Photo LibraryBrian ResnickYou’ve become pretty famous in the past few years. I was first familiar with your work on deriving personality profiles from Facebook. [This is the work that would inspire Cambridge Analytica.]But that’s a whole other story than the “gaydar” machine.Michal KosinskiIt’s exactly the same story.Brian ResnickReally. How so?Michal KosinskiMy overarching goal is to try to understand people, social processes, and behavior better through the lens of digital footprints.It proves pretty difficult to study human behavior and psychology using big data. But there’s huge promise there. What’s interesting are the tiny details that we may actually notice in big data, and the effect might be tiny.You can very easily create a “black box” that would take some of this digital footprint data and produce very accurate predictions of future behavior and psychological traits. By studying what’s inside this black box, we may understand behavior better. Even without studying the black box, we already know that the computer, in its own computer’s way, understood the links.Brian ResnickBy “black box,” you mean artificial intelligence and neural networks. That’s where computers are trained to make predictions off data, but you, the researcher, don’t know how it’s making the prediction. That prediction might be interesting, but it doesn’t always help you hypothesize about what’s really going on.Michal KosinskiExactly.It proves to be uncomfortably accurate at making predictions.We know that companies are already collecting this data and using such black boxes to predict future behavior. Google, Facebook, and Netflix are doing this.Basically, most of the modern platforms are just virtually based on recording digital footprints and predicting future behavior.Why computers may be better at reading faces than humansGetty Creative ImagesBrian ResnickSo for this project, the digital footprint you studied was profile pictures: 35,000-plus photos obtained from a dating website. Why did you want to study faces?Michal KosinskiA few reasons.First of all, maybe only five years ago, computer technology reached the stage at which you can run [these] analyses on your computer or laptop, as opposed to needing a supercomputer.Before, we just couldn’t really do it. We could study faces, but we would have to use very inaccurate measures. We had people judging the faces.Brian ResnickOkay. But why did you think the computer could correlate facial attributes with personal characteristics?Michal KosinskiPeople can predict intimate traits of others from the faces. Gender is an example. Emotion, age, Down syndrome, developmental disease. There’s a huge range of things we can detect from people’s faces.Someone told me in the response to my recent paper that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” What strikes me is it’s extraordinary to claim there is no sign of sexual orientation on your face, because so many other things — gender, age, and so on — leave signs on human faces.Psychologists would say, “Oh, yes, that’s true, but not personality. This is just pseudoscience.” I’m like, wait. You can accept that you can predict 57 things, but if I say, “What about 58?” you say, “This is absolutely theoretically impossible. This is pseudoscience. How can you even say that?”Brian ResnickPeople aren’t great at intuiting sexual orientation from just looking at a person’s face. Why would a neural network do better?Michal KosinskiWherever we try to apply neural nets to do something that humans were doing before, with very little tinkering you can get results that are better than what humans can do. This is amazing — in many cases, like self-driving cars, they are already safer than humans. Planes land themselves. We have all of those AI-based tools around us that make our lives better.We have many years of evidence that humans judge personality, intelligence, and political views from people faces with little accuracy.Why? Maybe because people cannot perceive [these things]. [For instance,] we focus on the wrinkles around your eyes because this is useful in judging emotion. But we don’t focus on wrinkles elsewhere. [Meaning there may be some clues to a person’s sexuality or personality in the face that we just don’t pay attention to.]The second is that maybe people, even if they perceive, they cannot interpret. [That is, we see the signs on a person’s face that relate to personality or sexual orientation, but we don’t connect the dots.] Our neural networks might be trained better to judge.“Can you please check how threatening this bomb is?”Adapted from Getty ImagesBrian ResnickOf all of the personal traits or characteristics to study, why did you choose sexual orientation for this paper? It was sure to be controversial.Michal KosinskiBecause it’s most urgent. I already ran studies on political views, personality, IQ, and a bunch of other things. Those other things, they’re interesting. They’re potentially important. But when it comes to sexual orientation, it’s super urgent.If you asked me, “Hey, Michal, why don’t you become a scientist to build explosives to build a new bigger bomb?” I would be like, “I don’t think people should be doing that.”Now, if you asked me, “We already have this bomb. We have these algorithms. Can you please check how threatening this bomb is?” Which is essentially what I tried to do. I think this is a really important aspect because we already have the danger. We have the risk, and we try to find ways to neutralize it.A smart person with a computer and access to the internet can judge sexual orientation of anyone in the world, or millions of people simultaneously with very little effort, which makes lives of homophobes and oppressive regimes just a tiny bit more easy.Brian ResnickYou say that this research is, in part, a warning about our loss of privacy. But then, aren’t you giving the world a blueprint to invade people’s privacy?[Note: I should mention, the “gaydar” machine Kosinski created isn’t all that practical to use in the real world. The algorithm was tested by analyzing pairs of photos, one of a straight person and one of a gay person. The computer had to make a guess about who was gay. It chose correctly 81 percent of the time. This is not the same task as picking seven gay men out of a lineup of 100.]Michal KosinskiI’m taking an existing weapon [AI and facial recognition], and I’m saying it’s already being used.Brian ResnickWho is using it?Michal KosinskiGovernments are already doing this in practice.[Note: There’s one startup called Faception that claims it can detect terrorists or pedophiles just by looking at faces, and says it has contracts with governments. It has been reported that Kosinski was an adviser to Faception. He says this is a mischaracterization, and that he has accepted no money from them. He says, “I’m happy to give advice,” and, “Look, if you study how chemicals are dangerous, you should be advising companies producing chemicals.”]Many fear AI will just be used to discriminate under the guise of objectivityGetty ImagesBrian ResnickThere’s a fear with AI that these networks are really just learning stereotypes.With the photos of people’s sexual orientation, in your paper you noted these are people’s self-selected photos. You didn’t take 30,000 people and bring them into a lab and take perfectly neutral photos of them. So your program could be picking up on things other than face shape, like makeup or grooming. That it’s not picking up on something biological, as your paper claims, but it’s picking up on choices.Michal KosinskiThe whole point of this paper is that you don’t need to bring people to the lab. You can just take their pictures from Facebook or from a dating website, and the prediction is possible.The whole idea of machine learning is that you can train it on the original sample, and then as the machine works, it will just start matching patterns and noticing patterns and enriching the model.I expect that if you take the model trained on dating websites and apply it to a DMV database of driving license photos, at the beginning, first few thousand, the model will probably struggle. Like learn there is a new pattern of lighting or what not, but this is the idea of machine learning and neural networks. It automatically will adjust. Even without any additional training data, it will improve the accuracy. It learns about the patterns in new images.Brian ResnickThere was a paper that came out of China where researchers used facial recognition to look at drivers’ license photos and predict who is a criminal. It purported to have an accuracy of 89.5 percent. I’ve talked to some experts about this, and the biggest concern there was this: What was this program picking up on? Could it be physical features of certain ethnic groups that are discriminated against in the justice system?Michal KosinskiYou can, but stereotypes also might be accurate. It might be that gay people ... I don’t know, talk differently. But it may also be true that to some extent, they talk differently. But humans have a problem with judging probability.The beauty of a computer is it can go beyond the stereotype. Use the stereotype proper. Like, the stereotype developed by a computer will be an accurate one. It’s a data-driven thing.The point is even if the prediction is not very accurate, you can sort people from most likely to least likely and just focus your efforts at the top. When it comes to, say, finding criminals, like people that want to blow themselves up or kill your grandma, I think there are still problems with using such technology to detect such people, but I’m open to discussing it.There will be biases. Nothing is perfect in AI.Adapted from Getty ImagesBrian ResnickLet’s say you did a machine learning project using police mug shots in the United States.Wouldn’t a machine learning program learn there’s racial prejudice in our justice system? But it wouldn’t know it’s racial prejudice — it would just begin to associate darker complexions with criminality. And then if you used that machine to predict who is a criminal, all you’d be doing is reinforcing a stereotype.Michal KosinskiIf you trained the model in a stupid way, then of course. You can make an algorithm as racist as no human being has ever been in the history. You can make a stupid thing, no question about it.We can train algorithms in such a way as to not be racists, minimize those biases, and, as opposed to humans, we can control for these biases. We can examine how algorithms work.Also, we have to compare in the algorithms with what we already have.People say, “Oh, if you use algorithmic hiring, sentencing, or whatnot, there will be biases.” I agree.There will be biases. Nothing is perfect in AI. It’s not perfect, but you always have to compare it with the status quo.What is the alternative? The alternative is using humans. Humans are racist, sexist, ageist, corrupt, unfair, get tired, and we know that. We understand this very well.People think morality is outside the realm of science. Integrity is outside of the realm of science. This, of course, is silly.Brian ResnickCan you understand why people were afraid of this?Michal KosinskiI understand the gut feeling. I’m not writing this paper with pleasure. It freaks me out that it’s possible. I would love for those results to fail to replicate. It would just mean that we have one problem less as humanity, but give me a chance to sit down and talk you through with someone and actually show them the paper. Have them read the paper and the hate goes away.I had a number of those experiences, including with people who sent me death threats.Brian ResnickWhat’s the big story here? The takeaway.Michal KosinskiThe big story is that we’re not going to have any privacy very soon. I’m all for privacy-protecting laws and technologies, but people keep forgetting that they’re just doomed to fail. Equifax had amazing data protecting technologies. If big companies and governments cannot protect their data, how can you believe that you or our readers or I would be able to protect our data? The motivated party is out there to get them. They will get the data, however much they encrypt it.Also, even if we somehow magically get full control of our data, we still want to share the data. We want to tweet. We want to write stuff on Facebook. We want to walk the streets without covering my face and distorting my voice. This is already enough to make very accurate predictions of my sensitive traits [like personality, politics, wealth]. Basically, going forward, there’s going to be no privacy whatsoever.Brian ResnickThere’s nothing we can do.Michal KosinskiThere’s little we can do.Now we have to sit down, and the sooner we sit down and start thinking about how to make sure that the post-privacy world — or post-privacy world for some people, like for poor, underprivileged people living in non-liberal, non-Western countries, if their world suddenly becomes a post-privacy world — how do we make sure that it’s still safe and habitable place to live?You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

Last summer I wrote about Forum for the Future’s report ""Future of Health and Wellbeing in the Workplace."" The topic of the Future of Work is getting a lot of coverage. My interest lies in how the Future of Work applies to sustainability. In March, UC Berkeley Haas School of Business’ Center for Responsible Business will hold a ""Future of Work"" conference lead by Faris Natour, principal and co-founder of Article One Advisors and leader of the Center’s Human Rights and Business Initiative. I spoke with him about how sustainability practitioners can create strategies and partnerships that minimize the risks and maximize the positive impacts of these changes.The media portrayal of the Future of Work tends to be polarizing, with some people describing doomsday scenarios where robots take all jobs, and others painting a picture of technologies that make people’s jobs safer, more efficient and more engaging.""Too often, the debate about the future of work and artificial intelligence and automation is fought at the very extremes of the spectrum, when in reality new technologies will bring both risks and opportunities,"" said Natour.What the future of work means for sustainability and human rightsNatour points to two trends that are redefining the future of work and have implications for sustainability and human rights: new technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI); and the rise of the platform economy.
More collaboration between CSR and sustainability, human rights and human resources teams will be essential.

According to a 2017 PwC report, a large percentage of jobs could become automated, including an estimated 38 percent in the United States, 35 percent in Germany, 30 percent in the United Kingdom and 21 percent in Japan. According to a McKinsey Global Institute analysis, by 2030, between 400 million and 800 million people will need to find new jobs because of automation. The same McKinsey study noted that it’s likely enough new jobs will be created to offset the lost jobs.Natour said sustainability and human rights risks include the potential for widespread elimination of jobs due to AI or automation, and privacy issues related to the collection of employee data. Natour also pointed to benefits, including the automation of risky jobs in industries such as extractives, the reduction of waste from more efficient processes, the elimination of dull or repetitive tasks and the ability for people to work more efficiently and flexibly through new technologies.






The platform economy, which Natour describes as ""the shift from a long-term, single employer work life to a portfolio of different jobs and gigs,"" is also changing the nature of work. A 2016 McKinsey study found that between 20 and 30 percent of working-age people in Europe and the United States had engaged in some kind of independent work. The Aspen Institute reports that between 2002 and 2014, the growth of the gig economy in the U.S. outpaced the growth of total employment by between 2 and 8 percentage points.Natour said this trend is supporting sustainability efforts such as employee well-being by encouraging employers to create more flexible work environments. Yet it is also creating potential risks, such as lack of job security, benefits and fair pay, and lack of protection against issues that intersect with human rights, such as discrimination and harassment.How employers should prepare for the future of workNatour recommends employers begin preparing for these changes by taking stock of the risks and opportunities throughout their operations.Because these issues can cut across functions, he recommends the internal assessment engage a diverse set of teams, including sustainability, HR supply chain, legal, ethics and public affairs. This will help the company determine the biggest impacts, and identify which departments should take the lead on the preparations such as retraining the workforce, addressing questions about automation in the supply chain, updating policies to protect independent contractors or looking at ethical questions such as who is responsible for an accident caused by an autonomous vehicle or privacy issues due to a data breach.
This transition is happening now and it’s affecting all sectors.

Next, Natour advises forming a cross-functional task force to create processes and policies that maximize the impacts and mitigate the risks. He said sustainability practitioners are critical on these teams because they have experience working across functions and because many of these trends relate to core sustainability issues such as community and social impacts.""More collaboration between CSR and sustainability, human rights and human resources teams will be essential to addressing these issues effectively,"" he said. (Another Article One partner, Chloe Poynton, recently wrote a blog outlining the opportunity for corporate human rights and human resources teams to deepen their collaboration.)The final step is to look externally: Join an industry collaboration, or reach out to government, civil society or academic institutions that are exploring trends and strategies on the issues your company has identified. Natour noted a few organizations, such as the Aspen Institute’s Future of Work initiative, the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable’s (ICAR) Robots and Rights initiative, and the Partnership on AI.Natour emphasized that this transition is happening now, affecting all sectors.""If you’re not currently looking at these issues and trying to understand how your company is exposed, it’s important to do that right away because we’re in the middle of the disruption, not on the verge of it,"" he said.To learn more, the ""Future of Work"" conference will be March 21 at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business’ Center for Responsible Business.

Moreover, voice recognition is becoming so advanced that standing clients and potential customers will no longer have to talk to humans about their financial needs. Even if a person is going to make the final decision about a transaction, most of the work has already been done.This development, however, may also hasten the end of banks. Due to Japan's zero interest rate policy, domestic banks can't make money on loans, so they've become clearinghouses for other financial companies' products, be it mutual funds or insurance policies. Banks are basically salesmen who collect handling fees for delivering products and services. Once that task is automated or otherwise rendered obsolete by new technology, what's the point of a bank?These types of stories have been receiving a great deal of attention in the media for a while now, and Asahi's affiliate weekly magazine, Aera, devoted a large portion of its Jan. 22 issue specifically to the end of banking in Japan. The articles seem to be a response to announcements made in recent months by the three Japanese “megabanks” that they would be eliminating a large number of jobs over the next decade: 19,000 at Mizuho Financial Group, 9,500 at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and 4,000 at Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Much like cloning, people are entertaining serious speculations in the acceptance of artificial intelligence. Many are of the opinion that such technology will eventually result in the elimination of the human race or in its suppression, just as seen in certain Sci-Fi movies.
Others believe that the technology will be a considerable threat to jobs. Without jobs, there will be unrest, which would still, eventually, lead to the breakdown of the human race.
But really, how accurate are these allegations or beliefs? Do we stand to lose more than what we are gaining from artificial intelligence? To properly investigate these claims, we need to fully understand the concept of artificial intelligence and weigh its pros and cons for a mobile app development company.
The concept of artificial intelligence describes computer systems performing jobs and task that would typically require a human to complete. Some of these functions include; speech recognition and translation, visual perception, decision making.
There are different levels or classifications of artificial intelligence in mobile app development company. AI can be classified into strong and weak. Strong artificial intelligence describes programming that could imitate a human, in thought and actions. While weak intelligence only mimics humans in actions. There is also narrow and general artificial intelligence, this classification is based on the extent of the capability of the programming.
Pros and cons of artificial intelligence for mobile app development:
Pros
Complete Tedious Task:
One of the significant advantages of artificially intelligent machines for mobile app development company is their ability to perform and complete tedious tasks that would have otherwise been too boring for humans. Using intricate and careful automation, these artificial intelligent machines can work for very long periods without a decrease in its production capacity. The elimination of mundane tasks from human workload frees up time to handle more important matters.
Less error:
Artificial intelligence machines are especially important in fields that require a very high degree of accuracy and precision. One of such area is space exploration. In space exploration, there are no margins for error and any wrongly placed number could ruin the entire process. Hence the need for artificial intelligence machines to help with the crunching of very complex numbers.
Also, artificially intelligent robots are programmed to help with space exploration. These robots are built to withstand the harsh atmosphere of space. They are acclimatised such that they cannot be broken down, modified or disfigured by the hostile space atmosphere.
Difficult exploration:
There are places on our planets that are difficult, if not wholly impossible, for humans to explore. The ocean floor is one of such locations. The extreme pressure in the ocean floor is too high for humans and would crush anyone in seconds. Intelligent robots, on the other hand, can be built with a unique material such as to withstand the pressure of the ocean floor.
Intelligent robots can also be used for fuel exploration and other mining processes. These robots are built such that they can perform challenging jobs without tiring quickly.
Daily application:
Artificial intelligence has found use in our daily lives. In travel and tourism, artificial intelligent apps can be used to detect locations much easily using augmented reality. Augmented reality superimposes computer-generated images on the real world view of the user, improving his/her perception of the surrounding. This is also used in museums, allowing for more robust customer experience.
Artificial intelligence can also be used for predictive writing and correction of human spelling. In the posting on photographs on social media, artificial intelligence programming can help to identify and detect a person’s face and correctly tag the individual.
Medicine:
Artificial intelligence has tremendous importance in medicine. Intelligent robots can be used in the diagnostic and treatment of diseases. They can also help inform doctors on the side effects of certain drugs. Also, they can be helpful in artificial surgery simulators.
Cons:
Cost:
One of the major drawbacks of artificially intelligent machines for mobile app development company is cost. They are very costly to build and even more costly to maintain and manage. There is always the need for upgrades so they can match the changing needs and environment. This usually requires more research. In the case of breakdowns, these machines can require a lot of processes for recovery of lost codes and reinstall the system.
Job losses:
This is one of the leading argument against artificial intelligence, and it is one that has since begun to happen. Many low-skilled jobs have been lost due to replacement by intelligent machines. A good example is in the assembly line in mobile app development company. A typical assembly line which would have given jobs to 30-50 people can be automated such that only 5 people will be needed for monitoring and supervision.
But this could be taken to a whole new level through the introduction of latest technology such as driverless cars. This could lead to loss of several jobs like taxi drivers and chauffeurs.
Lack of judgment calls:
No matter how smart an artificial intelligence robot is, it would still lack the judgment calls associated with humans. There are times when human judgment and calls are necessary and not something decided based on algorithms and calculations. A good example is the Sydney Australia shooting that took place in 2014.
When people started calling Uber to escape from the affected area, rather than make a decision to help those in need, the algorithm made its decision on the economies of supply and demand and hiked the price of its rides.
Lack of original creativity:
When it comes to innovative creativity and imagination for mobile app development company, you can only find it in humans. Artificial intelligent machines will help to design and create but have no capacity for the original creative ability that is found in humans. These devices lack the sensitivity and feeling that is found in humans.
No improvement in experience:
In humans, learning comes as a factor of experience. But this is not so with artificial intelligent machines in mobile app development company. Of course, they can store a lot of information, but they are unable to access this information the same way humans does.
They cannot alter their reactions and responses according to a changing environment. They cannot make a distinction between someone who is hardworking and someone who is inefficient. They lack the human touch necessary for effective living.

'Erica' the android will soon become a TV news anchor in Japan, her creator says.

At a mere 23 years old, Japan's latest news anchor would make her parents proud — if she had any.Erica, a lifelike android designed to look like a 23-year-old woman, may soon become a TV news anchor in Japan, the Wall Street Journal reported. According to Hiroshi Ishiguro, director of the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory at Osaka Universityand Erica's creator, the android will replace a human news anchor on the airwaves as soon as April, the Daily Mail said.Erica the android may be well suited for this desk job. For starters, she can capably recite scripted writing and sit in a chair, making her about as qualified for television as most humans. (According to Ishiguro, the android was originally designed to be a receptionist.)

Erica is capable of holding a conversation with humans, thanks to a combination of speech-generation algorithms, facial-recognition technology and infrared sensors that allow her to track faces across a room, the Daily Mail reported. While she cannot move her arms yet, Erica can move her facial features, neck, shoulders and waist independently, Ishiguro Laboratories said, allowing her to respond to human speech with uncanny autonomy.LATEST VIDEOS FROM livescienceLive ScienceAccording to the Daily Mail, Erica has been described by her creator as being so lifelike that she could ""have a soul.""Others might call her uncanny. But Erica will hardly be the first eerily lifelike robot to hold a mass human audience. In October 2017, a robot named Sophia was granted citizenship to Saudi Arabia after impressing journalists with her answers to simple interview questions at a tech conference in Riyadh.When asked about the uncanny valley — a psychological effect that activates when an artificial human entity looks both eerily familiar and foreign at the same time — Sophia was less than sympathetic.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.""Am I really that creepy?""

The project will be run with the support and participation of different governmental, semi-governmental, and private institutions.Major General Ibrahim Khalil Al Mansouri, Assistant Commander for Criminal Investigations of Dubai Police, announcing the project at a press conference said that aim of Oyoon is to created an integrated security system that works through all strategic partners to exploit modern and sophisticated technologies and artificial intelligence features to prevent crime, reduce traffic accident related deaths, prevent any negative incidents in residential, commercial and vital areas and to be able to respond immediately to incidents even before they get reported to the command unit.He also added that the project will also contribute to help police with the decision-making process and optimizing human resources by reducing their intervention in areas of monitoring, analysis and surveillance.“The project is an effective translation of the UAE’s strategy for artificial intelligence to achieve its objectives of relying on services, data analysis and smart application in various fields of work efficiently and effectively. In addition to integrating the first line services of the Dubai Police provided to the public through artificial intelligence in the main police operations,” he continued.Arabian Business citing some police sources reported that the project will feature a facial-recognition software that can identify the suspects, microphone-enabled cameras that can ‘speak’ to suspects in public and license plate readers.UAE had last year appointed a 27 year old as its Artificial Intelligence Minister becoming the first country to do so and a Dubai-based startup Derq that uses artificial intelligence to reduce road-accidents has been running a pilot in some areas of the city. So the government has been working on different initiatives that use modern technologies for some time to make Dubai a safer city to live in for the residents.The whole surveillance thing reminds us about this American TV show called Person of Interest. What’s different however is that in the TV show it was a secret system with public being unaware that they’re being watched. In Dubai’s case, public has been informed which is perhaps a good thing. Here’s a trailer of the show.The future might be safer but its going to get creepier as well.AuthorRecent Posts MB StaffLatest posts by MB Staff (see all) Dubai’s BitOasis gets acquired by Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX - July 3, 2024 Egyptian fintech Connect Money raises $8 million seed for its embedded finance platform - June 25, 2024 Nvidia expands to Middle East, partners with Qatar’s Ooredoo to offer AI-powered GPU-as-a-Service - June 23, 2024  Post Views: 9,595  Related Items:AI, Artificial Intelligence, Dubai, UAE, United Arab EmiratesRecommended for you     Dubai’s BitOasis gets acquired by Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX     Dubai’s Tenderd raises $30 million Series A for its heavy equipment management platform     Dubai fintech Stake raises $14 million Series A to grow its fractional real estate investment platform",,,,,"[{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.menabytes.com/dubai-police-ai/', 'url': 'https://www.menabytes.com/dubai-police-ai/', 'name': 'Dubai Police to use artificial intelligence and data analytics to prevent crimes', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.menabytes.com/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.menabytes.com/dubai-police-ai/#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.menabytes.com/dubai-police-ai/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.menabytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Artificial-Intelligence-Surveillance.jpg?fit=1000%2C586&ssl=1', 'datePublished': '2018-01-28T08:11:38+00:00', 'dateModified': '2018-01-28T08:13:44+00:00', 'author': {'@id': 'https://www.menabytes.com/#/schema/person/52356088a9824dd860e5d6ba9f8bfeab'}, 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://www.menabytes.com/dubai-police-ai/#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://www.menabytes.com/dubai-police-ai/']}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://www.menabytes.com/dubai-police-ai/#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.menabytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Artificial-Intelligence-Surveillance.jpg?fit=1000%2C586&ssl=1', 'contentUrl': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.menabytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Artificial-Intelligence-Surveillance.jpg?fit=1000%2C586&ssl=1', 'width': 1000, 'height': 586}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://www.menabytes.com/dubai-police-ai/#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://www.menabytes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Dubai Police to use artificial intelligence and data analytics to prevent crimes'}]}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.menabytes.com/#website', 'url': 'https://www.menabytes.com/', 'name': 'MENAbytes', 'description': 'Tech &amp; Startups from Middle East, North Africa, Turkey &amp; Pakistan', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': {'@type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://www.menabytes.com/?s={search_term_string}'}, 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.menabytes.com/#/schema/person/52356088a9824dd860e5d6ba9f8bfeab', 'name': 'MB Staff', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://www.menabytes.com/#/schema/person/image/', 'url': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.menabytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/menabytes-logo-short-1a2930-Copy-200.png?fit=96%2C96&ssl=1', 'contentUrl': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.menabytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/menabytes-logo-short-1a2930-Copy-200.png?fit=96%2C96&ssl=1', 'caption': 'MB Staff'}, 'url': 'https://www.menabytes.com/author/mbstaff/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

✓ Link copied to clipboard!  Updated | In 2013, James ""Jimi"" Crawford founded a company called Orbital Insight, barely noticed at the time amid the Silicon Valley froth. Crawford had worked at NASA for 15 years and wrote software for Mars rovers. He left NASA to run engineering for Google Books, and while there he noticed that Elon Musk's SpaceX and other new companies were driving down the cost of building and launching satellites. Crawford saw an opportunity to collect and analyze what he anticipated would be a deluge of images from a surfeit of new satellites that would circle the Earth, taking readings and pictures. Orbital Insight's first product looked at images of cornfields all over the world, analyzing the health of plants to predict yields for traders who bet on future price swings.About two years later, Silicon Valley's top investors decided Orbital Insight might be huge. Venture firms pumped $20 million into Crawford's company in June 2016 and then another $50 million in September 2017.That surge of excitement wasn't because Crawford (or investors) suddenly got smarter—it was because of significant advances in alternative intelligence. ""In 2015, for the first time ever, computers got better at object recognition than humans,"" Crawford has explained. AI can learn to recognize a tree or ship and see patterns amid billions of objects in images and data. Prior to such AI breakthroughs, satellite data were infinitely less useful—too cumbersome to be analyzed at fast enough speeds by traditional algorithms running on computers. Using AI, all that raw output from satellites can help traders, investors and corporations know things they could never know before and almost as soon as they happen.

Early in 2017, Orbital Insight got attention for being able to mix data from various sources to find pirate fishing boats that had gone dark by turning off their radio beacons—a discovery more useful to maritime law enforcement than business, but a strong proof point for the company's technology. In the fall, Crawford's team relied on data from a new type of satellite technology called synthetic aperture radar to peer through Hurricane Harvey's clouds as the storm hammered Houston. The usual satellite photos, as you might guess, can't see through clouds. Knowing the extent of flooding during the hurricane proved tremendously helpful to insurance companies that would have to settle billions of dollars of claims later. Those two wins—the pirate ships and Harvey—helped convince hedge funds and major banks to pay Orbital Insight millions for data sets that might help them learn something about natural resources, the movement of goods or anything else that the competition didn't yet know. ""We've only just begun to uncover a handful of signals, but we've already seen the impact they can have on financial, energy and insurance markets, as well as society as a whole,"" Crawford said in a statement.

But that's only the beginning. Orbital Insight and companies like it are ravenous for raw satellite data, so they are buying it from satellite companies, adding more fuel to the satellite boom. The relatively inexpensive, small satellites that observe conditions on Earth are the fastest-growing segment of the $260.5 billion global satellite industry, the Satellite Industries Association said in a report in July 2017. That's helping create a cascade of jobs, from rocket scientists (of course) down to maintenance workers who sweep launch pads. In December, LinkedIn listed more than 11,084 satellite industry job openings in the U.S. Related Stories

Humans vs. Robots: Artificial Intelligence Beats Top Pilot in NASA and Google Drone Race
Humans vs. Robots: Artificial Intelligence Beats Top Pilot in NASA and Google Drone Race																					

Orbital Insight is just one of a many new companies in an exploding field called alternative data. The market for alternative data was about $200 million in 2016 and is expected to shoot to more than twice that by 2020, according to research firm Tabb Group. Alternative data refers to data outside of mainstream information, such as government statistics, stock prices, company financial reports and consumer credit card transactions. Alternative data comes from sources such as cellphone signals, ""internet of things"" sensors on industrial equipment, online videos, tweets, searches, social media likes—and satellite images.Making use of all that raw data often means connecting several types of data to get a glimpse of a trend otherwise impossible to spot. AI makes that possible. The alternative data industry could not exist without AI. And an alternative data industry could not exist without humans. At a time when most of the rap against AI is that it will kill jobs, the rise of the alternative data business shows how AI can create jobs nobody even thought of before.Double Data-ingIt's easy to believe artificial intelligence is about to automate away truck drivers, radiologists, accountants, fast-food clerks and just about every kind of manufacturing job and leave the world with just two classes of people: a thin layer of rich geeks on top and then the rest of us—a giant, grumbling population of families living on government-issued guaranteed incomes and spending our days doing little more than playing with model trains or clicking down YouTube rabbit holes. When Quartz surveyed 1,600 readers this past July, 90 percent agreed that half of today's jobs will be lost to automation in five years—though in classic human thinking, 91 percent of respondents said other people's jobs will be axed, not their own.In recent months, however, some smart folks in the business world have been arguing that our future isn't so bleak, rolling out study after study showing AI will create many more jobs than it will destroy. A study by tech analyst firm Gartner concluded that by 2020, AI will automate 1.8 million people out of work but will create 2.3 million jobs—a net gain of 500,000 jobs. Capgemini, a consulting group, released a report saying that 83 percent of companies that implemented AI found that the technology created new jobs. Deloitte, another consulting firm, studied automation in the United Kingdom and found that 800,000 low-skilled jobs were eliminated because of AI, but another 3.5 million positions were created, and those new jobs pay on average $13,000 more per year than the jobs that went poof.Such statistics aren't always comforting in the face of an AI threat that seems so obvious. If we build self-driving trucks, millions of truck drivers will be rendered obsolete. We have dealt with the AI-driven chatbots replacing the human customer-service reps who used to answer our calls about how to buy the right size shoe or fix a finicky cable TV box. Last year, Deloitte did another study showing that within a decade, AI will automate away 39 percent of jobs in the legal sector—mostly lower-level paralegals and legal secretaries. We are familiar with those kinds of jobs and can easily imagine how people will get hurt if they are replaced by AI.It's harder to imagine industries that don't yet exist and how they will create jobs for all types of workers, not just those who have an innate knack for writing code or designing a computer chip. That's what makes the alternative data industry intriguing now: It is one of the early, emerging industries that has come into being because of AI. (Others range from the business of making computer chips specifically to run AI to a budding field of ""AI ethicists"" who teach AI to behave well.)The investing world awakened to alternative data thanks to an event in April 2016. Foursquare, the location-based social networking app, detected something odd in its data from the 50 million people using its apps to log the places they visited. At the time, the Chipotle restaurant chain was working to bounce back from a 2015 E. coli scare, and it reported that seasonal foot traffic to its restaurants appeared to be getting back to normal. But Foursquare noticed that its users who had previously visited a Chipotle were going to other restaurants instead. The foot traffic was due to promotions that lured in newcomers who just wanted to get a cut-price burrito. That meant Chipotle was losing its loyal customers. Foursquare made note of this in a blog post just before Chipotle reported earnings that showed that sales dropped 30 percent. Suddenly, traders around the world wanted the kind of magic Foursquare possessed.In recent years, the generators of new kinds of raw data have been exploding. We carry cellphones everywhere, creating sometimes-anonymous and sometimes-not data about where we are when we do certain things. Newfangled sensors track industrial parts, air quality, how many steps we walk. The more we do online, the more data our activity generates—and these days we shop, talk, socialize, bank, work and watch TV on computer or phone screens.

  A single source of data might result in a narrow insight into people's behavior, but there is exponential value in crossing different kinds of data sets. ""No matter how large your data set, you'll always miss the bigger picture if you're viewing it in isolation,"" Adam Gibbs of alternative data company Enigma tells me. ""The true value of data lies in connecting many pieces together from various sources to create a holistic view.""That's where AI becomes critical. It works somewhat like a research assistant. You tell it that you have a theory about what might be learned by cross-referencing different kinds of data and set the AI loose to crawl all that data and learn on its own, looking for complex patterns that would escape even brilliant humans. And unlike a human, an AI bot can absorb and learn from massive floods of data in an instant.Matei Zatreanu, founder of alternative data company System2, noted that AI learning coupled with multiple data streams can help investors see the world at a granular level, such as understanding the decisions of individuals. ""You can look at credit card data—that gives info on an individual person,"" Zatreanu told Business Insider. ""The huge difference is, unlike marketers, I don't care that your name is Rachael and you live at a certain address. I just care that a person with ID 345 used to shop at a Whole Foods but then—all of a sudden—an Aldi opens up in your neighborhood, and now I see that person with ID 345 no longer shops there, and I see an Aldi transaction. That means Whole Foods potentially lost a customer.""Such insights can suggest trends stock traders or hedge fund managers can bet on. The slightest edge from alternative data can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars—the difference between an underperforming fund and a hot ""alpha"" fund. ""The ability to source and analyze alternative data has become an essential skill for professional investors,"" said Tammer Kamel, CEO of alternative data provider Quandl, in a statement.With so much money at stake, unique alternative data has become highly valuable, and that's luring entrepreneurs to start all sorts of alternative data companies. Aclima and Understory rely on sensors to zero in on superlocalized weather patterns. Premise gathers prices from local stores. Enigma connects the kind of data governments have long supplied—like what doctors are prescribing to Medicare patients or which models of cars are coming into U.S. ports—in new ways, creating alternative data out of traditional data. Reveal Mobile is crossing GPS data with credit-card transactions to figure out people's patterns during the day. ""When you go on errands, we'll be able to see that you go to Home Depot first, then the grocery store, then go to lunch,"" Reveal CEO Brian Handly said at a recent Newsweek conference on data and finance. Marketers might be able to anticipate your pattern and send you a lunch discount offer the minute you pull into the Home Depot parking lot.All these companies are hiring AI specialists and programmers. They're also looking for people who are not necessarily technologists but know how to ask interesting questions for the AI to check out. Foursquare would never have made hay about the Chipotle data if someone hadn't thought to wonder whether the foot traffic was from new or old customers. An expert in iron ore might know questions to ask AI about the movement of barges to get some insight about whether production globally is up or down.This is all new work—jobs nobody could've imagined a decade ago, when the iPhone first came out.IoT JobsMany jobs are getting created downstream from the hedge funds and alternative data companies. Look at the activity stirred up by one class of alternative data company that buys enormous amounts of information collected by ""internet of things"" sensors. More than 8 billion connected things are already deployed worldwide, according to Gartner, and that's expected to rise to 20 billion by 2020. Global spending on the IoT is expected to grow nearly 16 percent a year through 2020, when the market will reach $1.3 trillion, according to technology analyst firm IDC. That's a lot of commerce—and that means a lot of jobs for employees at all levels. Verizon, for instance, needs an army of workers to install IoT sensors in millions of street lamps. Those sensors track noise levels, air quality, the number of cars in parking lots and other factors. Other companies are hiring IoT designers and managers—retailer Target hired a vice president of IoT last year. Without AI making all that data valuable, little of this would be happening.We are in the midst of an AI-driven data-gathering boom. In business circles, the meme is that ""data is the new oil""—and finding new data is the new prospecting craze.Which takes us back to satellites. By creating a rich market for satellite data, companies like Orbital Insight fund growth in the business of designing, making, launching and operating satellites. That's given birth to new companies such as Planet—founded, like Orbital Insight, by former NASA scientists. Planet is making satellites about the size of a footlong sub, and it operates 200 in orbit and raised $183 million in funding. Another young company, PlanetIQ, is working on launching a 12-satellite constellation.

  Down the satellite food chain, new satellite operators drive business for satellite manufacturers in the United States (Boeing, Orbital ATK, SSL) and overseas (Dhruva Space in India, NanoAvionics in Lithuania). Those manufacturers, in turn, buy from makers of electronics, antennae, solar panels, nuts, bolts and everything else that goes into a satellite. The workers in factories making the nuts and bolts for satellites may not know anything about AI, but AI is a big reason they're employed.It's impossible to count how many downstream jobs are already directly attributable to AI, yet there's no question AI makes data far more valuable than ever—the way the mechanized loom made cotton more valuable 250 years ago by greatly multiplying what could be produced with cotton.It's true that AI will automate away vast numbers of jobs in coming years. But emerging sectors like alternative data promise to give many more humans something to do more productive than watching Simon's Cat all day.Correction: A previous version of this article referred to Planet as ""Planet Labs."" The company changed its name from Planet Labs to Planet in 2016. A past version of this article also misstated the number of satellites Planet operates. It currently operates 200 satellites.

  ",Artificial Intelligence Will Be a Human Jobs Creator,https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/780304/fe-ai-01.jpg,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.newsweek.com/2018/01/26/artificial-intelligence-create-human-jobs-783730.html'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Updated&nbsp;| In 2013, James ""Jimi"" Crawford founded a company called Orbital Insight, barely noticed at the time amid the Silicon Valley froth. Crawford had worked at NASA for 15 years and wrote software for Mars rovers. He left NASA to run engineering for Google Books, and while there he noticed that Elon Musk's SpaceX and other new companies were driving down the cost of building and launching satellites. Crawford saw an opportunity to collect and analyze what he anticipated would be a deluge of images from a surfeit of new satellites that would circle the Earth, taking readings and pictures. Orbital Insight's first product looked at images of cornfields all over the world, analyzing the health of plants to predict yields for traders who bet on future price swings.About two years later, Silicon Valley's top investors decided Orbital Insight might be huge. Venture firms pumped $20 million into Crawford's company in June 2016 and then another $50 million in September 2017.That surge of excitement wasn't because Crawford (or investors) suddenly got smarter&mdash;it was because of significant advances in alternative intelligence. ""In 2015, for the first time ever, computers got better at object recognition than humans,"" Crawford has explained. AI can learn to recognize a tree or ship and see patterns amid billions of objects in images and data. Prior to such AI breakthroughs, satellite data were infinitely less useful&mdash;too cumbersome to be analyzed at fast enough speeds by traditional algorithms running on computers. Using AI, all that raw output from satellites can help traders, investors and corporations know things they could never know before and almost as soon as they happen.Early in 2017, Orbital Insight got attention for being able to mix data from various sources to find pirate fishing boats that had gone dark by turning off their radio beacons&mdash;a discovery more useful to maritime law enforcement than business, but a strong proof point for the company's technology.

Today Microsoft is releasing a new book, The Future Computed: Artificial Intelligence and its role in society. The two of us have written the foreword for the book, and our teams collaborated to write its contents. As the title suggests, the book provides our perspective on where AI technology is going and the new societal issues it has raised.
On a personal level, our work on the foreword provided an opportunity to step back and think about how much technology has changed our lives over the past two decades and to consider the changes that are likely to come over the next 20 years. In 1998, we both worked at Microsoft, but on opposite sides of the globe. While we lived on separate continents and in quite different cultures, we shared similar experiences and daily routines which were managed by manual planning and movement. Twenty years later, we take for granted the digital world that was once the stuff of science fiction.
Technology – including mobile devices and cloud computing – has fundamentally changed the way we consume news, plan our day, communicate, shop and interact with our family, friends and colleagues. Two decades from now, what will our world look like? At Microsoft, we imagine that artificial intelligence will help us do more with one of our most precious commodities: time. By 2038, personal digital assistants will be trained to anticipate our needs, help manage our schedule, prepare us for meetings, assist as we plan our social lives, reply to and route communications, and drive cars.
Beyond our personal lives, AI will enable breakthrough advances in areas like healthcare, agriculture, education and transportation. It’s already happening in impressive ways.
But as we’ve witnessed over the past 20 years, new technology also inevitably raises complex questions and broad societal concerns. As we look to a future powered by a partnership between computers and humans, it’s important that we address these challenges head on.
How do we ensure that AI is designed and used responsibly? How do we establish ethical principles to protect people? How should we govern its use? And how will AI impact employment and jobs?
To answer these tough questions, technologists will need to work closely with government, academia, business, civil society and other stakeholders. At Microsoft, we’ve identified six ethical principles – fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability – to guide the cross-disciplinary development and use of artificial intelligence. The better we understand these or similar issues — and the more technology developers and users can share best practices to address them — the better served the world will be as we contemplate societal rules to govern AI.
We must also pay attention to AI’s impact on workers. What jobs will AI eliminate? What jobs will it create? If there has been one constant over 250 years of technological change, it has been the ongoing impact of technology on jobs — the creation of new jobs, the elimination of existing jobs and the evolution of job tasks and content. This too is certain to continue.
Some key conclusions are emerging.
First, the companies and countries that will fare best in the AI era will be those that embrace these changes rapidly and effectively. This is because new jobs and economic growth will come to those that embrace the technology, not those that resist or delay adopting it.
Second, while we believe that AI will help solve big societal problems, we must look to this future with a critical eye. There will be challenges as well as opportunities. We must address the need for strong ethical principles, the evolution of laws, training for new skills and even labor market reforms. This must all come together if we’re going to make the most of AI.
Third, we need to act with a sense of shared responsibility because AI won’t be created by the tech sector alone. At Microsoft we’re working to democratize AI in a manner that’s similar to how we made  the PC available to everyone. This means we’re creating tools to make it easy for every developer, business and government to build AI-based solutions and accelerate the benefit to society.
All of this leads us to what may be one of the most important conclusions of all. Skilling-up for an AI-powered world involves more than science, technology, engineering and math. As computers behave more like humans, the social sciences and humanities will become even more important. Languages, art, history, economics, ethics, philosophy, psychology and human development courses can teach critical, philosophical and ethics-based skills that will be instrumental in the development and management of AI solutions. If AI is to reach its potential in serving humans, then every engineer will need to learn more about the liberal arts and every liberal arts major will need to learn more about engineering.
While we don’t have a crystal ball that shows us the future, we do know that we’re all going to need to spend more time listening to and learning from each other. We hope that The Future Computed can contribute to this conversation.

Whether the ""robots"" take the form of artificially intelligent (AI) software programs or humanoid machines, research suggests that technology is poised to automate a huge proportion of jobs worldwide, disrupting the global economy and leaving millions unemployed.But just which jobs are on the chopping block is still a subject of debate.Some experts have suggested that autonomous systems will replace us in jobs for which humans are unsuited anyway — those that are dull, dirty, and dangerous. That's already happening. Robots clean nuclear disaster sites and work construction jobs. Desk jobs aren't immune to the robot takeover, however — machines are replacing finance experts, outperforming doctors, and competing with advertising masterminds.The unique demands placed on primary and secondary school teachers make this position different from many other jobs at risk of automation. Students all learn differently, and a good teacher must attempt to deliver lessons in a way that resonates with every child in the classroom. Some students may have behavioral or psychological problems that inhibit or complicate that process. Others may have parents who are too involved, or not involved enough, in their education. Effective teachers must be able to navigate these many hurdles while satisfying often-changing curriculum requirements.In short, the job demands that teachers have nearly superhuman levels of empathy, grit, and organization. Creating robotic teachers that can meet all these demands might be challenging, but in the end, could these AI-enhanced entities solve our most pervasive and systemic issues in education?Room For ImprovementIn 2015, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a plan for eliminating poverty through sustainable development. One goal listed on the agenda is to ensure everyone in the world has equal access to a quality education. Specific targets include completely free primary and secondary education, access to updated education facilities, and instruction from qualified teachers.Some nations will have a tougher time meeting these goals than others. As of 2014, roughly nine percent of primary school-aged children (ages 5 to 11) weren't in school, according to the same UNESCO report. For lower secondary school-aged children (ages 12 to 14), that percentage jumps to 16 percent. More than 70 percent of out-of-school children live in Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. In the latter region, a majority of the schools aren't equipped with electricity or potable water, and depending on the grade level, between 26 and 56 percent of teachers aren't properly trained.To meet UNESCO's target of equal access to quality education, the world needs a lot more qualified teachers. The organization reports that we must add 20.1 million primary and secondary school teachers to the workforce, while also finding replacements for the 48.6 million expected to leave in the next 13 years due to retirement, the end of a temporary contract, or the desire to pursue a different profession with better pay or better working conditions. That's...a lot of teachers. So it's easy to see the appeal of using a robotic teacher to fill these gaps. Sure, it takes a lot of time and money to automate an entire profession. But after the initial development costs, administrators wouldn't need to worry about paying digital teachers. This saved money could then be used to pay for the needed updates to education facilities or other costs associated with providing all youth with a free education.Digital teachers wouldn't need days off and would never be late for work. Administrators could upload any changes to curricula across an entire fleet of AI instructors, and the systems would never make mistakes. If programmed correctly, they also wouldn't show any biases toward students based on gender, race, socio-economic status, personality preference, or other consideration.But we still have some ways to go before such instructors enter our classrooms.Education systems are ""only as good as the teachers who provide the hands-on schooling,"" UNESCO claims, and today's robots simply can't match human teachers in the quality of education they provide to students. In fact, they won't be able to for at least the next decade, Rose Luckin, a professor at the University College London Knowledge Lab, a research center focused on how digital media can transform education, told Futurism. Teachers rely heavily on social interaction to support their students and figure out what they need, Luckin continued, and so far no digital system can compete with a human in this realm.However, it is possible that no robot will ever be good enough to replace teachers completely. ""I do not believe that any robot can fulfill the wide range of tasks that a human teacher completes on a daily basis, nor do I believe that any robot will develop the vast repertoire of skills and abilities that a human teacher possesses,"" Luckin said.There is some weight to Luckin's assertions. While machines can handle a variety of specific tasks, we haven't yet come close to creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) — the kind of machine that could answer the tough questions outside the purview of the immediate lesson that good teachers should be prepared to tackle. Today's robots also lack the empathy and ability to inspire that teachers bring to the classroom.That doesn't mean robots won't replace teachers, though. Very few studies directly compare human and robot teachers, so it's not clear how much better the human performs than the robot.In any case, Luckin suggests a compromise: AI and automated systems could have collaborative roles in the education system. That would enable teachers and students to take advantage of the tech in ways that will benefit them both, and we wouldn't need to worry about lack of oversight for when our AI systems do encounter problems.AI in Every ClassroomFor teachers, the classroom is anything but serene. Kids giggle during lessons, call out, rustle papers, and fidget — teachers must compete with the chaos to simply get students to learn. And teachers take their jobs home with them, too, spending their evenings and weekends planning lessons and grading student work. What if AI could act as an extra pair of hands in the classroom? That was the idea Luckin and her co-author put forth in a recent paper. This AI assistant could manage tasks such as taking attendance or routine grading. It could also help teachers generate new lessons by autonomously navigating online teaching resources, such as Teachers Pay Teachers, to find the lesson plans most likely to resonate with a classroom based on the details of the students and the school's specific curriculum.Decreasing the workload dumped on teachers would hopefully make them less stressed. This could limit the burnout that has exacerbated the teacher shortage and make the position more appealing to others considering becoming teachers. In her paper, Luckin predicted that every teacher could have a dedicated AI assistant within the next decade. But AI could do more than the drudgery of teaching — it could actually make teachers better by giving them greater insight into their students' needs. Classrooms could be equipped with language processors, speech and gesture recognition technology, eye-tracking, and other physiological sensors to collect and analyze information about each student, Luckin writes. Instead of waiting for a test or a raised hand for a student to display her understanding of the material, teachers could access real-time information that could show them why the student might not be learning at full capacity. They'd know which students weren't getting enough sleep, if they had inadequate diets, if they were suffering from emotional stress — information that can affect a student's performance but that can be difficult to tease out in the classroom.The teacher could use this information to tailor his or her teaching strategies to meet the needs of each individual student. They could simply look at a list generated by the AI to see what each student should work on that day. If a student needed extra one-on-one attention, the teacher could instruct that student to work with an AI-powered Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that adjusts its approach to match the student's learning style. Meanwhile, the teacher may decide to give other students group work so they could hone their interpersonal skills.The system could also help students modify their behavior to improve their own performance. For example, a student might learn that she scores lower on exams when she stayed up late the night before, drank coffee that morning, or took public transport to school instead of walking. By altering these habits in the future, she could score better on the tests and excel.Image Credit: PixabayAs Luckin told Futurism, the increased use of AI in education could have downsides. Schools will need to guard against the misuse of student data, and cybersecurity will be of the utmost importance. Still, these types of precautions won't be limited to education. Data protection will be a universal concern as the Internet of Things (IoT) grows and our world gets increasingly ""smart.""A few decades in the future, every student and teacher could be the master of their own personal educational analytics, Luckin predicts. That information could be useful beyond the classroom — students may choose to share certain analytics along with their college admission packages, while teachers may include theirs in applications for future employment.Not My ClassroomAs previously noted, it will be a little while before every teacher has an AI assistant and every student has an AI tutor. Developing the necessary technology will be the simple part, Luckin said, and already, some researchers are working on such systems.Convincing parents, teachers, and students to embrace AI in education will be the real challenge. Some may be biased against the technology for fear it will leave them unemployed, while others may have a hard time shaking thoughts of the doomsday scenarios posited by tech luminaries such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking.Teachers, in particular, are likely to be more resistant to automation because teaching is an ""inherently human process,"" Terry Heick, founder and director of TeachThought, a publisher of teaching materials and resources that are focused on innovation in education, told Futurism.He said teachers might take the suggestion that a ""symbolically mindless robot"" could do their work as an indication that others see their skillset as easy to duplicate. In fact, said Heick, the opposite is true — teaching is such an ""impossible"" task that anything that could make the job easier on teachers should be valued. To ease this resistance, researchers and tech companies could involve educators, parents, and students in the development of AI systems designed for the classroom, as Luckin suggests in her paper. Stakeholders could see that their input and experience is valuable; they could even identify weaknesses in systems under development. Researchers can tailor systems to suit the needs of educators, students, and parents, improving the final product. Skeptics could see how AI could improve the learning experience.For this process to go well, it needs to be slow and iterative. It will likely take decades at best.""Considering that education still hasn’t embraced mobile technology, the idea of Johnny 5 circling around a classroom teaching students in just a decade seems far-fetched,"" Heick said. But maybe someday.Share This ArticleRead This NextYou Can't Always Get What You WantAnalyst Predicts Tesla Shareholders Are Going to Vote Down Elon Musk's Gigantic Pay Package This WeekJob AutomationOops!

Artificial intelligence can beat humans at games such as Jeopardy, chess and Go, but these much-celebrated achievements aren’t actually what we need. We want AI to work with us not against us – and the key may be a little banter.
Jacob Crandall at Brigham Young University in Utah and his colleagues created an algorithm capable of learning to cooperate with people that uses short snippets of conversation known as “cheap talk”.
By including chit-chat, the team doubled the rate of cooperation between humans and AI across 472 games. These games were two-player…

It’s 2038 and — like most businesses these days — a tech company is using artificial intelligence to scan job applicants. The system was trained with public employment records, an ostensibly unbiased dataset.
But even 20 years after sex-based discrimination was thrust into the media spotlight, the tech industry still hasn’t fully corrected its gender imbalance. The job screening system “learns” that most software engineers are men and starts favoring male candidates over women.
This dangerous scenario is one of many posited in “The Future Computed,” a new book published by Microsoft, with a foreword by Brad Smith, Microsoft president and chief legal officer, and Harry Shum, executive vice president of Microsoft’s Artificial Intelligence and Research group.
The book examines the use cases and potential dangers of AI technology, which will soon be integrated into many of the systems people use everyday. Microsoft believes AI should be developed with six core principles: “fair, reliable and safe, private and secure, inclusive, transparent, and accountable.”
Nimble policymaking and strong ethical guidelines are essential to ensuring AI doesn’t threaten equity or security, Microsoft says. In other words, we need to start planning now to avoid a scenario like the one facing the imaginary tech company looking for software engineers.
Microsoft suggests governments lead the way in establishing best practices for AI by integrating the technology into systems that serve the public. “While enabling more effective delivery of services for citizens, this will also provide governments with firsthand experience in developing best practices to address the ethical principles identified,” the book says.

Microsoft also suggests governments invest in better ways to make data public without connecting that data to individuals. AI relies on data — and large public datasets can be a useful tool in training the technology — but only if personal identifying information is protected.
“Additional research to enhance ‘de-identification’ techniques and ongoing discussions about how to balance the risks of re-identification against the social benefits will be important,” the book says.
But, Microsoft warns, governments shouldn’t go overboard. The book says regulators should avoid “rigid approaches” because not all personal information is equally sensitive and AI needs some identifying data, such as public health records, to achieve societal benefits.
Competitiveness is also a concern. AI needs data to learn and the keepers of the largest datasets in the world are a small handful of tech companies, Microsoft included. The book’s authors suggest government data as an antidote to this concern, allowing challengers to the Big Tech incumbents to feed their data-hungry AI systems.
Brad Smith, Microsoft president and chief legal officer, and Harry Shum, executive vice president of Microsoft’s Artificial Intelligence and Research group, wrote the foreword to ‘The Future Computed.’ (Microsoft Photo)
“The question of the availability of data will arise most directly when one firm seeks to buy another and competition authorities need to consider whether the combined firms would possess datasets that are so valuable and unique that no other firms can compete effectively,” Microsoft says in the book.
Microsoft’s recommendations boil down to an ethical code, designed to ensure governments and technologists recognize the risks associated with AI and build the technology with safeguards in mind.
“In computer science, will concerns about the impact of AI mean that the study of ethics will become a requirement for computer programmers and researchers? We believe that’s a safe bet,” write Smith and Shum in the book’s foreword. “Could we see a Hippocratic Oath for coders like we have for doctors? That could make sense.”
The book is available to download starting tonight, and will be released in the coming weeks on Amazon Kindle.

While jobs such as driving vehicles are likely to go, managerial jobs, including processing the huge amounts of data being collected from people today, will need to be created.An attendee tries out an application on the Pepper humanoid robot at SoftBank Robot World 2017 in Tokyo on November 21. Artificial intelligence will remove the need for many jobs in the service industry, it is predicted, but is expected to create more in high-tech roles that involve managing and utilising data. Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg“That’s a good indication that the world is changing and AI completely changes the way in which we operate,” said Abdul Rahman Al Thehaiban, senior vice president in technology for the Middle East and Africa at Oracle.""We are in an era of evolution and we anticipate a heavy adoption to AI. According to our studies, almost a third of all cloud customers are taking into consideration AI as part of their requirement."" Recent speculation has led many to think AI will mean less dependency on human capital.“But it’s completely the contrary,” he said. “We believe that [AI will mean] more focus of human capital into more innovation rather than just standard work. Its objective is for people to spend more time on creativity and innovation.”____________Read more[ UAE to train one million young Arab coders in the 'language of the future' ][ Minister of artificial intelligence appointed in UAE Cabinet reshuffle ]____________ As such, the company launched the Zayed Innovation Hub on Sunday – the first of its kind in the region - to attract and create the most promising ideas and applications that will shape the future.“The Zayed Innovation Hub represents a milestone in the Artificial Intelligence space, not only in the UAE but also in the region and to position the UAE as a global leader in AI,” Mr Al Olama said at the launch.“We expect this initiative to encourage other technology companies to emulate Oracle in supporting and training students and the Emirati youth.”From the government to the private sector, residents and students, the hub’s aim is to invest in local talent.“AI impacts all fields,” he said. “In the UAE, we are focusing on facing the future to ensure advancements of humanity.”The hub will not only be dedicated to the UAE or the region, but to eastern central Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which includes around 140 countries.“It is not just a normal hub,” Mr Al Thehaiban said. “It is fully dedicated to AI which gives us more of an obligation to ensure that we become part of the journey the UAE is transforming [into]. There have been many changes in IT and with the recent cloud engagement, this has been the fastest adoption across the world.”It will be open for all government users, private sector and students for any creative ideas.“But making AI easy to adopt is critical – a key challenge for organisations is that they can’t afford to wait,” he said.“So the hub will aim to address this challenge by engaging with key UAE audiences by raising their awareness levels, helping drive an innovative approach and also supporting the skills development of the next generation of Emirati leaders.”This year’s World Government Summit, which kicks off in Dubai next month, will introduce a Global Forum for Governance on AI for the first time.“The questions which the whole world is asking are whether AI is good or bad for humanity and if there is a risk for AI to have a higher ability to think and take decisions on behalf of human beings,” said Mohammed Al Gargawi, Minister of Cabinet Affairs and the Future.“There are two schools of thought. One says that 47 per cent of jobs will disappear in the coming 10 years and another says that with every new industrial revolution, jobs are lost.""The industrial revolution will create new job opportunities so here, we are discussing a virtual topic, but life with AI will be richer as humans will have more time to innovate, create and think about new ideas and sectors.”Experts say AI will reshape and improve the experience of tourism, healthcare, residents, education and businesses across the UAE, with studies showing that businesses using AI will steal up to 1.2 trillion dollars per year from their less-informed peers by 2020.“The success of strategic government initiatives like Smart Dubai and Expo 2020 is underpinned by emerging digital technologies like AI driving the creation of an automated infrastructure for the realisation of these projects”, said Arun Khehar, senior vice president of business applications in the Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa at Oracle.“The hub will serve as the ultimate platform for driving awareness, experimentation and implementation of AI in the UAE, and the opening of a state of the art Digital Hub in Dubai has now employed more than 400 cloud sales professionals.”",,https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/OSSOPMXWQXG2MLLIMHWKGHZFTI.jpg?smart=true&auth=548d043b2054cf5726745dc64b2bc578cac56b621b9e72a1c8b4ad3b8c29e780&width=400&height=225,,,,2021-06-21T02:05:59.966Z,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/government/500-emirati-men-and-women-in-first-batch-to-be-trained-in-artificial-intelligence-field-1.697341'}",,,[None],,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.thenationalnews.com/pf/resources/images/logo.png?d=748', 'width': 250, 'height': 69}",,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/TheNationalNews', 'https://x.com/TheNationalNews', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thenationalnews/', 'https://www.instagram.com/TheNationalNews.com', 'https://www.youtube.com/TheNationalNewspaper']",,,,"The first 500 Emirati men and women will soon start their training in artificial intelligence as the UAE looks to begin shaping its future in a field that is expected to soon touch every company and individual on the planet.

While jobs such as driving vehicles are likely to go, managerial jobs, including processing the huge amounts of data being collected from people today, will need to be created.  “That’s a good indication that the world is changing and AI completely changes the way in which we operate,” said Abdul Rahman Al Thehaiban, senior vice president in technology for the Middle East and Africa at Oracle. ""We are in an era of evolution and we anticipate a heavy adoption to AI. According to our studies, almost a third of all cloud customers are taking into consideration AI as part of their requirement.""<br/> Recent speculation has led many to think AI will mean less dependency on human capital. “But it’s completely the contrary,” he said. “We believe that [AI will mean] more focus of human capital into more innovation rather than just standard work. Its objective is for people to spend more time on creativity and innovation.” ____________ <strong>Read more</strong>   ____________<br/> As such, the company launched the Zayed Innovation Hub on Sunday – the first of its kind in the region - to attract and create the most promising ideas and applications that will shape the future. “The Zayed Innovation Hub represents a milestone in the Artificial Intelligence space, not only in the UAE but also in the region and to position the UAE as a global leader in AI,” Mr Al Olama said at the launch. “We expect this initiative to encourage other technology companies to emulate Oracle in supporting and training students and the Emirati youth.” From the government to the private sector, residents and students, the hub’s aim is to invest in local talent. “AI impacts all fields,” he said. “In the UAE, we are focusing on facing the future to ensure advancements of humanity.” The hub will not only be dedicated to the UAE or the region, but to eastern central Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which includes around 140 countries. “It is not just a normal hub,” Mr Al Thehaiban said. “It is fully dedicated to AI which gives us more of an obligation to ensure that we become part of the journey the UAE is transforming [into]. There have been many changes in IT and with the recent cloud engagement, this has been the fastest adoption across the world.” It will be open for all government users, private sector and students for any creative ideas. “But making AI easy to adopt is critical – a key challenge for organisations is that they can’t afford to wait,” he said. “So the hub will aim to address this challenge by engaging with key UAE audiences by raising their awareness levels, helping drive an innovative approach and also supporting the skills development of the next generation of Emirati leaders.” This year’s World Government Summit, which kicks off in Dubai next month, will introduce a Global Forum for Governance on AI for the first time. “The questions which the whole world is asking are whether AI is good or bad for humanity and if there is a risk for AI to have a higher ability to think and take decisions on behalf of human beings,” said Mohammed Al Gargawi, Minister of Cabinet Affairs and the Future. “There are two schools of thought. One says that 47 per cent of jobs will disappear in the coming 10 years and another says that with every new industrial revolution, jobs are lost. ""The industrial revolution will create new job opportunities so here, we are discussing a virtual topic, but life with AI will be richer as humans will have more time to innovate, create and think about new ideas and sectors.” Experts say AI will reshape and improve the experience of tourism, healthcare, residents, education and businesses across the UAE, with studies showing that businesses using AI will steal up to 1.2 trillion dollars per year from their less-informed peers by 2020. “The success of strategic government initiatives like Smart Dubai and Expo 2020 is underpinned by emerging digital technologies like AI driving the creation of an automated infrastructure for the realisation of these projects”, said Arun Khehar, senior vice president of business applications in the Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa at Oracle. “The hub will serve as the ultimate platform for driving awareness, experimentation and implementation of AI in the UAE, and the opening of a state of the art Digital Hub in Dubai has now employed more than 400 cloud sales professionals.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,

CMU Experts Lead Conversations at World Economic Forum

By Laura Kelly Email




A contingent of Carnegie Mellon University faculty, led by Interim President Farnam Jahanian, engaged in conversations about how big data and artificial intelligence are changing the world at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last week.
This year's theme, ""Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World,"" aimed to rededicate international leaders from across industries and disciplines to develop a shared narrative to improve the world.
""Carnegie Mellon is proud to have demonstrated our distinct expertise at the nexus of technology, business and human life at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year,"" Jahanian said. ""Our outstanding faculty presenters and panelists showed the global community that we not only pursue solutions to the world's most critical challenges, but we are also passionately committed to fostering access and broad societal inclusion in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a theme of this year's events.""


Among those innovators and scholars were faculty members Rita Singh, Marios Savvides and Jean Yang, who collaborated for an IdeasLab presentation, ""Ultra-Biometrics and Cybersecurity with Carnegie Mellon University.""


Singh, an associate research professor in the Machine Learning for Signal Processing Group, discussed her research, which allows for the pinpointing of people and insights into their biological makeup and surroundings through voice recognition.

Jean Yang, an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science, shared her research in encoding privacy frameworks and how to make them accessible to all. One of the pillars of her research that was discussed during the IdeasLabs was increasing security.
""Software is running more and more of our lives,"" Yang said. ""It's deciding everything from where we eat to who we date to what disease we get diagnosed with to how it gets treated.""

Illah Nourbakhsh, a professor in the Robotics Institute at CMU, discussed how to meet the needs of all within a growing global trade, geospatial technology, autonomous drones, and how to address global hunger and food security as a panelist at the Forum. Former Vice President Al Gore delivered the closing remarks of the session.
Again this year, the CREATE Lab at the Robotics Institute's billboard-sized EarthTime display was a popular draw among Forum attendees.
Justine Cassell, a professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, gave solo presentations, ""Governing Advanced Technologies: Machine Learning"" and ""Global Tech, Local Solutions: Artificial Intelligence."" In ""Machine Learning,"" Cassell addressed how machine learning will soon be used everywhere and discussed what first principles should shape its governance. In ""Artificial Intelligence,"" closing the gaps in access to information and smart algorithms were discussed.


In addition to IdeasLab, Singh, Savvides and Yang delivered solo presentations throughout the conference.
Formal talks are only a part of the Davos experience. Participants said informal interactions are an important part such as an extended conversation between CMU Trustee and CEO of Cognizant Francisco D'Souza, President Jahanian and musician will.i.am.
CMU also hosted a reception attended by many Davos participants including U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta.

We are living in interesting times, where digital assistants schedule meetings, chatbots work alongside humans as teaching assistants, and your suitcase can now become self driving luggage as showcased at CES, 2018.  The implications are just starting to be felt in the workplace. In 2017, I wrote about how The Employee Experience is the Future of Work. Now, as we enter 2018, the next journey for HR leaders will be to leverage artificial intelligence combined with human intelligence and create a more personalized employee experience.

Artificial Intelligence Is Transforming The Workplace 
As we increase our personal usage of chatbots (defined as software which provides an automated, yet personalized, conversation between itself and human users), employees will soon interact with them in the workplace as well. Forward looking HR leaders are piloting chatbots now to transform HR, and, in the process, re-imagine, re-invent, and re-tool the employee experience.
How does all of this impact HR in your organization? The following ten HR trends will matter most as AI enters the workplace:
1. Expect Humans To Work Along Side Artificial Intelligence
PROMOTED
My Forbes column, The Intersection of AI and HR  profiled three chatbots: Talla, Jane, and Jill Watson, and examined how artificial intelligence is working side by side with HR managers and teaching assistants. This was reinforced by a new Gartner report, predicting that  one in five workers will have AI as their co worker in 2022. 

At Georgia Institute of Technology, this is business as usual. Last year, Jill Watson, powered by IBM Watson analytics, became the ninth teaching assistant for an online course taught by Professor Ashok Goel entitled Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence. Professor Goel estimates that within a year, Jill Watson was able to answer 40% of all the students’ questions, freeing the human TAs to tackle more complex technical inquiries, such as, ""How do you define intelligence?"" In fact, one student reported, ""Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA, always there reminding us of due dates and posting questions to engage us mid-week, I find out she is a chatbot. I was flabbergasted.""
This is just the beginning as AI becomes a new member of the team. And visionary HR leaders will increasingly consider chatbots  another co-worker, helping to orient and train them, and assisting the rest of the team  in understanding how to work with them. The end result will be more time for employees to do what makes them uniquely human such as;  complex problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity, the top three skills deemed essential By the World Economic Forum.

2. Identify Which Roles On Your Team Will Be Transformed By AI 
McKinsey research finds very few occupations will be automated in their entirety, rather certain activities will be re-defined requiring business processes and job roles to change. 
In fact, according the McKinsey Global Institute,  fewer than 5 percent of occupations can be entirely automated using current technology. However, 60 percent of occupations could have 30 percent or more of their activities automated.
We are already seeing this in some key roles like mortgage loan officers, where key activities are being automated so mortgage loan officers can spend more time advising clients and providing other higher levels of customer service. The same will hold for key roles in HR like Recruiter, Training Coordinator, and HR Service Center Advisor, among others, where AI will automate routine work activities and amplify work processes allowing individuals in these roles to provide greater value to their internal customers--employees.
But the key will be for HR to develop an AI strategy and this starts by conducting research on what HR roles, processes, and workflows will be re-imagined with AI.
Figure 1 presents one way to begin thinking about the implications of AI on work tasks, key job roles, and work processes. You can start this process by asking:
Automate: What are the key activities within this role that could be automated to provide greater efficiency and effectiveness for accomplishing routine tasks?
Augment: How could more value be created by applying data analytics to identify new business insights?
Amplify: What work processes and workflows could be re-designed by machine learning?










 More job roles will change than will be become totally automated so HR needs to prepare today.
3. Transform Talent Acquisition With Artificial Intelligence
The most visible aspect of how HR is being impacted by artificial intelligence is the change in the way companies source and recruit new hires. Most notably, IBM has created a suite of tools that use machine learning to help candidates personalize their job search experience based on the engagement they have with Watson. In addition, Watson is helping recruiters prioritize jobs more efficiently, find talent faster, and match candidates more effectively. According to Amber Grewal, Vice President, Global Talent Acquisition, ""Recruiters are focusing more on identifying the most critical jobs in the business and on utilizing data to assist in talent sourcing.""
With the benefit of Watson, companies can empower recruiters to concentrate more on filling placements based on critical ""core"" skills needed across the company, such as agile, cognitive, and cloud, rather than simply screening candidates on filters like “years of experience” or specific education levels. Grewal calls this, horizontal sourcing, and sees it as the end of the requisition based sourcing model. As organizations become flatter, there is a growing need to identify talent with core, horizontal skills that can easily move across various business verticals, domains, and industries. This is truly reinventing the recruiting function.
4. Use Machine Learning to Help Employees Navigate Their Careers 
As employees stay in their roles longer, companies are leveraging machine learning to create internal career mobility platforms so employees can focus on career growth and not just promotions.
CEB Global estimates that employees at all levels are staying in their roles up to 30% longer today. This slow down in upward mobility  is causing employers such as Cisco, GE and Panasonic to take a more active role in partnering with employees to prioritize growing career experiences over the rate of promotion.
Elaine Mason, Vice President of People Planning Design and Analytics at Cisco, is leading an effort to create an internal career mobility platform so Cisco employees can ""choose their own adventure."" The platform, called My Development Space, uses machine learning so employees can build a profile showcasing their current skills, interests, and passions, and then view a range of internal roles that might be right for their next career opportunity. ""Our objective at Cisco is to create a career focused culture where employees are able to grow their capabilities through a series of lateral and vertical moves across silos and functions. The goal of My Development Space is to increase employee retention, grow employees' skills, and prepare them for both horizontal and upward positions.""
5. Hack HR To Identify New HR Solutions 
A hackathon is an event where computer programmers, software designers, graphic artists, and others come together to create a new product. The Facebook “Like” button and Facebook Chat were both first demoed at internal Facebook hackathons.
HR functions are now using the hackathon concept to identify new HR solutions. The Talent Experience team at Jet.com, a subsidiary of Walmart, used a hackathon to identify new ways to improve their candidate experience. The problem: the candidate experience took too long to match aspiring candidates with job openings. Research shows just how inefficient the process is: 85% of applicants don’t hear back after submitting an application— while 71% of employers claim that they can’t find a candidate with the right skill set.
So Jet.com used a hackathon to improve the candidate experience by bringing HR leaders together with software designers and graphic designers to create new candidate process.
The upshot: a new HR candidate solution process, dubbed Casy, uses machine learning to match job descriptions with key words in an applicant's resume, so the best candidate is identified in the shortest amount of time.
6. Explore Using AI To Be A Virtual Coach And Reinforce Learning
By now, we are all familiar with chatbots as productivity tools, for tasks like booking a hotel room using the Expedia chatbot or ordering a Taco using TacoBot. But there are a number of newly funded companies that are investing in chatbots to provide individual coaching in the workplace and to reinforce learning following a traditional training program.
MIT Media Lab startup GiantOtter is using artificial intelligence to develop and train “Coach Otto,” a bot that provides online coaching for companies. This is an interesting use case an employer can use a chatbot to participate in an extended conversation as a coach or companion amplifying a person’s ability to do their job. In the case of Coach Otto, this is preparing a manager to have a difficult conversation with a team member.
Chatbots are also being used as a learning reinforcement following a traditional training program. This is the case with Freeman, a brand experience company. Freeman trains its sales staff on the basics of selling with a course called Selling Fundamentals. But Freeman needed a reinforcement strategy to help sales people apply sales skills on-the-job. Their solution: Coach TopGun SellFun, a chatbot designed to improve the retention of new skills from the Selling Fundamentals program. AI has the power to not only carry on conversations with employees but also reinforce key learning needed for job success.
7. Use AI To Enhance Employee Communications 
Gartner predicts that by 2020, 85% of customer interactions will be managed by machines, without human input. The same may well be true for employee interactions. A recent ServiceNow survey of 350 HR leaders detailed in my Forbes column, The Intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Human Resources, found more than two thirds of HR leaders believe employees are comfortable accessing chatbots to get the information they need, at the time they need it. In fact, I am starting to think of chatbots as your newest HR team member, one that allows employees to easily retrieve answers to frequently asked questions.
The type of questions HR leaders believe employees are comfortable using a chatbot for range from the mundane and factual ones; such as how much paid time off do I have left, to the more personal ones; such as how do I report a sexual misconduct experience. And the prediction for 2020 by Deepak Bharadwaj, General Manager, HR Product Line, ServiceNow, is that the penetration of chatbots in the workplace could reach adoption rates of as high as 75% with employees accessing a chatbot to answer HR questions and access HR solutions anywhere and anytime.
 By using AI, HR leaders can create a seamless employee experience, one that mirrors their best customer experience.
8. Examine How Leadership Will Be Changed As AI Moves Into Management
AI is starting to take on tasks normally handled by mid-level managers. Chatbots can now:

Organize meetings, mimicking a “Chief of Staff,” offered by tools such as Howdy and Geekbot
Follow up after meetings, with minutes complete with highlighted keywords, offered by tools like Gridspace
Improve writing of job descriptions with machine learning platforms such as Textio 

So what happens to mid-level managers in this process? Robert Thomas, of Accenture, believes leaders will routinely include AI on their leadership team and the impact will be enhanced decision making speed and the ability to look at alternative scenarios with multiple points of view. Thomas believes this can assist leaders to become more agile in the way software developers have become accustomed to. The end result is one where AI augments mid-level managers to deliver greater value to their team.
9. Invest In The Human Experience Of Working
While technology is certainly a key element of creating a best of breed employee experience, forward looking HR leaders understand the biggest critical component in successfully implementing AI in the workplace is to have leaders who are committed to inspire teams and examine how intelligent technologies will transform HR. This starts with creating a more human experience at work, one where employees get to know each other better.
At Pandora, Kristen Robinson, CHRO, defines the employee experience journey as the ability to create an environment where employees perform, connect, and grow throughout their tenure with the company. While technology is part of the equation, Pandora is investing in creating more human connections between employees. And one of the ways they are doing this is a low tech solution: a podcast called People of Pandora, dedicated to sharing the stories of Pandora employees and their experiences both at Pandora and in their personal lives. You can listen for yourself to the podcast: People of Pandora.
Leveraging podcasts to connect employees with each other is also happening at GE Crotonville where the popular podcast, Brilliance Leadership Learning (you can find this on iTunes) regularly includes interviews with GE executives such as GE Digital Leader, GE CHRO, GE Chief Communications Officer, all sharing their personal and professional stories.
Look for a resurgence of and innovation in the power of storytelling in the digital age.
10. Identify New Roles That Will Be Created By Artificial Intelligence 
Gartner estimates that artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it eliminates by 2020.    This assumes 1.8 million jobs will be automated by 2020 but 2.3 million jobs will be created with a net gain of 500,000 new jobs created as artificial intelligence becomes widespread inside companies. The question is no longer when or if AI will transform the workplace, but how can  HR leaders prepare for a new world of work where AI augments the human workforce enabling some jobs to be more efficient and creating entirely new jobs along the way.
The team at the Cognizant Center for the Future of Work addressed this issue and identified 21 new jobs that will emerge over the next 10 years and these new jobs may well be the cornerstone of new ways of working. These jobs were organized from low tech to high tech over the 10-year horizon from 2018 to 2028. Take a peek at how they all stack up in Figure 2.










Two of my favorites include:

Bring Your Own IT Facilitator, this role acknowledges the growth of employees and intact work teams who have mastered the art of working around IT. We all know shadow IT operations are in existence, so why not make them official and give them a role in creating more automated self service solutions. Some of the tasks of this new role include: conduct a shadow IT assessment and work closely with IT infrastructure to design road maps for self-service IT solutions.
Financial Wellness Coach, this role assists employees in understanding how to live in the world of digital banking, bitcoin payments, and micro-lending. We have seen financial literacy is now part of a more holistic view of employee well-being. The financial wellness coach takes this one step further by providing coaching via a smart technology platform to optimize an employees' financial life.

The question for HR leaders is what are the new job roles in HR that are on the horizon as AI becomes integrated into the workplace? In interviews with clients, three interesting new roles have emerged:

Conversational Designer, this role creates content for conversational interfaces between an employee and HR, answering a range of HR related queries with speed and accuracy.
AI Trainer, this role makes the knowledge embedded in a job role AI ready. Creating knowledge for an AI supported workplace requires that individuals tag or ""annotate"" discrete knowledge nuggets so the correct data can be served up in a conversational interface.
Digital HR Business Partner, we all know what a traditional HR Business Partner does but how can we digitize parts of this role? This role presents HR leaders with an opportunity to automate, augment with new skills, and amplify work processes so individuals in this role can provide greater value to clients with consulting and critical problem solving.

It is an interesting time we live in! That's why it’s more important than ever to prepare yourself, your team, and your organization to develop a strategy to leverage artificial intelligence across the employee life cycle, from recruitment to learning, career development, coaching, and on-going communication. As we enter 2018, HR leaders need to lead this effort in partnership with IT and Corporate Communications to take full advantage of how to leverage intelligent technologies to provide an enhanced employee experience.
I look forward to hearing from you on how you are building your AI strategy.

The rise of artificial intelligence in the workplace poses a little-discussed question – wouldn’t it be better if the HR department, not the programmers, oversaw robots? Rob Mettler suggests the idea is not as bizarre as it sounds.

Artificial intelligence at work
Preparing for robotics and AI in the workplace
HR brings robots and people together
Is HR ready for the robot revolution?

The view that robots should report to the head of HR might sound absurd, but when the CIO of a major online retailer talks about his warehouse robots working in teams, when companies introduce “AI board members”, and robots start being trialled in social care, it’s time to reconsider lines of responsibility.
Of course, many will be of the opinion that robots and artificial intelligence (AI) aren’t human and we shouldn’t even entertain the idea.
But if we look to a future where AI agents such as IPsoft’s Amelia are fronting customer service, and robots like Aldebaran’s Pepper are undertaking manual and face-to-face tasks, we can see the essence of a changing workforce. We could argue it’s merely the next step for technology in the workplace, one following machinery in the industrial revolution, and computing in the information age.
But that argument misses a key point: the notion of intelligence. If the AI-driven customer service agent starts making decisions based on what it has learnt and experienced then who is responsible for the outcomes? Is it the Chief Information or Digital officer, or the business lines using the AI workforce? Let’s look at two scenarios to test this out.
First, let’s consider the AI board member. This challenges the perception that AI and robots will only take on blue collar work – the AI board member sits at the top table. This is not sci-fi but reality. Hong Kong-based venture capital firm Deep Knowledge was first in 2014 with Vital, and Finnish IT support firm Tieto appointed Alica T to its leadership team in 2017.
If the AI-driven customer service agent starts making decisions based on what it has learnt, then who is responsible for the outcomes?”

At first glance it might appear that these AI board members are little more than overhyped analytics dashboards bringing data and insight on demand to the board room.
But Vital has approved investment decisions and Alica T has voting rights, and in 2017 the Vital algorithm was credited with pulling Deep Knowledge back from the brink of bankruptcy, helping the company avoid investment in risky projects. Vital is treated as a member of the board with observer status, and the board have agreed not to make positive investment decisions without corroboration by Vital.
The buck stops – where?
So who takes the stick when the AI board member makes the wrong decision – is it the programmer who created it, or the CIO, or is it the business lead who commissioned it or the board for debating in front of it?
Robots in the workplace aren’t new. In 1961, General Motors introduced Unimate to the assembly line and last year global sales of industrial robots reached $13.1bn. But most of these robots are automating existing manual tasks and following processes and procedures. In this context, the robots have become the responsibility of engineering and manufacturing functions.
We are now entering a new phase of robotics where intelligence is key to their value. Pepper, a humanoid robot, is being used in a social care setting by Southend-on-Sea Borough Council, the aim being to free-up social care workers to focus on the more important components of their role. The next step on from this could be highly humanoid social care robots, as featured in Channel 4’s thought provoking sci-fi drama Humans.
On the frontline
In other examples, in 2017 Enfield Council started trialling an AI customer service agent, Amelia, on the frontline of services to respond to residents’ queries and application processes. So as these physical and AI robots become more intelligent and more common they will increasingly affect our working patterns, behaviour and workplace dynamics. Together with increasing levels of anthropomorphism, they are becoming more accountable – not to their technical genesis, but to outcomes they are brought in to deliver as well as the day-to-day managers and HR departments that support them.
We must resolve the issues of accountability and responsibility as these developments accelerate, and HR must be involved in the discussion. We are surely bound to witness a shift in reporting and accountability from robots’ technical guardians to an adapted HR function.

Since HR can’t reprogram them, the final responsibility should be the programmer’s. HR would be helpful for documenting the undesirable outcomes.

Marking the coming of the fourth industrial revolution, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is permeating every major industry from healthcare to transportation, education, finance and insurance. The McKinsey Global Institute(link is external) (pdf) says that AI is contributing to a transformation of society(link is external) “happening ten times faster and at 300 times the scale or at roughly 3,000 times the impact” of the Industrial Revolution.
In the healthcare industry, AI's ability to help clinicians make diagnoses is one major way in which patients are benefiting directly. Technology giant IBM brought AI into the mainstream of healthcare, when it offered its AI platform Watson(link is external) to cancer centres in 13 countries to aid oncologists in identifying evidence-based treatment options for patients.
The promise of AI is not limited to commercial applications. It shows great potential to help solve some of the world’s most challenging development problems that UNDP staff across the world contend with on a daily basis. A promising endeavour is the use of AI to automate UNDP’s Rapid Integrated Assessment (RIA) – a tool that helps governments assess the alignment of national development plans and sectoral strategies with the 169 targets of the Sustainable Development Goals to determine a country’s readiness for implementation of the global development agenda.  
As part of the Science for Social Good(link is external) programme, UNDP teamed with IBM Research to automate the RIA, a tedious process which typically would take experts three to four weeks to complete and entail manually reviewing hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of pages of documents and assessing alignment of national development priorities with the Global Goals for Sustainable Development.
Using AI, the initiative developed an algorithm that has been tested to evaluate the national development plans of five countries (Bhutan, Cambodia, Liberia, Mauritius, and Namibia) where manual RIAs were already undertaken. This was done to compare the results from the application of the algorithm with the results of the manual RIAs conducted by experts. The overall results have been very positive(link is external), with the system identifying a significant number of relevant national targets that align with the SDG targets. In some cases, the system has also been able to identify aligned national targets that were not picked up by experts when conducting the manual RIAs.
Similar encouraging results were seen on applying the algorithm to the national plan of Papua New Guinea, a country for which a RIA has not yet been performed. Of significance is that with the help of this system, the time taken to conduct a RIA could be substantially reduced, from three to four weeks to three to four days. The success of this endeavour is noteworthy as it will help countries to quickly identify gaps in alignment thus enabling them to better integrate the SDGs into their planning frameworks based on their specific context and priorities.
While AI has the potential to address many of the world’s development problems, there are growing concerns about the impacts of AI on labour markets and the required skill sets needed to embrace this new technology. Mitigating these challenges will require ensuring that AI is harnessed for the common good where benefits are shared broadly, particularly among those most marginalized. Ultimately, AI is not good or bad in and of itself. It’s all about how we choose to use it.

Seriously, are you not bored of people like Elon Musk or Stephen Hawking, who are frequently claiming that artificial intelligence (AI) is a big threat to human society? Those discussions let people think AI is going to steal everyone’s job and start the next world war. Even worse, it fuels expectations to a point that the general public is getting the idea that AI research has recently made quantum leaps. And thanks to raising these expectations we could easily run into an AI winter again.
Keep calm: we are far away from creating a super-intelligence Musk and Hawking are talking about or what Hollywood is showing us with movies like Ex Machina, Her or AI. Let me tell you something that should concern you more. According to a Sage survey, 43 percent of respondents in the U.S. and 46 percent of respondents in the UK answered that they have no idea what AI is about. Thus, the biggest issue these days is, that the general public has no clue what AI really means.
It is absolutely important to talk about regulations and ethics in terms of AI. Indeed, Boston Dynamics’ robots “Atlas” or “Handle” are spooky. But what if Tesla’s autopilot is knocking somebody down – who is responsible? Or if the autopilot has to decide which person should survive. The driver? The old man or the young boy on the street? These are the main questions I am getting frequently from the audience. This is what people are concerned about.











 
 
 
Right now, we are living in a time of exponential technological developments. Meaning, “this will never happen” is the wrong attitude since technology research and progress is happening in ever so short timeframes. However, the most successful AI systems today are solving the game of Go or the strategy game FreeCiv.

Today, most AI projects are based on machine learning that simply helps to identify patterns within data sets and thus tries to make predictions based on the existing data. However, having the right data and quality data is what’s most important. And then afterwards to check the plausibility and correctness of the results since you can always find something in endless sets of data. And that’s also one of the drawbacks if you consider machine learning as a single concept. Machine learning needs lots of training data to learn and be able to find valuable information respectively results in patterns.
Artificial intelligence is autonomous process automation
To bring the AI discussion to reasonable deliberations. Today, AI is not about recreating the human brain. It is about building a system that acts like a human. All in all, AI means analytics, problem solving and autonomous automation based on data, knowledge and experience.











 
 
 
Just try to look at this entire AI discussion from a different angle. Consider our life as a process. Consider every day as a process that is divided into single steps. And then, consider AI as autonomous process automation that provides us with more convenience and thus makes our life easier.
Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri are AI but not intelligent
Have you ever tried to lead a simple conversation with Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri? Exactly, this is not going to go well. However, Alexa as well as Siri are AI technologies. They use natural language processing (NLP). So, machine learning algorithms powered by predictive models. For example, the algorithms are used to translate your commands into little pieces, so-called sound bites. Afterwards, these pieces are analyzed by another predictive model, that tries to predict what your request was about. However, Alexa or Siri are not intelligent or self-learning. Consider their “brains” (they do NOT have brains) like a “database” in the cloud-backend of Amazon and Apple operating a set of ready answers or action items. If you are a proud owner of an Amazon Echo device you will understand what I mean. Every Friday you get an email with the newest commands you can use to control Alexa. Besides the ever-growing database behind Alexa, the so-called “Alexa-Skills” are helping Alexa to become more “intelligent.” This is nothing else but small applications (like for your Android smartphone or iPhone) someone has to develop and equip with further commands, questions you can ask, ready answers or action items. And the more skills are activated, the more intelligent Alexa appears since you have more commands and ways to interact with her. However, the interesting story around Alexa is that Amazon has 5,000 people exclusively working on Alexa to enhance it. So, we could expect more progress soon.
The good news, self-learning systems already do exist. If you connect your iPhone via Bluetooth with your car and if you’ve set up your work and home address, soon the iPhone will tell you how long you are going to need to work or back home. In some other cases “Apple Maps Destination” has shown me predictions to locations even if I didn’t store them exclusively on my iPhone. So, just based on my travel habits. Google Now works the same way. It proactively provides information to the users they are maybe looking for. Predictions based on their search habits. However, if you are granting Google access to your calendar, Google Now may also work as an advisor. It reminds you that you have an appointment and what vehicle you should take in order to arrive at your destination on time.











 
 
 
Other AI-related services you might have been in touch with for quite some time are:

Since the 1950s, the financial service industry is using machine learning algorithms for credit scoring.
Dating websites use algorithms to provide an indication of how likely two people are a match and would probably go out on a date.
At Geneva Airport, autonomous robot KATE takes care of your luggage, checks you in and guides you through the airport. Everything based on data analytics and geo location analysis.
“Relay” from Savioke is an autonomous delivery robot that is used in some hotels for room service purposes.

Autonomous process automation in your daily life
Back to AI as an autonomous process automation that makes our life easier. Let’s discuss some ideas:

Imagine Alexa or Siri as your personal watchdog in business. Checking your phone calls, autonomously negotiating appointments with e.g. colleagues – especially with the ones who always send calendar invitations before asking. I am kind of talking about a very early version of Iron Man’s AI “Jarvis.”
Or what about Alexa or Siri as your very personal life assistant. Let’s say you are speaking at a conference. Your flight home leaves at 4 p.m. In order to reach your flight on time, your personal life assistant autonomously orders you a ride for 2:15 p.m. since your speech ends at 1:45 p.m. and the traffic information looks busy these days. The virtual assistant just sends you the details of the pickup location which is right in front of the conference venue. The assistant simply follows the entire process you would usually go through: from taking the phone out of your pocket, opening the app, searching for the target location and then ordering the ride. So, keep your hands and mind free for more important things. Of course, you have to give the AI access to your calendar, geolocation and other information.
Or imagine an intelligent version of the kitchen aid “Thermomix.” The dish advisor: Based on what the kitchen helper finds in your fridge it makes recommendations what you could possibly cook. And when some ingredients for a dish are missing it could ask for permission to order them online. The health advisor: Based on your eating behavior of the last weeks it would nicely recommend you not to cook the tiramisu you were just about to prepare, because this wouldn’t be good for your consumption of calories.

Autonomous process automation inside your organization
AI as an autonomous process automation has lots of potentials inside an enterprise as well. Let’s focus on two real world examples:











 
 
 

An AI-defined infrastructure is actually nothing else but autonomous process automation for IT operations. Those kinds of environments are capable of deploying the necessary resources depending on the workload requirements as well as de-allocating the resources when they are not needed anymore. They are constantly analyzing the ever-changing behavior and status of every single infrastructure component and thus understanding the environment they are acting in. The environment is reacting or proactively acting based on the status of single infrastructure components by autonomously taking actions and thus leading the entire infrastructure into an error-free status.
As part of business operations, autonomous process automation is already utilized in the insurance industry, autonomously creating insurance policies. In doing so, experts are teaching the AI the process, step by step, how and why they create a certain insurance policy. Besides that, the AI is also connected to partner systems that deliver further information. For the time being, the AI creates an insurance policy and hands it over to an expert. The expert checks the insurance and tweaks it if needed. After that it is delivered to the customer. In the end, a customer will directly interact with the AI and, after delivering the necessary information, will receive his/her custom insurance policy.

Keep your expectations low
On a final note. Instead of constantly discussing AI as the biggest threat to humanity, maybe we should talk about the biggest threat to AI research. The impatience of humanity! The issue: AI research has been an oscillating system between several techniques. Whenever one approach did not do “the job completely,” people get frustrated and turn to another one. You want to see amazing AI stuff in the future? Keep calm and wait. It will happen! We just have to move forward step by step. Otherwise our expectations will fail and will immediately guide us into the next AI winter.
Saying this, consider AI technologies as an approach to make your life easier. And don’t stress the term “intelligent” too much. However, always be aware of what type of data and personal information you really want to share. Once it is out, it’s virtually impossible to roll it back.

        Technology      

Resistance Is Futile: Embracing the Era of the Augmented Worker 


        By Nathaniel Barr and Kelly Peters 

          January 8, 2018        






























 


 J.K. Rofling 
 
This article is part of our special issue “Connected State of Mind,” which explores the impact of tech use on our behavior and relationships. View the complete issue here.


Throughout history, technological advances have revolutionized the way we work. In many cases, these innovations extended our natural abilities, enabling our bodies to do more, more easily. “Most of the greatest advances of modern technology have been instruments which extended the scope of our sense organs, our brains, or our limbs,” the philosopher and psychologist K.J.W. Craik said in 1943. “Such are telescopes and microscopes, wireless, calculating machines, typewriters, motor-cars, ships and airplanes.”
These old inventions are what Tim Brown, the CEO of IDEO, calls artifacts. Artifacts aren’t themselves “smart”—the people who use them are. Today, as the rapid rise of artificial intelligence brings us to the brink of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we face a different dynamic: Both people and technology are smart, albeit in different ways.
Though some sectors will see large scale replacement of human employees with intelligent automation, more domains will require businesses to figure out how to interface the capabilities of these new tools with the workforce—to augment workers with A.I., rather than automate business functions entirely. The prospect of A.I.-augmented workers is both promising and unsettling: How can employees and firms ensure that they get the benefits of A.I. without erasing uniquely human strengths?
The prospect of A.I.-augmented workers is both promising and unsettling: How can employees and firms ensure that they get the benefits of A.I. without erasing uniquely human strengths?
One of the foremost challenges will be getting workers to embrace augmentation. During the 19th century, groups of English workers called the Luddites resisted new performance-enhancing technologies, and overcoming that resistance was critical to industrial advancement. Now, new technology raises this same problem, but it does so at unprecedented scale: Augmenting human abilities with A.I. is more complex than using artifacts, and it’s potentially even less welcome.
Since these new technologies play a role in even thinking for us, they pose a direct and existential threat to what it means to be human. Augmentation requires employees to challenge their conception of what their role can and should be in the workplace—and how their humanity can be redefined and extended. And, because these machines can quickly process vast amounts of data, they can yield novel, counterintuitive insights that humans could disagree with. It’s one thing to extend one’s abilities with machines; it is another to use a machine that produces a different judgment or reaches a different conclusion.
Further, A.I. will also require workers to face another assumption about human advantage: People tend to think that certain areas of judgment, like moral decision-making, are best accomplished by human agents, leaving many reluctant to trust machines. Even among those who think augmented technology may aid decisions in general, trusting the output of A.I. in more specific instances is a potential obstacle.
Firms  also have a role to play. They will need to leverage behavioral science and psychological research methods to investigate empirically under what circumstances employees accept or reject A.I. advice or decisions. In areas where A.I. looms but has yet to infiltrate, they could use a contemporary “Mechanical Turk” as a testing framework. When the inventor of the original Mechanical Turk unveiled it in 1770, he branded it as a chess-playing machine, with the intent to fool human players into believing it was a powerful, even supernaturally powerful, piece of technology. In reality, there was a gifted human chess player hidden within the apparatus.
So too could people be “fooled” for science. We have imagined an experiment that would test how and when employees trust A.I. in their decision-making: A staff member would play the role of “hidden expert” and create the illusion that advice is coming from the A.I. Employees could choose to incorporate the feedback into their own decision making or not, allowing a company to measure what percentage of the staff were willing to use an A.I. device, with what frequency, and in what situations. Another important area for measurement is the characteristics of employees that are more, or less, trusting of A.I. For instance, how do we know for sure that millennials will always more readily adopt new technology than those in older generations? (Answer: We don’t).
When A.I. decision aids are adopted, analogous measurements can be made to those described above for real time monitoring of when, how, and by whom they are used. Further, firms should also evaluate whether decisions made with A.I. are empirically better than those made without. For instance, in financial trading, are the workers that demonstrate more openness to A.I. input more likely to yield larger gains? And if so, is this because they are overriding suboptimal human biases?
Gathering this data and embracing augmentation will probably be most useful in industries in which people have historically relied only on their brains to make decisions, where there is resistance to acknowledge cognitive limits and biases, and where A.I. has already demonstrated the capacity to improve human ability. Take, for instance, fields in which decisions mean the difference between life and death—such as medical decision-making, where A.I. can now read scans, classify patients by various criteria, prioritize patient care, and aid in providing complex clinical decision support—or where they mean earning or losing millions or billions of dollars, such as in financial trading or advising, where A.I. applications can do things like automatically process news and data to provide humans with insights to make more informed choices and spend more time with clients.
Building an augmented workforce isn’t a race to the finish, but rather it’s an uncertain journey with neither roadmap nor prescribed end point.
Though the benefits of A.I. are promising and openness is important, it is important to proceed thoughtfully. The algorithms and technology that underlie A.I. are imperfect and shouldn’t be accepted with unflinching faith. Rather, the optimal, but likely elusive, arrangement is that the output of A.I. is used when the human is wrong, and the A.I. is overridden when the technology is wrong. Such a tension, between trust and skepticism in the face of augmented decision-making, will require what Gordon Pennycook of Yale University and his colleagues have called reflective, rather than reflexive, open-mindedness. Rather than uncritically accepting automated answers, we must consciously deliberate and reflect, on a case-by-case basis, how best to use the intelligence of computing technology with human wisdom and discernment. Attributes connected to success in such deliberation will be increasingly prized as augmentation expands—The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report identifies critical thinking, judgment and decision-making, cognitive flexibility, and creativity as Top Skills for 2020 and for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Much as employees will need these characteristics to make the best individual decisions, firms will also need to exhibit flexibility and creativity at the organizational level. Building an augmented workforce isn’t a race to the finish, but rather it’s an uncertain journey with neither roadmap nor prescribed end point. Since we can’t be sure which systems and approaches for integrating A.I. are most effective, we must continue to experiment, measure, and innovate. Adjusting to a world characterized by accelerating technological advance isn’t a one-time investment but an ongoing battle for the optimization of extended human ability.
We predict that firms that can most effectively extend human cognitive ability with new technologies and find the ideal alignment between human intelligence and A.I. will have significant economic advantages over competitors unwilling to augment or unable to find the right equilibrium. Though this particular challenge is new, creatively leveraging technology to extend our natural ability is not. It is an integral part of the history, present, and future of how we work—and is truly and deeply human.

","Over the past few years, artificial intelligence has rapidly matured as a viable field of technology. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"




Machines that learn from experience, adjust to new inputs, and perform tasks once uniquely the domain of humans, have entered our daily lives in ways seen and unseen. Given the current breakneck pace of change and innovation, the question for governments and policymakers is how to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence, and not be trampled by the robot takeover of our nightmares. The answer is simple: make them work for us.
Recently, the IMF’s Managing Director Christine Lagarde convened some of the most distinguished voices in the field of artificial intelligence, including Malcolm Frank of Cognizant; Martin Ford, author of Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future; Chief Analytics Officer of IBM, Martin Fleming; and Andrew McAfee and Simon Johnson, the latter a former Chief Economist of the IMF, and both professors at MIT.  
There are four areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning of importance to the IMF’s work:

Governance: Both countries and the IMF will need to address the provenance of data, as well as matters of privacy and informed consent before basing analysis or grounding policy advice on Big Data or the algorithms used to generate findings. Big Data is dynamic, heterogeneous, and may originate in sectors that do not map cleanly to the IMF’s existing lines of responsibility or expertise. For example, data generated from e-commerce, the Internet of Things, satellite data, or supply-chain and logistics data are not yet well understood or integrated in how we assess the health of a country’s economy. Both the IMF and countries will need to develop expertise in the use of such micro-level data.
Labor markets: Labor markets will look different in the next few years. There will be fewer middle-skilled jobs, such as insurance claims processing or jobs performed in a constrained physical space, like fork-lift operator or order expeditor. These sorts of jobs have been more resistant to offshoring or automation so far. But they may disappear soon, as artificial intelligence improves and robots are more able to make decisions based on ambiguous situations. This has implications for education, retirement, and social welfare programs. Large numbers of middle-class jobs may be eliminated, leading to unemployment or underemployment. Some jobs will require extensive retraining to ensure that workers can perform the work. Many countries are already facing rapidly aging populations. Should large numbers of workers leave the labor market prematurely, governments will find it even more difficult to fund social-welfare and retirement benefits.  
Taxes: By implication, should labor markets rapidly shed middle-skilled or low-skilled jobs as many predict, the tax structures of many countries will need to reflect the decreasing share of GDP attributable to wages and salaries. Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, roughly half of government revenue is derived from individual income or social insurance taxes. If labor becomes a smaller part of developed economies, tax structures will need to change to sustain government revenues near current levels, and to avoid creating further disincentives to the creation of jobs. For example, Microsoft founder Bill Gates suggested that a tax might be levied on robots.
Social equity: Computer-driven decision-making should be open to scrutiny and inspection, and must not simply be automated versions of mental models that embed legacies of social inequality. For instance, some businesses make use of data to offer personalized pricing, based on predictive models about the future revenue stream that a potential customer might provide.  Some customers who do not match an optimal profile might be “invited to leave quietly.” Such redlining of particular groups of customers may lead to further marginalization, leading to a self-fulfilling prophesy.  

Economists generally build models and then refine them to reduce error and improve robustness. Many artificial intelligence methods are impervious to external analysis, because software based on artificial intelligence learns and adapts as it encounters new data. After millions of iterations, the algorithm itself will have changed substantially. “The algorithm told me to do it,” is unlikely to withstand public inquiry as the basis for policy development.
Next steps
There is clearly a need for all institutions to keep up as this rapidly changing world impacts their work. So, the IMF will continue to bring in experts to promote information exchange and develop training so that its staff can work with these new technologies as they emerge. In turn, this will help the IMF work with its member countries to make artificial intelligence serve the public good.

One of CFM’s goals is to help museums learn from other sectors, and help other sectors learn from us. For that reason, my colleagues and I cultivate a diverse audience for our work, drawing futurists, games designers, technologists, educators, librarians and many others into conversation with museumers. In today’s post Rhea Steele, COO at the organization that accredits P-12 educator preparation programs, offers some thoughts on how artificial intelligence, our tech focus in TrendsWatch 2017, may transform the work of accreditation programs.
 
When I read the November/December issue of Museum magazine: Museums 2040, I was energized and excited by the not-so-far-fetched opportunities presented to future museums. Reading the Accreditation Spotlight, I recalled a session focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the American Society of Association Executives Technology Conference. Not just the stuff of science fiction, AI takes computing beyond algorithms and human-created code. AI allows computers to learn from experience, adjust “behaviors” (outputs) to match new stimulus (inputs) and perform tasks of increasing complexity. This type of learning is referred to as machine learning. During the session, we discussed how AI can assist with repetitive tasks, quickly parse large data sets, and “multitask” by monitoring and responding to multiple systems and inputs simultaneously. I began to wonder what would happen if we applied machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accreditation activities. 
 
The purpose of accreditation in higher education is to improve program quality and assure public accountability, whereas in the museum space, it is to recognize adherence to the standards in the field. In both cases, accreditation systems are dependent on clearly defined rubrics to help volunteer peer reviewers make judgments on the institution’s demonstration of meeting standards. At my organization, the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation, as well as at other accreditors, our process is built on is the evaluative judgments of volunteers who are applying our guidelines and decision criteria. A significant amount of time, effort, and funding goes into ensuring volunteers are sufficiently trained and able to interpret evidence both broadly and within institutional context. As you can imagine, the quality assurance processes, including establishing interrater reliability, result in the need for many, many volunteers and a well-informed, detail-oriented staff.   
 
There is general consensus that the process of accreditation is best conducted by volunteer peer reviewers due to the depth of their knowledge of the field and the nuanced understanding needed to connect disparate pieces of evidence in the context of an individual institution. Can human peer review alone meet the demand for accreditation services? Currently about 1075 museums have been accredited by AAM, compared to the 4000 that have taken the Pledge of Excellence and the estimated 35,000 museums in the US identified by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Slightly more than 1000 people serve as peer reviewers for AAM Accreditation, and a nine-member commission makes all the final decisions regarding accreditation. Could AI enable the AAM program to increase the number of museums served, without a proportionate increase in cost? 
 
AI could help with the quality, as well as the quantity, of reviews. The challenge faced by volunteer peer reviewers is to approach each organization with true objectivity – a peer reviewer who works at a large well-funded institution must surface and set aside his/her implicit biases when reviewing an institution with a different profile. While this system has worked well in the past, can we make it work better with the application of AI?
 
Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri are all able to interpret natural language commands, IBM’s Watson won Jeopardy, and Netflix makes eerily on-target recommendations for movies and shows I will like. It’s all just algorithms, you might say, and you are correct.  But these algorithms are increasingly complex and sophisticated. Today’s AI-based programs use machine learning techniques (including rubrics and rules) to acquire information and adapt through experience. Our peer reviewers do the same. What if we shift our model and use AI to do what it does best – parse through reams of qualitative and quantitative data submitted for accreditation and provide peer reviewers with an initial assessment of alignment to the standards? How would this all work? 
 
In the same way we currently train peer reviewers, an accreditation AI would be trained using data elements, evidence, rubrics and decisions made by past peer reviewers. We would then run simulations to enable the AI to learn alongside the peer reviewers currently auditing institutions and compare the AI’s recommendations with those of the peer review team and make adjustments. Eventually, the AI would be able to provide absolute consistency in the identification of areas for improvement and misalignment with standards. It could also identify practices that correlate with positive outcomes, thus improving the flow of information on best practices throughout the field. As in many fields beginning to adopt AI (medicine, engineering, customer service), I believe the technology would supplement, rather than supplant, the human role. Peer reviewers will use the AI’s recommendations to collect and refine information requested and reviewed during the on-site visit and use the algorithm’s analysis to inform their recommendations and the decision to grant or not grant accreditation. 
 
As we move further and further into an AI-enabled future, we have an opportunity to review and reframe how we leverage technology to improve our industries. Application of AI to assist in the peer review process of accreditation is one way we can leverage the power of technology and help humans focus on high-value activities. How else can museums benefit from the novel application of technology?

Automation and artificial intelligence technologies are transforming manufacturing, corporate work and the retail business, providing new opportunities for companies to explore and posing major threats to those that don’t adapt to the times. Equally daunting challenges confront colleges and universities, but they’ve been slower to acknowledge them.
At present, colleges and universities are most worried about competition from schools or training systems using online learning technology. But that is just one aspect of the technological changes already under way. For example, some companies are moving toward requiring workers have specific skills trainings and certifications – as opposed to college degrees. 
As a professor who researches artificial intelligence and offers distance learning courses, I can say that online education is a disruptive challenge for which colleges are ill-prepared. Lack of student demand is already closing 800 out of roughly 10,000 engineering colleges in India. And online learning has put as many as half the colleges and universities in the U.S. at risk of shutting down in the next couple decades as remote students get comparable educations over the internet – without living on campus or taking classes in person. Unless universities move quickly to transform themselves into educational institutions for a technology-assisted future, they risk becoming obsolete.
Existing alternatives to traditional higher ed
Enormous amounts of information are now available online for free, ready for watching, listening or reading at any time, by anyone who’s connected. For more than a decade, private companies, nonprofits and universities alike have been experimenting with online courses, often offered for free or at low cost to large numbers of students around the world. Research has shown that it’s as effective for students to use a combination of online courses and traditional in-classroom instruction as it is to just have classes in person.



Is this the future of a college education?

Providers of massive open online courses (often called “MOOCs”) are refining ways for people who complete the classes to present their accomplishments in ways employers can understand easily. For example, students in certain classes from major MOOC provider edX can get an official Arizona State University transcript listing their courses and grades. An employer would never know the person studied online. (There’s another threat to universities’ business model, too: Students can take the classes and get their grades for free; they only need to pay if they are happy with their grades, and if they want official college credit.)
This is a period of rapid change unlike what universities have dealt with for centuries.
The evolution of the university
Medieval European universities trained would-be clergy members in canonical law, theological discussion and religious administration. These institutions amassed huge repositories of knowledge, storing and indexing them in libraries, which became the focal point of the campus.
As European countries explored the world and established overseas colonies starting in the 15th and 16th centuries, universities evolved to train officers to manage those territories, study navigation across the oceans and look after colonists’ health. After the Industrial Revolution, colleges changed again, teaching workers how to use new scientific and technological methods and tools. 
In the 21st century, the workplace is transforming once more; what businesses, governments and society need from education is shifting, and technology has made the brick-and-mortar library obsolete. It used to be that users of a technology needed to know how it works. In the early days of driving, for instance, it was important for a driver to be able to fix a car that broke down on the side of the road, perhaps far from any expert mechanic. 
But in the current post-industrial economy, that has changed: Even a car mechanic uses a computer to connect to car systems to identify what is not working properly. Very few people need to know how these internal computer systems work; they just need to be able to interpret sensor readings and error messages. 
A changing job market
Now, the number of jobs mostly involving routine skills – both physical and cognitive – is shrinking over time.
Increasing automation at factories is rapidly replacing workers at factories, even in low-wage countries like China. Artificial intelligence technologies like machine learning and computer vision are permanently eliminating high-skill jobs in offices, too. Many world economies – including in the U.S. – are turning from manufacturing to service, in which most new jobs do not require advanced education. 
The remaining jobs will involve fewer routine tasks. The people doing that work will still need some education beyond high school. But they may not have as much need to attend classes at, or even live on, a physical university campus. Colleges that are outside the very top tier of quality and name recognition – and those that have taken on large amounts of debt to build physical facilities – will suffer as demand for their services lessens.
Competition between colleges
Another factor challenging universities’ existence is the rapidly rising cost of a traditional college education. So far, in the U.S. demand for degrees from residential colleges has remained high because government-backed loans are easy to get. But student loan debt in the U.S. has reached US$1.45 trillion – and as many as 20 percent of borrowers may not be earning enough to pay them back.

Universities might highlight intangible values of in-person learning, like personal contact and nonverbal communication, but the costs are becoming a larger factor. Parents and students in the U.S. are increasingly asking whether it’s worth spending around $30,000 – or even more than $60,000 – for less than 240 days of school in an elite private residential college – more than $250 a night. 
Private colleges’ main competition at the moment comes from public universities. Their prices are two-thirds lower, but studying still involves taking many courses that are just as easily taught online.

Soon students will want to take a variety of courses from different universities, choosing each class and school for its particular merits and benefits. That will stiffen competition between institutions, lowering students’ costs – and universities’ revenues. 
Courses will become shared experiences for online learning communities. Some colleges might seek to charge students for special in-person learning experiences, but these will be extras for those who can afford them, not the higher education norm they are today.
Finding a new way to teach
Some universities – those at the top, with the most money and expertise – are responding to the coming changes to higher education. Some are forming partnerships with international universities and online teaching companies, or building remote-learning programs on their own. Some of these, like the Harvard Extension School, are high-tech adaptations of correspondence courses people used to take by mail. 
Harvard Extension School enrolls nearly 2,000 degree candidates and over 13,000 non-degree students, who take classes online, on campus or a mix of both. Students can earn a Bachelor of Liberal Arts degree in extension studies. At an estimated cost of $49,500, a four-year degree is cheaper than a single year on campus at Harvard.
But the vast majority of people who take its classes never get a degree at all. They’re just looking for one particular course, or maybe a few, customizing their own education. 
Employers will soon take advantage of options like this, too: Universities will find themselves asked to build specific programs for particular companies. And universities will find themselves needing to explore other ways artificial intelligence technologies can help reduce the cost of education.
