Vodafone, Singapore Airlines and Intel are among other companies to have used similar systems.Polling commissioned by the Royal Society of Arts and released on Friday suggests 60% of the public are opposed to the use of automated decision-making in recruitment as well as in criminal justice.A citizens’ jury convened by the charity to explore AI concluded that the growing practice needed independent regulation and warned of public anger at “tech creep” unless citizens were given a greater role in designing systems.A parallel YouGov poll found that only 32% of people are aware AI is being used for decision-making in general. Awareness of automated decision-making in workplaces and the criminal justice system is even lower, at 14% and 9% respectively.Last week the United Nations special rapporteur Philip Alston said the world risked “stumbling zombie-like into a digital welfare dystopia” in which artificial intelligence and other technologies were used to target, surveil and punish the poorest people.The Guardian reported on how the UK’s Department for Work and Pensions was accelerating the development of welfare robots for use in its flagship universal credit system, and how more than 100 councils were using predictive analytics and other artificial intelligence systems to aid interactions with their citizens.“New technologies are being adopted at a rapid pace, and regulators and the public are struggling to keep up,” said Asheem Singh, acting head of tech and society at the RSA.“An increasing amount of decision-making – in our public services, the job market and healthcare – is taking place via ever-more opaque processes. This is a source of anxiety for the general public. The measures we are proposing – such as a new watchdog to scrutinise decisions made by AI on behalf of the public – are crucial first steps in increasing clarity and accountability.”Last month in a report commissioned by the government’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, the Royal United Services Institute, a security thinktank, warned of “unfair discrimination” by data analytics and algorithms in policing. Meanwhile, the high court ruled that South Wales police’s use of facial recognition software was legal, despite a claim it breached data protection and equality laws.The RSA panel spent four days examining the spread of AI and automated decision-making into recruitment, healthcare and policing. Members of the panel voiced hopes that algorithms could make fairer, less-biased decisions on things such as pay rises or promotions, and that facial recognition programmes might be more objective than human police officers.But they raised questions about whether automated decision systems would reinforce an organisation’s existing profile, for example as traditionally white and male, and how the public would know the technology was being used.The jury was convened by the RSA in collaboration with DeepMind, a London-based AI firm owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Unilever is using software from a US-company, HireVue, in the UK and abroad, having first trialled it in 2017. HireVue has previously said the software scans the language that candidates use – for example, active or passive phrases, tone of voice and speed of delivery – as well as facial expressions such as furrowed brows, smiles and eye-widening.“It is helping to save 100,000 hours of interviewing time and roughly $1m in recruitment costs each year for us globally,” said a Unilever spokeswoman. “It is, however, just one of many tools we use for our graduate recruitment.”She said video interviews were optional and candidates were asked to allow or disallow automated decision-making being used to evaluate their video interview. They were sent information about how to prepare beforehand and could choose to speak to a “talent adviser” instead if they preferred.The system is now used across Unilever’s entire graduate recruitment programme, and HireVue claims it has resulted in a more ethnically and gender-diverse workforce.Unilever said that at the early stage in the recruitment process when HireVue was used, it was not compulsory for candidates to give their gender or ethnicity so it was not able to provide representative data.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Work & careersGraduate careersUnilevernewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsJack Black puts Tenacious D ‘on hold’ after bandmate’s Trump shooting commentRFK Jr apologises after leaked phone call in which Trump seems to offer dealMy sausage-like fingers are not sexy.

Sci-fi wants to portray artificial intelligence agents as thinking machines, while businesses today use artificial intelligence for more mundane tasks like filling out forms with robotic process automation or driving your car. When interacting with these artificial intelligence interfaces at our current level of AI technology, our human inclination is to treat them like vending machines, rather than to treat them like a person. Why? Because thinking of AI like a person (anthropomorphizing) leads to immediate disappointment. Today’s AI is very narrow, and so straying across the invisible line between what these systems can and can’t do leads to generic responses like “I don’t understand that” or “I can’t do that yet”. Although the technology is extremely cool, it just doesn’t think in the way that you or I think of as thinking.

Let’s look at how that “thinking” process works, and examine how there are different kinds of thinking going on inside AI systems. 

First, let me convince you that thinking is a real thing. Putting aside the whole conversation about consciousness, there is a pretty interesting philosophical argument that thinking is just computing inside your head. As it turns out, this has been investigated, and we can make some conclusions beyond just imagining what thinking might really be. In the book “Thinking Fast and Slow”, Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman talks about the two systems in our brains that do thinking: A fast automated thinking system (System 1), and a slow more deliberative thinking system (System 2). Just like we have a left and right brain stuck in our one head, we also have these two types of thinking systems baked into our heads, talking to each other and forming the way we see the world. And so thinking is not as much about being right, as it is a couple of ways for making decisions. Today's AI systems learn to think fast and automatically (like System 1), but artificial intelligence as a science doesn’t yet have a good handle on how to do the thinking slow approach we get from System 2. Also, today’s AI systems make the same sorts of mistakes as System 1, where biases, shortcuts, and generalizations get baked into the “thinking” machine during learning. With today’s AI, there is no deliberative step by step thinking process going on. For example, How can AI “think”, when a major component of what thinking is all about isn’t ready for primetime?

Now that we have a bit more definition about what thinking is, how can we make more human-like artificial intelligence? Maybe representing feedback loops will get us to a sort of thinking machine like System 2. Well, as it turns out, we have not cracked that yet. AI models don’t contain common knowledge about the world. For example, I recall Yann Lecun, a “founding father” of modern AI,  gave an example sentence “He walked through the door” and pointed out that today’s AI models can’t decide what this means. There is a silly interpretation where we can conclude that a person crashed through a door like a superhero, smashing it to pieces. There is another interpretation where either the door was open or the person opens the door to walk through the doorway. Unfortunately, without common knowledge, you don’t really know which situation is more likely. This shows us that even “thinking fast” situations can go poorly using the tools we have available today.

We live in a world where fast thinking AI is the norm, and the models are slowly trained on huge amounts of data. The reason you can’t make a better search engine than Google is not the secrecy of their search algorithms. Rather, it is the fact that they have data you don’t have, from excellent web crawlers to cameras on cars driving around your neighborhood. Currently, the value in AI is the data, and the algorithms are mostly free and open source. Gathering masses of data is not necessarily enough to ensure a feature works. Massive efforts at human labor are often required. In the future, thinking algorithms that teach themselves may themselves represent most of the value in an AI system, but for now, you still need data to make an AI system, and the data is the most valuable part of the project. 
Thinking is not easily separated from the human condition, but we humans are also far from perfect. We may be smart on average, but as individuals, we are not built to do statistics. There's some evidence for the wisdom of crowds, but a crowd holding pitchforks and torches may change your mind. As it turns out, we are adapted through the generations to avoid being eaten by lions, rather than being adapted to be the best at calculus. We humans also have many biases and shortcuts built into our hardware. It’s well documented. For example, correlation is not causation, but we often get them mixed up. A colleague of mine has a funny story from her undergraduate math degree at a respected university, where the students would play a game called “stats chicken”, where they delay taking their statistics course until the fourth year, hoping every year that the requirement to take the course will be dropped from the program.

Given these many limitations on our human thinking, we are often puzzled by the conclusions reached but our machine counterparts. We “think” so differently from each other. When we see a really relevant movie or product recommendation, we feel impressed by this amazing recommendation magic trick, but don’t get to see the way the magic trick is performed. And one is tempted to conclude that machine-based thinking is better or cleaner than our messy biological process, because it is build on so much truth and mathematics. In many situations that’s true, but that truth hides a dark underlying secret. In many cases, it is not so clear why artificial intelligence works so well. The engineering got a bit ahead of the science, and we are playing with tools we don’t fully understand. We know they work, and we can test them, but we don’t have a good system for proving why things work. In fact, there are some accusations even in respected academic circles (slide 24, here) that the basic theory of artificial intelligence as a field of science is not yet rigerously defined. It is not just name-calling or jealousy being hurled by the mathematicians at the engineers. AI is a bunch of fields stuck together, and there really is a lack of connection in the field between how to make things work and proving why they work. And so the question about thinking and AI is also a question about knowledge. You can drive a car if you don’t know exactly how it works inside, and so maybe you can think, even if you don’t know why your thinking works.

Assuming we don’t have a concrete theory underlying the field of artificial intelligence, how can engineers get anything done? Well, there are very good ways to test and train AI models, which is good enough for today’s economy. There are many types of AI, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and more. Engineers don’t tend to ask questions like “is it thinking?”, and instead ask questions like “is it broken?” and “what is the test score?”

Supervised learning is a very popular type of artificial intelligence that makes fast predictions in some narrow domain. The state-of-the-art machinery for doing supervised learning on large datasets is feed-forward deep neural networks. This type of system does not really think. Instead, it learns to pick a label (for classification) or a number (for regression) based upon a set of observations. The way decisions are baked into neural networks during “learning” is not obvious without a strong validation step. More transparent AI models have been around for a long time, for example, in areas such as game theory for military planning. Explicit models like decision trees are a common approach to developing an interpretable AI system, where a set of rules is learned that defines your path from observation to prediction, like a choose your own adventure story where each piece of data follows a path from the beginning of the book to the conclusion. 
Another type of artificial intelligence called reinforcement learning involves learning the transition from one decision to the next based on what’s going on in the environment and what happened in the past. We know that without much better “environment” models of the world, these approaches are going to learn super slowly, to do even the most basic tasks. Systems that learn to solve problems this way rely heavily on accurate models of how the world works. When dealing with a problem related to humans, they need lots of data on what those humans do, or like, or think. For example, you can’t learn to generate amazing music without data on what humans like to listen to. In a game playing simulator an AI model can play against itself very quickly to get smart, but in human-related applications the slow pace of data collection gums up the speed of the project. And so in a broad sense, the AI field is still under construction at the same time as we are plugging lots of things into it.Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the company's ...

Regardless of the underlying technical machinery, when you interact with a trained artificial intelligence model in the vast majority of real-life applications today, the model is pre-trained and is not learning on the fly. This is done to improve the stability of your experience, but also hides the messiness of the underlying technology. The learning tends to happen is a safe space where things can be tested, and you experience only the predictions (also called inference) as a customer of the AI system.  
Despite the hype, AI models that think like we do are not coming around the corner to exceed humanity in every way. Truly thinking machines are definitely worthy of research, but they are not here just yet. Today, AI models and human analysts work side-by-side, where the analyst gives their opinion and is assisted by an AI model. It is useful to think about more general mathematical models like rainfall estimation and sovereign credit risk modeling to think about how mathematical models are carefully designed by humans, encoding huge amounts of careful and deliberative human thinking. The practice of building AI systems involves a lot of reading and creativity. It's not just coding away at the keyboard. 
I feel that AI software developers gradually build a sense for how to think about what an AI model is doing, and it ins’t “thinking”. I wanted to get some input from someone unrelated to me in the artificial intelligence field, to see if they feel the same way. Through the CEO of DTA, I set up a talk with Kurt Manninen about his work on an AI product called AstraLaunch. I asked Kurt a lot of technology questions, leading up to the question “Does the system think like people do?”
AstraLaunch is a pretty advanced product involving both supervised and unsupervised learning for matching technologies with company needs on a very technical basis. A complicated technology like this is a good area to be thinking about “thinking”. The system has an intake process that leads into a document collection stage, and then outputs a chart of sorted relevant documents and technologies. What I wanted to understand from Kurt is the way he thinks about what the matching technology. Is the system thinking when it maps the needs of NASA to the technology capabilities of companies? When diagnosing an incorrect prediction, does he think about the model as making a mistake, or is the origin of the mistake with the model maker and/or the data?
Kurt’s answer was really close to what I expected from my own experience. Technology like AstraLaunch involves humans and AI models working together to leverage the strength information processing approach. But, Kurt felt strongly, as I do, that bugs in AI models are the fault of people, not the model. An AI developer can see where the training wasn’t set up properly to understand language, or vocabulary, or where the dataset collection went wrong, etc.
Returning to the original question about artificial intelligence and thinking, I think we can solidly conclude that these systems don’t do thinking at all. If we only have fast and automatic (System 1) artificial intelligence to work with, can we think of an AI model as a gifted employee that thinks differently about the world? Well, no. AI will probably cheat if the training is unmanaged, and so it is a lazy, deceptive employee. It will use the easy way out to get the highest score on every test, even if the approach is silly or wrong. As we try and build a “System 2” that thinks more like us, we need to remember that thinking is not about passing a test. Instead consider this quote:The test will last your entire life, and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions that, when taken together, will make your life yours. And everything, everything, will be on it.

Rise of artificial intelligence means architects are ""doomed"" says Sebastian Errazuriz

Ninety per cent of architects will lose their jobs as artificial intelligence takes over the design process, according to designer Sebastian Errazuriz.



The New York-based designer made the controversial claim in a series of movies posted on his Instagram account.
""I think it's important that architects are warned as soon as possible that 90 per cent of their jobs are at risk,"" he said.
""It's almost impossible for you to compete"" with algorithms he said, adding: ""The thing is you're not that special.""


Born in Chile and raised in London, the artist and designer has courted controversy before, most recently by proposing to turn the fire-damaged Notre Dame cathedral in Paris into a rocket launchpad.
In his latest provocation, he has predicted the demise of the architecture profession at the hands of artificial intelligence.
In one Instagram post, Errazuriz posted an animation of a parametric tool developed by Wallgren Arkitekter and BOX Bygg that can generate plans automatically.
""This is today,"" Errazuriz wrote. ""Now try to imagine what 1,000 times this tech and 10 years will do to the industry.""
Wallgren Arkitekter and BOX Bygg have created a tool that generates adaptive plansMachine learning will soon allow software applications to synthesize vast amounts of architectural knowledge in seconds, he predicted. Architects by contrast take years acquiring the skills and experience needed to design buildings, leaving them unable to compete.
Errazuriz predicted that clients would soon be able to tell an app what kind of building they want, describe the budget, location, size and other preferences and get a range of options in seconds.
Soon a client would be able to ""move the distribution around, see it in augmented reality, check how my furniture will fit inside and approve the one that fits within my budget,"" he said. The app would then recommend a local contractor to build the project.


Only a very few architects will survive, he predicted. ""Architecture as an artistic practice is the only one that will survive and it will be developed by a tiny elite. We're talking five per cent, one per cent of architects max. The rest, they're done, they're doomed, they're gone. Finito. This is the end. Muerte.""

He advised architects to instead become software developers.
""Go into tech,"" he said. ""Understand that those same spatial capabilities can be used in more abstract ways to be able to coordinate giant systems and develop the systems of tomorrow, working with other types of engineers. Not the ones who will pour cement, but ones that will write code. Please make the switch now. Don't lose your job.""
Other provocations by Errazuriz include his 2017 project that vandalised augmented-reality artworks by Jeff Koons, and a range of shoes designed for a dozen of his former lovers.

Image: Oral-BToday, Oral-B launched its $220 Oral-B Genius X electric toothbrush, which Oral-B says uses AI to help you brush better. I never thought AI would come for my teeth.The toothbrush connects to an app on your phone over Bluetooth. When you start brushing, the app will show a timer of how long you’ve been brushing and guide you to where should brush next. That seems handy.At least you get a phone charger with your $220 toothbrush. Image: Oral-BOral-B says the toothbrush uses sensors to know when you’re applying too much pressure or not brushing long enough in a certain spot, and then sends data from the sensors to the app. The app takes this sensor data and uses the “Genius X AI algorithm” to tell you where you need to brush better and give you a rating on how well you brushed. I don’t know if I’d like that feature. It sounds like the toothbrush can brush-shame me.This isn’t Oral-B’s first connected toothbrush. The company released a Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush in 2014, which could be “programmed with the help of a dentist.” It launched its Genius line of toothbrushes in 2016, but earlier models needed to use your smartphone’s camera to follow your brushing. That meant you had to plop your phone into a smartphone mount on your bathroom mirror every time you brushed, which I would imagine would get annoying after a while. RelatedBrushing your teeth with a smart toothbrush is unnecessarily arduous This new Bluetooth-connected toothbrush brings a dentist into your bathroomOh, so that's why I never wanted to see inside my mouthPhilips Sonicare and Kolibree have offered toothbrushes for years that seem to work similarly to the Genius X. Kolibree’s even turns brushing into a game. Onvi’s toothbrush will stream footage of the inside of your mouth. And they’re all pretty expensive — a decently affordable option is Kolibree’s, which is available at Best Buy for $149.99, though Kolibree also partnered with Colgate on an even cheaper toothbrush that’s $99.95.Some people have already gotten their hands on the Genius X, and reviews seem... positive? One reviewer at Forbes praised how well the app tracked the toothbrush’s position in his mouth. If you really want to go deep, the YouTube channel Electric Teeth has a 25-minute review of the toothbrush — and the reviewer really liked it.But I still think I’m going to use the toothbrush I get from the dentist every six months.Oral-B Genius X  / Available for $220Order on Best BuyVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

I never thought AI would come for my teeth.

The toothbrush connects to an app on your phone over Bluetooth. When you start brushing, the app will show a timer of how long you’ve been brushing and guide you to where should brush next. That seems handy.

[Image: At least you get a phone charger with your $220 toothbrush. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RgeKHkaNLPnaKTEou2h70E_FzP0=/0x0:1200x1200/1200x1200/filters:focal(600x600:601x601)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19319289/oralB_G2_PDP_Secondary_Images_Mi.png]

Oral-B says the toothbrush uses sensors to know when you’re applying too much pressure or not brushing long enough in a certain spot, and then sends data from the sensors to the app. The app takes this sensor data and uses the “Genius X AI algorithm” to tell you where you need to brush better and give you a rating on how well you brushed. I don’t know if I’d like that feature. It sounds like the toothbrush can brush-shame me.

This isn’t Oral-B’s first connected toothbrush. The company released a Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush in 2014, which could be “programmed with the help of a dentist.” It launched its Genius line of toothbrushes in 2016, but earlier models needed to use your smartphone’s camera to follow your brushing. That meant you had to plop your phone into a smartphone mount on your bathroom mirror every time you brushed, which I would imagine would get annoying after a while. 

Philips Sonicare and Kolibree have offered toothbrushes for years that seem to work similarly to the Genius X. Kolibree’s even turns brushing into a game. Onvi’s toothbrush will stream footage of the inside of your mouth. And they’re all pretty expensive — a decently affordable option is Kolibree’s, which is available at Best Buy for $149.99, though Kolibree also partnered with Colgate on an even cheaper toothbrush that’s $99.95.

Some people have already gotten their hands on the Genius X, and reviews seem... positive? One reviewer at Forbes praised how well the app tracked the toothbrush’s position in his mouth. If you really want to go deep, the YouTube channel Electric Teeth has a 25-minute review of the toothbrush — and the reviewer really liked it.

But I still think I’m going to use the toothbrush I get from the dentist every six months.

Will Artificial Intelligence Lead to Massive Job Losses?


Artificial intelligence is the next big thing in technology, there is no arguing that. In recent years, AI has become as much a buzzword as a perceived threat to job security.

 



Make no mistake, the “AI” available on devices like smartphones, smart homes, smart appliances and such is not true AI – it’s just a clever interface designed to understand certain voice commands and act accordingly. There are still some huge barriers that have to be overtaken until true AI is developed. Researchers around the world, from laboratories in major Western universities to Google’s AI research centre in Accra, opened this summer, are working on it as we speak, expecting to reach breakthroughs in the coming years.
AI and job loss
One of the things the media often links to AI is job loss. If you search Google for “job loss from AI”, you’ll see a variety of reports stating that artificial intelligence will kill millions of jobs in countries ranging from the United Kingdom and the United States to Russia and Hong Kong. Others liken the emergence of AI and robotics to the Industrial Revolution that introduced machines to manufacturing, saying that, although it will indeed lead to job loss in areas like manufacturing and retail, the emergence of AI will create new jobs as well. And one expert even goes as far as stating that AI will create more jobs than it destroys – a godsend for many advanced economies.


Re-skilling is vital
Kay Firth-Butterfield, head of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the World Economic Forum (WEF), believes that artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it destroys – but re-skilling workforce will be vital for the transition.
She pointed out that around 29% of all current workplace tasks are performed by machines – and by 2025, this percentage will grow beyond 50%. This transformation will definitely affect the global labour force. The WEF expects AI and automation to displace about 75 million jobs on a global scale but at the same time, its specialists predict that almost twice as many – 133 million – new jobs will be created at the same time. Of course, this comes at a cost: based on a survey of companies across 12 industries and 20 economies, the WEF predicts that more than half of all the employees will need “significant re- and up-skilling” to harness the opportunities offered by what she calls “the Fourth Industrial Revolution”.
Change is always scary – and it’s especially so when it comes to AI, one of the favourite boogiemen of pop culture in our modern times. There are, in turn, enough specialists that say there’s nothing to worry about in the long run.

Look at the latest Gartner Hype Cycle for artificial intelligence, and you will see most AI elements are rounding the hype curve, and have yet to take their stomach-churning plunge into the trough of disillusionment. Talk to business leaders these days, and no one appears disappointed, yet.


A survey of more than 1,000 executives, released by RELX, confirms this is the golden age of AI. Adoption, for one, has continued to climb in the last year, jumping from 48 percent in 2018 to 72 percent in 2019.

Executives, to say the least, are pumped. No less than 93 percent say that emerging technologies, including AI and its close siblings of deep learning and machine learning, are helping their businesses be more competitive. Among these respondents, 57 percent report that AI tech is helping to improve and develop products, while 54 percent report these technologies are optimizing control and collaboration.

PROMOTED
AI may be an instrument for consolidating and reducing the workforce and operations, but it is having quite the opposite effect, the survey suggests. Close to two-thirds of executives, 64 percent, expanded the areas of their business touched by AI in the last year. A majority of businesses (56 percent) increased their data scientist and technologist headcount to support their AI tech expansion. Another 54 percent created new roles focused on emerging technology. With the increase in hiring, 54 percent of organizations were able to implement additional AI strategies.

Executives acknowledge and report they are actively pursuing education and training opportunities. A vast majority (93 percent) believe that companies should invest in the future artificial intelligence workforce through educational initiatives such as university partnerships. The majority (62 percent) of executives say their company offers AI training currently, up from 46 percent in 2018. Of those who say their company does not offer training, only about half, 53 percent, say they plan to do so in the future.

Brandon, 15 at the time, was receiving special education and social services, but Mr. Dai knew that by 22, his brother would phase out of the services and education provided by the state.“In the autism community, we call that ‘falling off the cliff,’” Mr. Dai said. “It’s what a lot of families are worried about.”Like so many entrepreneurs inspired by personal experience, Mr. Dai’s concern for his brother ultimately became the genesis for a new business. In 2018, Mr. Dai co-founded Daivergent, a start-up that is connecting tech companies with a pool of candidates on the autism spectrum. The company already has 20 corporate clients and has helped 75 people find work. There are about 1,100 candidates in the Daivergent pool.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe employment rate for individuals on the spectrum — even for those who have finished college — is extremely low. Statistics vary, but according to Anne Roux, a research scientist at the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute at Drexel University, about 50 percent of those on the autism spectrum have had at least one job since high school, but often that job is a low-paying part-time position. For those with greater impairment, she added, only 14 percent have employment in the community in which they live.It’s not that their abilities are lacking, said David Kearon, the director of adult services for the advocacy group Autism Speaks. “Anecdotally what we hear all the time is that autistic adults have the intellectual capability, but, because of their challenges with social skills, they’re often unemployed.” Brandon Dai, for example, “can focus on detail-oriented, complex, repetitive kinds of work that underlie much of the data structure that go into artificial intelligence and machine learning,” his brother said.ImageByran Dai, left, and his brother Brandon at the Grand Canyon. Credit... Mr. Dai, a data scientist, and a high school friend Rahul Mahida, a data engineer who has an autistic cousin, realized that there was no platform to pair those on the spectrum with companies looking for candidates who could work in data and artificial intelligence. The corporate name, Daivergent, is essentially a portmanteau combining Mr. Dai’s name with neurodiversity, the term describing those individuals who have a range of neurological conditions including autism. Most of the general population is considered to be neurotypical.Leon Campbell, 24, who is autistic, was employee No. 1 at the new company. With a computer science degree from Hunter College in New York, Mr. Campbell had technical skills but had never had a job before Daivergent hired him. He initially worked on labeling, but now focuses on quality assurance, overseeing the projects Daivergent’s remote workers complete. “I am one of the last lines of defense,” he said, before the work is sent to the corporate client.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHe worried that his new job would be stressful, but because Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida were so accommodating, “those concerns quickly faded away on the first week of the job.”Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida have taken a multifaceted approach to building their company because both the candidates and the tech companies have needs that can be complex.At the outset, Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida reached out to organizations like Autism Speaks and AHRC New York City to find suitable candidates, whose skills are assessed through Daivergent’s readiness platform, which incorporates work experience, technology skills and socialization. Teaching the requisite skills is accomplished through video-based education. Mr. Mahida said the candidates often excel at the ability to vet thousands of images. “They do much better on these assessments than Byran and I did,” he said.The most difficult part may be improving social and communication skills. Daivergent, Mr. Dai said, builds “shared interest groups through community forum and instant messaging tools, and also creates virtual job clubs where folks on the spectrum can swap tips and review resumes. It creates a community by us, and for us.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImageMr. Dai and Rahul Mahida, right, co-founded Daivergant. The company already has 20 corporate clients and has helped 75 people on the autism spectrum find work. There are about 1,100 candidates in the Daivergent pool.Credit...Calla Kessler/The New York TimesAnd Daivergent is working with the software giant SAP, which is a leader in employing those on the spectrum through its Autism at Work initiative, which started in 2013.Judith Williams, SAP’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, said that Daivergent would be offered for customers who purchased Fieldglass, SAP’s product for managing contingent workers, so that those customers could have access to Daivergent’s work force. In addition, Ms. Williams said, SAP’s managers would have direct access to Daivergent’s work force as well.Daivergent is also working with colleges to help autistic students gain employment. At Drexel, for example, the company is working with the university’s autism support program, to help those students obtain work to fulfill academic requirements, since the school is a co-op system that requires students to complete several internships before graduating. It’s often difficult for autistic students to obtain internships, but Daivergent is helping to bridge the gap. “While I just started working with them in April,” said Amy Edwards, who runs the autism support program, “they’ve been awesome.”Daivergent is not the only company helping autistic workers find employment. Brenda Weitzberg was one of the first entrepreneurs to tackle this issue. More than a decade ago, motivated by her oldest son, she said she read “one sentence about a Danish company that hired those on the spectrum to do software testing.” With neither a technology nor an entrepreneurial background, she shopped her idea with professors at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and asked if there were a group of students interested in an “employment autism project.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImageAspiritech has about 130 employees, neurodiverse as well as neurotypical.Credit...John Zich/AspiritechImageFidget items in one of Aspiritech’s four staff sensory break rooms.Credit...John Zich/AspiritechImageAn Aspiritech analyst taking a sensory break in Highland ParkCredit...John Zich/AspiritechWhile the students’ proposal didn’t pan out, Ms. Weitzberg and her husband, Moshe, nevertheless persevered, bootstrapping their fledgling company. They parlayed their first client into others, and now the company, Aspiritech, has about 130 employees, neurodiverse as well as neurotypical. Based in Highland Park, Ill., wages start at $15 per hour, about twice the state’s $8.25 minimum.While Aspiritech doesn’t have specific training, the company has hired support staff to work with its employees. And the employees have formed clubs for after-work activity, increasing their social interactions. While autism inspired the company, Ms. Weitzberg said her company’s focus was on the work. “Autism gets us a foot in the door, since many people have a child or family member with autism, but it doesn’t keep us there. There has to be quality.”Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida know this as well and, as a result, are deliberate in scaling their efforts. That is difficult because there is demand from the tech community, eager for capable employees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTUltimately, those in the field hope this will be the beginning of expanded employment opportunities for the neurodiverse community. As Ms. Williams of SAP said, “One really important thing we have learned — we had an idea of the types of jobs we thought people with autism would be suited for — like jobs where there is a repetitive attention to detail. But that’s stereotypical. We found that those on the spectrum can also work in H.R. and customer experience as well as engineering.”ImageA quality assurance lead at Aspiritech  training two new applicants.Credit...John Zich/AspiritechIn the meantime, Daivergent, like other start-ups, is charting its course securing funding and determining the best way to meet the needs of the community and its corporate clients. Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida have participated in the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator and an SAP accelerator as well earlier this year. And they have raised $1 million in funding to date.Mr. Dai hopes that his brother will eventually be suitable for the platform. “He’s well-versed in his iPad and grew up with computers, so I always thought of his potentially working somewhere in tech, likely more in a support role.”Growing the company has been a learning process for Mr. Dai and Mr. Mahida. “We don’t say tech will solve everything. We have to understand the nuance first,” Mr. Dai said. “There are people who have spent decades on accessibility and we won’t be the people who will say we know just what to do.”For companies — whether in tech or other industries — who want to add staff from the neurodiverse community, Mr. Campbell, Daivergent’s employee No. 1, has some advice: “I want an employer to see me as a person. Don’t hire because you want to look better for your investors.”A version of this article appears in print on Nov. 22, 2019, Section B, Page 4 of the New York edition with the headline: Connecting People on the Spectrum With Jobs in Tech.

Every business needs to apply it in their website design, app development, and marketing process. To put it in other words, every business needs to work with AI developers. For example, developers of game apps and gaming consoles are very vast in artificial intelligence. In fact, many of them are AI developers. This is because artificial intelligence makes video games interesting. Whatever video game you play, you’ll get a response from the system and it will be tailored by your input with no human intervention.This article actually discusses the benefits that make both AI developers and AI technology very important. After going through it, you’ll have an idea of what you’re missing if you’re yet to exploit the technology.1. Voice-based search is on the riseVoice command started with Alexa and many people latched on to the convenience of issuing voice commands instead of having to type them. It takes artificial intelligence for any system to be able to process voice commands.Now, a lot of people have already started carrying out online searches with voice commands. Don’t you also prefer to issue voice command instead of typing it out? In fact, it has been reported that half of the online searches will be voice-based by the end of 2020. It is definitely because of the convenience. So, it is necessary to hire AI developers to optimize your website for voice-based searches.2. 24/7 availabilityWebsites and mobile apps are available 24/7 but support staff usually aren’t available 24/7. Any customer care team that is available 24 hours a day must be running shifts. Unfortunately, customers are now too impatient and they want instant response. They no longer want to wait for 24 hours.Artificial intelligence provides the solution to the problem — AI chatbots. Many websites are manned by chatbots that will always respond instantly to customers’ queries anytime every time. You must have observed that live chats are available on so many websites now. Most of them are run by chatbots. Using chatbots will save you the money you’ll pay for hiring people to man your website 24 hours a day. So, AI saves costs and increases your rate of sales conversion.3. Improved user experienceWhen implemented properly, visitors on your website can enjoy great user experience and that will make them come back for more. One way to achieve that is to predict what they’re searching for. When they’re typing the name of any product, your website should present them with the options of the products whose names match those letters so they will just have to choose.Reducing the number of typing visitors do on your website helps to improve their experience tremendously. Another way to achieve this is to present them with their last order. Based on their ordering patterns, bots can present them with their last order so they don’t have to repeat the process all over again. Imagine someone who orders more than 10 items at the same time. It will be a lot of relief if she is presented with her exact order so she won’t have to select the items one after the other again.Now let’s talk about the advantages of AI in other areas.4. Reduced errorsAI robots work on codes and lack emotions. So, they cannot be distracted by anything. They perform their tasks with 99.9% accuracy that humans cannot possibly match. Whether it is data analysis or simple computations, robots will carry it out with reliable accuracy.This is why some companies employ them for data analysis. You understand that important business decisions are based on data analysis figures and it can be catastrophic if the figures are not accurate. For the sake of accuracy, employ AI for your business reports and data analyses.5. Increased speedThis is self-explanatory on its own. Robots, machines, and computers work with astonishing speed. So speed is one of the reasons to exploit artificial intelligence technology. Take Microsoft Excel for instance. To sum up hundreds of figures, you only need to highlight the figures and click on the auto-sum button and the answer appears in a flash. That is exactly how the robots work with speed. So, if you appreciate the speed of computations, think of artificial intelligence.6. Dangerous tasksSome tasks cannot be carried out by humans because of the danger involved. However, these tasks need to be carried out because of the importance of their results. Such tasks are now carried out by robots. For example, some explorations are dangerous because of the gases that may be given off by the act. It is better to design robots to carry out such tasks.These days, robots are designed to explore space, take snapshots and send them over to earth. Some robots can even fly a space shuttle on their own. They were designed specifically for the job. It is all based on artificial intelligence.7. The proliferation of medical appsThe artificial intelligence has yielded the emergence of numerous medical apps. These apps help with mild diagnoses and prescriptions. They only need to input the symptoms and their medical history on the apps. The ailment will be diagnosed and drugs will be prescribed.These apps rely on large volumes of medical data to be able to diagnose and prescribed drugs accurately.To sum it up, artificial intelligence helps with voice commands, 24/7 availability, improved user experience, reduced error, increased speed, dangerous tasks, medical diagnoses and prescriptions, and in many other areas.Author Bio:Melissa Crooks is Content Writer who writes for Hyperlink InfoSystem, a mobile app development company in New York, USA and India that holds the best team of skilled and expert app developers.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to reshape practically every sector of the economy over the next two decades, from healthcare through to agriculture, mining and transport. It has the potential to automate repetitive or dangerous tasks, increase productivity and inform the development of new products and services which change the way that we work and live.
  









Australia is world-renowned for the quality and volume of AI and computer science research we create, and as the national science agency, CSIRO’s work in artificial intelligence is 89% more cited than the global average, according to a Normalised Citation Impact, InCites (Web of Science Articles & Reviews, 2014-2018).
At CSIRO, AI is currently employed across multiple domains, from agriculture and climate science to energy distribution and precision health care. There are many fields of science within AI including: machine learning, natural language programming, deep learning (neural networks), computer vision and robotics.
At D61+ LIVE 2019, we gathered leaders throughout CSIRO to explain how they are using artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate their science for social and environmental good.
How artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can advance the tools that we have
The combination of historical tools and cutting edge technology has created a plethora of new opportunities, said Dr Simon Barry, Acting Director of CSIRO’s Data61. With the availability of vast quantities of data and the high-powered tools required to understand it, new pathways to accelerate and optimise every aspect of the future have been created.
Using the example of computer processing, Data61’s interim Director explained that while deep learning was widely understood in the ‘80s and ‘90s, it wasn’t until the late 2000s that the methodology was applied to Graphical Processing Units. This collaboration resulted in more efficient training of Deep Learning Models used to perform simultaneous computer tasks.
The CSIRO has applied this concept to agriculture, allowing farmers to make more efficient and sustainable cultivation choices, explained Dr Jen Taylor, Research Group Leader of CSIRO’s Agriculture and Food. “There’s a 70% uptake of unmanned tractors and similar machines rolling around farms making decisions about water, pests and pathogens without a farmer walking up and down the fields.”
“It’s so much more precise and efficient, which is fantastic for the whole system.”
  









Optimising Australia’s energy network using AI and ML
CSIRO’s Energy Business Unit is using AI and ML to model Australia’s extensive energy supply network via a digital simulation, known as a Digital Twin, to improve efficiency, disaster management, and emerging power sources. This process will also help manage over investment and energy distribution in the grid of the future, said CSIRO’s Energy Business Unit Director, Dr Tim Finnigan. He added that AI and ML is crucial to developing an efficient and adaptable system that can be used up until 2040 and beyond.
When it was originally created, Australia’s energy grid was designed to manage only a small number of energy sources, such as coal and gas, however, now there are millions of different derivations, explained Dr Finnigan. A Digital Twin simulation provides insights and results from various methods that could be used to update the network, with automatic programming able to determine the most effective solution.
""We’ll avoid over investment in that, and that could be in the billions in savings. And that’s just one benefit.”
“In the situation where you have faults in the system or environmental impacts, for example bushfires, which with climate change we are expecting more and more intense bushfires with higher peak temperatures, how will a grid system in those environmental conditions operate in the future, and how can it potentially repair itself if it is integrated with some machine learning?
If a fault goes out in a certain part of the grid, can machine learning help the system repair itself or reroute power so that we don’t get a South Australia state-wide blackout? We can actually have a smart enough and well-trained grid that could figure out other pathways for power to flow.” 
Building solid and dependable models for climate analysis
Machine learning is being used by CSIRO’s Climate Science Forecasting team to help better understand complex environmental patterns and emerging weather trends such as natural disasters like floods and droughts by mining insightful historical data, says team leader Dr Terry O’Kane. Being able to find a common underlying driver in similar climate patterns by using this cutting-edge technology to organise immense amounts of statistical information could help predict the future of Australia’s atmospheric conditions.
""We actually don’t really know the dynamics that drive the major climate teleconnection modes,” explained Dr O’Kane, “so if you think of the El Nino southern oscillation, which drives a lot of the large scale weather in Australia, and it’s relation to something like the Indonesia Dipole, the cause and relationships between these large teleconnections (climate anomalies being related to each other at large distances), we only really know them imperially, and machine learning offers a tool for a purely data-driven approach to pull out and mathematically underpin those relations.” 
This approach has been applied to analyse drought prediction, a multi-faceted challenge with a plethora of variables that must be considered when forecasting the future. ""The work we’ve been doing is to try and find, in a mechanistic sense, what other common underlying drivers by going back in time.”
""We have a better understanding of what we don’t know, which is a lot.” 
Using AI to guide farmers future plans
As the Research Leader of CSIRO’s Agriculture and Food department, Dr Jen Taylor appreciates how essential climate prediction is for Australia’s agriculture and aquaculture industries. Dr Taylor explained how a single gram of soil can contain billions of microbes that can, or cannot help a plant grow, machine learning and artificial intelligence provides a system that can interpret a complex growth system to ensure future crops set up for success. 
  









“Farmers have been working hard to get efficient practises for a while now, but there’s a lot more urgency in the system. Everything needs to get a lot more efficient, more sustainable. So farmers need to make some fairly complex decisions about how they use their water, whether they need to worry about pests or pathogens and that sort of stuff, and there are systems around that do that.”
Using the example of state-of-the-art wearable and hands-free sensors Data61 developed for prawn harvesters, Dr Taylor explained that AI and machine learning is helping the nation’s farmers making instantaneous decisions about best practise system management and preventing waste. “There’s a booth outside that’s been talking about how they help aquaculture farmers monitor the water quality in their pond.”
“We wouldn’t have been able to do that without sensors and a way to interpret that data that’s coming in.”
Understanding genetic diseases
Being able to extrapolate data when there are 3 billion letters in the genome was once a near-impossible task before machine learning, says Dr Denis Bauer, CSIRO’s principal research scientist in transformational bioinformatics.
  









With a research pool of 22,000 individuals with motor neurone disease, each who have 2 million genetic differences between them, equalling roughly 80 million features that need analysing, the resulting matrix included 1.7 trillion statistical examples. A dataset of this size could not be analysed fully if using traditional methodology, explains Dr Bauer.
“Using machine learning, particularly when we’re using it as a random forest, that builds individual decision trees that look at subsets of the data, and then ultimately come up with a model that captures the whole 3 billion letters for the genome and make that inference.”
In partnership with the Dementia Team Grant led by Prof Ian Blair of Macquarie University, CSIRO’s Transformational Bioinformatics used machine learning to analyse the full genome simultaneously, identifying the genomic location that jointly contributes to the disease rather than being limited to detecting only the strong individually contributing genes.
This approach resulted in the effective analysis of genomic data from sizeable sample pools, boosting the statistical power needed for disease gene classification.
“Now, for the first time, we’ve built our own  machine learning model that deals with this ultra-high dimensional data that others have not dealt with before. For example, the Googles and the Yahoos of the world typically deal with with tens of thousands of features.”
“It’s nice to know that a little Australian team is at the forefront of big data analysis.”

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Decades of technological advances have led to a revolution in ultrasound machines that has given rise to modern devices that weigh less than a pound and can display images on smartphones. But they still require an expert to make sense of the resulting images.
“It’s not as easy as it looks,” said Richard Fabian, CEO of Fujifilm SonoSite, a pioneer of ultrasound technologies. “A slight movement of your hand means all the difference in the world.”
That’s why SonoSite is focused on a future in which artificial intelligence helps healthcare workers to make sense of ultrasounds in real-time. The idea is that computers can be trained to identify and label critical pieces of a medical image to help clinicians get answers without the need for specially-trained radiologists.
“Using AI you can really quickly interpret what’s going on. And the focus is on accuracy, it’s on confidence, and it’s on expanding ultrasound users,” Fabian said during a talk at Life Science Washington’s annual summit in Bellevue, Wash. on Friday.
Bothell, Wash.-based SonoSite recently partnered with the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) in Seattle on an effort to train AI to interpret ultrasound images. To train the models, SonoSite is using large quantities of clinical data that it gathered with the help of Partners HealthCare, a hospital in Boston.
Artificial intelligence has shown promise in interpreting medical imaging to diagnose diseases like early-stage lung cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer. The advancements have drawn tech leaders including Google and Microsoft, who hope their AI and cloud capabilities can one day be an essential element of healthcare diagnostics.

SonoSite was initially launched with the idea of creating portable ultrasounds for the military. Its lightweight units are widely used by healthcare teams in both low-resource settings and emergency rooms.
Ultrasound imaging is significantly more affordable and portable than X-ray imaging, CT scans or PET scans, without the risk of radiation exposure. While the images it provides are not as clear, researchers think deep learning can make up some of that difference.
AI2 researchers are in the process of training deep learning models on ultrasound images in which the veins and arteries have been labeled by sonographers. One application of the AI-powered ultrasound would be to help clinicians find veins much faster and more accurately.
Fabian also gave the example of AI models labeling things such as organs and fluid build-ups inside the body, which could inform care decisions without the need for specialists. He thinks that future ultrasounds could deliver medical insights without ever displaying an image.
“If ultrasound becomes cheap enough, it could become a patch [that gives] you the information that you need,” said Fabian.

Artificial Intelligence System Gives Fashion Advice












A new AI system developed by University of Texas at Austin researchers can offer fashion advice. 









AUSTIN, Texas — People turn to many different sources for clothing style advice, from magazines to best friends to Instagram. Soon, though, you may be able to ask your smartphone.
A University of Texas at Austin computer science team, in partnership with researchers from Cornell Tech, Georgia Tech and Facebook AI Research, has developed an artificial intelligence system that can look at a photo of an outfit and suggest helpful tips to make it more fashionable. Suggestions may include tweaks such as selecting a sleeveless top or a longer jacket.
“We thought of it like a friend giving you feedback,” said Kristen Grauman, a professor of computer science whose previous research has largely focused on visual recognition for artificial intelligence. “It’s also motivated by a practical idea: that we can work with a given outfit to make small changes so it’s just a bit better.”
The tool, named Fashion++, uses visual recognition systems to analyze the color, pattern, texture and shape of garments in an image. It considers where edits will have the most impact. It then offers several alternative outfits to the user.
Fashion++ was trained using more than 10,000 images of outfits shared publicly on online sites for fashion enthusiasts. Finding images of fashionable outfits was easy, said graduate student Kimberly Hsiao. Finding unfashionable images proved challenging. So, she came up with a workaround. She mixed images of fashionable outfits to create less-fashionable examples and trained the system on what not to wear.
“As fashion styles evolve, the AI can continue to learn by giving it new images, which are abundant on the internet,” Hsiao said.
Grauman and Hsiao will present their approach at next week’s International Conference on Computer Vision in Seoul, South Korea.
Like all AI systems, bias can creep in through the data sets for Fashion++. The researchers pointed out that vintage looks are harder to recognize as stylish because training images came from the internet, which has been in wide use only since the 1990s. Additionally, because the users submitting images were mostly from North America, styles from other parts of the world don’t show up as much. Another challenge is that many images of fashionable clothes appear on models, but bodies come in many sizes and shapes, affecting fashion choices. Next up, Grauman and Hsiao are working toward letting the AI learn what flatters different body shapes so its recommendations can be more tailored.
“We are examining the interaction between how a person’s body is shaped and how the clothing would suit them. We’re excited to broaden the applicability to people of all body sizes and shapes by doing this research,” Grauman said.

The impact of artificial intelligence on education, financial instruments, criminal justice and healthcare, are just a few of the topics that will be addressed at this year’s Gordon Gamm Comparative Law and Justice Symposium on Nov. 8.
Leading this year’s Symposium, titled The Implications of Artificial Intelligence for a Just Society,  is Tulane Law Prof. Kristin Johnson, a national leader in the legal issues surrounding artificial intelligence and the law school’s 2019 Gordon Gamm Faculty Scholar. The event will be held in the John Giffen Weinmann Hall, 6329 Freret Street, from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The Symposium will bring experts in this burgeoning area of law to Tulane, to discuss the broad societal implications of AI. The rise of artificial intelligence introduces efficiencies and new opportunities in finance, employment, education, criminal law enforcement risk assessments, national security and the automation of various professions, including the development of smart contracts and the automation of various skills associated with the practice of law.
Recursive learning and neural networks enable machine learning algorithms to adapt beyond simple instructions and independently assess data in decision-making processes. Early evidence indicates, however, that learning algorithms may operate in a manner that leads to unfair, biased or unethical and in some cases, discriminatory outcomes.
Among the topics discussed by panels are the impact of AI on finance and employment, including the ethical and discriminatory risks; the displacement of humans in law enforcement, education, digital gaming and law; impact on ethics; and gender bias.
Distinguished panelists include:

Matthew Bruckner, Associate Professor of Law, Howard University Law School ;
Stephen Rea Campbell, Research Assistant Professor at Colorado School of Mines and University of California Irvine, Department of Anthropology;
Wendy Greene, Frances Lewis Scholar-in-Residence, Washington & Lee University Law School;
Dr. Nicholas Mattei, Assistant Professor of Computer Science, Tulane;
Suzanne T. Mestayer, Managing Principal, ThirtyNorth Investments, LLC;
Xuan-Thao Nguyen, Gerald L. Bepko Chair in Law, Director, Center for IP & Innovation, Indiana University McKinney School of Law;
Najarian Peters, Faculty Associate, Berkman Klein Center For Internet & Society, Harvard University, and Institute for Privacy Protection, Seton Hall University Law School.

A full program can be found here.
The event is free and open to the public, but registration is required.
 It is available for 2.5 hours of Continuing Education Credits (CLE) in Texas, Alabama and Louisiana.
The Gamm Comparative Law and Justice Symposium is made possible through the generosity of Grace and Gordon Gamm (L ’70) and the Gordon J. Gamm Comparative Law Endowed Fund.  The Fund supports the appointment each year of a Gordon Gamm Faculty Scholar, an early-career Tulane Law professor, and provides the resources to expand their research and engagement with other scholars and the broader public.
Johnson, the 2019 Gamm Scholar, has established herself as one of the first and most influential legal scholars to study the ways in which the algorithms used in artificial intelligence can unintentionally entrench racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination by embodying and reinforcing implicit biases. She testified on these issues before a Congressional committee this summer. 
By sponsoring the event, Gamm continues to support the law school with his passion for comparative law. Past Gamm Faculty Scholars include Profs. Saru Matambanadzo (equality law), Sally Richardson (comparative law), Ann Lipton (corporate law), and Robert Westley (racial reconciliation).

Called upon by the United Nations, World Bank, INTERPOL, and leading enterprises, Daniel is a globally sought-after expert on the competitive strategy implications of AI for business and government leaders. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  This article is based on a talk by Emerj.com (formerly TechEmergence) CEO Daniel Faggella at a recently held independently organized TEDxURI event. Part of the talk was on the impact of artificial intelligence on job security. When I speak to my business readers or with businesspeople at conferences and events, the topic is always the same: The applications and implications of artificial intelligence in business That’s convenient because that’s what we exclusively focus on here at TechEmergence. From oil and gas to customer service, we’re exploring the current traction and latest applications of AI. When I talk to family members or friends of friends, the topic is also remarkably predictable: The automation of jobs by artificial intelligence This lead me to devote an entire TEDx talk to this topic and to spend three long weeks digging through hundreds of interviews to find the common threads and themes about job automation from all the experts we’ve spoken to over the last five years. I’ve decided to distill these ideas into a single article—and here it is. Below is the full video of the TEDx presentation on which this article is based. What follows is a breakdown of what I consider to be the three most important elements of job automation:  Job Automation – What Researchers Say In our recent study of PhD perspectives on “AI Risk”, we found that most common “20 year risk” in the eyes of most of our AI expert panel was “Technological Unemployment.” We periodically carry out interviews and surveys of those that work with the hard science of AI. To keep up with current trends and issues, we talk to those who have a deep understanding of AI and its attendant technologies.  For one of our surveys, we polled over 30 researchers—most of whom have PhDs in various disciplines including artificial intelligence, computer science, robotics, and linguistics—about what they believed would be the risks of AI in 20 years and 100 years. Various responses ranged from general mismanagement of AI to killer robots. However, of the 33 respondents, 12 believed that the biggest risks of AI would be to the economy through automation.  Below, respondents explain how they believed AI would change the job landscape: “Drastic changes to the employment market due to increased capability of autonomous systems (it’s more of a certainty than a risk and we should already be factoring this into education policies).” — Dr. Helgi Helgason, PhD in Artificial Intelligence, Reykjavik University (Iceland), VP Operational Intelligence at Activity Stream  “Massive unemployment and resulting huge wealth disparities.” — Prof. Lyle Ungar, Professor of Computer and Information Science, Bioengineering Science, Genomics and Computational Biology, Operations and Information Management, and Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania ​”Massive unemployment. Machines will be singing the song, “Anything you can do, I can do better; I can do anything better than you.” — ​Dr. Nils Nilsson, ​PhD in Electrical Engineering, Stanford Professor of Engineering (Emeritus) in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University, Kumagai Professor of Engineering (Emeritus) in Computer Science at Stanford. It is apparent from the survey that many AI researchers believe that the AI risk to job security is a real concern, and they believe it is already happening today. This is supported by numerous other interviews and surveys carried out by TechEmergence at various points in time.  Three Factors Ensuring Job Security – Context, Coordination and Connection A rundown of recent news articles, as well as an MIT meta-analysis on job loss predictions, indicates that AI will certainly take over quite a few jobs in the future. However, there are many reasons why machines will not make all humans obsolete, and three factors stand out for people that have made it their business to know. Insights on this topic have emerged from interviewing numerous executives and researchers and diving back into previous surveys on TechEmergence that discuss the impact of AI on jobs in different sectors. From our research, we’ve found three factors that could ensure job security and fend off automation in the future. Factor 1: Context Most people believe that machines will take over mostly blue-collar jobs, such as in factories and manufacturing. While machines can improve some efficiencies, some tasks will require more context than machinery can handle. In the domain of welding, it is possible to automate the task in a repeatable or predictable production line. There has to be a specific kind of input that goes through a specific process to produce a specific output.  This type of rote work is particularly suited to automation. However, it is much harder to automate the repair of an automobile, as the welder has to make a judgment call based on the situation. For example, the welder would need to decide whether they would bang out a damaged portion of a car or cut through it and replace it. Many skilled workers, in particular, are not automatable. Take a plumber, for instance. The work is not predictable at all. When a plumber shows up at a house, many factors come into play that the plumber has to consider. The plumber may need to know the age of the boiler, the type of pipes, seasonality of the problem, and so on.  Only after getting the answers to these kinds of questions can the plumber even start to figure out what to do. This type of job involves a lot of context as well as physical dexterity. Robots are not able towalk like humans yet, so changing a pipe under the sink is probably out of the question. Another skilled type of work considered blue-collar is clothing and shoe production. Two companies claim to have developed AI-based software that can guide a robot to make shoes and sew clothes. However, these systems require humans to work alongside them and can only handle very specific and simple production lines. Much of the designing and implementing still depends largely on humans to work. Contrary to popular belief, white-collar jobs may actually be more automatable than many skilled blue-collar jobs. Quite a lot of automation implementation is going on in the world of white-collar workers, from life insurance agents to medical personnel. However, the most interesting thing about automation in these sectors is that the same rule applies as for blue-collar work: if it is repeatable and predictable, it is automatable. It does not matter how much a person is paid to do the work. A good example is in finance. An auditor, for example, that mainly goes through financial reports looking for variations or anomalies in order to pass them to the next person in the workflow is doing an automatable job. It is just a matter of detecting glitches in the reports, which an AI system can do. The same holds true for many bookkeeping and accounting tasks, where the work primarily involves handling and processing data.  However, a purchasing officer may also be looking for variations in the same set of financial reports, but will then use that information to make purchasing decisions. That is contextual and makes the work much harder to automate. The auditor and purchasing officer may get about the same pay, but one is automatable, and the other is not. Another good example is medical diagnostic AI, of which about a third of all SaaS AI companies focus. Current applications indicate that AI is not about to replace doctors for the simple matter of context.  Tests, machine vision, and medical records go a long way in reducing the huge amount of available data into manageable chunks to arrive at potential diagnoses. However, crunching the numbers and detecting patterns can only go so far. It takes that and a doctor to see, smell, hear and touch a patient to gather subtle clues that can lead to discovering the actual health problem. Context is probably the most salient point that emerged from all of the interviews and surveys performed. In a nutshell, if it is possible for someone to do a job in isolation without having to take into account any outside factors, influences, or situation, then job security in the face of AI is not assured. Context leads to complexity, and the real world is complex. Because of this, the best way to ensure job security is to embrace the complexities of a particular task and get involved in it in order to stay relevant. Factor 2: Coordination Context refers to situations, but people often create these situations, directly or indirectly. The second factor that can ensure job security in the face of AI is coordination. Coordination is primarily about managing people. It could be a small team of scientists working to find a cure for cancer. It could be a group of 50 sales representatives that are deployed throughout a state. In either case, the human element is the most important and confounding in effective coordination. While an AI system may match Scientist A to Scientist B as the best people to work on a certain portion of a clinical study because of their academic backgrounds, working together if they dislike each other may not provide optimal results.  In the case of a sales team, historical data may show that Sales Rep A has sold the highest number of products in a particular area. However, a new employee, Sales Rep B, lives in that particular area and has excellent relationships with retailers. A human coordinator can understand how those dynamics can affect an outcome. An AI system will crunch the numbers and provide the logical choices, which will not always work.   That said, AI does have a place in coordination, and that is in providing venues for effective team communication. This is particularly important when coordinating people in the field or in another country. Factor 3: Connection In a similar way, connection is important in ensuring job security in many sectors. It does not necessarily involve connecting with people in order to manage them, but jobs that require some type of human connection are probably going to be safe from human obsolescence. Call center agents to some degree are at risk from AI systems. Natural language processing can handle some initial interactions in the customer service tiers, such as self-service tasks (billing inquiries, identity verification), before referring to a live agent.  AI systems are also useful in customer service for sentiment analysis and customer data compilation. However, when the caller requires anything more complex than a scripted set of instructions or suggestions, a human connection needs to be established. A good example of complex interpersonal relationships is in education. AI systems have found their way into classrooms in the form of instructional design and content delivery, and even in tutoring.  However, student-teacher relationships have a profound effect on student engagement, and this has a direct impact on learning. It is not likely that students, especially young ones, will engage with a robotic teacher in quite the same way as a human teacher. Concluding Thoughts – Keep a Firm Grasp on Context According to asurvey by Bloomberg,  some of the highest paid jobs are also the most at-risk in the face of AI. These include compensation and benefits managers, accountants and credit analysts. Among the least vulnerable are doctors, teachers, and dentists. It is immediately apparent that the least vulnerable occupations are those that require human interaction and context at some level. The most vulnerable positions deal primarily with numbers and data. It is also interesting to note that blue-collar workers (except for truck drivers) are absent from the list of survey participants in our own AI risk analysis (mentioned with a graphic earlier in this article). As artificial intelligence progresses, programs will preempt human needs and take automatic action. The evolution of technology will be more than just upgrades in the tools used for work. It will involve different ways to relate and indeed live as human beings in an increasingly virtual world. The rolling process of creative destruction is moving faster and faster, and staying ahead of that is a major reason for keeping a grasp on context. If you want to see your own interests represented in the future of your industry, you must have your hands around the messy context of the industry itself. What skills are becoming more, or less, important? How is the nature of the customer changing? How is the nature of the product changing? Given the speed and pace of change, these aren’t questions to be handled just by founders and CEOs, but by anyone who wants to stay relevant and employable in the future we’re creating together. The factors discussed in this article are useful for anyone seeking job security in the face of AI as a litmus test to determine whether it will affect a certain career trajectory. It would be safe to say that for most people to whom these three concepts have no relevance, where interactions are so limited that it is not a critical part of their work, or whose activities are repeatable and scriptable, are the ones most likely to be at risk of losing their jobs to automation.

Big data isn’t quite the term de rigueur that it was a few years ago, but that doesn’t mean it went anywhere. If anything, big data has just been getting bigger.
That once might have been considered a significant challenge. But now, it’s increasingly viewed as a desired state, specifically in organizations that are experimenting with and implementing machine learning and other AI disciplines.
“AI and ML are now giving us new opportunities to use the big data that we already had, as well as unleash a whole lot of new use cases with new data types,” says Glenn Gruber, senior digital strategist at Anexinet. “We now have much more usable data in the form of pictures, video, and voice [for example]. In the past, we may have tried to minimize the amount of this type of data that we captured because we couldn’t do quite so much with it, yet [it] would incur great costs to store it.”
[ Could AI solve that problem? Get real-world lessons learned from CIOs in the new HBR Analytic Services report, An Executive’s Guide to Real-World AI. ]
How AI fits with big data
“The more data we put through the machine learning models, the better they get. It’s a virtuous cycle.”
There’s a reciprocal relationship between big data and AI: The latter depends heavily on the former for success, while also helping organizations unlock the potential in their data stores in ways that were previously cumbersome or impossible.
“Today, we want as much [data] as we can get – not only to drive better insight into business problems we’re trying to solve, but because the more data we put through the machine learning models, the better they get,” Gruber says. “It’s a virtuous cycle in that way.”
How AI uses big data
It’s not as if storage and other issues with big data and analytics have gone bye-bye. Gruber, for one, notes that the pairing of big data and AI creates new needs (or underscores existing ones) around infrastructure, data preparation, and governance, for example. But in some cases, AI and ML technologies might be a key part of how organizations address those operational complexities. (Again, there’s a cyclical relationship here.)
[ Sort out the jargon jumble. Read: AI vs. machine learning: What’s the difference? ]
About that “better insight” thing: How is AI – and ML as its most prominent discipline in the business world at the moment – helping IT leaders deliver that, whether now or in the future? Let us count some ways.
6 ways AI fuels better insights
1. AI is creating new methods for analyzing data
One of the fundamental business problems of big data could sometimes be summarized with a simple question: Now what? As in: We’ve got all this stuff (that’s the technical term for it) and plenty more of it coming – so what do we do with it? In the once-deafening buzz around big data, it wasn’t always easy to hear the answers to that question.
Moreover, answering that question – or deriving insights from your data – usually required a lot of manual effort. AI is creating new methods for doing so. In a sense, AI and ML are the new methods, broadly speaking.
“Historically, when it comes to analyzing data, engineers have had to use a query or SQL (a list of queries). But as the importance of data continues to grow, a multitude of ways to get insights have emerged. AI is the next step to query/SQL,” says Steven Mih, CEO at Alluxio. “What used to be statistical models now has converged with computer science and has become AI and machine learning.”
2. Data analytics is becoming less labor-intensive
As a result, managing and analyzing data depends less on time-consuming manual effort than in the past. People still play a vital role in data management and analytics, but processes that might have taken days or weeks (or longer) are picking up speed thanks to AI.
“AI and ML are tools that help a company analyze their data more quickly and efficiently than what could be done [solely] by employees,” says Sue Clark, senior CTO architect at Sungard AS.
Mathias Golombek, CTO at Exasol, has observed a trend to a two-tier strategy when it comes to big data, as organizations contend with the massive scope of the information they must manage if they’re going to get any value from it: The storage layer and an operational analytics layer that sits on top of it. News flash: the operational analytics layer is the one the CEO cares about, even if it can’t function without the storage layer.
“For specific use cases, it revolutionizes the way you get rules, decisions, and predictions done.”
“That’s where insights are extracted out of data and data-driven decisions take place,” Golombek says. “AI is enhancing this analytics world with totally new capabilities to take semi-automatic decisions based on training data. It’s not applicable for all questions you have for data, but for specific use cases, it revolutionizes the way you get rules, decisions, and predictions done without complex human know-how.”
(In an upcoming post, we’ll look at some use cases that illuminate how AI and big data combine forces, such as in predictive maintenance – essentially predicting when a machine might fail, for example – and other practical applications.)
In other words, insights and decisions can happen faster. Moreover, IT can apply similar principles – using AI technologies to reduce manual, labor-intensive burdens and increase speed – to the back-end stuff that, let’s face it, few outside of IT want to hear about.
“The real-time nature of data insights, coupled with the fact that it exists everywhere now – siloed across different racks, regions, and clouds – means that companies are having to evolve from the traditional methods of managing and analyzing [data],” Mih from Alluxio says. That’s where AI comes in. “Gone are the days of data engineers manually copying data around again and again, delivering datasets weeks after a data scientist requests it.”
3. Humans still matter plenty
Like others, Elif Tutuk, associate VP of Qlik Research, sees AI and ML as powerful levers when it comes to big data.
“AI and machine learning, among other emerging technologies, are critical to helping businesses have a more holistic view of all of that data, providing them with a way to make connections between key data sets,” Tutuk says. But, she adds, it’s not a matter of cutting out human intelligence and insight.
“Businesses need to combine the power of human intuition with machine intelligence to augment these technologies – or augmented intelligence. More specifically, an AI system needs to learn from data, as well as from humans, in order to be able to fulfill its function,” Tutuk says.
“Businesses that successfully combined the power of human and technology are able to expand who has access to key insights from analytics beyond data scientists and business analysts while saving time and reducing potential bias that may result from business users interpreting data. This results in more efficient business operations, quicker insights gleaned from data and ultimately increased enterprise productivity.”

Diplomacy in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

Theme
The key question on the mind of policymakers now is whether Artificial Intelligence would be able to deliver on its promises instead of entering another season of scepticism and stagnation.
Summary
The quest for Artificial Intelligence (AI) has travelled through multiple “seasons of hope and despair” since the 1950s. The introduction of neural networks and deep learning in late 1990s has generated a new wave of interest in AI and growing optimism in the possibility of applying it to a wide range of activities, including diplomacy. The key question on the mind of policymakers now is whether AI would be able to deliver on its promises instead of entering another season of scepticism and stagnation. This paper evaluates the potential of IA to provide reliable assistance in areas of diplomatic interest such as in consular services, crisis management, public diplomacy and international negotiations, as well as the ratio between costs and contributions of AI applications to diplomatic work.
Analysis
The term “artificial intelligence” was first coined by an American computer scientist, John McCarthy in 1956, who defined AI as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.1In basic terms, AI refers to the activity by which computers process large volumes of data using highly sophisticated algorithms to simulate human reasoning and/or behaviour.2 Russell & Norvig use these two dimensions (reasoning and behaviour) to group AI definitions according to the emphasis they place on thinking vs acting humanly. 3
Another approach to defining AI is by zooming in on the two constitutive components of the concept. Nils J. Nilsson defines, for instance, artificial intelligence as the “activity devoted to making machines intelligent” while “intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment”. 4 Echoing Nilsson’s view, the European Commission’s High-Level Group on AI provides a more comprehensive understanding of the term:
“Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are software (and possibly also hardware) systems designed by humans that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the information, derived from this data and deciding the best action(s) to take to achieve the given goal.”5
While the concept of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, one could argue that the ambition to push forward the frontier of machine intelligence is the main anchor that holds the concept together. As the authors of the report on “Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030” point out, we should not expect AI to “deliver” a life-changing product, but rather to continue to generate incremental improvements in its quest to achieve and possibly surpass human standards of reasoning and behaviour. In so doing, AI also sets in motion the so-called “AI effect”: as AI brings a new technology into the common fold, people become accustomed to this technology, it stops being considered AI, and newer technology emerges.6
In the same way that cars differ in terms of their quality and performance, AI programs also significantly vary along a broad spectrum ranging from rudimentary to super-intelligent forms. In consular and diplomatic affairs, the left side of this spectrum is already visible. At the lower end of the complexity scale, chat-bots now assist with visa applications, legal aid for refugees, and consular registrations.7  More sophisticated algorithms are being developed by MFAs to either advance the spread of positive narratives or inhibit online disinformation and propaganda.8 However, all these applications, regardless of their degree of technical sophistication, fall in the category of ‘narrow’ or ‘weak’ AI, as they are programmed to perform a single task. They extract and process information from a specific dataset to provide guidance on legal matters and consular services. The ‘narrow’ designation for such AI applications comes from fact that they cannot perform tasks outside the information confines delineated by their dataset.
By contrast, general AI refers to machines that exhibit human abilities ranging from problem-solving and creativity to taking decisions under conditions of uncertainty and thinking abstractly. They are thus able to perform intellectual activities like a human being, without any external help. Most importantly, strong AI would require some form of self-awareness or consciousness in order to be able to fully operate. If so, strong AI may reach a point in which it will be able not only to mimic the human brain but to surpass the cognitive performance of humans in all domains of interest. This is what Nick Bostrom calls superintelligence, an AI system that can do all that a human intellect can do, but faster (‘speed superintelligence’), or that it can aggregate a large number of smaller intelligences (‘collective superintelligence’) or that it is at least as fast as a human mind but vastly qualitatively smarter (‘quality superintelligence’).9
That being said, strong AI, let alone superintelligence, remain merely theoretical constructs at this time, as all applications developed thus far, including those that have attracted media attention such as Amazon’s Alexa or Tesla’s self-driving prototypes fall safely in the category of narrow AI. However, this may change soon, especially if quantum computing technology will make significant progress. Results from a large survey of machine learning researchers on their beliefs about progress in AI is relatively optimistic. Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and even working as a surgeon (by 2053). Furthermore, they believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years.10
AI and Diplomacy
Riding the waves of growing interest about AI in IR and security studies,11 the debate about the role of AI in diplomacy is also gaining momentum, although academic discussions are progressing rather slowly, without a clear analytical focus. As the authors of a recent report on AI opportunities for the conduct of diplomacy point out, discussions about AI in the context of foreign policy and diplomacy often lack clarity in terminology. They suggest that a better understanding of the relationship between AI and diplomacy could come from building on the distinction between AI as a diplomatic topic, AI as a diplomatic tool, and AI as a factor that shapes the environment in which diplomacy is practised. As a topic for diplomacy, AI is relevant for a broader policy agenda ranging from economy, business, and security, all the way to democracy, human rights, and ethics. As a tool for diplomacy, AI looks at how it can support the functions of diplomacy and the day-to-day tasks of diplomats. As a factor that impacts the environment in which diplomacy is practised, AI could well turn out to be the defining technology of our time and as such it has the potential to reshape the foundation of the international order.12
Taking note of the fact that developments in AI are so dynamic and the implications so wide-ranging, another report prepared by a German think tank calls on Ministries of Foreign Affairs (MFAs) to immediately begin planning strategies that can respond effectively to the influence of AI in international affairs. Economic disruption, security & autonomous weapons, and democracy & ethics are the three areas they identify as priorities at the intersection of AI and foreign policy. Although they believe that transformational changes to diplomatic institutions will eventually be needed to meet the challenges ahead, they favour, in the short term, an incremental approach to AI that builds on the successes (and learns from the failures) of “cyber-foreign policy”, which, in many countries, has been already internalised in the culture of the relevant institutions, including of the MFAs.13 In the same vein, the authors of a report prepared for the Centre for a New American Security see great potential for AI in national security-related areas, including diplomacy. For example, AI can help improve communication between governments and foreign publics by lowering language barriers between countries, enhance the security of diplomatic missions via image recognition and information sorting technologies, and support international humanitarian operations by monitoring elections, assisting in peacekeeping operations, and ensuring that financial aid disbursements are not misused through anomaly detection.14
From an AI perspective, consular services could be a low-hanging fruit for AI integration in diplomacy as decisions are amenable to digitisation, the analytical contribution is reasonable relevant and the technology favours collaboration between users and the machine. Consular services rely on highly structured decisions, as they largely involve recurring and routinised operations based on clear and stable procedures, which do not need to be treated as new each time a decision has to be made (except for crisis situations, which are discussed further below). From a knowledge perspective, AI-assisted consular services may embody declarative (know-what) and procedural knowledge (know-how) to automate routinised operations and scaffold human cognition by reducing cognitive effort. This can be done by using data mining and data discovery techniques to organize the data and make it possible to identify patterns and relationships that would be difficult to observe otherwise (e.g., variation of demand for services by location, time, and audience profile).Case study #1: AI as Digital Consul AssistantThe consulate of country X has been facing uneven demand for emergency passports, visa requests and business certifications in the past five years. The situation has led to a growing backlog, significant loss of public reputation and a tense relationship between the consulate and the MFA. An AI system trained with data from the past five years uses descriptive analytics to identify patterns in the applications and concludes that August, May and December are the most likely months to witness an increase of the demand in the three categories next year. AI predictions are confirmed for August and May but not for December. AI recalibrates its advice using updated data and the new predictions help consular officers manage requests more effectively. As the MFA confidence in the AI system grows, the digital assistant is then introduced to other consulates experiencing similar problems.
Digital platforms could also emerge as indispensable tools for managing diplomatic crises in the digital age and for good reasons. They can help embassies and MFAs make sense of the nature and gravity of the events in real-time, streamline the decision-making process, manage the public’s expectations, and facilitate crisis termination. At the same time, they need to be used with great care as factual inaccuracies, coordination gaps, mismatched disclosure level, and poor symbolic signalling could easily derail digital efforts of crisis management.15 AI systems could provide great assistance to diplomats in times of crisis by helping them make sense of what it is happening (descriptive analytics) and identify possible trends (predictive analytics). The main challenge for AI is the semi-structured nature of the decisions to be taken. While many MFAs have pre-designed plans to activate in case of a crisis, it is safe to assume that reality often defies the best crafted plans. Given the high level of uncertainty in which crisis decision-making operates and the inevitable scrutiny and demand of accountability to occur if something goes wrong, AI integration can work only if humans retain control over the process. As a recent SIPRI study pointed out, AI systems may fail spectacularly when confronted with tasks or environments that differ slightly to those they were trained for. Their algorithms are also opaque, which makes difficult for humans to explain how they work and whether they include bias that could lead to problematic –if not dangerous– behaviours.16
As data is turning into the “new oil”, one would expect that the influence of digital technologies on public diplomacy to maximise interest in learning how to make oneself better heard, listened and followed by the relevant audiences. As the volume of data-driven interactions continue to grow at an exponential rate, one can make oneself heard by professionally learning how to separate ‘signals’ from the background ‘noise’ and by pro-actively adjusting her message to ensure maximal visibility in the online space, in real time. Making oneself listened would require, by extension, a better understanding of the cognitive frames and emotional undertones that enable audiences to meaningfully connect with a particular message. Making oneself followed would involve micro-level connections with the audience based on individual interests and preferences.17Case study #2: AI as Digital PD AssistantThe embassy of country X in Madrid would like to conduct a public diplomacy campaign in support of one of the following policy priorities: increasing the level of educational exchanges of Spanish students in the home country,  showcasing the strength of the military relationship between country  X and the Spain and boosting Spanish investments in the home country.  As it has only £25,000 in the budget for the campaign, it needs to know which version can demonstrate better return on investment. Using social media data, an AI system will first seek to listen and determine the level of interest and reception (positive, negative, neutral) of the public in the three topics. The next step will be to use diagnostic analytics to explain the possible drivers of interest in each topic (message, format, influencers) and the likelihood of the public reacting to the embassy’s campaign. The last step will be to run simulations to evaluate which campaign will be able to have the strongest impact given the way in which the public positions itself on each topic and the factors that may help increase or decrease public interest in them.
At the operational level of the digital diplomat decisions are expected to take a structured form as the way to meaningfully communicate with the audience would rely on continuously tested principles of digital outreach with a likely focus on visual enhancement, emotional framing, and algorithmic-driven engagement. AI could assist these efforts by providing reliable diagnostics of the scope conditions for impact via network, cluster and semantic analyses. Prescriptive analytics could also offer insight into the comparative value-added of alternative approaches to digital engagement (e.g., which method proves more impactful in terms of making oneself heard, listened and followed). On the downside, the knowledge so generated would likely stimulate a competitive relationship between the AI system and digital diplomats as most of the work done by the later could be gradually automated. However, such a development might be welcome by budget-strapped MFAs and embassies seeking to maintain their influence and make the best of their limited resources by harnessing the power of technological innovation.
Given the growing technical complexity and resource-intensive nature of international negotiations it is hardly surprisingly that AI has already started to disrupt this field. The Cognitive Trade Advisor (CTA) developed by IBM aims to assist trade negotiators dealing with rules of origin (criteria used to identify the origin /nationality of a product) by answering queries related to existing trade agreements, custom duties corresponding to different categories of rules of origin, and even to the negotiating profiles of the party of interest.18 CTA uses descriptive analytics to provide timely and reliable insight into technically complex issues that would otherwise require days or possibly weeks for an experienced team to sort out. It does not replace the negotiator in making decisions, nor does it conduct negotiations by itself, or at least not yet. It simply assists the negotiator in figuring out the best negotiating strategy by reducing critical information gaps, provided that the integrity of the AI system has not been compromised by hostile parties. The competitive advantage that such a system could offer negotiators cannot be ignored, although caveats remain for cases in which negotiations would involve semi-structured decisions such as climate negotiations or the Digital Geneva Convention to protect cyberspace. The problem for such cases lies with the lower degree of data veracity (confidence in the data) when dealing with matters that can easily become subject to interpretation and contestation, hence the need for stronger human expertise and judgement to assess the value of competing courses of action in line with the definition of national interests as agreed upon by foreign policy makers. 
Conclusions
As Bostrom has shown, the quest for Artificial intelligence has travelled through multiple “seasons of hope and despair”. The early attempts in the 1950s at the Dartmouth College sought to provide a proof of concept for AI by demonstrating that machines were able to perform complicated logical tests. Following a period of stagnation, another burst of innovative thinking took place in early 1970s, which showed that logical reasoning could be integrated with perception and used to control physical activity. However, difficulties in scaling up AI findings soon led to an “AI winter” of declining funding and increased scepticism. A new springtime arrived with the launch of the Fifth Generation Computer System Project by Japan in early 1980s, which led to the proliferation of expert systems as new tools of AI-supported decision-making. After another period of relative stagnation, the introduction of neural networks and deep learning in late 1990s has generated a new wave of interest in AI and growing optimism in the possibility of applying it to a wide range of activities, including diplomacy. The key question on the mind of policymakers now is whether AI would be able to deliver on its promises instead of entering another season of scepticism and stagnation. If AI would be able to demonstrate value in a consistent manner by providing reliable assistance in areas of diplomatic interest such as in consular services, crisis management, public diplomacy and international negotiations, as suggested above, then the future of AI in diplomacy should look bright. If, on the other hand, the ratio between costs and contributions of AI applications to diplomatic work would stay high, then the appetite for AI integration would likely decline.

2 In simple terms, behaviour refers to the way in which people act to a situation in response to certain internal or external stimuli. The classical theory of human behaviour, the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model argues that  individual behaviour is best explained by the way in which agents develop intentions (desires that the agent has committed to pursue) out of a broader range of desires (states of affairs they would like to bring about), which in turn are derived from a set of beliefs (information the agent has about the world). The way in which intentions are formed remain a matter of dispute between different schools of thought, with a traditional view emphasizing the role of rational reasoning (the rational dimension) , while others stressing the importance of internal mental processes (the cognitive dimension), or the social context in which this occurs (the social dimension).

“Efforts to cultivate algorithmic fairness lag far behind the enthusiasm to adopt the technology”

American industry is in the midst of another revolution. This one is taking us to a place where decisions of many kinds, from when you should go in for a coronary bypass to where your car should turn left, will no longer be made entirely by us; they will be guided by artificial intelligence. That’s good news, because artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for improving the health and welfare of much of the planet. But for society to take full advantage of the power of AI, algorithmic outcomes must be fair, and the application of those outcomes must be ethical.
So far, efforts to cultivate algorithmic fairness lag far behind the enthusiasm to adopt the technology. Industry, with its drive for competitive advantage and focus on profits, has shown little inclination to shoulder this responsibility. The institution that needs to play a critical role in leading the way to an AI-powered world that is both ethical and fair is higher education.
At many technology companies, concern about the potential for unethical use of AI is the elephant in the room, and employee unease has prompted the hiring of ethics officers and review boards. This is a step in a positive direction, but it is not enough to overcome the challenge we face.
That problem is twofold: there are the underpinnings of technology itself, and there is the application of AI in ethical and unbiased ways. Machines may be fast learners, but the data they learn from are often a compilation of human decisions. If those decisions are freighted with bias, and they often are, AI can bake that in too, creating a system that is perpetually unfair.
Research has shown, for example, that some AI-powered facial recognition software returns more false matches for African Americans than it does for white people. Such technological shortcomings are exacerbated by AI’s failure to recognize them as shortcomings, as humans might do. Algorithms do not self-correct. They self-reinforce.
And humans, although gifted with the ability to identify problems and make ethical corrections, apply that ability in a very human way—selectively. Officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently combed the databases of driver’s licenses in states that use facial recognition technology without informing the drivers. And Amazon shareholders recently rejected a proposal to audit its facial recognition software, which critics claim can lead to false matches and arrests. With law enforcement engaging in questionable practices and industry failing to do the work needed, academia must redouble its leadership in this critical area.
With its teaching mission, its predilection for interdisciplinary research, and its indifference to quick profits from research projects, academia is well positioned to lay down the path to ethical AI. The teaching part of that effort is already underway. A Law for Algorithms course, which explores the impact of algorithms on society, was recently jointly taught at Boston University, Harvard, Columbia, and Berkeley, and many other universities include similar considerations in computer science courses. Cornell, MIT, Stanford, and the University of Texas offer specific courses on the ethical design of intelligent systems. Universities are undertaking the necessary research to power unbiased AI as well. 
At Boston University, researchers are investigating techniques that could be used to reliably apply algorithms trained on one population to other populations that were underrepresented in the training set. They are also trying to determine exactly how learning machines reach their conclusions, because it seems doubly unethical to apply potentially unfair conclusions when those conclusions cannot be explained to the humans who live by them. The goal of all this is the development of what is aptly called “fair machine learning,” which will allow us to tap the power of AI to study societal problems, ranging from affordable housing to the influence of fake news.
To accomplish that, universities need the government’s help. In line with the National Artificial Intelligence R&D Strategic Plan recommendations, public policy and federal funding agencies should support research initiatives that bring the expertise of academic scientists to bear on projects that serve the public good. Laws and regulations must advance and support the research and applicable solutions coming out of higher education and require industry to incorporate the ethics of AI as a critical component of their business model. Additionally, federal funding will not only help advance AI, but as a recent study shows, it will also fuel innovation and job growth. That’s a win-win. 
That’s not enough. A comprehensive examination of AI’s potential for harm, as well as good, should be an integrated part of all computer science education, and should work toward cultivating ways of thinking that are particularly attuned to fairness. Furthermore, as AI expands its role in the guidance of our lives, the technology that we have long labeled computer science must be considered as much a social science discipline as it is a STEM discipline, replete with the moral mission inherent in fields like public health or economics. This broadening of the discipline, aided by greater engagement with the humanities and social sciences, is critical as higher education trains the next generation of computer science citizens.  
All of us, in government, academia, and industry, must work together to set the future of AI on the most beneficial and safest course for everyone—but higher education, with proper support and with leadership from the computer science community, must step up and lead the charge.

People have more trust in robots than their managers, according to the second annual AI at Work study conducted by Oracle and Future Workplace, a research firm preparing leaders for disruptions in recruiting, development and employee engagement. The study of 8,370 employees, managers and HR leaders across 10 countries, found that artificial intelligence has changed the relationship between people and technology at work and is reshaping the role HR teams and managers need to play in attracting, retaining and developing talent.

“With technology adding great value to all organizational functions, people are excited about increasingly leveraging technologies like AI in HR. The study shows that the equation between people and technology is being re-written and the organizations need to work closely with their HR teams to meet the changing expectations of people. The study also highlights another aspect that with technology taking care of transactional activities, leaders and managers need to bring more strategic value to management and use more of their soft skills with people. If managers want to survive the challenge of AI, they must embrace EI,” said Shaakun Khanna, Head of HCM Applications, Asia Pacific, Oracle.

There is a new piece of data software doing the rounds in football circles. Pitched as a recruiting tool, it uses artificial intelligence to crunch player data and work out how influential over 90,000 players across the world have been in their leagues – before further refining the data so that the same up-and-coming stars can be compared by position, player role, age, nationality or even league. It gives clubs who pay the subscription fee a definitive list on, say, the best 23 year-old left-backs available for under £5 million in 250 competitions across the globe. It’s the work of Dutch data firm SciSports, who are working with more than 75 clubs worldwide and who are trying to boost their influence in the Premier League market, and have developed a razor sharp algorithm that, they claim, can give clubs a recruitment edge.

 How Newcastle United got a sports science edge: Big data, blood tests and brilliant training plans

 One of the features they’ve been showing off to English clubs recently is the shadow squad option. This crunches the data for every club in the Premier League and allows them to measure the quality of the squad against various league positions. So if you pick top four and then connect it to, say, Newcastle it’ll be able to flag up how many of United’s players would – according to their algorithm – be capable of stepping into a squad challenging for those positions. Welcome to the world of recruitment in 2019: the growing influence of insight, data and artificial intelligence is a noticeable trend in a world that is becoming the testing ground for some really groundbreaking work. But how do you bring that new new world order together with the established order of scouts who still have so much to offer and agents and companies who hold the key to players? The rise of so-called transfer speed dating is one way – and an agent based in Newcastle has one of the UK-based events that is growing increasingly influential. 









 Middlesbrough-born Tony Sharkey was a young pro at Leeds United before become an agent almost 20 years. And his new venture – the Football Transfer Forum – is one of the so-called “transfer speed dating” events which enables agents, club recruitment officials, sporting directors, sports lawyers and Chief Scouts to network in the crucial weeks before the transfer window.

 Revealed: The transfer summit Newcastle United were involved in this week as they look to finally do deals

 December sees the fourth edition of the event at Anfield and around 150 professionals from clubs across the four professional leagues and the SPL – as well as La Liga – will pay up to £350 for a place. There are keynote speakers – Dan Ashworth, formerly of the FA and now at Brighton, has given a speech, as has Steve Walsh, the man credited with spotting many of the players who helped Leicester to win the note. Companies like Football Manager – who want to roll out their extensive database to professional clubs in England – and player insurance firms also pay for tables and introductions. Newcastle have been among the attendees at previous events - at the Riverside and the Etihad - and the company who connected Ludwig Francilette to United in the summer are one of the firms who have made the most of the opportunity to alert clubs to players who might not be on their scouting radars.

 What Steve Nickson does at Newcastle United as transfer chief

 And it is the recruitment work that is the basis for the event. It’s a fascinating way for “prep work” for transfer windows to be carried out, giving clubs the chance to lay the groundwork for their target lists and also for intermediaries to alert clubs about potential players – and vice versa. “It’s basically pre-work before the window. I’m an agent so what might happen is someone from one of the clubs might say ‘We need a left-back this January’ and I’ve got a left-back or know someone who has one, it gives them something to work on,” Sharkey explains over coffee in a Jesmond cafe. “This is a networking event and it’s bringing people in the football business in the recruitment and transfer of players together. “It’s just one day before the transfer window but it brings them together: some won’t have met, some will have had phone calls and know each other over a period of time but it’s a good way of touching base with everybody. There’ll be a lot of clubs, a lot of agents and some good companies as well.” Sharkey sees a more modern generation of recruitment professionals are entering the game who are brilliant at using the tech – scouting platforms Wyscout and Scout7 or video analysis tool Hudl – with their route into the game through university degrees, analytics or science rather than having played the game. Maybe they haven’t had quite as much experience of pressing the flesh as their senior colleagues. Transfer forums, and Wyscout also hold their own event in Amsterdam this November which draws clubs from across the Continent, are one way of changing that. “I’m starting to see younger element now coming into the game,” he says. 










Tony Sharkey, the founder of Football Transfer Forum, at the last event at Etihad

 “Scouts being employed by clubs are very good with the computer, they watch games on screens with the different data packages and are incredibly data savvy. They’ve been brought up on Football Manager or FIFA and that younger breed of scouts are coming into the game which is freshening things up a bit. “They probably know each other on LinkedIn or one of the other platforms but to actually go and meet in person is a benefit.” Each club is given a table and agents and intermediaries book “appointments”. Clubs can also network between themselves with five minute “dates”. Sharkey explains: “It’s five minutes of ‘speed dating’. It’s done like that but there’s lots of time during the day and the evening where you can meet informally.

“The clubs also have a special part during the day where they get a chance to network between themselves so they have an informal space to network. Our regular people who have been coming with us for three years – it’s a chance to catch up. “People talk about players all the time. What people used to call ‘tapping up’ back in the day, well clubs and agents involved are talking about players 24/7. It’s part of scouting to know what players are about and to be able to talk about that. “I do know we have had one significant transfer off the back of the Transfer Forum as well.”Story SavedYou can find this story in  My Bookmarks.Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.Follow ChronicleLiveFacebookTwitterCommentMore OnJesmondBarclay's Premier LeagueTransfer deadline dayNewcastle United FCTop Stories1Newcastle made a club-record transfer bid for me but I messed up my career big time2FA respond to Eddie Howe talk as Gareth Southgate steps down as England boss3Newcastle owners know their most crucial addition after £186.7m masterstroke4Newcastle United transfer news LIVE with message to FA on Howe, Gordon future5Newcastle United stance on Eddie Howe future as England talk intensifies and £5m buyout detailsRecommendedAmazon Prime Day 2024 live sale updates on top deals from bestselling brandsThere are thousands of discounts to be had for Amazon Prime subscribers on favourites including Ninja, Shark, Apple, Beats and loads more in the two-day sale eventAlan Shearer slams former Newcastle team-mate over ‘ridiculous’ England commentJude Bellingham has failed light up Euro 2024 for England as he did for Real Madrid last season - but Didi Hamann's call for him to be dropped has been shot down by Alan Shearer Newcastle handed early warning by Premier League's big 7 as opportunity knocks Are Newcastle regarded as Champions League contenders for next season?

As the technology evolves, applications for autonomous vehicles, robotics, data mining and precision medicine, among others, are taking off and creating lucrative opportunities.AI is expected to add 14 per cent to the world’s gross domestic product by 2030, equivalent to $15.7 trillion (Dh57.7tn), according to business consultancy PwC. Experts estimate that AI’s contribution to the UAE economy will match the global increase of 14 per cent – the largest GDP share in the Middle East – in the same time frame. The country ranks 19th worldwide on the government AI readiness index, first in the region, according to Oxford Insights.“The invention of electricity, the railroad, smartphones all transformed the world as we knew it. AI can lead to an ever-greater societal and economic transformation,” said Dr Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of State and chairman of the MBZUAI board of trustees.Talent and academic institutions are essential, he said.  “The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence is an open invitation from Abu Dhabi to the world to unleash AI’s full potential.”Artificial intelligence in UAEThis is the teaching moment for artificial intelligenceArtificial intelligence isn't coming to the UAE - it is already hereThe university was officially launched on Wednesday at its campus in Masdar City.The UAE was among the first nations to see an opportunity in AI for its economy. In 2017, the government rolled out an AI strategy, dubbed UAE 2031, outlining plans to use the technology to make governance more efficient and naming eight sectors it aims to transform including space, renewable energy, water and education. The country also appointed the world's first Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Omar Al Olama. Mr Al Olama was present at the launch on Wednesday, alongside Dr Ahmad Belhoul Al Falasi, Minister of State for Higher Education and Advanced Skills, and Sheikh Mohammad Bin Hamad Bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Airports. Mr Al Olama and Dr Al Falasi are also members of the university's advisory board.""You're seeing the AI race emerge, with more than 20 national strategies. Countries are saying we need to lead and not be playing catch-up on this opportunity,"" Faisal Hamady, principal at Boston Consulting Group, told The National. ""It's a bit of a positioning game.""The money governments are investing is primarily going into research and development, workforce training, data infrastructure and governance, as well as helping start-ups grow, Mr Hamady said.Start-up data aggregator Magnitt counts 128 Mena start-ups on its platform that use AI. Of those, 52 are based in the UAE.Combined, these 128 start-ups have raised $18 million to date, according to Magnitt, indicating that the application of AI is still in the early stages. However, half of the amount was raised within this year, which might point to an upward trend, Sietse van de Kerkhof, a venture capital data manager at Magnitt, told The National.GOV-FIVE-YEAR-COMMITMENT“Aside from certain hotspots around the world, like the US and China, pure AI research is rare,” Mr van de Kerkhof said.With the opening of MBZUAI, AI research will be both common and local in the UAE.The university's founding board of trustees comprise leaders in the field. They include MBZUAI interim president, Professor Michael Brady, who teaches oncological imaging at the University of Oxford; Prof Anil Jain, a lecturer at Michigan State University; Dr Kai-Fu Lee, a technology executive and venture capitalist based in Beijing; and Prof Daniela Rus, director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Professor Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, Dean of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences at Tsinghua University in Beijing and Peng Xiao, CEO of Group 42.MBZUAI has partnered with the Abu Dhabi-based Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IIAI), an applied research lab, to supervise PhD students and curriculum development. IIAI will also serve as a principal partner for collaborative research.The university will offer master of science and PhD programmes in three of the fastest-growing areas of AI: machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing.""Following decades of research into machine learning and artificial intelligence, we are now at a turning point in the widespread application of advanced intelligence. That evolution is – among other things – creating exciting new career opportunities in nearly every sector of society,"" said Prof Brady, interim president of MBZUAI.",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://www.thenationalnews.com,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url':

UAE is rolling out its biggest effort yet to develop a workforce versed in artificial intelligence, as the rapidly-advancing technology transforms economies worldwide. The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), a new graduate-level AI research institution in Abu Dhabi, is accepting applications for its first masters and PhD programmes this month, with classes scheduled to begin in September 2020. As the first university to have a singular focus on AI, the institution aims to attract students from around the world to advance the technology and propel the UAE’s economic diversification efforts.  To compete with more than a hundred graduate degree programmes in AI – mainly in North America, China and the UK – MBZUAI is offering full scholarships, monthly stipends, health insurance and accommodation to all students. MBZUAI is named after Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, who believes in the transformative power of knowledge and scientific thinking. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, a subset of AI, are gaining leaps forward in mimicking human thinking – creating the building blocks for automatic systems that can be improved through experience and data. As the technology evolves, applications for autonomous vehicles, robotics, data mining and precision medicine, among others, are taking off and creating lucrative opportunities. AI is expected to add 14 per cent to the world’s gross domestic product by 2030, equivalent to $15.7 trillion (Dh57.7tn), according to business consultancy PwC. Experts estimate that AI’s contribution to the UAE economy will match the global increase of 14 per cent – the largest GDP share in the Middle East – in the same time frame. The country ranks 19th worldwide on the government AI readiness index, first in the region, according to Oxford Insights.  “The invention of electricity, the railroad, smartphones all transformed the world as we knew it. AI can lead to an ever-greater societal and economic transformation,” said Dr Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of State and chairman of the MBZUAI board of trustees. Talent and academic institutions are essential, he said.  “The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence is an open invitation from Abu Dhabi to the world to unleash AI’s full potential.”  The university was officially launched on Wednesday at its campus in Masdar City. The UAE was among the first nations to see an opportunity in AI for its economy. In 2017, the government rolled out an AI strategy, dubbed UAE 2031, outlining plans to use the technology to make governance more efficient and naming eight sectors it aims to transform including space, renewable energy, water and education. The country also appointed the world's first Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Omar Al Olama. Mr Al Olama was present at the launch on Wednesday, alongside Dr Ahmad Belhoul Al Falasi, Minister of State for Higher Education and Advanced Skills, and Sheikh Mohammad Bin Hamad Bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Airports. Mr Al Olama and Dr Al Falasi are also members of the university's advisory board. ""You're seeing the AI race emerge, with more than 20 national strategies. Countries are saying we need to lead and not be playing catch-up on this opportunity,"" Faisal Hamady, principal at Boston Consulting Group, told <em>The National</em>. ""It's a bit of a positioning game."" The money governments are investing is primarily going into research and development, workforce training, data infrastructure and governance, as well as helping start-ups grow, Mr Hamady said. Start-up data aggregator Magnitt counts 128 Mena start-ups on its platform that use AI. Of those, 52 are based in the UAE. Combined, these 128 start-ups have raised $18 million to date, according to Magnitt, indicating that the application of AI is still in the early stages. However, half of the amount was raised within this year, which might point to an upward trend, Sietse van de Kerkhof, a venture capital data manager at Magnitt, told <em>The National</em>.  “Aside from certain hotspots around the world, like the US and China, pure AI research is rare,” Mr van de Kerkhof said. With the opening of MBZUAI, AI research will be both common and local in the UAE. The university's founding board of trustees comprise leaders in the field. They include MBZUAI interim president, Professor Michael Brady, who teaches oncological imaging at the University of Oxford; Prof Anil Jain, a lecturer at Michigan State University; Dr Kai-Fu Lee, a technology executive and venture capitalist based in Beijing; and Prof Daniela Rus, director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Professor Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, Dean of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences at Tsinghua University in Beijing and Peng Xiao, CEO of Group 42.  MBZUAI has partnered with the Abu Dhabi-based Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IIAI), an applied research lab, to supervise PhD students and curriculum development. IIAI will also serve as a principal partner for collaborative research. The university will offer master of science and PhD programmes in three of the fastest-growing areas of AI: machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing. ""Following decades of research into machine learning and artificial intelligence, we are now at a turning point in the widespread application of advanced intelligence. That evolution is – among other things – creating exciting new career opportunities in nearly every sector of society,"" said Prof Brady, interim president of MBZUAI.",,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.thenationalnews.com/pf/resources/images/logo.png?d=753', 'width': 250, 'height': 69}",,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/TheNationalNews', 'https://x.com/TheNationalNews', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thenationalnews/', 'https://www.instagram.com/TheNationalNews.com', 'https://www.youtube.com/TheNationalNewspaper']",,,,,,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Banks and other financial institutions can be tight-lipped about how they implement AI technologies within their businesses. Citi, however, has been relatively open about their current AI initiatives. Since 2017, they have published press releases and other announcements of AI initiatives that are both internal and customer-facing. In this article, we cover three of Citi’s AI initiatives and explain how they work: Document Digitization: Digitizing paper forms for a risk analytics platform. Customer Service Chatbot and Mobile App: Citi’s mobile app that features a conversational interface for customer service and account inquiries.  Fraud Detection: Leveraging Feedzai’s anomaly detection platform for more accurate risk management.  Document Digitization Citi announced a collaborative project with Ernst & Young (EY) and SAS to leverage AI for an advanced risk analytics scoring engine. The initiative is intended to help streamline the manual processes required to review large amounts of global trade transactions while keeping regulatory compliance intact.  Citi Global Trade has been progressively digitizing its platform. Part of this involves digitizing millions of trade-related documents each year using an optical character recognition (OCR) component which likely involves machine vision. In order to create an AI-powered document digitization application, Citi would need to leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine vision. This would allow the application to automatically recognize each character and copy them into a digital version of the document. The document could then be searchable with an NLP-based enterprise search application. Customer Service Chatbot In 2018, Citi released its first chatbot, called Citi Bot SG, for Facebook Messenger in Singapore. The chatbot was available for all consumer banking customers after a beta testing period involving 600 customers and employees. While the initial release was for Singapore customers exclusively, Citi claims they will be rolling out the chatbot for other markets such as North America and parts of China.  The company claimed Citi Bot is able to help customers with a variety of needs, such as account specific questions like account balances. This also includes inquiries about recent transactions, bill summaries, and reward point balances. In order to leverage natural language processing (NLP) with this kind of conversational interface, Citi would need to develop an ML model trained on hundreds of thousands of customer service questions and their correct responses.  Once the model and the NLP software are combined, the resulting chatbot may be able to offer “intuitive” answers to customer questions, as Citi states. An intuitive answer likely is one that the chatbot delivers in complete sentences that are intended to give the customer the feeling that a real person is sending them the message.  While Citi is unclear on the complete functionality of the Singapore version of the chatbot, we can infer that it can request the company’s account files and provide users with information about their accounts on request. It may be able to link or redirect users to a page of Citi’s website where they may be able to find or update that information, but the company has not confirmed this functionality. In July of 2019, Citi Bot SG was replaced with Citigroup’s new mobile app aimed at global consumer banking customers. They claim this app features all of the same services Citi Bot SG users came to appreciate during its run. According to Citi’s website, users can now automatically offset their spending with their virtual points, find discounts, and withdraw cash from credit cards on this new version. However, it is unclear how much of this new functionality is accessible through the conversational interface itself. Anomaly Detection-based Fraud Detection Citi also partnered with Feedzai in 2018 in order to make use of their AI platform for risk management and fraud detection in banking. Citi claims they intend to integrate Feedzai’s platform f into its currently available services such as accounts payable. This may empower clients with more control over risk management for all their transactions. Manish Kohli, Global Head of Payments and Receivables, Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions (Citi TTS), has stated that this strategic partnership is a good example of their commitment to using new technologies to drive innovation. In reference to this partnership, Kohli said, “With the help of Feedzai’s solution, we can scale rapidly in an effort to deliver value to our clients, allowing them to make payments securely, efficiently and without friction, across the globe.” Citi may appear focused on providing risk management without slowing down their claims processing tech stack. In addition to the constant innovations of fraud detection and payment processing, cyber-attacks and other fraud methods are constantly improving. It is because of this that Citi’s clients expect progressively faster and safer transactions. They claim that their integration of Feedzai’s software will help these clients stay aware of new threats without taking more of their time. Feedzai has claimed their OpenML Engine helps banking data science teams create new ML models for fraud detections using provided sample models. It is likely that Citi has used some form of this to develop their models for banking and commerce customers. This offering may have helped Citi decide to partner with Feedzai, because the existing machine learning models indicated a higher chance of security and perhaps success.  The following image explains how the Feedzai’s platform works. The data flows from large storage units referred to as “data lakes” and APIs into the OpenML Engine platform. The platform then routes the data towards experiments and real-time analysis.  The data from this deployment also funnels into the “Feedzai risk studio,” which is likely a database Feedzai uses to improve future products. It is unclear whether Citi has access to the full Feedzai risk studio:  Feedzai’s software can purportedly accomplish this by monitoring all transactions for any discrepancies or unusual payment behavior. It would then analyze these anomalies before the transactions are cleared to continue through the system. Citi claims that they may have a new solution using Feedzai’s anomaly detection in 2019.   Header Image Credit: Fortune Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at JPMorgan - Current InitiativesAccording to Fortune, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the U.S. and controls over… Artificial Intelligence at Goldman Sachs - Current InitiativesThe top 100 global banks, including Goldman Sachs, are beginning to take AI strategies very… Artificial Intelligence at UBS - Current Applications and InitiativesUBS is a Swiss multinational investment banking and financial services company ranked 30th on S&P… Artificial Intelligence at Barclays - Current InitiativesBarclays is a UK bank ranked 20th on S&P Global’s list of the top 100 banks.… Artificial Intelligence in Retail Banking - Current ApplicationsMany business processes in retail banking are ripe for automation with AI.

How artificial intelligence will impact self-employment

People who are self-employed in some of the lowest paid and most popular jobs are at the greatest risk of being displaced by artificial intelligence (AI), according to new research from the University at Buffalo School of Management.





Recently published by the Center for Research on Self-Employment, the study found that with both self-employment and AI investment on the rise, independent sales people, drivers, and agriculture and construction workers are in the greatest danger of having their jobs computerized, because the work is routine and low in technical expertise.
""Those who are self-employed just don't have the same access to AI resources that corporate employees do, which makes it difficult for them to keep up with these technological advancements,"" says Kate Bezrukova, associate professor of organization and human resources in the UB School of Management.
The researchers conducted a systematic review of every study to date on artificial intelligence and the self-employed, and compared those findings to their own research on groups and teams from more than 20 published studies across many work settings. Through this approach, they found that while certain jobs are at risk from AI, not every profession is in jeopardy.
In general, occupations that require employees to work together, negotiate and make decisions are less likely to be eliminated because these attributes are harder for AI to imitate. The careers less at risk from AI are typically those with higher pay, such as lawyers, managers, and business and medical professionals.
The study also found that technical jobs such as maintenance for robots and distribution of hardware for AI may see significant growth.
""It's like when the computer revolution hit decades ago—there was great fear that computers would replace people,"" says Bezrukova. ""But work just shifted and IT positions grew because we needed more support for our computers and networking.""
Looking ahead, the study recommends creating public awareness programs to highlight the opportunities and risks of AI, updating education curriculum to integrate shifting skills and tools, and conducting additional research on the integration of AI in work, specifically for the self-employed.

Lancaster University leads drive to bring Artificial Intelligence to heart of business

2 October 2019 15:09



Key figures from industry, government and academic research came together to address how they all need to adapt and embrace Artificial Intelligence in the future of work.An event organised by Lancaster University Management School’s Centre for Technological Futures at the Work Foundation in London brought together voices from across many sectors.Representatives from the Cabinet Office, BT, the TUC, the British Retail Consortium and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, among others, looked at how they can embrace the opportunities and tackle the challenges Artificial Intelligence offers to the future of both business and society.The event, ‘Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work’, sought to identify opportunities and issues in the use of artificial intelligence within business, as well as its societal applications, through workshops and panel discussions.From left: Work Foundation Associate Lesley Giles; Professor Monideepa Tarafdar, of the Centre for Technological Futures at Lancaster University; and Lancaster University Management School Dean Professor Angus Laing, all speaking at the Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work event at the Work FoundationProfessor Monideepa Tarafdar, director of the Centre for Technological Futures, said: “The future of work increasingly depends on developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence.“While it is interesting to think about AI as being super-intelligent, the reality of failed and high cost AI implementation in organisations points toward the need for understanding and action on a range of managerial/human, technical, ethical, regulatory governance and social issues, as humans partner with machines to get organisational work done.”Fellow Centre Director, Professor Theo Vurdubakis added: “The understanding such issues is limited and needs cross-expertise collaboration from those in industry, government and academia.“We need to ask how we develop robust structures that enable people from different pillars of society to work together in shaping its progress and its influence on business and society.”The event addressed issues such how to manage an increasing skills gap in data science, retaining process expertise, and addressing regulatory, social and ethical concerns to effectively implement AI.Industry practitioners discussed their experiences with AI across sectors from accounting to retail, researchers focused on current problematic issues, and senior policy-makers provide insight on areas of focus and priority for the Government.Recent research from the Centre for Technological Futures and MIT Sloan School’s Center for Information Research – entitled Using AI to Enhance Business Operations – found that businesses that are serious about AI applications spend the money to hire the right staff and develop the business practices that ensure it can improve their business operations, rather than spending money and harnessing massive amounts of data with no obvious benefits.Professor Tarafdar added: “As a collective we have to examine ways forward, with the goal of developing a framework that goes beyond the stereotypical views of AI and focuses on what can be done to better work with it.” Back to News

Recommending content, powering chatbots, trading stocks, detecting medical conditions, and driving cars. These are only a small handful of the most well-known uses of artificial intelligence, yet there is one that, despite being on the margins for much of AI's recent history, is now threatening to grow significantly in prominence. This is AI's ability to classify and rank people, to separate them according to whether they're “good” or “bad” in relation to certain purposes.


At the moment, Western civilization hasn't reached the point where AI-based systems are used en masse to categorize us according to whether we're likely to be “good” employees, “good” customers, “good” dates and “good” citizens. Nonetheless, all available indicators suggest that we're moving in this direction, and that this is regardless of whether Western nations consciously decide to construct the kinds of social credit system currently being developed by China.

This risk was highlighted at the end of September, when it emerged that an AI-powered system was being used to screen job candidates in the U.K. for the first time. Developed by the U.S.-based HireVue, it harnesses machine learning to evaluate the facial expressions, language and tone of voice of job applicants, who are filmed via smartphone or laptop and quizzed with an identical set of interview questions. HireVue's platform then filters out the “best” applicants by comparing the 25,000 pieces of data taken from each applicant's video against those collected from the interviews of existing “model” employees.

PROMOTED
Needless to say, privacy advocates and academics aren't particularly keen on HireVue's ""Hiring Intelligence Platform,"" which is used globally to conduct one million interviews and over 150,000 pre-hire assessments every 90 days. ""It is going to favour people who are good at doing interviews on video and any data set will have biases in it which will rule out people who actually would have been great at the job,” UCL's Anna Cox told the Daily Telegraph.

HireVue's technology is already here, but there are signs that similar systems may end up being wielded in other areas and sectors, to potentially harmful effect. At the end of September, Sky News reported that Academies Enterprise Trust, one of the biggest academy school chains in England, had begun monitoring the mental health of pupils at its 150 schools using a tool called AS Tracking, which uses artificial intelligence to predict self-harm, eating disorders and drug abuse.

On their own, such systems can be beneficial, given that the introduction of AS Tracking in one school in Essex resulted in a 20% reduction in pupil self-harm. However, there's a genuine concern that once schools introduce AI classification and monitoring of pupils in one area, they'll apply it to other areas, eventually using it to select the “best” students and refuse places to the “worst.” This possibility is especially worrying in the case of private schools, or in the U.K., also in the case of academies, which critics argue have been turning schools into businesses.

""With these types of technologies there is a concern that they are implemented for one reason and later used for other reasons,"" said Carly Kind, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, who was speaking to Sky News. ""There is the scope for mission creep, where somebody in a school says this would be a great tool to sort children into different classrooms, or decide which students should go on to university and which shouldn't.""

This is still a fear rather than a reality, but when the use of AI is shown to result in improved results (and improved profits in certain cases), basic economic imperatives will dictate that rising numbers of schools adopt AI-based classification systems more broadly. And the same goes for businesses and organizations in general, as has been highlighted by other recent cases.
For example, the U.K.-based Trades Union Congress complained in April about the growing popularity of AI-based staff-monitoring tools such as Isaak, which as of April kept tabs on approximately 130,000 workers in the U.K. and abroad. Not only does Isaak record employee activity at the micro level (i.e. tracking whether they're typing or not), but it also ranks them according to how collaborative they are, using communication data to determine whether they're “influencers” or “change-makers.” On top of this, it can also compare employee activity data with sales performance figures, furnishing management with a detailed window into who's a 'good' worker and who isn't.
Similar examples can easily be found elsewhere. Montage is another applicant-filtering tool that utilizes artificial intelligence, and as of last October it was being used by around 100 Fortune 500 companies. A number of Fortune 500 companies also make use of Humanyze, which provides a wearable smart device that tracks employee behavior, conversations and movements, and that combines with data from emails and other digital communications to determine how engaged and productive any given worker is.
And to put this in perspective, a study published last year by Gartner found that analytical or AI-based employee-monitoring is currently being used by over 50% of companies that bring in more than $750 million in annual revenues.
No doubt the identification of “good” and “bad” employees is already firmly established practice in many of the world's biggest corporations, but it's likely we'll see the classification of people spread outwards into other areas of society. Most ominously, a September report on ""The Global Expansion of AI Surveillance"" published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that at least 75 out of 176 countries internationally are regularly using AI tech for surveillance purposes, while this ratio increases to 51% of ""advanced democracies.""
This is a startling percentage, and when it emerges that authorities in the United States, for instance, are already using AI to predict where crimes will happen and to maintain a facial recognition database of around half the adult population, the possibility that the use of AI could expand further becomes a very tangible one.
Given that the essential function of AI is to classify masses of data into simplified categories, and given that the vast majority of data comes from people, it's almost inevitable that AI-based tools will be used increasingly to classify people. This may begin as a mostly benign practice, but given the profit-motive and the logic of a competitive global economy, it will be very hard to resist the temptation to use AI in a growing number of domains.
The effect of this might be to increase the fortunes and profits of corporations, as well as to ease the task of governments and authorities in an age of rising political instability, but it's also clear that the widespread use of classificatory AI comes with massive social dangers. Numerous studies have already shown that AI algorithms are only as “objective” and “fair” as the data they're fed, and if little is done to change such bias, their deployment in the years to come might only amount to a means of perpetuating unequal and unjust social structures.

        What CFOs need to know to start AI deployment

            The learning capability can solve some problems for finance teams, but extra effort is needed to make artificial intelligence work.

Technology and analyticsPerformance management










The numbers sound promising.
PwC estimates that artificial intelligence (AI) could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030.
In Singapore, 86% of the 150 CFOs recruitment agency Robert Half surveyed earlier this year indicated that they are implementing the technology or have plans to do so in the next 12 months. The benefits those CFOs expect AI to bring include increased efficiencies and productivity (50%), better decision-making capabilities (46%), and enhanced processes (44%), the company noted.
A late 2018 Gartner survey found that 27% of the more than 400 companies polled planned to deploy AI for their finance functions by 2020.
But what is AI?
Enterprise- and consumer-technology companies attach the AI label to a wide range of products — among them chatbots, facial recognition, and even smartphone games that “predict” how you will look when you grow old. So, what is AI, and what would it allow users such as CFOs and their teams to achieve?
While AI is a broad term, it all comes down to data and getting a learning engine to do a better job, according to Eric Thain, co-chair and president at the Artificial Intelligence Society of Hong Kong and general manager of brand development at HK Express, a Hong Kong-headquartered airline.
As machines learn by trial-and-error and/or pattern recognition, data is the fuel for their learning process, Thain said in a phone interview. “The more the data, the better the learning engine works,” he noted.
In addition, machine learning is the natural progression of data analytics when it comes to AI, he said.
“While descriptive analytics tells us what the situation is, predictive analytics tells us about the future based on past data,” he explained. “And then there’ll be prescriptive analytics that tells us what to do when something happens. When narrowed down, AI and data analytics is machine learning at work.”
In Charting the Future of Accountancy With AI, a report by CPA Australia and the Singapore Management University School of Accountancy, machine learning — a subfield of AI and the driver of most of AI’s recent progress — is defined as the use of techniques that enable computers to learn and continually improve without being explicitly programmed.
“In essence, AI and machine learning (in their current form) consist of techniques which learn to recognise patterns in order to make predictions that facilitate decision-making,” the report said.
What can AI do for the finance function?
One way AI can help finance functions is to automate the extraction of data from documents such as invoices and receipts, according to Rahul Chandra, head of South East Asia and Middle East at Intain Fintech, an AI and blockchain solutions provider based in India, Singapore, and the US.
Context-based learning capabilities allow AI tools to recognise common features on different invoices even when those invoices have varied formats, he said in an interview with FM.
Thus, after successfully recognising and classifying a document such as an invoice, an AI tool can extract data such as invoice numbers, amounts payable, bank account numbers, and company names, even if they appear in different places on different invoices.
“Companies denote invoice numbers in different ways such as INV number, invoice number, or purchase number. An AI tool will eventually learn that they refer to the same thing, and there’s no need for employees to manually extract data from documents,” Chandra said.

How much time is required to train an AI tool to extract the correct data? The more invoices that a finance function uses to train an AI tool, the faster it learns, according to Chandra.
While the time required for AI tools to become highly accurate differs, Chandra said it takes one to four weeks for Intain Fintech’s AI tool to become 90% confident in its data extraction work.
Confidence is the probability with which an AI model predicts what it has extracted is accurate; confidence ranges from 0% to 100% — from not so confident to absolutely sure, according to Chandra.
He added that Intain Fintech’s AI solution allows a user to decide “the level of confidence” that requires human intervention, he said.
“For instance, a user can choose to get an alert if the AI tool only has 70% confidence in document recognition,” he explained.
Fully automated finance processes go beyond data extraction
Successful data extraction from documents is not the same as the complete automation of a finance process.
In the invoice scenario, finance functions need to be aware that making the extracted invoice data available to a company’s existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for the accounts payable process requires integration between the AI tool and the ERP system, Chandra pointed out.
Integration usually requires an application programming interface (API), which in simple terms is computer code that allows computer applications to communicate with one another. An AI vendor that provides a document recognition tool might also provide an API.
What about forecasting? It might not be that straightforward
According to Charting the Future of Accountancy With AI, forecasting is a task that AI can help in financial planning and analysis (FP&A).
AI analytics tools can generate new insights into costing, pricing, sales, revenue, and cash flow by analysing historical relationships between internal and external drivers such as product portfolios, competitor behaviour, natural events, macroeconomics, and historical performance, the report stated.
While Gartner also sees interest growing in using AI to improve FP&A, it said that only a few organisations are currently using it successfully.
The reason is that AI is not yet built into most FP&A application suites, said Christopher Iervolino, senior director analyst at Gartner.
But to someone like Thain, who comes from the airline industry, revenues forecasting with AI is nothing new and is doable with clean and integrated data.
“The airline industry — which has an enormous amount of customer data — has used predictive analytics to help come up with pricing and revenue strategies for ten to 20 years already,” he said. “Indeed the industry is one of the cases used in university-level AI teaching.”

Start with examining your data
As data and its quality matter, Chandra and Thain advised finance functions to take the following steps if they want to deploy AI for forecasting.
Digitise data. According to Chandra, if you have not digitised your data, you will have to do so before using AI to get any forecasting done.
“The more data you have the better,” he said. “There’s no point to forecast based on a small amount of data because it won’t be accurate.”
While a scanner helps to digitise a paper document, it takes the optical character recognition (OCR) technology to enable computers to read its data and content.
However, OCR can only give users a raw dump of data, Chandra pointed out. Thus, finance teams need to work with IT teams to extract data points such as dates and the different types of numbers in a document, he added.
Clean data. A task harder than data digitisation is data cleansing. “There’s always junk in data,” said Chandra. “This is why data cleansing is important. You don’t want to forecast with incorrect data.”
Data cleansing involves the detection, correction, or removal of inaccurate data from a database, a spreadsheet, or other sources. All these tasks can be done by data cleansing tools offered by different technology vendors, Chandra said.
Before data cleansing is done, one has to define the rules for the task, he said.
After a finance team has come up with the rules, it asks the IT function to implement them. An alternative is to use a tool that allows users to directly apply rules without involving IT, Chandra said.
Integrate data. Data cleansing and data integration combined are 70% of the battle, said Thain. Finance functions need to make sure that data points and data sets are integrated — especially when some of the data needed is captured differently because it comes from other functions — before AI tools can provide the desired analysis and insights, he said. An AI solution provider can help with data integration, he added.
Advice to CFOs
Know what you want to do with AI. The most important question that CFOs need to ask before deployment is what they want AI to do, Chandra said. “You start this by mapping your processes,” he said. “Once you have a correct process map, you start to see the pain points. Some of them might not require you to fix with AI at all.”
Act now. As AI deployment is a big step, CFOs should act now, Thain said.
“Adoption is only half the battle while the other half is about changing the way you and others work and an organisation’s culture. So start talking to people who are knowledgeable about AI,” he said.
After that, CFOs need to have a top-down strategic vision and communicate with the organisation about that properly.
Stay away from a big-bang type of transformation. As AI deployment plus data cleansing is a long and tedious process, one can start by taking baby steps, Chandra noted.
“If there are ten steps, you can start with two steps first and see what benefits you can reap before moving to the next one” he said.

We just have to do it thoughtfully,"" Beyer told USA TODAY. He said computer learning and facial recognition software could enable police to falsely identify someone, prompting a cop to reach for a gun in extreme cases. ""I think very soon we will ask to ban the use of facial recognition technology on body cams because of the real-time concerns,"" Beyer said.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a general purpose technology that is quickly reshaping economic activity and human behavior. Modern AI is still in its early days (though the term itself and earlier versions date back to the 1950s). Several estimates suggest that AI could create trillions or tens of trillions of dollars in wealth. Given the wide potential applications of the technology, those numbers seem plausible.
But as with most bursts of technological innovation, the benefits and risks of AI are not distributed equally worldwide. In AI as with other technologies, what we have isn’t really a global economy, but a set of partially connected national economies playing out on the global stage.
How does machine learning work?
Computer programs typically are created by programmers who write down a set of instructions that the computer executes. This works well when software can clearly state a set of rules or processes for doing something straightforward—basic mathematical operations, for instance.
But if we want a computer to carry out a task that doesn’t have a set of easy-to-follow instructions, because we don’t know exactly how to do it or how it can be efficiently done—such as recognizing a face or keeping our balance while catching a football—then we need a different technique.
Machine learning uses statistics to train computers to independently extract patterns from massive data sets, develop their own algorithms based on those patterns, and fine-tune the algorithms’ predictive ability by running them against new data sets.
How does machine learning boost economic growth?
Machine learning can create enormous value in a variety of ways, but probably the simplest way is by ramping up productivity. Any real production process—whether a factory that makes cars or a process that determines the likelihood that a biopsied skin cell is malignant—has thousands of steps. Each one of those steps could be done more efficiently. But to figure out how to do so requires considering possible changes to these thousands of steps, and perhaps rearranging them and adding new ones. This ushers in a cascade of nearly infinite possibilities.
Given this complexity, machine learning is a more efficient way to sift through these possibilities because the algorithms can predict whether a change will improve things. In practice, this means machine learning can yield productivity gains that human beings might not have otherwise imagined or discovered. 
But those algorithms themselves need to be built, maintained, and improved. That involves a set of processes that we call a “machine learning value chain”. The term “value chain” still calls up images of factories and industrial products, but new technologies, such as AI, have value chains too. 
An AI value chain basically includes five steps: data collection, data storage, data preparation and engineering, algorithm training, and algorithm development. That’s not the only way to categorize it, and it’s not the end of the story by any means. But thinking about AI in these terms shows that some countries are in better shape to join the AI competition than others.
How have policymakers approached AI so far?
It wasn’t that long ago that many people in the technology sector were able to convince policymakers that the digital world existed on a plane separate from and independent of governments. The internet of the 1990s, and even through much of the 2000s, was imagined to be a policy-free zone in which the power of technology would simply overwhelm or bypass the power of the state. It’s good that this naive notion is now mostly gone. But that really ups the ante for policymakers, who now have no excuse for simply letting the technology sector carve its own path. 
Policymakers thinking about long-term economic growth as well as military and security issues need to determine which parts of the machine learning value chain are most important, and realistically achievable for their country. Policy will be an important determinant of where countries land in the global machine learning economy over the next decade. That has become increasingly clear in the last year or so, as governments develop AI strategies to position themselves on what may be an even more uneven landscape than the one that late twentieth-century globalization produced.
How will the consequences of AI differ from the effects of globalization?
In simple terms, globalization refers to the increasing mobility of goods, money, ideas, and, to a lesser extent, people across national boundaries. This heightened mobility, in turn, has led many global companies to create cross-national production networks. For instance, the technology and business services firm IBM promoted a vision of a globally integrated enterprise, where work moves (as former chief executive officer Sam Palmisano put it) to where it can be done best, essentially without regard for political borders. 
Right now, the AI and machine learning economy is not evolving that way. That’s partly a function of the global rise in economic nationalism. But in many ways, this difference is also specific to AI. Given AI’s propensity to boost productivity and growth, policymakers see that the technology is poised to bestow significant and possibly sustained advantage on the companies and countries that lead. This makes countries less keen to share AI-related scientific and business knowledge.
AI also has direct military and intelligence applications—autonomous weapons are just one example. Countries have also become sensitive, though in very different ways, to the uses and abuses of very large data sets collected by firms and governments. They are keenly aware of the value of such data and are leery of letting it fall into others’ hands.
Like with the steam engine or other technologies of the past, the basic science and technologies behind machine learning cannot really be controlled or contained. But pieces of the value chain can be at least partially contained within national borders. It is possible to restrict the export of data, and access to bespoke hardware that runs machine learning systems much more efficiently than less specialized hardware. Governments can encourage or discourage the development of markets for certain kinds of machine learning products that can jumpstart AI-powered economic growth. Restricting the movement of the most talented machine learning researchers and engineers (through visa restrictions, for instance) is feasible. And it’s possible, though not easy or cheap, that some technologies could be brought out of the private sector and back into the public and defense sectors, if governments decide it is necessary for national security reasons. 
The bottom line is that no law of nature says that machine learning will diffuse across national borders and be equally available to all countries and companies. There will be leaders and laggards. In the fast-moving technology space, it’s likely that the market leaders will, at least for a time, accelerate ahead of others at an even faster pace, as their initial advantages build on themselves. That has important consequences for global economic inequality, which may start to take a different shape than it has over the last thirty years.
How can policymakers prepare for those new developments in economic inequality?
Globalization has contributed to increased inequality inside many countries. But economic inequality between countries has diminished in meaningful terms. Economist Richard Baldwin coined the term “the Great Convergence” to describe this phenomenon. This convergence was partly driven by Chinese growth and some of its positive effects in other developing nations—all of which were enabled by cross-national production networks and liberalized trade in manufactured goods. The relative increase in wealth among many less developed countries was a geopolitical stabilizer, even as worsening domestic inequality created internal political fractures in many countries.
The machine learning economy looks set to shape a different inequality landscape. First-mover advantages, positive feedback growth loops, and the critical importance of small pockets of highly talented people will combine to create superstar economies. Just as San Francisco and the Bay Area have rocketed ahead of rural California, the countries that lead in machine learning are likely to speed ahead of others, who will find it increasingly hard to catch up. 
This looks like very bad news for poor developing countries, who can no longer count on low-cost manufacturing as the first rung of a ladder to faster growth. There might be an equivalent for machine learning, like labeling data sets, but that is extremely low-value-add work that can be done anywhere in the world over the internet, and from which little, if any, learning occurs that would jump-start the development of more sophisticated and higher-value machine learning activities, like algorithm design and product development. Middle-income countries with more capital may find themselves in a similarly challenging situation. How can they use that capital to avoid being left behind?
The age of industrial globalization had a formula for economic development, but machine learning does not yet. Policymakers need to solve that problem as soon as possible—and that includes policymakers in countries that are winning the race. Leaving everyone else behind only looks good until the losers decide to disrupt or attack the leaders rather than try to compete. Given the vast challenges of digital insecurity that could undermine our collective future, that is not a scenario that anyone should want to see come to pass.

What’s New: Intel and Brown University today began work on a DARPA-funded Intelligent Spine Interface project that aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to restore movement and bladder control for patients paralyzed by severe spinal cord injuries.


“As a Ph.D. student at Brown, I investigated how to interface the brain with machines as an application. Now at Intel, we’re combining our AI expertise with Brown University’s cutting-edge medical research to help solve a critical medical problem: how to reconnect the brain and spine after a major spinal injury.”
–Naveen Rao, Intel corporate vice president and general manager of the AI Products Group


How It Works: During the two-year program, researchers will record motor and sensory signals from the spinal cord and use artificial neural networks to learn how to stimulate the post-injury site to communicate motor commands. Surgeons at Rhode Island Hospital near Brown University will implant electrode arrays on both ends of a patient’s injury site, creating an intelligent bypass to eventually allow the severed nerves to communicate in real time. Researchers will leverage both Intel AI open source software such as nGraph and Intel AI accelerator hardware to meet the real-time requirements of this application.


“A spinal cord injury is devastating, and little is known about how remaining circuits around the injury may be leveraged to support rehabilitation and restoration of lost function. Listening for the first time to the spinal circuits around the injury and then taking action in real time with Intel’s combined AI hardware and software solutions will uncover new knowledge about the spinal cord and accelerate innovation toward new therapies,” said David Borton, assistant professor of engineering, Brown University.


Why It Matters: The human body is unable to regenerate severed nerve fibers. In the case of a severe spinal injury, the brain’s electrical commands will no longer reach the muscles, which can lead to paralysis. The National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center estimates there are 291,000 people with spinal cord injuries living in the United States, with more than 17,000 new cases each year. Over 30 percent of those spinal cord injuries result in complete tetraplegia or paraplegia.

I love Grammarly, the writing correction software from Grammarly, Inc. As a writer, it has proved invaluable to me time and time again, popping up quietly to say that I forgot a comma, got a bit too verbose on a sentence, or have used too many adverbs. I even sprung for the professional version.


Besides endorsing it, I bring Grammarly up for another reason. It is the face of augmentative AI. It is AI because it uses some very sophisticated (and likely recursive) algorithms to determine when grammar is being used improperly or even to provide recommendations for what may be a better way to phrase things. It is augmentative because, rather than completely replacing the need for a writer, it instead is intended to nudge the author in a particular direction, to give them a certain degree of editorial expertise so that they can publish with more confidence or reduce the workload on a copy editor.

This may sound like it eliminates the need for a copy editor, but even that’s not really the case. Truth is, many copy editors also use Grammarly, and prefer that their writers do so well, because they usually prefer the much more subtle task of improving well wrought prose, rather than the tedious and maddening task of correcting grammatical and spelling errors.

PROMOTED
As a journalist I use Cisco’s Webex a great deal. Their most recent products have introduced something that I’ve found to be invaluable - the ability to transcribe audio in real time. Once again, this natural language processing (NLP) capability, long the holy grail of AI, is simply there. It has turned what was once a tedious day long operation into a comparatively short editing session (no NLP is 100% accurate), meaning that I can spend more time gathering the news than having to transcribe it.

These examples may seem to be a far cry from the popular vision of AI as a job stealer - from autonomous cars and trucks to systems that will eliminate creatives and decision makers - but they are actually pretty indicative of where Artificial Intelligence is going. I’ve written before about Adobe Photoshop’s Select Subject feature, which uses a fairly sophisticated AI to select that part of an image that looks like it’s the focus of the shot. This is an operation that can be done by hand, but it is slow, tedious and error prone. With it, Photoshop will select what I would have most of the time, and the rest can then be added relatively easily.

What’s evident from these examples is that this kind of augmentative AI can be used to do those parts of a task or operation that were high cost for very little value add otherwise. Grammarly doesn’t change my voice significantly as a writer. Auto-transcription takes a task that would likely take me several hours to do manually and reduces it to seconds so that I can focus on the content. Photoshop’s Select Subject eliminates the need for very painstaking selection of an image. It can be argued in all three cases, that this does eliminate the need for a human being to do these tasks, but let’s face it - these are tasks that nobody would prefer to do unless they really had no choice.

These kinds of instances do not flash “artificial intelligence” at first blush. When Microsoft Powerpoint suggests alternatives visualizations to the boring old bullet points slide, the effect is to change behavior by giving a nudge. The program is saying “This looks like a pyramid, or a timeline, or a set of bucket categorizations. Why don’t you use this kind of presentation?”
Over time, you’ll notice that certain presentations float to the top more often than others, because you tend to choose them more often, though occasionally, the AI mixes things up, because it “realizes” through analysing your history with the app that you may be going overboard with that particular layout and should try others for variety. Grammarly (and related services such as Textio) follow grammatical rules, but use these products for a while, and you’ll find that the systems begin making larger and more complex recommendations that begin to match your own writing style.Close-up view on white conceptual keyboard - NLP (blue key)Getty
You see this behavior increasingly in social media platforms, especially in longer form business messaging such as Linked-In where the recommendation engine will often provide recommended completion content that can be sentence length or longer. Yes, you are saving time, but the AI is also training you even as you train it, putting forth recommendations that sound more professional and that, by extension, teach you to prefer that form of rhetoric, to be more aware of certain grammatical constructions without necessarily knowing exactly what those constructions are.
It is this subtle interplay between human and machine agency that makes AI augmentation so noteworthy. Until comparatively recently, this capability didn’t exist in the same way. When people developed applications, they created capabilities - modules - that added functionality, but that functionality was generally bounded. Auto-saving a word processing document, for instance, is not AI; it is using a simple algorithm to determine when changes were made, then providing a save call after certain activity (such as typing) stops for a specific period of time.
However, work with an intelligent word processor long enough and several things will begin to configure to better accommodate your writing style. Word and grammatical recommendations will begin to reflect your specific usage. Soft grammatical “rules” will be suppressed if you continue to ignore them, the application making the reasonable assumption that you are deliberately ignoring them when pointed out.
Ironically, this can also mean that if someone else uses your particular “trained” word processing application, they will likely get frustrated because the recommendations being made do not fit with their writing style, not because they are programmed to follow a given standard, but because they have been trained to facilitate your style instead.Training is the process of providing input data into machine learning in order to establish the ... [+] parameters from subsequence categorization.Getty
In effect, the use of augmented AI personalizes that AI - the AI becomes a friend and confidant, not just a tool. This isn’t some magical, mystical computer science property. Human beings are social creatures, and when we are lonely we tend to anthropomorphize even inanimate objects around us so that we have someone to talk to. Tom Hanks, in one of his best roles to date (Cast Away), made this obvious in his humanizing of a volleyball as Wilson, an example of what TVtropes.com calls “Companion Cubes”, named for a similar anthropomorphized object from the Portal game franchise. Augmented AIs are examples of such companion cubes, ones that increasingly are capable of conversation and remembered history ( “Hey, Siri, do you remember that beach ball in that movie we watched about a cast away who talked to it?”, “I think the ball’s name was Wilson. Why do you ask?”)
Remembered history is actually a pretty good description for how most augmented AIs work. Typically, most AIs are trained to pick up anomalous behavior from a specific model, weighing both the type and weight of that anomaly and adjusting the model accordingly. In lexical analysis this includes the presence of new words or phrases and the absence of previously existing words or phrases (which are in turn kept in some form of index). A factory-reset AI will likely change fairly significantly as a user interacts with it, but over time, the model will more closely represent the optimal state for the user.
In some cases, the model itself is also somewhat self-aware, and will deliberately “mutate” the weightings based upon certain parameters to mix things up a bit. News filters, for instance, will normally gravitate towards a state where certain topics predominate (news about “artificial intelligence” or “sports balls” for instance, based upon a user’s selections), but every so often, a filter will pick up something that’s three or four hops away along a topic selection graph, in order to keep the filter from being too narrow.
This, of course, also highlights one of the biggest dangers of augmenting AIs. Such filters will create an intrinsic, self selected bias in the information that gets through. If your personal bias tends to favor a certain political ideology, you get more stories (or recommendations) that favor that bias, and fewer that counter it. This can create a bubble in which what you see reinforces what you believe, while counter examples just never get through the filters. Because this affect is invisible, it may not even be obvious that it is happening, but it is one reason why periodically any AI should nudge itself out of its calculated presets.Just as a sound mixer can be used to adjust the input weights of various audio signals, so too does ... [+] machine learning set the weights of various model parameters.Getty
The other issue that besets augmented AIs is in the initial design of model. One of the best analogs to the way that most machine learning in particular works is to imagine a sound mixer with several dozen (or several thousand) dials that automatically adjusts themselves to determine the weights of various inputs. In an ideal world, each dial is hooked up to a variable that is independent of other variables (changing one variable doesn’t effect any other variable). In reality, it’s not unusual for some variables to be somewhat (or even heavily) correlated, which means that if one variable changes, it causes other variables to change automatically, though not necessarily in completely known ways.
For instance, age and political affiliation might not, at first glance be obviously correlated, but as it turns out, there are subtle (and not completely linear) correlations that do tend to show up when a large enough sample of the population is taken. In a purely linear model (the domain primarily of high school linear algebra) the variables usually are completely independent, but in real life, the coupling between variables can become chaotic and non-linear unpredictably, and one of the big challenges that data scientist face is determining whether the model in question is linear within the domain being considered.
Every AI has some kind of model that determines the variables (columns) that are adjusted as learning takes place. If there are too few variables, the model may not match that well. If there are too many, the curves being delineated may be too restrictive, and if specific variables are correlated in some manner, then small variations in input can explode and create noise in the signal. This means that few models are perfect (and the ones that are perfect are too simple to be useful), and sometimes the best you can do is to keep false positives and negatives below a certain threshold.
Deep learning AIs are similar, but they essentially have the ability to determine the variables (or axes) that are most orthogonal to one another. However, this comes at a significant cost - it may be far from obvious how to interpret those variables. This explainability problem is one of the most vexing facing the field of AI, because if you don’t know what a variable actually means, you can’t conclusively prove that the model actually works.Sometimes the patterns that emerge in augmented AI are not the ones we think they are.Getty
A conversation at an Artificial Intelligence Meetup in Seattle illustrated this problem graphically. In one particular deep analysis of various patients at a given hospital, a deep learning model emerged from analysis that seemed to perfectly predict from a person’s medical record if that patient had cancer. The analysts examining the (OCR-scanned) data were ecstatic, thinking they’d found a foolproof model for cancer detection, when one of the nurses working on the study pointed out to them that every cancer patient’s paper records had a © written on one corner of the form to let the nurses quickly see who had cancer and who didn’t. The AI had picked this up in the analysis, and not surprisingly it accurately predicated that if the © was in that corner, the patient was sure to have cancer. Once this factor was eliminated, the accuracy rate of the model dropped considerably. (Thanks to Reza Rassool, CTO of RealNetworks, for this particular story).
Augmentation is likely to be, for some time to come, the way that most people will directly interact with artificial intelligence systems. The effects will be subtle - steadily improving the quality of the digital products that people produce, reducing the number of errors that show up, and reducing the overall time to create intellectual works - art, writing, coding, and so forth. At the same time, they raise intriguing ethical questions, such as “if an AI is used to create new content, to what extent is that augmenting technology actually responsible for what’s created?”
It also raises serious questions about simulcra in the digital world. Daz Studio, a freemium 3D rendering and rigging software product, has recently included an upgrade that analyses portraits and generates 3D models and materials using facial recognition software. While the results are still (mostly) in the uncanny valley territory, such a tool makes it possible to create photographs and animations that can look surprisingly realistic and in many cases close enough to a person to be indistinguishable. If you think about actors, models, business people, political figures and others, you can see where these kinds of technologies can be used for political mischief.
This means that augmentation AI is also likely to be the next front of an ethical battleground, as laws, social conventions and ethics begin to catch up with the technology.
There is no question that artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules, for good and bad, and augmentation, the kind of AI that is here today and is becoming increasingly difficult to discern from human-directed software, is a proving ground for how the human/computer divide asserts itself. Pay attention to this space.

5 Important Reasons Why Artificial Intelligence is Important to You



You have probably heard that artificial intelligence could be used to do lots of impressive tasks and jobs. AI can help designers and artists make quick tweaks to visuals. AI can also help researchers identify “fake” images or connect touch and sense. AI is being used to program websites and apps by combining symbolic reasoning and deep learning. Basically, artificial intelligence goes beyond deep learning. Here are five reasons why AI is important to you.
Artificial Intelligence will create new jobs.
It is no news that AI will replace “repetitive jobs.” It literally means that these kinds of jobs will be automated, like what robots are currently doing in a myriad of factories. Robots are rendering the humans that are supposed to do those tasks practically jobless.
And it goes further than that – many “white collar” tasks in the fields of law, hospitality, marketing, healthcare, accounting, and others are adversely affected. The situation seems scary because scientists are just scratching the surface as extensive research and development of AI. AI is advancing rapidly (and it is more accessible to everybody).
The great news about AI is that it can create new jobs.
Some believe that AI can create even more new jobs than ever before. According to this school of thought, AI will be the most significant job engine the world has ever seen. Artificial intelligence will eliminate low-skilled jobs and effectively create massive high-skilled job opportunities that will span all sectors of the economy.
For example, if AI becomes fully adapt to language translation, it will create a considerable demand for high-skilled human translators. If the costs of essential translations drop to nearly zero, this will encourage MORE companies that need this particular service to expand their business operations abroad.
To those who speak different languages than the community in which they reside, this help will inevitably create more work for high-skilled translators, boost more economic activities. As a result of this, and more people will be employed in these companies due to the increased workload.
Boosting international trade it one of the most significant benefits of our “global” times. So yes, AI will eliminate some jobs, but it will create many, many more.
Artificial Intelligence will improved healthcare.
AI can be used extensively in the healthcare industry. It is applicable in automated operations, predictive diagnostics, preventive interventions, precision surgery, and a host of other clinical operations. Some individuals predict that AI will completely reshape the healthcare landscape for the better.
AI is revolutionizing how the health sector works by reducing spending and improve patient outcomes.
And here are some of the applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare:

Doing repetitive jobs.
Managing medical records and other data.
Digital consultation.
Treatment design.
Medical management.
Virtual nurses.
Precision medicine.
Drug creation, and a myriad of other uses of AI.

Artificial Intelligence will revolutionize agriculture.
AI is also used in the agriculture industry extensively. Robots can be used to plant seeds, fertilized crops and administer pesticides, among a lot of other uses. Farmers can use a drone to monitor the cultivation of crops and also collect data for analysis.
The value-add data will be used to increase the final output. How? The data collected is analyzed by AI on such variables as crop health and soil conditions, boosting final production, and it can also be used in harvesting, especially for crops that are difficult to gather.
Artificial Intelligence will eliminate the need for you to perform tedious tasks.
AI is changing the workplace, and there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic. It is used to do lots of tedious and lengthy tasks, especially the low-skilled types of jobs that are labor-intensive. It means that employees will be retasked away from boring jobs and bring significant and positive change in the workplace.
For instance, artificial intelligence is used in the automotive industry to do repetitive tasks such as performing a routine operation in the assembly line, for example. Allowing a robot to care for well, robotic-tasks, has created a shift in the workforce.
 AI is used to increase auto safety and decrease traffic complications.
Auto accidents are one of the most popular types of accidents that happen in America. It kills thousands of people annually. A whopping 95 percent of these accidents are caused by human error, meaning accidents are avoidable.
The number of accident cases will reduce as artificial intelligence is being introduced into the industry by the use of self-driving cars. On-going research in the auto industry is looking at ways AI can be used to improve traffic conditions.
Smart systems are currently in place in many cities that are used to analyze traffic lights at the intersections. Avoiding congestion leads to safer movements of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians.
Conclusion
Artificial intelligence is very useful in all industries as more research is being done to advance it. The advancements in this AI tech will be most useful if it is understood and trusted. An important part of it is that artificial intelligence and related technologies such as drones, robots, and autonomous vehicles can create around tens of millions of jobs over the next decade.
Having more jobs created — not less — will be great news for everyone. More jobs will help boost the GDP of the economy. Advancement in AI and its impressive computational power has already led to the concept of supercomputers and beyond.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is joining forces with two other research powerhouses to pioneer a new $5.5 million research center created by the U.S. Department of Energy to focus on the biggest challenges in artificial intelligence.
The Center for Artificial Intelligence-Focused Architectures and Algorithms, or ARIAA, will promote collaborative projects for scientists at PNNL in Richland, Wash., at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, and at Georgia Tech. PNNL and Sandia are part of the Energy Department’s network of research labs.
ARIAA will be headed by Roberto Gioiosa, a senior research scientist at PNNL. As center director, he’ll be in charge of ARIAA’s overall vision, strategy and research direction. He’ll be assisted by two deputy directors, Sandia’s Rajamanickam and Georgia Tech Professor Tushar Krishna.
The creation of the new center is in line with the White House’s efforts to encourage partnerships in AI research. Last month, Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced the establishment of the DOE Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office to serve as a coordinating hub for all the work that’s being done in his department.
“Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing our world,” Gioiosa said in a news release. “You can see this everywhere, from your mobile phone to the development of self-driving cars. AI is also revolutionizing the way we do science and the way we tackle problems important to our nation.”
Gioiosa said that the creation of ARIAA “is part of the strategy for solving some of the most challenging problems by employing novel artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.”

Top research priorities will include AI applications for cybersecurity, electric grid resilience, graph analytics and computational chemistry. Those fields are highly relevant for the Energy Department’s portfolio, and can also yield commercial opportunities for more secure networks and new types of medicines.
ARIAA’s approach will take advantage of an approach known as “co-design,” in which researchers balance the capabilities of hardware and software as they optimize computer architectures and algorithms to address a given challenge.
The co-design approach is particularly well-suited to supercomputers and high-performance computing. And few people know that better than Gioiosa, who was part of the team that built the IBM Blue Gene supercomputer 15 years ago. Now he’s counting on co-design to unlock new capabilities for AI.
“AI promises to yield answers to many problems in a fraction of the time compared to current processes,” Gioiosa said. “But more importantly, AI will allow us to solve problems today, that simply cannot be solved because they are too complex. This is the science of the future.”

Several companies have made significant progress in creating smart mirrors, also called digital mirrors or smart displays, that can help you in the dressing room as well as when you’re in the hair stylist’s seat or shopping for makeup.
The Magic Of Smart Mirrors: Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality And The Internet of ThingsAdobe Stock

Technology Behind Smart Mirrors

The silver-glassed mirrors most of us are familiar with today got their start more than 200 years ago in Germany. While they still serve a useful purpose when reflecting your image back to you, some fashion and beauty leaders figured that if you added smart technology to mirrors, they could elevate the customer experience. This vision is now a reality thanks to the significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and gesture recognition technology. These mirrors can adjust your image, including the clothes you wear to your hairstyle, hair color, and makeup to create a very realistic augmented reflection.

Applications of Smart Mirrors

The beauty of a digital makeover is it’s easy to experiment and hit “undo” when you don’t like the results. L’Oréal launched an app called Style My Hair in partnership with ModiFace that allows customers to become a blonde (or any other hair color)—at least digitally—on live video. The technology colors hair strand by strand to create a fully dimensional, realistic look. Not loving blonde? Just swipe on the app and change your color again. This technology is beneficial when a colorist consults with a client regarding what they want and lets the client see—quite effectively—how the color will look on them prior to committing to the real thing.
PROMOTED
YouCam Makeup-Magic Selfie Cam, developed by Perfect Corp., is a similar app that can show you what you’ll look like with a new hair color (and eye color), try on makeup as well as a skincare analysis feature that identifies issues to troubleshoot with a skincare routine. Shopping for cosmetics in real-life can involve taking makeup on and off as you try new shades of highlighter, foundation, blush, lipstick, and eye shadow. Being able to do this virtually prevents any adverse reactions, especially for sensitive skin and makes experimentation easy as you swap between different options.
The same technology can help people see how a new hairstyle will complement their face—or not—before any irreversible cuts are made. It can also be helpful to determine a style for a special occasion or see how a style you saw in a magazine will work with your face shape before you head to the salon.

Coty’s version of the smart mirror is the CES 2019 Innovation Awards Honoree—Wella Professionals Smart Mirror. This mirror allows stylists to provide more personalized consultations. Like the apps discussed above, the Wella Professionals Smart Mirror is able to do a live AR hair color try on and can provide a 360-degree of the style so the client can see what it will look like from all angles. In addition, using facial recognition technology, it can retrieve past styles for each customer, allowing the stylist and client to really assess what worked and what didn't. Also important, the mirror provides a curated feed of content with trending styles and classic looks to help inspire both stylists and customers when trying to determine a new look. It also connects to a mobile app so the stylist and customer can stay in contact in between appointments.

Memory Mirror, a digital mirror created by MemoMi, combines a full-length mirror with high-tech including a 70-inch LCD, computer and HD camera that can record videos so you can save, share and review your try-on sessions. Neiman Marcus installed MemoMi’s mirrors in 34 locations. Another mirror altering the retail experience is the Oak Mirror by Oak Labs. It serves as a digital assistant in a dressing room, allowing customers to request other colors, styles, or accessories from a sales assistant.

Sephora is another beauty retailer that offers a 3D augmented reality mirror. Customers trying out different products can move their face from side to side, and the augmented eye shadow or lipstick stays where it is supposed to creating a very realistic effect. The technology is expected to not only enhance the customer experience but drive sales. When it's easier to experiment with different looks, it makes it easier to discover new products to purchase.
While your haircut, hair color, and makeup choices are important for your overall look, SenseMi expanded the makeover capabilities to create a virtual dressing mirror, too. The company's smart mirror is used in retail stores, and there's a home version that allows you to ""try"" on clothes digitally, plus it’s able to send you reminders about your calendar, tell you the traffic details along your normal commuting route and more. SenseMi even sells a smart table that provides a multi-touch, interactive experience that can be used in hotels, schools, hospitals, and more.
Artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and virtual reality will help to make retail stores more interactive and the online experience more real-life. Perhaps more importantly, with the help of makeover apps and smart mirrors, the days of bad haircuts, and color and makeup choices will be a thing of the past.

Slice to the present and that dread has now been supplanted with a progressively rational methodology where AI is being viewed as an approach to expand human capacities in an undeniably digital time..New AI frameworks have beyond-human cognitive abilities, which a significant number of us fear could conceivably dehumanize the eventual fate of work. Artificial intelligence will surely mechanize most tedious and physical tasks, and part of the quantitative tasks, for example, programming and even data science. Nonetheless, via automating these skills, AI will drive human experts up the range of abilities stepping stool into exceptionally human abilities, for example, inventiveness, social capabilities, sympathy, and sense-production, which machines can't automate. Subsequently, AI will make the working environment progressively human, not less. This is the endowment of AI to Mankind..People and machines can supplement each other bringing about increasing efficiency. This collaboration could increase income by 38% by 2022, as indicated by Accenture Research. At any rate, 61% of business pioneers concur that the convergence of human and machine collaboration is going to enable them to accomplish their vital needs quicker and more effectively..Human and machine collaboration is fundamental for companies. Having the correct attitude for AI means being quiet with the idea of human+machine, leaving the mentality of human Vs. machine behind. Because of AI, production lines are currently requiring somewhat more mankind; and AI is boosting the value of manufacturers and engineers..With the fast adoption of AI and related technologies, in any case, there will consistently be a few occupations that will be done only by humans. And after that, there are others that can be completely automated and can be dealt with intelligent automation. In any case, the most extreme jobs will see a blend of people and machines working together. This space is something named as &quot;the missing middle&quot; by Accenture..There are circumstances where an AI-driven choice all alone isn't sufficient and we additionally need to know the reasons and rationale behind it. These jobs will expect individuals to apply their human abilities and knowledge. Explainable AI supplements and supports people empowering them to improve, to be precise and take faster decisions..As the collaboration among people and machines increases, this space will see more activity. For instance, large enterprises need to deal with countless tasks which means cooperating with various merchants, customers and partners. The dangers required for every one of these associations is extraordinary, and often organizations turn out wrong in view of the complex nature of these associations. Accenture Labs applied Explainable AI and built up a five-stage procedure to clarify the hazard level of projects and agreements at every level, alongside substantial explanations behind these expectations, making it simpler for leaders to make more informed choices..Assigning and Sharing.No one task will be 100% driven by a machine or a human by themselves; rather, every task will have some level of shared association. Organizations should make an assignment allocation structure to characterize jobs and responsibilities and set the guidelines for AI frameworks and workers to facilitate to achieve a task. Augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) will be the main thrust for empowering workers to team up seriously with machines through an intuitive and simple interface. For example, making an interpretation of consumer behavior to business clients, as well as machines..Improved Speed.Speed is too significant in numerous businesses, including finance. The recognition of credit card extortion on the spot can ensure a cardholder that a transaction won't be affirmed if the misrepresentation was included, sparing time and headaches if this is distinguished past the point of no return. As indicated by Daugherty and Wilson, HSBC Holdings built up an AI-based solution that utilizes improved speed and accuracy in fraud detection. The solution can screen a huge number of transactions every day looking for an unpretentious pattern that can flag extortion..This kind of solution is extraordinary for financial establishments. However, they need human collaboration to be ceaselessly refreshed. Without the updates required, soon the algorithms would end up futile for fighting fraud. Data analysts and financial fraud experts must watch out for the product consistently to guarantee the AI solution is at any rate one stage in front of criminals..Humans and machines will cooperate perfectly, supplementing one another. Machines will figure out how to do simple tasks, for example, following procedures or crunching information. They will likewise acknowledge when people are experiencing issues and will be prepared to step in to help or to demand help from a human if the activity is past their abilities..Best performance, truth be told, will be accomplished through collaboration between humans and machines. A genuine model is cancer identification. As indicated by Harvard research, AI algorithms can read diagnostic scans with a 92% precision. People can do it with a 96% precision.

Artificial intelligence and facial analysis software is becoming commonplace in job interviews. The technology, developed by US company HireVue, analyses the language and tone of a candidate’s voice and records their facial expressions as they are videoed answering identical questions.
It was used in the UK for the first time in September but has been used around the world for several years. Some 700 companies, including Vodafone, Hilton and Urban Outfitters have tried it out. 
Certainly there are significant benefits to be had from this. HireVue says it speeds up the hiring process by 90% thanks to the speed of information processing. But there are important risks we should be wary of when outsourcing job interviews to AI.
The AI is built on algorithms that assess applicants against its database of about 25,000 pieces of facial and linguistic information. These are compiled from previous interviews of “successful hires” – those who have gone on to be good at the job. The 350 linguistic elements include criteria like a candidate’s tone of voice, their use of passive or active words, sentence length and the speed they talk. The thousands of facial features analysed include brow furrowing, brow raising, the amount eyes widen or close, lip tightening, chin raising and smiling.
The fundamental issue with this, as is often pointed out by critics of AI, is that this technology is not born in a perfect society. It is created within our existing society, marked by a whole range of different kinds of biases, prejudices, inequalities and discrimination. The data on which algorithms “learn” to judge candidates contains these existing sets of beliefs. 
As UCLA professor, Safya Noble, demonstrates in her book Algorithms of Oppression, a few simple Google searches shows this happening. For example, when you search the term “professor style”, Google Images returns exclusively middle-aged white men. You get similar results for a “successful manager” search. By contrast, a search for “housekeeping” returns pictures of women.

This reflects how algorithms have “learnt” that professors and managers are mostly white men, while those who do housekeeping are women. And by delivering these results algorithms necessarily contribute to the consolidation, perpetuation and potentially even amplification of existing beliefs and biases. For this very reason we should question the intelligence of AI. The solutions it provides are necessarily conservative, leaving little room for innovation and social progress.

‘Symbolic capital’
As French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu emphasised in his work on the way that inequalities are reproduced, we all have very different economic and cultural capital. The environment in which we grow up, the quality of the teaching we had, the presence or absence of extra-curricular activities and a range of other factors, have a decisive impact on our intellectual abilities and strengths. This also has a big impact on the way we perceive ourselves – our levels of self-confidence, the objectives we set for ourselves, and our chances in life. 
Another famous sociologist, Erving Goffman, called it a “sense of one’s place”. It is this ingrained sense of how we should act that leads people with less cultural capital (generally from less privileged backgrounds) to keep to their “ordinary” place. This is also reflected in our body language and the way we speak. So there are those who, from an early age, have a stronger confidence in their abilities and knowledge. And there are many others who have not been exposed to the same teachings and cultural practices, and may be more timid and reserved. They may even suffer from an inferiority complex.
All of this will come across in job interviews. Ease, confidence, self-assurance and linguistic skills become what Bourdieu called “symbolic capital”. Those who possess it will be more successful – whether or not those qualities are actually best, or bring something new to the job.

Of course, this is something that has always been the case in society. But artificial intelligence will only reinforce it – particularly when AI is fed data of the candidates who were successful in the past. This means companies are likely to hire the same types of people that they have always hired.
The big risk here is that those people are all from the same set of backgrounds. Algorithms leave little room for subjective appreciation, for risk-taking or for acting upon a feeling that a person should be given a chance. 
In addition, this technology may lead to the rejection of talented and innovative people who simply do not fit the profile of those who smile at the right moment or have the required tone of voice. And this may actually be bad for businesses in the long run as they risk missing out on talent that comes in unconventional forms. 
More concerning is that this technology may also inadvertently exclude people from diverse backgrounds and give more chances to those who come from privileged ones. As a rule, they possess greater economic and social capital, which allows them to obtain the skills that become symbolic capital in an interview setting.
What we see here is another manifestation of the more general issues with AI. Technology that is developed using data from our existing society, with its various inequalities and biases, is likely to reproduce them in the solutions and decisions that it proposes.

Correction: the headline of this article was amended to say facial analysis rather than facial recognition.

Analysts say it’s evidence of tech rivalry between the countries.Photograph: Qilai Shen/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThe AI Database →ApplicationFace recognitionEthicsHardwareRegulationEnd UserGovernmentSectorPublic safetyTechnologyMachine visionThe Trump administration Monday banned six Chinese companies that work on artificial intelligence from doing business with US firms, accusing the companies of helping to violate the human rights of Muslims in China’s northwestern province of Xinjiang.Four of the companies, SenseTime, Megvii, iFLYTEK, and Yitu, make software for facial recognition and voice transcription that’s reportedly been used in a campaign of repression and control in Xinjiang that has drawn international condemnation. The other companies, Hikvision and Dahua Technology, make surveillance equipment such as cameras that incorporates AI.Besides drawing attention to an important issue, the ban is also the latest effort by the US to curb China’s progress in an increasingly important technology. “This is part of the broader tech cold war,” says Rebecca Fannin, a technology consultant and author of Tech Titans of China, a book that charts China’s recent progress in technology and innovation.Trending NowWhy Some Cities Are Banning Facial Recognition TechnologyThe rise of China’s tech industry has coincided, in recent years, with a revolution in AI. Advances in machine learning have transformed areas such as image and voice recognition, and the country’s big tech companies—Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, and Tencent—have embraced the research and use of AI. A string of AI startups, including the four named at the top, have also ridden this wave to commercial riches by providing software for voice assistants, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and more.Fannin says the potential for AI to drive economic growth, and the way Chinese companies like Huawei and TikTok are growing overseas, present a challenge to American tech dominance. “These are troubling issues for the US,” she says.Robert Ross, a professor who studies Chinese foriegn policy at Boston University, is more blunt. “I would say the president is using the situation with the Uighurs as a pretext,” he says. “It seems to be something of an effort to restrain China from developing AI technology, and from benefiting from US technology while it does that.”AdvertisementThe ban, announced after US markets closed Monday, prohibits the Chinese firms from doing business with US companies without a government-granted license.The move marks a shift in Trump’s trade battle with China, which has until now targeted tech companies over espionage and security rather than human rights. Huawei has been the main target of US restrictions, with its 5G technology cited as a particular security worry.The new restrictions also appeared timed to provide leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. China’s vice premier, Liu He, will arrive in Washington, DC, this week for the latest round of talks.In total, 28 entities were added to the US Department of Commerce list. They include Xiamen Meiya Pico, which provides digital forensics tools, including ones for searching laptops and smartphones; and Yixin Science and Technology, which makes micro and nano fabrication gear, along with equipping regional government bureaus, a police college, and a construction company.“Specifically, these entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups [in Xinjiang],” the Commerce Department said in its notice.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDBut the Trump administration’s motives appear to be double-edged. For one thing, the White House has not offered a consistent message on the situation in Xinjiang or on human rights in general. In July, more than 20 countries pressured China through the UN Human Rights Council to stop detentions in Xinjiang. But the US was not involved, having withdrawn from the forum a year earlier. In addition, the White House has so far shown little interest in regulating facial regulation technology offered by US companies.Ross at Boston University says the ban may only cause China to dig its heels in over what it sees as a national security issue. “It's not at all clear that sanctions will help change the situation,” he says.Keep ReadingThe latest on artificial intelligence, from machine learning to computer vision and moreStill, the sanctions will be welcomed by those who have documented the disappearance and detention of more than a million people in Xinjiang, as well as widespread use of surveillance technology. “It’s showing tech companies they can’t do this sort of work and get away with it,” says Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Washington who studies the Uighurs.The ban may also have a serious impact on the companies targeted, as well as some US suppliers. According to IPVM, a company that tracks the video surveillance industry, Hikvision and Dahua both depend heavily on technology from Intel, Nvidia, and other US suppliers. Hikvision has not been able to supply to US federal agencies since August due to a ban announced last year. According to IPVM, US sales had accounted for about 5 percent of the company’s $7 billion in annual revenue.Hikvision said in a statement that the restrictions “will deter global companies from communicating with the US government, hurt Hikvision’s US businesses partners, and negatively impact the US economy.”The AI companies added to the list also likely rely on US suppliers. According to a report published in February by the Center for New American Security, SenseTime operates computing infrastructure that includes 54 million graphical processing unit chips for training its AI algorithms. The most popular GPUs for AI training are designed by the American company Nvidia and manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan.

The other companies, Hikvision and Dahua Technology, make surveillance equipment such as cameras that incorporates AI.
Besides drawing attention to an important issue, the ban is also the latest effort by the US to curb China’s progress in an increasingly important technology. “This is part of the broader tech cold war,” says Rebecca Fannin, a technology consultant and author of Tech Titans of China, a book that charts China’s recent progress in technology and innovation.
The rise of China’s tech industry has coincided, in recent years, with a revolution in AI. Advances in machine learning have transformed areas such as image and voice recognition, and the country’s big tech companies—Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, and Tencent—have embraced the research and use of AI. A string of AI startups, including the four named at the top, have also ridden this wave to commercial riches by providing software for voice assistants, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and more.
Fannin says the potential for AI to drive economic growth, and the way Chinese companies like Huawei and TikTok are growing overseas, present a challenge to American tech dominance. “These are troubling issues for the US,” she says.
Robert Ross, a professor who studies Chinese foriegn policy at Boston University, is more blunt. “I would say the president is using the situation with the Uighurs as a pretext,” he says. “It seems to be something of an effort to restrain China from developing AI technology, and from benefiting from US technology while it does that.”
The ban, announced after US markets closed Monday, prohibits the Chinese firms from doing business with US companies without a government-granted license.
The move marks a shift in Trump’s trade battle with China, which has until now targeted tech companies over espionage and security rather than human rights. Huawei has been the main target of US restrictions, with its 5G technology cited as a particular security worry.
The new restrictions also appeared timed to provide leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. China’s vice premier, Liu He, will arrive in Washington, DC, this week for the latest round of talks.
In total, 28 entities were added to the US Department of Commerce list. They include Xiamen Meiya Pico, which provides digital forensics tools, including ones for searching laptops and smartphones; and Yixin Science and Technology, which makes micro and nano fabrication gear, along with equipping regional government bureaus, a police college, and a construction company.
“Specifically, these entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups [in Xinjiang],” the Commerce Department said in its notice.
But the Trump administration’s motives appear to be double-edged. For one thing, the White House has not offered a consistent message on the situation in Xinjiang or on human rights in general. In July, more than 20 countries pressured China through the UN Human Rights Council to stop detentions in Xinjiang. But the US was not involved, having withdrawn from the forum a year earlier. In addition, the White House has so far shown little interest in regulating facial regulation technology offered by US companies.
Ross at Boston University says the ban may only cause China to dig its heels in over what it sees as a national security issue. “It's not at all clear that sanctions will help change the situation,” he says.
Still, the sanctions will be welcomed by those who have documented the disappearance and detention of more than a million people in Xinjiang, as well as widespread use of surveillance technology. “It’s showing tech companies they can’t do this sort of work and get away with it,” says Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Washington who studies the Uighurs.
The ban may also have a serious impact on the companies targeted, as well as some US suppliers. According to IPVM, a company that tracks the video surveillance industry, Hikvision and Dahua both depend heavily on technology from Intel, Nvidia, and other US suppliers. Hikvision has not been able to supply to US federal agencies since August due to a ban announced last year. According to IPVM, US sales had accounted for about 5 percent of the company’s $7 billion in annual revenue.
Hikvision said in a statement that the restrictions “will deter global companies from communicating with the US government, hurt Hikvision’s US businesses partners, and negatively impact the US economy.”
The AI companies added to the list also likely rely on US suppliers. According to a report published in February by the Center for New American Security, SenseTime operates computing infrastructure that includes 54 million graphical processing unit chips for training its AI algorithms. The most popular GPUs for AI training are designed by the American company Nvidia and manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan. Chinese alternatives from Alibaba, Huawei, and others are still in development.
SenseTime lists Nvidia and another US chipmaker, Qualcomm, among its partners. The company is also collaborating with Honda on self-driving cars, and has funded an AI research project at MIT.
A spokeswoman for SenseTime said the company has been preparing for a ban by diversifying its supply chain. She also shared a prepared statement in which the company said: “We abide by all relevant laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We have been actively developing our AI code of ethics to ensure our technologies are used in a responsible way.”
Megvii issued a statement that played down its role in Xinjiang. “To the company’s knowledge, around 1 percent of its total revenue was derived from projects in Xinjiang in 2018,” it reads. “No revenue was generated from Xinjiang in the six months ended June 30, 2019.”
The US announcement prompted a swift rebuke from Beijing. At a press briefing held in the Chinese capital on Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry dismissed the new restrictions as foreign meddling.

EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Confidence and investment in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve health care remain high, according to a new survey of 500 U.S. health industry leaders from hospitals, health plans, life sciences and employers, on their attitudes and adoption of the technology. Significantly, compared with 2018 findings, this year’s results found a nearly 88% increase in the number of respondents who said their organizations have a strategy in place and have implemented AI.

“At Optum, we apply what we call OptumIQ – a distinctive combination of curated data, analytics and health care expertise – to drive that intelligence transformation.”Post this

The second OptumIQ Annual Survey on AI in Health Care also reveals a shift in funding expectations for AI-related projects, as leaders estimate their organizations will invest an average of $39.7 million over the next five years – $7.3 million more than last year’s estimate.


“These findings validate that AI is vital to holistically transform health care. It’s encouraging to see executives’ growing trust in, and adoption of, AI to make data more actionable in making the health system work better for everyone,” said Dan Schumacher, president and chief operating officer of Optum. “Working together, I am confident we can improve the quality, experiences and reduce the total cost of health care in meaningful, sustainable ways.”


In addition, the survey found:



A positive return on investment (ROI) will take less time than previously expected, as little as three years in some cases. Half (50%) of respondents expect to see a tangible cost savings in three years or fewer as a result of investing in AI, compared with 31% in 2018. Among the respondent groups, more hospitals (55%) and health plans (52%) expect to see a positive return in less time – in three years or fewer – while life sciences executives (38%) anticipate it taking five years or longer.


Implementation has advanced. Sixty-two percent of respondents report having implemented an AI strategy – an increase of nearly 88% from 2018 (33%) – while 22% report being at late stages of implementation.


A higher level of trust in AI for administrative over clinical applications. While most respondents indicated high levels of trust in AI for both clinical and administrative tasks overall, when asked to rank specific applications, more administrative applications were selected (62%) over clinical applications (38%). In addition, when asked which health care applications, if any, they would feel comfortable having AI technology support, four out of five of the top-ranked applications were administrative.


Administrative process improvements top the list of investment priorities. Half (50%) of organizations will invest first in automating business processes, such as administrative tasks or customer service, while more than a third (36%) will invest in personalizing clinical care recommendations, such as drug therapies, and the same percentage (36%) also will invest in accelerating research for new therapeutic or clinical discoveries.



AI Seen as Most Pragmatic for Non-clinical Applications
In addition to noting the growing value of AI in the clinical environment, health care executives are looking to AI to solve a variety of operational and administrative challenges, such as automating pre-authorizations and personalizing care. The top five areas that organizations see AI as having potential are:



51% to automate prior authorizations


47% to provide individuals with relevant health actions using personalized communications


45% to manage electronic health records (EHRs)


43% to detect fraud, waste or abuse in reimbursement


38% to select appropriate care settings



AI to Create More Employment Opportunities and Drive Job Growth
As more organizations invest in and move forward with implementations, half (52%) of leaders expect AI to create more work opportunities. The majority (87%) agree that hiring candidates who have experience working with AI technology is a priority for their organization.


Most (89%) also agree employees are not being trained quickly enough to keep up with the growth of AI. In fact, 91% estimate that 10% to 50% of new roles will require experience working with AI. To solve this, they are evenly split among solutions such as establishing partnerships, creating training programs, working with consulting firms and postponing projects.


“In order to transform and modernize the U.S. health system through the power of AI, it is critical that organizations invest in developing talent throughout the enterprise to solve health care’s most complex challenges,” said Steve Griffiths, senior vice president and chief operating officer of Optum Enterprise Analytics. “At Optum, we apply what we call OptumIQ – a distinctive combination of curated data, analytics and health care expertise – to drive that intelligence transformation.”

When being empathetic is your full-time job, burning out is only human. Few people are more aware of this than customer service representatives, who are tasked with approaching each conversation with energy and compassion — whether it's their first call of the day or their 60th. It's their job to make even the most difficult customer feel understood and respected while still providing them accurate information. Oftentimes that's a tall order, resulting in frustration on both ends of the call. But over the last few years, an unlikely aide has come forward: artificial intelligence tools designed to help people tap into and maintain ""human"" characteristics like empathy and compassion. 



One of these tools is a platform called Cogito, named for the famous Descartes philosophy Cogito, ergo sum (""I think, therefore I am""). It's an AI platform that monitors sales and service calls for large corporations (among them, MetLife and Humana) and offers employees real-time feedback on customer interactions. During a call, an employee may see Cogito pop-up alerts on their screen encouraging them to display more empathy, increase their vocal energy, speak more slowly or respond more quickly. Interactions are scored and tracked on internal company dashboards, and managers can gauge, instantly, what different members of their team may need to work on. As a call center representative in MetLife's disability insurance department, Conor Sprouls uses Cogito constantly. On a typical day, he takes anywhere from 30 to 50 calls. Each one lasts between five and 45 minutes, depending on the complexity of the issue. Sprouls's first caller on the morning of Sept. 12, 2019, was someone with an anxiety disorder, and Cogito pinged Sprouls once with a reminder to be empathetic and a few times for being slow to respond (not uncommon when looking for documentation on someone's claim, explains Sprouls).When Cogito first rolled out, some employees were concerned about constant supervisor oversight and notification overload. They were getting pinged too often about the empathy cue, for example, and at one point, the tool thought a representative and a customer were talking over each other when they were in fact sharing a laugh. But Sprouls says that the system gets more intuitive with every call. As for over-supervision, call center conversations are always recorded and sent to supervisors, so it's not much of a change. In fact, Cogito may even offer a more realistic reflection of performance, says Sprouls. ""A supervisor can't be expected to listen to every single call for each of their associates, so sometimes when we're just choosing calls at random, it could be luck of the draw — one associate could be monitored on an easy call, and another could be monitored on a hard one,"" he says. ""Cogito is going to give you the end result: who needs to work on what. I think the way a lot of us really look at Cogito is as a personal job coach."" 


MetLife has been using Cogito for about two years, though it was first introduced in a pilot capacity. Emily Baker, a MetLife supervisor with a team of about 17, says that her associates all benefited from Cogito's cues during the pilot process. She says one associate's favorite was the energy cue; he'd start slouching in his seat at the end of the day, and the posture meant he didn't project his voice as much. When the energy cue appeared (a coffee cup icon), he sat up straight and spoke more energetically so that he appeared more engaged in the call.""I like the fact that I can see overall, on my particular supervisor dashboard, how we're doing as a team, if there are any trends,"" Baker says. ""Is everybody speaking over the caller? Is everybody having trouble with dead air? You can drill down into each person, and it's really good for coaching one-on-one."" Now, MetLife is in the process of rolling out Cogito across even more of its customer-facing departments — claims, direct sales, customer growth. The company also plans to more than double the number of employees using the platform (from 1,200 to over 3,000). ""It's a little bit of a strange dynamic,"" says Kristine Poznanski, head of global customer solutions at MetLife. ""We're using technology and artificial intelligence to help our associates demonstrate more human behavior. It's something you don't intuitively think about."" A growing trend At his consulting job in the New Zealand Department of Child and Family, Josh Feast, co-founder and CEO of Cogito, says he learned that social workers could experience burnout in as few as three to five years. He was shocked by the irony — that a profession designed to care for people wasn't conducive to caring for the people in that profession. An idea began to form, and it took further shape after a course at MIT's Media Lab, during which Feast had a key revelation: Big organizations understand data well, so if he wanted to help people inside a large organization, he needed to present his idea in a language the corporate team could understand. ""It was almost like being hit by a lightning strike,"" he says. And so Cogito was born. In the R&D phase, Feast and his co-founder worked for DARPA, the U.S. government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The agency had in mind soldiers struggling with PTSD, and DARPA provided the Cogito team with funding to research aid for psychological distress. So Feast began studying how nurses interacted with patients. 


""There was a real ""aha' moment where we discovered that if you could use that technology to understand the conversation — and to measure the conversational dance between nurse and patient — you could start getting a read of the degree of empathy and compassion they displayed ... and the resulting attitude the patient had to that interaction,"" says Feast. He built dashboards to display measures of compassion and empathy, and he found something noteworthy: When people were given real-time feedback while speaking with someone, levels of compassion and empathy during the conversation improved. That realization was the key to Cogito's future. But Cogito isn't the only AI-powered tool aiming to help us tap into our humanity. ButterflyThere's Butterfly, an AI tool that aims to help managers empathize with their employees and increase workplace happiness. After Butterfly is embedded into a workplace messaging system, it functions as a chatbot — executive-coaching managers in real-time based on employee surveys and feedback. Butterfly analyzes the latter to measure levels of stress, collaboration, conflict, purpose, creativity and the like. Then, it provides managers with calls to action and reading materials to help them deal with problems on their team. For example, an executive with a highly-stressed team might receive an article on how to create a more compassionate work environment. ""In a nutshell, Butterfly was created in order to help managers to be on point when it comes to their… team's level of engagement and overall happiness,"" says co-founder and CEO David Mendlewicz. ""Think about an AI-driven happiness assistant or AI-driven leadership coach."" SupportivAnother AI-powered empathy tool is Supportiv, a peer counseling platform aiming to use natural language processing to take on daily mental health struggles such as work stress, anxiety, loneliness and conflicts with loved ones. Seconds after a user answers Supportiv's primary question — ""What's your struggle?"" — they're sorted into an anonymous, topic-specific peer support group. 


Each group has a trained live moderator (who is also equipped to refer specialized or emergency services as needed), and an AI algorithm scans conversations to detect mood, tone, engagement and interaction patterns. On the moderator's side, prompts pop up — user X hasn't contributed to the conversation in a while, or user Y shared a thought above that hasn't been addressed. Co-founder Helena Plater-Zyberk's vision for Supportiv's next iteration: additional AI advances that could help identify isolated users in chats and alert moderators with suggestions on how to be more empathetic towards those individuals. The aim, says Plater-Zyberk, is to create ""superhuman moderators"" — using compassion, empathy and hyper-alertness to facilitate a group chat better than any normally-equipped human. IBM's Project DebaterFinally, when it comes to the theory ""I think, therefore I am,"" IBM's Project Debater fits the bill. Introduced by the tech giant in January, it's billed as the first AI system that can debate complex ideas with humans. At its core, Debater is about rational thinking and empathy — considering opposing points of view and understanding an opponent enough to be able to address their argument piece-by-piece and ultimately win them over. Dr. Aya Soffer, vice president of AI tech at IBM Research, envisions a variety of real-world applications for Debater — a policymaker who wants to understand the range of implications for a law they're considering. For example, in the case of banning phones from schools (a law the French government passed in 2018), what are the precedents, the pros and cons, the arguments on both sides of the equation? A financial analyst or investment advisor might use Debater to make smart projections about what a new type of technology may or may not mean for the market. We typically look for supporting arguments in order to convince ourselves, or someone else, of something. But Soffer says that taking counterarguments into account could be even more powerful, whether to change a mind or strengthen a pre-existing view. That kind of empathy and higher-level logical thinking is something IBM Debater aims to help with.Pitfalls and privacy As is the case with all new technology, this type has some concerning use cases. First, there's the potential for system bias in the data used to train the algorithm. For example, if it's taught using cases of predominantly white men expressing empathy, that could yield a system that charts lower output for women and minorities. A call center representative with a medical condition might display less energy than the perceived norm but does their best to make up for it in other ways. 


That's why it's a good idea for individuals to be provided this data before it's shared with their supervisors, says Rosalind Picard, founder and director of the Affective Computing Research Group at the MIT Media Lab. She believes it's a breach of ethics to share data on an employee's interactions, such as levels of compassion, empathy and energy, with a manager first. And then there's the temptation for this type of technology to go beyond its intended use case — a helpful reminder to facilitate a genuine connection — and instead serve as a driver for insincere interactions fueled by fear. After all, similar tech tools are part of the foundation of social ratings systems (think Black Mirror's ""Nosedive"" episode). In 2020, China plans to debut publicly available social credit scores for every citizen. That score will help determine an individual's eligibility for an apartment, which travel deals they're offered, which schools they may enroll their children in and even whether they can see a hospital doctor without lining up to pay first. Within the next five years, experts predict we'll make great strides in ""sentiment analysis"" — a type of natural language processing that identifies human emotions by analyzing facial expressions and body language or text responses. But for Noah Goodman, associate professor at Stanford University's Computation and Cognition Lab, there's a moral dilemma involved: What's the right thing to do with the information these systems learn? Should they have goals — prompt us, adjust our environments or send us tools to make us feel happier, more compassionate, more empathetic? What should the technology do with data on our feelings towards someone else, our performance in any given interaction? And who should it make that information available to? ""This is a place where the creepiness boundary is always close,"" says Goodman.  Another problem? AI simply can't replicate, or fully comprehend, human emotion. Take Cogito, for example. Let's say you're a customer service representative on the phone with customers all day, and you receive an alert that you're sounding low-energy and tired instead of high-energy and alert. That doesn't mean you're actually feeling tired, says Picard, and that's an important distinction to make. ""It doesn't know how I feel,"" says Picard. ""It has no consciousness — it's simply saying that to this system listening to your vocal quality, compared to your usual vocal quality and compared to other people on the phone at this company's vocal quality, here is how you might sound, according to the data we've collected… It's not to say you are that way."" There's a misunderstanding that we're already at the point where AI effectively understands human feelings, rather than just being able to analyze data and recognize patterns related to them. The phrase ""artificial intelligence"" itself may propagate that misunderstanding, says Picard, so to avoid fueling public fear about the future of AI, she recommends calling it software instead. ""As soon as we call the software ""AI,' a lot of people think it's doing more than it is,"" she says. ""When we say the machine ""learns' and that it's ""learned something' what we mean is that we've trained a big chunk of mathematics to take a bunch of inputs and make a mathematical function that produces a set of outputs with them. It doesn't ""learn' or ""know' or ""feel' or ""think' anything like any of us do. It's not alive."" 


Implications and regulationsSome experts believe there will come a day when technology will be able to understand and replicate ""uniquely human"" characteristics. The idea falls under the ""computational theory of the mind"" — that the brain is a dedicated tool for processing information, and even complex emotions like compassion and empathy can be charted as data. But even if that's true, there's a difference between experiencing emotion and understanding it — and in Goodman's view, it'll one day be entirely possible to build AI systems that have a good understanding of people's emotions without actually experiencing emotions themselves. There's also the idea that throughout the course of history, fear has often accompanied the release of new technology. ""We're always afraid of something new coming out, specifically if it has a large technological component,"" says Mendlewicz. ""Exactly the same fear rose up when the first telegraph came… and when the telegraph was replaced by the phone, people were also expressing fear… about [it] making us less human — having to communicate to a machine."" One of the most important questions to ask: How do we avoid this being used to alienate people or to create more distance between human beings? One prime example is social media platforms, which were introduced to augment human connectivity but paradoxically ended up as tools of polarization. ""What we've learned from that is that human connectivity and the humanity of technology should not be assumed; it needs to be cultivated,"" says Rumman Chowdhury, who leads Accenture's Responsible AI initiative. ""Instead of figuring out how we fit around technology, we need to figure out how technology fits around us."" That also means watching out for red flags, including the tech ""solutionism"" fallacy — the idea that technology can solve any and all of humanity's problems. Although it can't do that, technology can point out things we need to focus on in order to work towards more overarching solutions. ""We as human beings have to be willing to do the hard work,"" says Chowdhury. ""Empathy doesn't just happen because an AI told you to be more empathetic ... [Let's say] I create an AI to read through your emails and tell you if you sound kind enough and, if not, fix your emails for you so that you sound kind. That doesn't make your a nicer person; it doesn't make you more empathetic... The creation of any of this AI that involves improving human beings needs to be designed very thoughtfully, so that human beings are doing the work."" Some of that work involves building systems to regulate this type of AI before it's widespread, and experts have already begun floating ideas. For any AI tool, Chris Sciacca, communications manager for IBM Research, would like to see an ""AI Fact Sheet"" that functions like a nutrition label on a loaf of bread, including data such as who trained the algorithm, when and which data they used. It's a way to look ""under the hood"" — or even inside the black box — of an AI tool, understand why it might have come to a certain conclusion and remember to take its results with a grain of salt. He says IBM is working on standardizing and promoting such a practice. 


Picard suggests regulations akin to those for lie detection tests, such as the Federal Employee Polygraph Protection Act, passed in 1988. Under a similar law, it stands to reason that employers would be unable to require AI communication monitoring tools, with few exceptions — and that even in those cases, they couldn't monitoring someone without informing them about the technology and their rights. Spencer Gerrol, CEO of Spark Neuro — a neuroanalytics company that aims to measure emotion and attention for advertisers — says the potential implications for this kind of empathetic AI keep him up at night. Facebook may have created ""amazing"" tech, he says, but it also contributed to meddling in the U.S. elections. And when it comes to devices that can read emotions based on your brain activity, consequences could be even more dire, especially since much of emotion is subconscious. That means that one day, a device could feasibly be more ""aware"" of your emotions than you yourself are. ""The ethics of that will become complex,"" says Gerrol, especially once advertisers attempt to persuade individuals to take action by leveraging what's known about their emotions. As for the founder of Cogito himself? Feast believes that over the next five to 10 years, AI tools will split into two categories: Virtual agents that complete tasks on our behalf.Intelligent augmentation, or services built around reinforcing or extending our own human capabilities. Feast envisions more of a meld between man and machine, tools that we'll deem necessary to help us perform the way we want to in particular settings. These types of tools, he says, will ""extend and reinforce our humanness.""

This Institute for Public Relations (IPR) 2019 Future of Work Report investigates the future of work and the impact of several factors on the changing nature of work, including a rapidly and continuously shifting technological landscape, the growth of globalization, and the juxtaposition of new and tenured members of the workforce. While some technological innovations have already made a significant impact on organizations, the future of work is more than just artificial intelligence (AI) and automation. The intent of this project was to investigate the three interlinked dimensions of an organization: the work (the what), the workforce (the who), and the workplace (the where). Each offers unique challenges and opportunities for organizational (internal) communication.
The 2019 IPR Future of Work Report arose from a need to
understand current and continuous forces of change impacting organizational
operations and communication. The report focuses on the disruptions in the
workforce, how organizations are dealing with those changes, and how organizations
are communicating to a diverse and evolving workforce.
 
For this report, IPR interviewed 25 executives responsible
for organizational/internal communication to determine how they are
strategizing around this new reality. To protect confidentiality, interviewees’
identities are white-labeled. Interviews were transcribed, and thematic
analysis was conducted using a process of open and axial coding.
Three meta-themes framed the report’s findings:
•            The future
of work in a global, technology-driven reality;
•            Reaching a
diversifying workforce;
•            Investing
in employees for the future of work.

Dr. Lukasik, director of the department’s research division, strove to apply advanced technology to national defense.Credit...Department of DefenseBy Katie HafnerOct. 7, 2019Stephen Lukasik, a physicist who oversaw crucial work on national security and computer networking as director of the Defense Department’s research division in the late 1960s and early ’70s, died on Thursday at his home in Falls Church, Va. He was 88.The cause was respiratory failure, his wife, Virginia, said. Dr. Lukasik (pronounced loo-KAY-sik) spent eight years at the department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as ARPA, a period when great strides were made in detecting and controlling weapons of mass destruction — particularly nuclear devices — as well as in computer networking and artificial intelligence.Dr. Lukasik’s work at ARPA helped spur the growth of a worldwide network of seismographs to detect nuclear explosions, helping to plant the seeds for what became the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996.He was an ardent champion of using advanced technology to promote national defense, including the Arpanet, the precursor to the internet, which was built during his tenure as ARPA director.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn a 1991 interview with the University of Minnesota’s Charles Babbage Institute, Dr. Lukasik said that one of his major goals was to transfer ARPA’s work to the military services. “Whatever it is you’re trying to do, it’s got to get out of the research labs,” he said.ImageStephen Lukasik in 1971. “Why don’t you guys do something interesting? Like, fixing it so computers can understand speech?” he told a group of artificial intelligence researchers.Credit...Department of DefenseHe required ARPA researchers to develop technology with applications to military command and control systems. “It wasn’t just, ‘Gee whiz,’ and patting them on the back,” he said. “It was understanding what they’re doing, grasping its implications and relating that to the world of problems that the Defense Department either had or would be facing.”

How The Times decides who gets an obituary. There is no formula, scoring system or checklist in determining the news value of a life. We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here.Learn more about our process.Dr. Lukasik’s interest in artificial intelligence, for example, was driven by his national security concerns. In the early 1970s, while attending a meeting of ARPA-funded A.I. researchers, he grew impatient.“I said, ‘Why don’t you guys do something interesting? Like, fixing it so computers can understand speech?’” he said in the Babbage interview.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHis incentive at the time, he wrote in a reminiscence, was to assist the National Security Agency, which employed “vast numbers of transcribers and translators to make sense of a multitude of communication channels they monitored.” In one instance he had ARPA researchers work on using artificial intelligence to transcribe manual Morse code.“In my view, he was one of the few people who really thought about how science and technology serve national security,” said Sharon Weinberger, author of “The Imagineers of War: The Untold Story of DARPA, the Pentagon Agency That Changed the World” (2017). “He saw the role of strategy, not just widgets or weapons to serve the Pentagon, but the bigger picture around it.”Dr. Lukasik was an early champion of the Arpanet, which began as an experiment in computer networking. His contribution to the Arpanet, he wrote in 2014, “was helping to wrench this R&D project away from its creators, who would have liked to research it forever,” in part to promote military innovation.Dr. Lukasik began using electronic mail in its earliest versions in 1973; indeed, he became known for running ARPA largely by email. Yet email also vexed him. Not one to throw anything away, he grew frustrated by the email piling up in his inbox.He complained to Lawrence Roberts, who ran ARPA’s Information Processing Techniques Office. “I said, ‘Larry, this email is great, but it’s a mess!’” he recalled in an interview for “Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet” (1996). “In typical Larry fashion he came in the next day, and said, ‘Steve, I wrote some code for you.’” It was the first email management program.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStephen Joseph Lukasik was born on March 19, 1931, in Staten Island to Stephen and Mildred (Tynan) Lukasik. His father was an accountant, his mother a bank employee.Stephen began reading scientific literature at age 10 and at 14 knew what direction his career would take after reading newspaper accounts of the atomic bomb attacks on Japan.“I was really horrified by the human losses at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” Dr. Lukasik said in an interview for this obituary in March. “So I read everything that I could and decided that, of all the sciences, physics was the one that answered the questions I wanted to know about.” At 16 he entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., where he received a bachelor’s degree in physics in 1951. He received his Ph.D., also in physics, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956.While at Rensselaer, he met Marilyn Trappiel, a chemistry student at nearby Russell Sage College. They married in 1953 and divorced in 1982.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn 1955, while a doctoral student, Dr. Lukasik joined the Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a scientist at the company’s Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory, outside Pittsburgh. His work attracted the attention of the Defense Department, and he joined ARPA in 1966 as director for nuclear test detection. He became the agency’s overall director in 1971.After leaving ARPA, he worked in security-related positions at the RAND Corporation, Northrop, TRW and elsewhere. He became chief scientist at the Federal Communications Commission in 1979.While at the F.C.C., he met Virginia Dogan Armstrong, a policy analyst. They married in 1983. In addition to her, his survivors include four children from his first marriage, Carol Ward, Elizabeth O’Masta and Gregory and Jeffrey Lukasik; two stepchildren, Elizabeth Armstrong Parker and Alan Armstrong; 11 grandchildren; and 3 great-grandchildren.So abiding was Dr. Lukasik’s interest in national security and technology that he amassed a personal library of about 10,000 books relating to every dimension of those subjects.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTInternet security breaches remained a worry. “Even if by some miracle governments and industry worldwide were to agree on a course of action to remove threats to the net,” he wrote in 2011, “groups such as criminals benefiting from the current state of insecurity are unlikely to cooperate.”Anthony Rutkowski, a longtime colleague, recounted that while on a flight home from a meeting in Europe 18 years ago, he read a draft of a paper that Dr. Lukasik had given him. In it, Dr. Lukasik outlined ways that the internet could be used to coordinate a major infrastructure attack on the United States.“The detail was stunning,” Mr. Rutkowski recalled. The date was Sept. 11, 2001. His plane turned around, mid-Atlantic, and returned to Europe.Katie Hafner, a former staff reporter for The New York Times, is the author of ""Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of The Internet.""

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general and machine learning (ML) in particular, is not a new concept, but it is only in recent years that financial services firms have started to learn about and understand its full potential.
AI systems can be designed to learn to adapt behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by previous actions. As a scientific discipline, AI includes several approaches and techniques, such as machine learning, machine reasoning, and robotics.
Now is a good time to start building greater knowledge and awareness in this area. The technology has moved beyondunrealistic fantasy to real business applications. At the same time, processes and approaches in the AI space have not yet been finalised.It is vital to ensure that any adoption of ML and associated technologies is valuable in the long-term without producing unacceptable side-effects for organisations and society.
EU and international regulators have also taken an active interest in AI, and while they recognise the benefits that AI can bring to financial markets, consumers, and their own work, they are increasingly mindful of the potential risks and unintended consequences that the use of AI by regulated firms may have.
AI raises profound questions across ethical, legal and regulatory domains, touching many fronts, from protecting national security and citizen rights to advancing commercial interests and international standing.
The European Commission has put forward a European approach to artificial intelligence and robotics and is well placed to establish a distinctive form of AI that is ethically robust and protects the rights of individuals, firms and society. It deals with technological, ethical, legal and socio-economic aspects to boost EU's research and industrial capacity and to put AI at the service of European citizens and economy. Base on this EU approach, Cyprus is developing a national strategy document for Artificial Intelligence for the country. The effort is organized by the Department of Electronic Communications, of the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Works.
Professional services firms have traditionally been at the forefront of the utilisation of new technology. Given that Accountancy firms traditionallyare compiling, organising, analysing and reporting on huge quantities of business and financial data, they are the leaders in the creation of new methodologies and technological tools for analysis.
To date, there has been limited use in real-world accounting, but early research and implementation projects include:
• using machine learning to code accounting entries and improve on the accuracy of rules-based approaches, enabling greater automation of processes;
• improving fraud detection through more sophisticated, machine learning models of ‘normal’ activities and better prediction of fraudulent activities;and
• using machine learning-based predictive models to forecast revenues;
In order to build a positive vision of the future, we need to develop a deep understanding of how AI can solveaccounting and business problems, the practical challenges and the skills accountants need to work alongside intelligent systems.
There is one key question:How do you achieve effective human supervision of AI? Can control velocity keep pace with risk velocity?
One of the major challenges for the audit process will be validation of outcomes or decisions made by an AI system. It is similar to the challenge faced by management of how to demonstrate to others that the AI’s outcomes are correct and appropriate.
Auditors have taken the lead for international standardization efforts because they are continuously confronted with the need to substantiate their opinion to management. Without a framework, this is an extremely difficult task.
The reality of AI is that you can automate transactions. The question is whether you can automate judgement. One of the things to bear in mind about AI is that it there is always an element of doubt. Even if you had perfect data, you would never get a perfect answer, but you can get good results. Therefore, a person’s judgement is needed.
Firms should adopt the principles of algorithmic accountability and auditability – these require firms to have organisational and technical processes in place to demonstrate, and for third parties to be able to check and review, that an algorithm is compliant with data protection requirements.
AI will increasingly become a core component of many firms’ strategies to deliver better customer service, improve operational efficiency and effectiveness and gain a competitive advantage.

October 2019        

Why is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technology so important in material recovery facility (MRF) operations? Some of the biggest challenges of recycling sorting is that it is still a very costly, manual process. Most facilities are run chronically understaffed due to low unemployment. [With AI technology], we can sustainably replace very scarce labor, pick faster, more accurately, around the clock at a sustained rate with little operational upkeep. Lastly, with computer vision and machine learning, we are capturing and sharing data on material streams enabling recycling operations to gain transparency on the value of their lines, as well as measure productivity. How does AI work on a practical level? Matanya Horowitz CEO, AMP RoboticsAI is the process of getting information and applying rules for using this information, applying logic, self-correction and learning to execute a task. The core problem that AMP has solved is teaching a machine to distinguish individual objects that may be dirty, smashed or torn in the midst of a very cluttered environment. That identification problem is quite difficult, as it means the machine must truly understand what makes a carton different than PET (polyethylene terephthalate), which is different than HDPE (high-density polyethylene), despite all of the variations that may be present. With artificial intelligence we solved this with the development of AMP Neuron™, our AI platform. What are the main uses for AI and robotics in the recycling industry? Using advanced computer vision and machine learning, the platform trains itself by processing millions of material images. It teaches itself to look for different visual attributes such as size, color and texture. It learns many of the same things a person would learn: PET is shiny, and aluminum has a gray circle on the bottom. Due to the learning-based approach, it learns from experience, not only getting better, but also identifying more specific categories of material. AMP Neuron can identify distinct materials with AI and discern what to do with each fraction, guiding robots within our AMP Cortex™ system to precisely sort consistently at a much faster rate and with greater accuracy than a person. How does the incorporation of robotic technology affect manual sorting operations? The modularity of our AMP Cortex™ robotic sorting system drops into the general footprint of a sorting station, making it incredibly scalable by adapting to existing operations. The installation is intended to be done within existing operations without costly retrofit and extended downtime, often over a weekend. We train on a given operation’s material stream in advance to jumpstart the integration, striving to be up and running as soon as possible. As far as working with or replacing manual sortation, it really depends on the customer operation and their goals. Our systems are designed and scalable to solve the labor challenge overall as a replacement. But due to the system’s modularity, robots can co-locate with manual sortation as well. Where do you see AI technology headed? We see a future (and it is happening fast) where facilities are increasingly automated at low cost, reducing operational friction and creating even more value. We also see the potential for new types of high-value commodity categories created as our AI is precise down to the consumer packaged good (CPG) brand level and even the UPC and SKU level. As our technology constantly adapts to new material types in the stream even more value will be created for the circular economy and its stakeholders.

Automation and AI are coming for jobs — and African American workers are particularly at risk.African American workers will have higher rates of job displacement than the general US population due to automation, according to a new report by the consultancy McKinsey. ""There is an elevated risk to the African American workforce to modernization, automation, and the global shift that exists in this modern economy,"" McKinsey partner and report co-author Jason Wright tells Business Insider.

While 22% of all jobs in the total workforce will get ""disrupted,"" meaning either killed or replaced by lower-paying work, it's 10% higher for the African American workforce. That means 4.5 million black jobs could be displaced by 2030 without any intervention, according to McKinsey.

About 34% to 36% of jobs in those three sectors will get disrupted, McKinsey says.The disproportionate impact of automation could exacerbate the already widening racial wealth gap. The wealth gap between the median black and white families in the US has jumped $54,000 since 1992. White Americans own disproportionately more homes and hold less student debt than African Americans — factors that can be traced to historic redlining and discrimination in job hiring.Automation and AI will impact black men and black women differently.College education and gender will all impact how severely black Americans will face job loss, McKinsey finds.

While the general black population is 10% more at risk for job disruption, the number jumps to 30% for African American men without a college degree. In fact, the researchers estimate that 28% of jobs held by black men without a college degree will get disrupted by automation and AI by 2030.Interestingly, while black men face greater risk of job disruption from AI, black women will see relatively fewer job losses. Black women might lose jobs at a lower rate not only compared to black men, but also when compared to white and Asian Americans of all genders.Black women are currently overrepresented in jobs that will see growth in the next decade, like nursing assistants and home health aides. However, black and Hispanic women are still paid the least out of every racial-gender pairing.

Wright said understanding the unique ways automation will impact different racial-gender groups will allow for better understanding of which policies to advocate for. Black men might need more job re-skilling training to prepare for job disruption, while black women might need better access to education to attain higher-paying work.""There's a real benefit to the evolution the economy is going through,"" he said. ""Being smart, especially as a person of color, on the unique risk to you is helpful.""

How the story began
The story began 15 years ago when a group of developers founded a small IT company and started to work on the introduction of quantitative methods of investment research based on the experience of scientists in the field of theoretical physics, applied mathematics and programming in the financial markets. Today Quant Infinity is an international group of IT-companies focused on developing software for quantitative trading on international financial markets. It has over 15 years of experience in product development for financial companies, 8 years of which were spent successfully developing and installing automated trading systems. Investment hedge funds, trust companies, banks, and family offices implement Quant Infinity solutions for managing either their own funds or for providing asset management services to clients under their own brand (White Label). Quant Infinity services are already used by financial companies in Europe and Asia.
What is Quantitative Investing, and how does it work?

Quantitative investing emerged in the United States in the 1970s. Edward Thorpe, an American professor of mathematics at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), is considered to be the founder of this trend. In his research on the movement of quotes on the stock exchange, he concluded that it is possible to predict changes in asset prices with the help of the probability theory, predictive analytics and the law of large numbers.
Thorpe used his developments in his first quantitative investment fund, founded in late 1969. Over the next 18 years, he turned $1.4 million into $273 million. His Princeton Newport Partners (1969-1988, with an average income of 19.1% per year) and Ridgeline (1994-2002, with an average income of 21%, with a volatility of 7%) were beyond the reach of traditional managers of that time.
In the 1970s, for investors accustomed to investing in traditional instruments on financial advisers’ guidance, Thorpe’s method appeared to be like predicting the future. However, over two decades, many hedge funds, major banks, and other financial companies in the US actively began to apply this method. Citadel, QIM, TwoSigma are the most well-known companies among them. The method has been utilized as well by some investment departments at the largest US banks like JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and others.
 Quantitative funds today 
By the end of the first quarter of 2019, the total assets under the management of hedge funds reached USD 3.0113 trillion. According to Global Hedge Fund Industry Outlook 2019, the largest funds which use quantitative methods of investing demonstrated significant growth over the period 2013-2018. The volume of assets under the management of these funds is more than USD 1 trillion.

Predictive analysis, probability theory, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence used for analysis and prediction in quantitative funds. The best of these funds present impressive results on a long horizon. For example, the average annual return of Renaissance Technologies by Jim Simons (the founder of the most successful hedge fund according to Forbes) for the last 30 years was 40% per annum. Even the total average return of all quantitative funds exceeds traditional hedge funds´ return. Between 2012-2017, the average return of quantitative funds was 5.1% per year, while the average return of “traditional” hedge funds was 4.3% per year.
How to profit from this

The Quant Infinity solution is an international algorithmic trading strategy developed in 2011 which is being constantly improved by a team of mathematicians. Since the beginning the strategy has been continuously developed. The results, which are regularly confirmed by an international audit company are above 35% p.a. in average. For risk-averse investors, the volatility of the strategy can easily be down-scaled, thus still offering pure alpha creation. The strategy has always been among the top 10 international rankings of Barclay Hedge and EurekaHedge in terms of return on par with the largest international funds.
The strategy currently encompassed more than 7´000 bots which are all being run and monitored automatically. The quality of each individual bot is essentially determined by its return per risk and is conventionally measured via the Sharpe ratio.  Mathematically, the Sharpe ratio is defined as the ratio of the annualized mean return to the annualized standard deviation of returns. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the smoother the track record of the individual bot. It is directly linked to the probability of generating a positive return over a given horizon of time. Over the last 4 years, the Sharpe ratio of the Quant Infinity strategy is 1.27.  As a benchmark, over the last 4 years the Sharpe ratio of the S&P 500 Index is 0.72.  Under these circumstances the probability to achieve a positive result over the next 2 years is 92.9% for the Quant Infinity strategy and only 83.5% for the S&P500 Index.*
* The Sharpe ratio of the strategy was calculated using Composite track record since 01.07.2015. The Sharp Ratio of S&P500 Index was calculated using open sources since 01.07.2015.
 
Ways of cooperation
White label fund/proprietary trading
You as a regulated investment company (e.g. a fund) can offer the Quant Infinity-Strategy to your own clients either as a stand-alone version or integrated with different strategies to increase your diversification.
You own the product and you set up the parameters which are right for your market and your clients at your own discretion. The total amount of assets under management in the strategy shall however not be less than USD/EUR 5 M for a proper functioning of it.

Every day we see continued development of new technologies, new applications, and greater investment in AI, machine learning, and the host of cognitive technologies. While we might be able to easily see how some of these technologies will be implemented in the short term, what does the future hold for widespread adoption of AI? In the 1980s the emergence of portable phones made it pretty obvious that they would allow us to make phone calls wherever we are, but who could have predicted the use of mobile phones as portable computing gadgets with apps, access to worldwide information, cameras, GPS, and the wide range of things we now take for granted as mobile, ubiquitous computing.  Likewise, the future world of AI will most likely have much greater impact in a much different way than what we might be assuming today.

One way of looking into the future that AI might bring is through Cognilytica’s four-part AI enabled vision of the future. In that vision, there are four main aspects in which AI will impact our future lives: the way we work, the way we live, the way we experience the world and our interactions with each other, and the relationship we have with data. (Disclosure: I’m a principal analyst with Cognilytica)

The AI-Enabled FutureCognilytica
The New Workforce & The Always-On Organization

As technology progresses, the nature of work and labor rapidly changes. It is the purpose of technology to eliminate burdensome tasks and improve our daily lives. Technology is meant to increase our productivity, and allow us to live our lives to old age with increasing quality. We have always seen adjustments to the workforce when new technologies become available, especially in the areas of automation and augmentation. It should therefore be no surprise that organizations in industries of all types are looking to AI to change the way that they run their businesses. As such, the adoption of AI will necessarily and unavoidably change the nature of work. 

PROMOTED
This is definitely the case for blue-collar work, which has already seen widespread change with the impact of robotics and automation. Automation has already replaced many positions in the area of manufacturing, but the bigger shift is not on the factory floor, but in the office cubicle. AI is eliminating much of the drudgery and repetitive work that has been farmed to service workers, or is otherwise taking up the time of more highly paid office workers. The use of various forms of process automation, from the less-intelligent, and ill-named robotic process automation (RPA) to the more intelligent cognitive automation forms, it’s clear that AI is here to stay in the organization. In the not-too-distant future, there will be just as many software and hardware bots operating the back and front offices of businesses as there are humans in the organization, and quite likely, many more bots than humans.
One positive aspect in this area of the AI-enabled organization is the realization that AI is making organizations much more responsive to their customer’s needs and desires. AI is making mass-customization possible for many different industries by leveraging the power of machine learning-enabled hyperpersonalization to tailor their offerings and build solutions customized for each individual customer, patient, client, or citizen. Through the use of conversational agents and autonomous systems, organizations are able to provide better customer service and better products and solutions to their customers by leveraging AI to churn through large quantities of data to build more accurate profiles of all of their customers. This impact can be felt even in the healthcare industry where AI is being used to provide personalized medicine and healthcare better tailored to individual patient needs.

Another benefit and change that AI brings is the “always-on organization”. With the use of conversational agents and autonomous bots, there’s very little reason for businesses to close. Even after the humans go home, bots are operating, providing both the expectation and the reality that users can do business at any time they choose. This is not only limited to ecommerce and purely digital operations. The AI-enabled future means 24-hr coffee shops that are fully automated, and banks that no longer operate on “bankers hours”. In the AI-enabled future, businesses simply don’t have hours of operation. They’re always in operation.

The future is Autonomous
AI is empowering the ability for autonomous operation of all types. Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is autonomous vehicles, but this is just one specific application of autonomous systems - and not even the best one. In the future, all modes of transportation will become autonomous, and this will bring about a change in the way we think of things like vehicles. If we think of it in conjunction with businesses like Uber or Lyft where you can essentially call a ride on demand whenever, you no longer need to own your own car if you can instead call one and it can show up whenever we need them. Our society is heading in a direction that lets us imagine these possibilities.

Autonomous everything doesn’t just mean autonomous vehicles. It means that we can have autonomous systems and operations of all sorts, from the autonomous software bots we described above performing the perfunctory work required in most processes to the vision of autonomous retail currently being innovated by Amazon Go and others. The combination of computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing, predictive analytics, and the world of intelligent sensors and devices means that we will be awash in autonomous systems of all sorts pervasive in our daily lives.
Enhancing the Human Experience
In addition to our work lives, AI will soon be a part of our overall human experience. We will come to use and sometimes rely on AI systems to enhance our daily interactions with each other, expand our creativity, and give us ways to express ourselves that we can’t otherwise do today. In the same way that spell check is part of the daily world of even the most casual of writers, AI will be used to give us powers of language translation and augmented creativity. Already, AI systems are helping those with limited artistic talents compose and produce original and powerful works of art and music.
AI systems are also having a great influence on how we communicate and socialize with each other. Humans are incredibly social creatures and one of the biggest developments to come out of machine learning technology is machine translation that can help humans understand and communicate in many languages. In the AI-enabled future, humans will be able to converse and interact with each other in the native language of choice, not having to worry about miscommunicating intentions. Machine learning models will be able to understand context, nuance, and colloquialisms that help to fill the gaps of human communication. This will make it easier for people who speak two different languages and don't understand each other to be able to carry on a conversation whether it is for business or for travel. AI is going to help us continue to meet our need to connect with others in meaningful ways. 
Changing our relationship with data: Pervasive Knowledge
The internet and mobile phones have completely changed the way we interact with others and the world around us. In the 1980s the concept of “pervasive computing” was nothing more than a pie-in-the-sky vision of everyone having computers available to them wherever they are, with instant access to data and information. It took just a few scant decades to make that vision a reality. Now we carry with us constantly-connected devices that have worldwide access to information. And now through AI, we’re moving beyond the idea of pervasive computing to pervasive knowledge. 
Pervasive knowledge is the idea that not only are we always going to be connected to the worldwide information grid, but all systems will have constant knowledge of what we are doing and how we’re doing it. This is the idea that people will already know things about you because of what is available for them through technology. On the positive side, this could mean a lot for disaster preparedness. If you think of instances such as an Amber Alert or tornado warning, 10 or 15 years ago you didn't get a text message when a kid went missing or a storm was imminent. The idea of pervasive computing made it an assumption that a text message would be sufficient to provide notification. But if you think about this, that’s a particularly non-intelligent way to do things. What if the system already knew that you were or weren’t in the path of a storm, could guide you to a safe place to seek shelter, and would additionally notify first responders if the storm hit the location where you were. This is the idea of pervasive knowledge made tangible, and it will impact everything from the way we shop to the way we live. 
The problem with pervasive knowledge is the “creepy” factor. To many, pervasive knowledge means pervasive surveillance. We don’t want systems to know where we are and what we are doing, yet we freely give this information away with our GPS-enabled phones connected to social media with cameras. While we might accuse governments or companies of tracking us without our consent, we are actually already freely giving this information in exchange for all the modern conveniences afforded by that pervasive connectivity. So too we’ll see people giving information to contribute to pervasive knowledge in exchange for even greater conveniences. 
The AI-enabled future will be a world where there is more access to all types of information and we are going to demand that those who have access to it use it smartly and use it for our benefit. This is going to mean that we're asking more of the people who have custody of this knowledge. We will demand that companies already know about us. We will demand that governments already have access to what they need to know. We won’t be patient with giving people information that we will presume they already should know. The future will be AI enabled and less patient.
We don't really know how soon or in what ways these visions of the AI-enabled future will become a reality, but even the most casual of observers can see that these are inevitable trends. The one thing that is certain is that it’s coming and we’re already heading in that direction. Companies are developing and investing in these technologies now.

AI could help work out how many people are in large crowds

Artificial intelligence may be able to settle the debate over how many people attend protests or gatherings.
Vast numbers of people took to the streets of London this weekend to call for a second referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union. But exactly how many people were there is up for debate. Protest organisers say there were 1 million people, but when similar claims were made earlier in the year, they were disputed by fact-checking organisations.
A method developed by Reza Bahmanyar at the German Aerospace Center and his colleagues that uses artificial intelligence could help improve counts in the future.Advertisement
To create the system, the team hand-counted nearly a quarter of a million people in 33 images taken from planes, drones and helicopters, then used this to train an algorithm called MRCNet. MRCNet divides each image into small squares and analyses how many people are in each one.

The results are better than other AI-powered crowd estimation systems, proving 15 percent more accurate than its nearest competitor at reaching the correct number in a crowd. The system is much faster than hand annotation, taking 0.03 milliseconds to compute the number of people in each square.
At present, the team have only used the AI in lab conditions, but Bahmanyar hopes to soon mount the system onto planes and helicopters to do real-time counts.
Crowd science is inexact and slow to come up with estimates. “It’s a highly emotive topic,” says Keith Still at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK. Still invented one of the current best methods for measuring crowds, which monitors the routes people take, the density of the crowd and the profile of the participants to get an accurate estimate of numbers.
“I think in the right places, this technology could be really useful,” says Still. “Protest organisers and governments often don’t want real numbers,” he says. “They want marketing numbers. Will they invest in something that punctures their claim?”

 Five Key Trends in AI and Data Science for 2024 | Thomas H. Davenport and Randy Bean
















In the longstanding argument about whether AI will replace or complement human beings, the new watchword is symbiosis. Most recently, Elon Musk used the term to describe how a brain implant might merge human and digital intelligence. But you don’t need to go full cyborg to achieve a mutually beneficial relationship between humans and AI. Instead, you can reimagine worker roles and business processes to enable people and AI to collaborate and achieve something greater together than they could apart.
Given the swell of fear and questions around AI — from how many jobs will be lost to who will train these new systems — the question of how to achieve human-machine collaboration has taken on new urgency. After all, these mutually beneficial relationships, focused on augmentation rather than displacement, stand to boost business value while lessening risk of people losing jobs.
In order to create a symbiotic AI workforce, organizations will need to use human-centered AI processes that motivate workers, retrain them in the context of their workflow, and shift the focus from automation to collaboration between humans and machines.
To test that proposition, our company’s innovation hub in Dublin, Ireland, conducted an experiment designed to see how human workers might augment the work of an existing AI system and embrace their new roles as AI trainers.
Evolving the AI Trainer Role
Working with a team of design, data, and software experts, and medical coders, we designed, built, and tested a software interface that enabled the medical coders to move from simply using AI to improving it, taking on the tasks of an AI Trainer, a role that teaches AI how to perform and iterate.
Medical coders analyze a patient’s medical chart, taking complex information about diagnoses, treatments, medications, and more, which is translated into alphanumeric codes that are submitted to billing systems and health insurers. This coding is critical not only for billing and reimbursement but also for patient care and epidemiological studies.
At the location where the experiment took place, an AI system had recently been put in place to assist medical coders in examining patient charts. Previously, medical coders read through charts and highlighted relevant information with a pen. AI took some of the heavy lifting out of this process by scanning the charts and finding information about drug treatments to support insurance payments.
We saw the opportunity for the medical coders, who are registered nurses, to further apply their expertise by training the AI system so it could more accurately validate genuine links between medical conditions and treatments. The duty of updating the AI links had until then fallen to a data scientist, who would look for patterns in the manual inputs from the medical coder experts and update the knowledge database accordingly. In the experiment, however, a new and simple-to-use interface allowed the coders to apply their medical expertise (and some basic statistical concepts) to update and validate the links in the AI database.

The resulting symbiotic system enabled the humans and the AI to each work to their strengths. With AI thriving at repetitive, straightforward tasks at high volume and accuracy, the coders were allowed to focus their skills and attention on the more complex cases that require domain expertise, decision-making, and critical analysis.
As their understanding of AI grew, the coders were able to make coding decisions that were beyond the scope of a non-medically trained data scientist. Achieving better outcomes than either the coders or AI system could independently, this workflow not only generates more value in the short term but also holds promise for longer-term improvements in patient care, based in part on the complex connections that coders make.
Enabling Human + AI Collaboration in the Enterprise
Though small in scale, the experiment has big implications for leaders, workers, data scientists, and managers seeking to shape the AI systems and jobs of the future. Turning workers who are merely consumers of AI into producers of AI results in processes that produce outputs of ever-increasing value.
To create these exponentially more valuable symbiotic systems, organizations should keep in mind these basic principles that emerged from our experiment:
Challenge the assumption that AI is always superior to humans. Leaders as well as workers often uncritically accept that assumption. In our experiment, the medical coders initially thought that human colleagues were making errors that were in fact attributable to AI. But as they continued to work with AI and understand its power and limitations, they came to recognize the source of the errors and how to address them. Rather than supplanting human skills, such collaborative systems can increase the value of those skills and improve the performance of AI.









Be open and transparent with workers about your plans for AI and its impact on their future. As we move to a more AI-enabled workforce, not everyone will welcome changes in their roles, skills, and responsibilities — especially when their livelihood is at stake. Workers are much more likely to embrace symbiotic systems than stand-alone AI designed to supplant people. When developing symbiotic systems, help workers who are not familiar with AI to develop a positive relationship with it. In our experiment, medical coders often referred to the AI they were training as a child to whom they were teaching new things.
Harness the intrinsic motivations of workers. The symbiotic medical coding system was designed to draw on the nurses’ desire to apply their medical knowledge. As a result, they felt committed to their new roles, in control of their work, and masterful at it. After working as trainers with the system, eight of the nine medical coders felt more positive about working with AI on a daily basis, and two-thirds felt positive about future job opportunities. Overall, they were motivated both to learn new technical skills and to further enhance their medical knowledge, which points to potential benefits for AI-enabled businesses.
Invest in people. When we think of investing in AI, we tend to think of technology first. That’s important, but people will drive the value for your business. Investing in your employees so they can build AI relationships into their roles is a long-term strategy that can unlock previously untapped expertise and value in your workforce.
For example, AI trainers are one of three new categories of AI-driven business and technology jobs, but many large companies are outsourcing the role. By contrast, our experiment enabled existing employees to apply their skills in a new way to train AI without the need for outsourcing. Further, technical re-skilling was not a prerequisite of working with the new system. In fact, with the right design, AI can be positioned as an easy-to-use tool that enables employees to do their job better.
Focus on function, not sophistication. Successful symbiotic systems will put simplicity before sophistication and value transparency and ease of use over complexity. Data scientists and designers will need to work together closely to create human-centric, symbiotic AI systems that enable human experts, like the nurses in our experiment, to train and continuously improve the systems without extensive training themselves. Meanwhile, data scientists — a scarce resource likely to grow scarcer — can use their time and talents to identify additional business opportunities in an organization’s processes rather than operating and maintaining existing AI systems.
Cocreate and experiment. Once you have identified the process or workflow where people and AI can work symbiotically, make sure all stakeholders work and experiment together from the start. Have designers and data experts collaborate as early as possible to ensure a useful and usable system. Engage users and cocreate with them to make sure their needs and motivations are heard and incorporated into design decisions. Assess how people use the system and measure not just productivity but also the qualitative aspects of the experience. Gather feedback from users; and if you see burnout, boredom, or dislike arising, then react and redesign as needed.

Looking To the Future
Relentless automation that bypasses human input is proving to be a short-term and unsatisfactory application of AI. At the operational level, an exclusive focus on automation leads to inflexible, brittle business processes. Worse, leaving people out of the loop forgoes a rich source of added value and squanders the expert knowledge the organization maintains. Worst of all, it cedes the future to competitors who choose to build symbiotic systems in which humans and machines continually improve each other’s performance.
To build such systems, organizations need to take the long view. With AI washing over virtually every industry these days, leaders are understandably eager to catch the wave in the short term. But they need to ask themselves how to position their workforce to harness the waves to come. That means thinking about and investing in roles and responsibilities that are three to five years away.
By taking this long view, coupled with a willingness to experiment, managers can make space for creativity, test for stakeholder buy-in, and design processes and jobs for maximum collaborative intelligence. As AI and humans get smarter by working together, the system grows organically in the hands of those who work with it most closely. By embracing symbiotic processes, the organization fulfills its ethical obligation to its most valuable asset — its people.

“Jexi” is a what-if movie, that sad brand of stale comedy that’s framed by a conceptually intriguing idea — like “Isn’t It Romantic,” which asked what-if-someone-was-stuck-in-a-romantic-comedy? With major studio comedies frequently tanking at the box office, this type of writing has become increasingly popular as producers search for a unique idea to get people into theater seats. This time, unfortunately, that didn’t work. In its opening weekend, “Jexi” grossed a meager 3.2 million dollars. For the benefit of those who didn’t see it (meaning most of the world) the film’s what-if question is what-if-a-cell-phone-fell-in-love?Phil, played by Adam Devine (“Isn’t It Romantic”), works an unsatisfying job at a Buzzfeed-style website making listicles about cats while pining for something more. When he buys a new phone, its unusually vivacious artificial intelligence software, Jexi, sets out to improve his life, and falls head over heels for him in the process. Of course, these feelings aren’t quite reciprocated, as Phil has fallen in love with Cate (Alexandra Shipp, “Love Simon”) and starts to use his phone less. 
 

Devine and the cast, especially Wanda Sykes (“Bad Moms”), are funny enough to carry mediocre scenes that have been done before in countless other comedies. The science fiction elements, centered around a sentient, emotional AI, are interesting at a base level, asking common but still pressing questions about artificial life and the future of human connection. Jexi herself is also hilarious, delivering expletive-filled rants with the dryness of a taciturn artificial personality like Siri. The movie is a strange combination of science fiction with a social point a la “Black Mirror” and a Lifetime network romantic comedy.The two genres in “Jexi” mix like oil and water. The science fiction is kept wall away from the love story, shoved into a subplot. The film employs elements from two distinct genres with widely different rules and conventions, without considering how they would appear in juxtaposition. Since a balance is never achieved, they manage to diminish the effects of each other. The romance comes off as frivolous and unrealistic, while the sci-fi appears impersonal, just a gimmick in service of the plot.On top of the blithe romance and its science fiction sojurns, “Jexi” clumsily tries to say something about society. It’s a basic message: Technology dependence bad, personal connection good. The opening scene is a montage of Phil diving into a cell phone to escape his parents’ troubled marriage. Then there’s Adam painstakingly working to create the “perfect” Facebook picture, slathering it in filters and emojis. Finally, and most ham-fistedly — a phone literally tries to stop Phil from having a human relationship. This idea would work if “Jexi” had any real humanity, yet everything about it invokes the superficiality of the internet age. The cinematography chokes in colors straight out of Snapchat’s most garish filters, and the music used wouldn’t be out of place in an Apple commercial. The characters are like Instagram personalities, too. They fit their assigned roles perfectly, without any blemishes, and there is never any real depth. Kid Cudi’s awkward cameo furthers the unreality.“Jexi” dispenses surface pleasures perfectly, conjuring brief laughs or mild interest, but in the end, nothing sticks. Its many disparate parts are too underdeveloped and contradictory to work. Satires about similar topics, like the episode “Nosedive” from “Black Mirror,” work because the comedy and science fiction are intertwined, combining to say something meaningful about the human experience. In “Jexi,” they’re too chopped up, which keeps it from saying anything at all. 
 

“Jexi” will be buried in the streaming sludge among other forgotten movies, joining the ever-growing pile of colorful, smiling thumbnails that don’t do much but look pretty. This seems like the most appropriate fate.

Artificial Intelligence Firms in China Face Brunt of Trade Dispute

The Trump administration is taking its issue with trade out
on several different Chinese entities. During the first week of October, the
administration banned 28-Chinese individuals by issuing restrictions with their
Visa’s. During the second week of October, the administration levied a ban on
six Chinese companies that work on artificial intelligence. These companies are
unable to work with US firms, accusing the companies of helping to violate the
human rights of Muslims in China’s northwestern province of Xinjiang.
According to sources, four of the companies, SenseTime,
Megvii, iFLYTEK, and Yitu, make software for facial recognition and voice
transcription. The issue the administration has with these companies is that
have been used in a campaign of repression. The other companies, Hikvision
and Dahua Technology, make surveillance equipment such as cameras that
incorporates artificial intelligence. This has also affected large online shares such as Alibaba, and Baidu.
The goal seems to be to hamper Chinese firms from making
program in artificial intelligence which is part of a broader effort by the
administration to hamper Chinese business. The expansion of the China’s tech
industry has coincided, with a rise in popularity of artificial intelligence.
The advancement in Chinese AI have broadened to areas such as facial and voice
recognition. This has the potential to drive the tech industry in China,
something the US administration is attempting to stifle during a trade war. The
US
Commerce Department added these firms to a trade blacklist this week.
Twenty government and security bureaus in China’s Xinjiang region were also included
in the ban.
The restriction prohibits the Chinese firms from doing business with US companies without a government-granted license. The US administration is now using a new tool in its arsenal against China. The shift in sentiment now targets Chinese human rights issues as opposed to just espionage. For example, Huawei has been the main target of US restrictions, with its 5G technology cited as a particular security worry. The announcement comes ahead of a meeting between Chinese and US negotiators which has been weighing on riskier assets. In total, 28 entities were added to the US Department of Commerce list. 
The question for investors is why this matters, Artificial intelligence
technologies have the potential to make companies more productive but it
can also make national defense better equipped to wage wars. Trying to hamper
China’s AI companies could assist the US’s own national security and foreign
policy interest in the short term. The administration is also hoping to exert
tremendous pressure on the Chinese in the hopes that they can create a deal
that is helpful. 
China is still dependent on US and other foreign semi-conductor makers. This dependence has not gone unnoticed, by the US administration and they are keen to capitalize on this issue for their trade negotiations. According to BBC News only  16% of the semiconductors used within China are made in the country and only half of those by local companies.

Currently, this is done manually and as such, the workers run the risk of falling prey to tuberculosis (TB) and respiratory diseases..“A lot of tea workers suffer from TB, cancer etc as they spray the fertilisers and pesticides. We are hopeful that by using drones, we will be able to keep them away from the diseases,” Shetty said at a programme on the sidelines of a workshop of BRS Ventures at Maijan Tea Estate in Upper Assam’s Dibrugarh district..There is a concern about the chemical residues polluting air as fertilisers and pesticides would be sprayed from a height. However, Shetty allayed the fear saying there would be precision spraying..According to the Plantation Labour Act, the workers, engaged in spraying fertilisers and pesticides, should be provided with “protective gears” which include gloves, masks and goggles but few tea estates adhere to the guidelines. Tea workers’ unions alleged that TB and respiratory diseases were very common among tea workers and they killed many workers over the years..The BRS Ventures will use two kinds of robotic drones. Their application is expected to reduce the wastage of fertilisers and improve the quality of tea. One set of drones will scientifically analyse the health of plants, soil conditions and other natural factors while the other will spray fertilisers and target pests..The company also has plans to implant molecular markers in leaves to develop traits for mass production..“We have the technology to implant molecular or genetic markers in plants but tea is a new area for us,” said Avital Tractitman, an executive of Israeli SMX, who is attending the seven-day workshop..The markers help manage a plant’s genes by augmenting resistance to pests and improving the quality and quantity of production..Shetty, who was born in Udupi, assured that the use of technology would not lead to retrenchment..“None of our 26,000 farmers will lose his or her job. We will engage them in different areas,” he said..He used the phrase, “We are here to cooperate” several times in his speech and preferred to call the employees farmers to workers..For technological assistance, the BRS Ventures has tied up with several companies from the US, Australia, Scotland, Israel etc..“We worked on similar projects in Asia and the use of AI improved the quality of lives of the workers and increased production,” Nataraj Balasubramanian of the US-based Smart Farms said. .Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Workers should prepare for robotics takeover

Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT  | Technology experts are calling on government and training institutions to prepare the next generation of the workforce for an aggressive world of robotics and artificial intelligence machines.
They say without taking a deliberate policy to skill the next generation of workers, robots and machine intelligence will push millions of people out of industrial, agriculture, financial and infrastructure sectors into a vicious cycle of poverty.
They say the dawn of that machine intelligence has already arrived into the country in the forms of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in the various banking halls, Smartphones, Drones and Hi-tech warfare capabilities.
Solomon King Benge, the Founder of Fundi Bots, a non-profit organization accelerating science learning in Uganda says that general intelligence, Artificial Narrow Intelligence and Super Artificial Intelligence machines, are taking the world by storm.
Most robots and machine intelligence perform pre-programmed tasks using sets of coded instructions. For instance, by studying how former President Barrack Obama speaks, a robot was used to fabricate statements which he never actually said to cause uproar towards him. The experts say, at this rate, it will be easy to frame many people in criminal activities and acts of pornography.
According to Benge, most of the jobs that will be lost to robots and intelligent machines will include manual and very dangerous jobs involving sets of repetitive procedures which humans dread as cumbersome or time-consuming. He cites stamping of big volumes of papers and moving loads back and forth around the rooms, offices or industries.
Benge says the most feared form of artificial intelligence that scientists believe will replace the majority of the human workforce is known as Super Artificial Intelligence, although it is yet to be developed at a global level.
The experts say that for the next workforce to survive the Robotics takeover, the government must put in place favourable mechanisms for training, innovation, orientation and regulation.
Benge adds that the human generation must be highly skilled in creative thinking, hold a high degree of empathy for humanity and develop high levels of competencies in decision making which those machines are ordinarily incapable of executing.
Dr Robinah Nakawunde Kulabako, a Senior Lecturer and Head of the Department of Civil Engineering at Makerere University agrees with Benge’s position. She says there is hope in the coming world of robots and machine intelligence since they are basically trained and programmed to follow basic instructions without critical thinking in unpredicted circumstances.

 

Dr Nakawunde says the government should prepare citizens to capitalize on the weak links of robots and machine intelligence to prevent loss of livelihoods.
“Where Machines have taken over, we will require human intelligence to engage in complex activities beyond the intelligence level of the machines. This will require training, change in policies and legislations” she stated.
Alice Namuli Blazevic, the Head of Technology and Innovation at Katende, Ssempebwa and Company Advocates says the world of robots and machine intelligence will bring better efficiency including wiping out corruption, delays in service deliveries and job creations when harnessed by those who are prepared for it.
The technology enthusiasts were speaking at the geopolitics Conference taking place at Makerere University under the theme: The Machines Are Taking Over.
Silver Kayondo, the Founder of Drone Nerds Africa, a Ugandan technology hub specializing in building drones says the government must take bold steps to understand the unseen opportunities in the emerging technology arena for better data protection and military capability as Africa presents itself as the frontier for testing potent technologies.
“When we ignore what the 4th industrial revolution is bringing towards us; we risk many things with our location in sub-Saharan Africa where many tropical diseases are common. We need to understand the impact with which some of the emerging technologies will bring” he warned.

Recently major names in the technology industry have been talking about why the potential applications of artificial intelligence could be something we should be worried about. Their argument comes from two different places. One the one hand, they see AI as one of the most fundamental transformative technologies that we have ever seen in the history of mankind, and on the other hand, that transformative power is something we should be scared of and be wary about. If AI is transformative, then it has the power to be transformative both for good reasons as well as bad. 


However, fear of the unknown has always been the case with technology from the wheel to the internet. So, is AI something we should be scared of? The fears of AI seem to stem from a few common causes: general anxiety about machine intelligence, the fear of mass unemployment, concerns about super-intelligence, putting the power of AI into the wrong people’s hands, and general concern and caution when it comes to new technology.

General Anxiety about AI

One of the most widespread fears of AI is just general anxiety about it and what it’s potentially capable of. A recurring theme in movies and science fiction is AI systems that go rogue - think HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey or the Terminator movie series. People don’t like machines that get too smart, because we fear we can’t control it. This popular representation of AI gone bad is causing a general wariness in the public surrounding the development of intelligent systems technologies. The fear is generally surrounding the unknown that as AI systems are becoming more intelligent and human intelligence surrounding these systems is increasing, these two unknowns don’t really give us a clear direction for where things could go. 

PROMOTED
However, just as we have examples of HAL and Terminator, we also have examples as C3PO and the computers from Star Trek. These are highly intelligent systems that are well within the control of humans. The future could be as great and benign as Star Trek if we had that perspective on the possibilities of intelligent machines. A good antidote to general anxiety is the realization that whenever human society has faced a major change or shift due to technological advances, humans has developed and adapted right along with it.
Fear of AI: AI is a Job Killer
Another major fear of AI is rooted in the idea of mass unemployment of human workers due to their replacement by AI workers. A big concern is that in the previous wave of automation, it was mostly blue collar jobs like manufacturing oriented jobs that were automated away, but in this new wave, it will be mostly white collar service-oriented jobs that are based around knowledge workers that will bear the brunt of intelligent forms of automation. The need for trained human workers in many areas of the economy will go away as the use of AI grows and increasingly permeates the business world. AI also has an effect on blue collar workers such as delivery drivers, cab drivers and many more aspects of supply chain, logistics, and manufacturing. The fact is the technology is in place that 80% of any of these jobs can be done by machines that are smart enough, so the reality already exists.

The counterargument here is that some of these systems aren’t to a point where they can reliably replace many human jobs. While AI systems provide a lot of capabilities, they simply can’t operate in a fully autonomous mode. In fact, most successful AI implementations are being done such that the AI system is providing an augmented intelligence role, supporting the human at what they do best, and not fully replacing them. In general, as technology waves disrupt industries and workers, they replace job categories, but don’t take away overall jobs. In fact overall jobs continue to grow and find new niches while machines simply replace the old ways of doing things. Companies aren’t completely throwing things out that have been working for them. It’s a more general transition into the world of new technologies such as AI. As is often said, AI isn’t a job killer, it’s a job category killer.

The fact is that a lot of industries are already being disrupted by the advancement of technology and a lot of it has nothing to do with AI. Rather, it is due to automation and streamlining processes that make it easier and quicker to go about inputting work for ourselves and not relying on businesses and other organizations to be the middleman when it comes to getting things done.

Fear of AI: Bad People Doing Bad Things
Another common fear of AI is that bad actors can do bad things when it comes to AI. Leaders in Russia made a pronouncement that whoever leads the advancement of AI is going to be one of the top rulers of the world. It is no surprise that countries are pouring significant amounts of investment and research into developing AI systems from everything to military advancement to intelligence systems that can influence the news. We can expect governments to continue to use AI systems in ways that will make us increasingly uncomfortable in the ways they are applied to warfare, surveillance, law enforcement, and other purposes. 
Yet, while we can expect governments and countries to compete with each other for AI dominance, it’s not the governments we have to fear. After all, laws and governance are there to keep an eye on government behavior. We have more to fear from bad actors, criminals, and mischief makers taking AI technologies and bending them to their ill-conceived purposes. As AI systems tend to learn from their creators, that can call into question the intention of the creator and those who are teaching the systems and what all they hope to accomplish. The fear is all stemming from the unknown. In addition, there hasn’t really been a strong counter argument as to what could be the best way to approach this particular scenario and what it means for the future.
Fear of AI: The SuperIntelligence
Probably the biggest fear of AI making media waves is that of super intelligence or that AI will reach a point where it doesn’t care for or about the existence of humanity anymore, such as what happens with Skynet in the Terminator series of movies. The technology will get to a point where it can teach itself and improve and invent on its own, and instead of becoming a force for the betterment of humanity, humanity becomes a servant of technology. The fear is that our brains will just not be able to keep up with advancement, development and invention after a certain point because things will be moving way too fast.
Computing systems could very well reach a point where they outstrip their human creators, and what will that mean for humanity when we reach that point? It makes us question what exactly intelligence is, and how we measure and define intelligence as concept for both humanity and computers, and how that new definition will fit into the world both now and moving forward. But all of this is assuming that systems can and will be able to achieve the goal of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and that we as a species or a society will not be able to put safeguards in place to keep the computers from reaching that point.
The big counterargument to all of this is that we are still much farther away from achieving AGI than we really think we are. While a lot of the technology is moving quickly to realizing goals of narrow AI, there are parts that aren’t working particularly well. Data is still the cornerstone of AI, and a lot of it is still messy and dirty — the Achilles Heel of AI.
All of these fears boil down to the fact that we just don’t know where AI is going and how soon it will take us to get there. Technology makes surprising and unusual leaps and bounds in ways we never think it will and things we think will take a while don’t. On the other hand things we thought would be here sooner aren’t there yet. It’s just a situation where we have to wait and see what comes.

Mark Brill: Artificial intelligence and the Wizard of Oz effect

In the last 18 months, a painting created by artificial intelligence (AI) was sold at Christie’s for €400,000, a writing bot at tech magazine TNW out-performed its journalist colleagues, and Google announced that it had achieved quantum supremacy in a computation that would have taken a binary computer 10,000 years. AI seems to be coming of age.
In spite of all the hype, it is not quite as it appears, and the above examples actually highlight some of the challenges with the current state of AI. The painting sold at Christie’s, called Portrait of Edmund Belamy, was made by an AI algorithm, but the data input and the final selection was made by humans from the French art collective Obvious. They saw the role of AI in much the same way as other artists view a paintbrush: a tool to produce the work.
Journalists at TNW, meanwhile, pre-programmed sets of phrases into a bot called Stoshi Nagaboto which collected data about Bitcoin and turned it into short articles. Unlike its human counterparts, Stoshi did not need to pause to eat or sleep.




The machine’s performance was measured in terms of views, but this is not necessarily a good gauge of success. Journalists will spend time finely crafting insightful long-form articles that may have fewer views, but offer a much deeper level of engagement.
Google’s claims of quantum supremacy have also been disputed, with IBM stating that Google had exaggerated the speed claims, and that the calculation could have been achieved conventionally in a couple of days.
So, AI is not yet doing the job it promises, in spite of significant investments in the technology. Instead, the vast sums of money spent on development has led to a ‘fake it ’til you make it’ approach. Organisations such as Facebook, Spinvox, Clara, Expensify have all been found playing Wizard of Oz, by employing people to undertake tasks that should be done by AI.
Putting aside the deception, though, maybe it is not such a bad thing that humans remain part of the process. Amazon, for example, had to abandon using AI for recruitment, as it eliminated women from jobs, due to historical prejudice in the data used. There is a risk that this kind of data bias could also apply to the employee benefits sector.
AI offers the potential to do amazing things, but we are not there yet. While we are not that far from aeroplanes being able to fly themselves, most of us would prefer to get on one with a pilot.
We want the reassurance of a highly skilled individual on hand in case something goes wrong, so perhaps we should apply the pilot analogy to other areas of AI. Where we are making important decisions that impact on both individual and societal futures, we need skilled, knowledgeable people to ensure the machines make the right choices.

(@SHRMMaryCheddie)From The Reading ListWashington Post: ""A face-scanning algorithm increasingly decides whether you deserve the job"" — ""An artificial intelligence hiring system has become a powerful gatekeeper for some of America’s most prominent employers, reshaping how companies assess their workforce — and how prospective employees prove their worth.""Designed by the recruiting-technology firm HireVue, the system uses candidates’ computer or cellphone cameras to analyze their facial movements, word choice and speaking voice before ranking them against other applicants based on an automatically generated 'employability' score.WBUR is a nonprofit news organization. Our coverage relies on your financial support. If you value articles like the one you're reading right now,  give today.""HireVue’s 'AI-driven assessments' have become so pervasive in some industries, including hospitality and finance, that universities make special efforts to train students on how to look and speak for best results. More than 100 employers now use the system, including Hilton and Unilever, and more than a million job seekers have been analyzed.""Harvard Business Review: ""Recruiting"" — ""Goldman Sachs is a people-centric business—every day our employees engage with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. As a consequence, hiring extraordinary talent is vital to our success and can never be taken for granted. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we faced a challenge that was, frankly, relatively new to our now 150-year-old firm. For decades investment banking had been one of the most sought-after, exciting, and fast-growing industries in the world. That made sense—we were growing by double digits and had high returns, which meant that opportunity and reward were in great supply. However, the crash took some of the sheen off our industry; both growth and returns moderated. And simultaneously, the battle for talent intensified—within and outside our industry. Many of the candidates we were pursuing were heading off to Silicon Valley, private equity, or start-ups. Furthermore, we were no longer principally looking for a specialized cadre of accounting, finance, and economics majors: New skills, especially coding, were in huge demand at Goldman Sachs—and pretty much everywhere else. The wind had shifted from our backs to our faces, and we needed to respond.""Not long ago the firm relied on a narrower set of factors for identifying 'the best' students, such as school, GPA, major, leadership roles, and relevant experience—the classic résumé topics. No longer. We decided to replace our hiring playbook with emerging best practices for assessment and recruitment, so we put together a task force of senior business leaders, PhDs in industrial and organizational psychology, data scientists, and experts in recruiting. Some people asked, 'Why overhaul a recruiting process that has proved so successful?' and 'Don’t you already have many more qualified applicants than available jobs?' These were reasonable questions. But often staying successful is about learning and changing rather than sticking to the tried-and-true.""Each year we hire up to 3,000 summer interns and nearly as many new analysts directly from campuses. In our eyes, these are the firm’s future leaders, so it made sense to focus our initial reforms there. They involved two major additions to our campus recruiting strategy—video interviews and structured interviewing.""Washington Post: ""The new way your boss can tell if you’re about to quit your job"" — ""IBM wants to keep its employees from quitting, and it’s using artificial intelligence to do it.""In a recent CNBC interview, chief executive Ginni Rometty said that thanks to AI, the tech and consulting giant can predict with 95 percent accuracy the employees who are likely to leave in the next six months. The 'proactive retention' tool — which IBM uses internally but is also selling to clients — analyzes thousands of pieces of data and then nudges managers toward the employees who may be on their way out, telling them to 'do something now so it never enters their mind,' Rometty said.""IBM’s efforts to use AI to learn who might quit is one of the more high-profile recent examples of the way data science, 'deep learning' and 'predictive analytics' are increasingly infiltrating the traditionally low-tech human resources department, arming personnel chiefs with more rigorous tools and hard data around the tricky art of managing people.""This program aired on October 30, 2019.Thank you for choosing journalism from WBUR and On Point.

Should we believe headlines claiming nearly half of all jobs will be lost to robots and artificial intelligence? 
We think not, and in a newly released study we explain why. 
Headlines trumpeting massive job losses have been in abundance for five or so years. 
Even The Conversation has had its had its share. 
Most come from a common source.  
It is a single study, conducted in 2013 by Oxford University’s Carl Benedict Frey and Michael Osborne.
This study lies behind the claim that 47% of jobs in the United States were at “high risk” of automation over the next ten or so years. 
Many claims, one source
Google Scholar says it has been cited more than 4,300 times, a figure that doesn’t count newspaper headlines.
The major predictions of job losses due to automation in Australia are based directly on its findings. Commentaries about the future of work in Australia have also drawn extensively on the study. 



What if robots can do less than we think?

In Australia and elsewhere the study’s predictions have led to calls for a Universal Basic Income and for a “work guarantee” that would allocate the smaller number of jobs fairly. 
Our new research paper concludes the former study’s predictions are not well-founded. 
It has two weaknesses. 
First, the method used to make predictions has major flaws.
Second, the predictions have not fared well when compared to actual changes in employment in the United States in the time since they were made.
Flawed method
The study authors asked a group of machine learning experts to identify jobs from a long list that could be automated. 
The experts concluded that half of the jobs on the list could be done by robotics and artificial intelligence in the near future. 
What’s wrong with that?
While those interviewed were experts in machine learning, they were not experts in the many jobs they considered. They were simply asked to look at a short text description of each job along with a list of tasks associated with it. 
Some of their predictions might make sense, such as most driving-related jobs being at risk.

      Driverless cars: once they're on the road, human drivers should be banned




Those jobs seem unlikely to vanish entirely in the next decade; but given recent developments in driverless cars, their demise might not be far away. 
But other predictions are harder to understand, such as the claim the jobs of accountants, marketing specialists and claims investigators are at risk over the next decade or so. 
Standard descriptions of the tasks undertaken by accountants include interpretation of information about accounting records and organisational performance. Interpretation is usually regarded as outside the scope of work that can be done by artificial intelligence. 
The work of accountants may well change with advances in artificial intelligence, but it is unlikely to be lost.
Exaggerated retelling
Equally troubling, we show the study’s predictions are inconsistent with the study authors’ views about how robots and artificial intelligence will affect jobs. 
The authors write that recent advances in robotics are still struggling with the challenge of manipulating small objects. Yet their study ends up predicting many jobs that require this sort of manipulation are at high risk of being lost in ten to 15 years.
Keep in mind the authors did not themselves claim all the jobs they identified would be lost. Instead, they claimed it would become technologically feasible to replace them.
Unfortunately, that was a distinction almost entirely lost in the headlines – which portrayed the study’s predictions as forecasts of what would happen.

      Machines on the march threaten almost half of modern jobs




But replacing workers with machines requires more than having the machines available. 
It requires investment in new (and likely very expensive) technologies. It requires governments to permit their use (as with driverless cars). And it requires workers be trained in their installation and maintenance.
Little predictive power
The study was initially published in 2013, six years ago, so it is possible to evaluate the predictions that were made by comparing them against actual changes in employment.
When we do this, we find the predictions don’t add anything to our understanding of actual employment changes in the United States.
Economists already had developed a well-grounded and empirically supported framework for understanding the effect of technological change on employment.

      Why we are still convinced robots will take our jobs despite the evidence




That framework is built on the concept robots and computers are very good at undertaking tasks that are routine, not so good at less routine tasks.
It has performed well in explaining employment in Australia and internationally and did so in the US between 2013 to 2018.
Our calcuations show this framework better explains what happened to the number of people in jobs by occupation in the US from 2013 to 2018 than the study’s predictions. 
Note that we did not examine whether the study correctly forecast what would happen (that would have been a big ask), merely whether its framework produced better forecasts than or added value to the existing framework. It did neither.
Some jobs will grow, others will die
Routine jobs will indeed dwindle as machines replace workers, but other jobs are likely to flourish. One occupation that stands out is personal care. Classified by the study as at high risk of automation, employment in it in the US has nearly doubled since the study was published.
Reality is often more complex (and interesting) than headlines.
For a more believable account of what is likely to happen we suggest a paper from the leading labour economist in the field, David Autor.
Its title: Why Are There Still So Many Jobs? The History and Future of Workplace Automation.

HAI Distinguished Fellow Erik Brynjolfsson and Stanford GSB Professor Susan Athey discuss the ethics of AI at a recent conference. | Holly Hernandez


An underlying theme emerged from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence’s fall conference: AI must be truly beneficial for humanity and not undermine people in a cold calculus of efficiency.
Titled AI Ethics, Policy, and Governanceopen in new window, the event brought together more than 900 people from academia, industry, civil society, and government to discuss the future of AI (or automated computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence).
Discussions at the conference highlighted how companies, governments, and people around the world are grappling with AI’s ethical, policy, and governance implications.
Expanding Human Experience
Susan Athey, the Economics of Technology Professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business and faculty associate director at Stanford HAI, spoke about AI’s impact on the economy. It’s critical, she said, that AI creates shared prosperity and expands — rather than replaces — the human experience in life and at work. Humans, after all, understand things in a way that may be difficult to codify in AI. How we organize and think about the future of work for people as well as machines is important, as it is all interconnected, she added.
“The real benefits of AI come when we dive into the applications and understand the entire vertical, everything through implementation, including the ethics and the feelings of people adopting it,” Athey said.
Erik Brynjolfssonopen in new window, director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at MIT, said companies building AI need to focus on the human side in addition to the eye-popping technology. “We need to understand first what our values are so we can understand how best to use these technologies.” He said it’s necessary to rethink the whole organizational and business process in terms of how AI fits in with the human culture.
Other panelists discussed the roles of public entities and private enterprise when it comes to regulating AI.
Eric Schmidtopen in new window, the former CEO of Google and technical advisor to Alphabet Inc., spoke with Marietje Schaakeopen in new window, a Dutch member of the European Parliament who played a role in the European Union’s regulation of big tech and is the Stanford Cyber Policy Centeropen in new window’s international policy director.
Schmidt noted that ethics matter in how a human decision is combined with an AI decision and said that “liberal, Western values” are important to support at a time when countries like China are using AI technology to repress and surveil their own people. “We want to make sure the systems we’re building are built on our values, human values,” he said.
Schaake urged that policymakers worldwide should take a citizen-oriented approach to AI policies and regulations, rather than follow a more corporate user-oriented framework. She advocated greater regulation of how tech companies use big data and stronger privacy protections for individuals, and urged that regulation should happen sooner rather than later in the case of artificial intelligence.
“We need a deeper debate about which tasks need to stay in the hands of the public and out of the market,” she said.
Ethics, Geopolitics, and Diversity
Reid Hoffmanopen in new window, cofounder of LinkedIn, talked about his concept of “blitzscalingopen in new window,” a set of techniques learned at Silicon Valley companies to develop innovations quickly. Hoffman said this should happen in AI simultaneously with a sense of ethics and responsibility.

For example, when fast-growing companies plan for the future and quickly build up their engineering or sales capabilities, they also need to anticipate risk and what could go wrong on the road ahead. This means hiring people who understand risk and ethics and developing a risk framework for the company that is combined with a sense of ethics.
In the area of health care and disease, DJ Patilopen in new window, the head of technology for Devoted Health, noted how AI holds tremendous promise for treating people and saving lives: “We need to go at maximum warp speed to help those people.” The challenge is how to bring those cures and treatments to market quickly while also adhering to the necessary health care safeguards and ethical sensibilities.
Patil also called for more cooperation on data sharing around the world. “We have climate change, the potential for pandemics. What we need is better international frameworks, treaty mechanisms to share data across regional lines so that we can actually work on human problems.”
AI and National Security
In an AI and Geopolitics breakout session, led by Amy Zegartopen in new window, a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studiesopen in new window and at the Hoover Institutionopen in new window, panelists analyzed the nature of artificial intelligence, its role in national security, intelligence, and safety systems, and how it may affect strategic stability — or instability.
On the latter, Colin H. Kahlopen in new window, codirector of Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperationopen in new window, raised concerns about whether AI would increase economic tensions among the world’s most powerful nations and alter the global military balance of power if some countries move ahead quickly on AI while others fall behind. Another concern he mentioned was the possibility of someone using AI-enabled cyber weapons against nuclear command and control centers.
Zegart added that machine learning can help lighten the cognitive load when intelligence specialists are analyzing and sifting through data, which today is being produced at an accelerated rate. The challenge is organizational, as bureaucracies are slow to adopt game-changing technology.

Artificial Intelligence, Online Content Policy, Technology and Innovation 




 



The internet has altered every aspect of our lives. It has helped us launch political campaigns, begin romantic relationships, discover faraway places, document human rights abuses, and ensure that those subject to disasters are safe and have access to the resources they need. Much like any other great innovation, however, it also has its dark side.
Indeed, the internet has become a breeding ground for terrorists, a marketplace for human trafficking, a platform for child sexual exploitation, and a stage for hate speech and violence. To combat the presence of such terrible things, the job of content moderator was born.
Content moderators review and analyze user reports of abusive content found on platforms and decide, based on a predetermined set of rules and guidelines as well as the law, whether the content should stay up or come down.
The debates stirring in Congress and society relating to the role of content moderators have fueled many a baseless claim. Here are five of the most repeated myths.
Myth No. 1: Content moderators are part-time employees who work in less-than-ideal conditions. 
The conditions tied to this type of work have spawned horror stories of content moderators working as contractors for as little as $28,800 per year under extreme micromanagement. In the Philippines, workers operate out of jam-packed malls where they spend over nine hours a day moderating content for as little as $480 a month. With few workday breaks and no access to counseling, many of these individuals end up suffering from insomnia, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
These workers are real, and these stories are true. However, another set of content moderators exists. These employees also often struggle to deal with what they come across online due to the nature of the job, but their working conditions are significantly better. They live in the Bay Area and are paid well. They are lawyers, veterans, former teachers, economists and consultants. They speak over 15 languages. They represent the initial vision for the content moderator.
The appalling working conditions of contractors are a direct result of the internet’s unforeseen explosion. None of these platforms ever could have fathomed having so many users, and no one could have foreseen the horrific videos, photos and posts that would someday find their way onto the internet. As a result, there has been significant outside pressure to further moderate this content, leading some companies to resort to hiring contractors to perform this work.
Many believe the answer is to simply bring all moderators in-house. While tech companies can afford to do so, the mental health impacts of the job remain. Indeed, in many ways, content moderators’ work resembles that of first responders and crime scene investigators. The difference is that for those jobs, employers have come up with ways to help their employees cope with trauma, including peer support programs, individual counseling, physical fitness programs and an allotted amount of time for work. Incorporating these solutions would make a world of difference for content moderators.
Myth No. 2: Content moderation is censorship .
Some see content moderation as a form of censorship; a way for organizations to exercise control over users’ speech by blocking comments, posts, reviews, search results and other types of content they deem undesirable.
The truth is, content moderation is not about censorship; it is about providing a healthy and safe environment where users can upload their own products, posts or comments and comfortably engage with others. It’s a tool to improve user experience, ensure that platforms adhere to local and global laws, and helps users trust that they can interact through a platform or use a service without fear of being deceived.
Flags and report buttons allow users to notify site owners when something seems out of place. Human moderators ensure that all users comply with community standards. Well-trained AI moderation solutions use filters to screen for inappropriate words, phrases and images to help weed out trolls, bullies and spammers. In other words, content moderators keep online spaces great places to be.
In a cyber world filled with extremism, violence, child sexual abuse imagery and revenge porn, there is scarcely time to think about censoring speech that does not align with an individual’s particular politics or viewpoint. Admittedly, moderators are human beings, so mistakes can be made. However, chances are that if content has come down, it is because it is at odds with the platform’s terms of service or policies, or the law, not with the moderator’s personal bias.
Myth No. 3: Tech companies can vet all content before it is uploaded. 
Content moderation was never meant to operate at the scale of billions of users. Yet currently, 300 hours of video content is uploaded to YouTube every minute, over 95 million photos are uploaded to Instagram each day, and over 500 million tweets are sent on Twitter each day (that is 6,000 tweets per second). It is simply impossible for human moderators to vet every piece of content that is uploaded before it goes live.
Myth No. 4: Artificial Intelligence (AI) can moderate content on its own. 
Automated systems using AI and machine learning are certainly doing quite a bit to help with this unfathomably enormous task. They act as triage systems, for example, by pushing suspect content to human moderators and weeding out some unwanted material on their own. However, AI cannot solve the online content moderation problem without human help.
AI either uses visual recognition to identify a relatively broad category of objectionable content, or it matches content to an index of banned items. The latter approach is used in cases of obvious illicit material, such as terrorist content or child sexual abuse imagery. In these cases, content is given a “hash,” or an ID, so that if it is detected again, the uploading process will be disabled. Regardless of which method is used, the parameters must be set by human beings.
What’s more, while these AI-driven processes are mostly reliable, problems can arise. As Tarleton Gillespsie writes in “Custodians of the Internet,” “Automated detection is just not an easy task — arguably it’s an impossible one, given that offense depends so critically on both interpretation and context.” Indeed, AI has trouble looking for context and understanding certain dynamics, such as the varying legal regimes in different countries. AI also lacks the ability to account for the constant changes in how humans classify and define problematic content. These complexities make it difficult for people to moderate content, so how can we expect a machine, which is programmed by humans, to get the job done?
This is not to say that there is no hope for AI. Yet for the moment, it will remain a complement to human-driven content moderation as opposed to a replacement.
Myth No. 5: A removal of Section 230 will make for better moderation practices. 
Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, websites and internet service providers are not liable for the comments, pictures and videos that their users and subscribers post, no matter how bad they are (with certain exceptions). By providing this immunity, the hope was that companies would be free to adopt basic conduct codes and delete material that the companies deemed inappropriate. The law also prevents platforms from being held liable for good faith actions to block “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable material.” In fact, Section 230 can be thought of as giving birth to, and making possible, content moderation.
If lawmakers rescind Section 230 protection, tech companies will be open to a lawsuit every time a moderator decides to remove content or leave it on the platform. As a result, these companies would be forced to do one of two things: Either allow everything that anyone posts to remain — including horrific content like terrorist execution videos, Ku Klux Klan propaganda, etc. — or only allow approved content to be published. Given the astronomical amount of content uploaded to platforms each day (see Myth No. 3), many companies would likely opt to allow the vilest content to remain on their platforms rather than risking the myriad lawsuits and fines that could easily put them out of business.
In short, removal of Section 230 immunity does not make for more “fair” moderation practices; it removes the incentive to moderate altogether.
Yet this past June, Sen. Josh Hawley unveiled a bill entitled the “Stop Internet Censorship Act.” Under the Hawley bill, the Federal Trade Commission would audit major platforms’ moderation practices every two years to determine whether those practices were “biased against a political party, political candidate or political viewpoint.” Platforms that are not able to satisfy this standard would lose their Section 230 immunity. This would not only eliminate the incentive for these platforms to moderate their users’ content, it would effectively grant the government control over online speech.
Conclusion
For years now, many have demanded that various internet platforms “do more” in relation to content moderation. In response, large tech companies have hired thousands of content moderators to do this work. These moderators must perform a complex balancing act: They must follow the law, keep users safe, protect free speech online, and ensure that the product still thrives in the marketplace. Doing so requires moderators drown themselves in a sea of beheading videos, rape videos, and crime scenes photos for hours on end, every day. Even in-house content moderators, with good pay, and good working conditions, are plagued by the content they see on a constant basis.
Many assume that large tech companies can easily hide the worst parts of humanity that find their way onto the internet. But there is no easy solution to what is happening online. With billions of users, there will never be enough moderators to make sure everything is checked. Legal complaints and methods for reporting abuse helps to narrow it down, but even so, the task is overwhelming. As someone who once did this work, it is frustrating to watch so many politicians demand that companies “do something” without realizing the complexities involved. What’s more, many proposed solutions will not work and would instead create harmful unintended consequences.
What is happening online is a reflection on our society. Tech companies — and content moderators in particular — cannot magically fix the evil found within humanity, nor can we prevent it from finding its way online.
Can improvements be made? Certainly. This is why I left the tech world to work in the policy space. I understand these issues thanks to my first-hand experience and I want to raise awareness and advocate for intelligent change. But I can’t do it on my own. Lawmakers and the public need to understand just what content moderation is, and the consequences of tinkering with it, before drawing conclusions or making demands. (Image credit: GaudiLab)
