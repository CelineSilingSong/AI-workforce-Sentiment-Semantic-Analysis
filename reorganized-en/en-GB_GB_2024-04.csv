Businesses have sought different forms of automation and intelligent data processing for years, but generative AI has opened the floodgates of investment and enterprise interest.Formed on the back of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), which have been in the enterprise wheelhouse for many years, generative AI entered the public eye through the popularity of ChatGPT and has since come to dominate discussions in the tech sector.The relatively new approach to AI is already being used to generate detailed text and image outputs using simple user input and is increasingly integrated within business environments to automate a range of menial tasks. Generative AI has sparked interest across the business world because of the degree to which it can be personalized. With the right approach, the technology can radically improve worker productivity and help companies provide customers with far more intuitive user experiences.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProHow does generative AI work?Generative AI’ is a term that refers broadly to AI systems that are capable of producing outputs based on a prompt. These come in a few different forms that work in subtly different ways. The most popular models in use today rely on a complex artificial neural network (ANN) architecture known as a transformer.In simple terms, transformers take a prompt and output a response based on statistics and the exhaustive training process to which they have been subjected.Transformers convert inputs into context, by breaking words down into mathematical values that are used to inform a model’s output. For example, when a user inputs “Where is Microsoft’s HQ?” into a model, the transformer converts the words into ‘tokens’ of data which are combined to form a coherent ‘vector’ of context used to produce a statistically relevant output.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

The two main forms of neural networks at play here – GANs and transformers – work in slightly different ways. By and large the former is involved in creating visual and multimedia content from images and text, while the latter uses information on the internet to generate textual output.What are some examples of generative AI?Although generative AI became popular in 2022, experts have been working on the technology in theoretical and practical applications for many years.Dutch researchers wrote about the philosophical underpinnings of generative AI as far back as 2012. Indium Software, too, released a white paper [PDF] less than three years ago which highlighted not just how generative AI could be used creatively, but also in high-friction workplaces like healthcare.Transformer models rose to prominence through the research paper Attention Is All You Need and quickly became prized for the efficient and performant way in which they could be used to produce coherent AI output. This was a significant breakthrough, which fed directly into subsequent products at OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and other firms.Examples of generative AIThe generative AI market has grown incredibly quickly, to the extent that there are now innumerable LLMs and tools that rely on the technology. For many businesses and consumers alike, the standout example will still be OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Microsoft users also now have access to Copilot, the company’s AI productivity assistant, across a wide range of apps in the 365 suite, as well as within Bing search.Google’s Gemini AI family powers the company’s AI product offerings, including Google Cloud’s new Vertex AI Agents. AWS has also invested heavily in AI tools, having rolled out solutions such its chatbot for enterprise Amazon Q.AI pair programmers such as Code Llama, Gemini Code Assist, or GitHub Copilot can provide code suggestions based on a company’s private codebase or make existing cod emore efficient. These tools can also analyze code to provide user-friendly explanations of its function and produce comments, or translate it from one programming language into another.Open-source AI models are also growing in popularity. These include models from AI community Hugging Face, with models in the space rapidly approaching the sophistication of some proprietary models.In recent months, however, experts have questioned whether these models are truly open, as developers continue to impose usage restrictions on some models in their licenses. For example, open models from developers Meta and Databricks come with clauses that prohibit their use by firms with more than 700 million active monthly users, without express permission from the developers.The latest flagship models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, Meta’s Llama 3, and Anthropic’s Claude 3 are multimodal. This means they can process text, images, video, or audio as inputs and produce outputs in a variety of formats.Gemini 1.5 Pro also uses an architecture known as ‘mixture-of-experts’ (MOE), in which multiple ANNs dubbed ‘experts’ are assigned inputs based on which expert will most effectively process the input to produce an output.The MoE approach has been hailed as a cost-effective route for training compared to prohibitively expensive traditional methods. It allows for models to increase in size and effectiveness, especially for multimodal processing, and is likely to become more widely-used in future models.What are the benefits of generative AI?RELATED WHITEPAPER(Image credit: Getty Images)Discover the leading service providers in enterprise supply chain innovationPart of the reason that generative AI has seen such a boom in popularity is its ease of use relative to its power and potential. Generative AI has opened the door to far more detailed responses to natural language inputs, with LLMs able to unpick meaning from user queries and provide informed responses on its own.Through generative AI-powered chatbots, businesses can provide customers with personalized answers based on questions to improve the overall digital experience of their website.Using generative AI, enterprises can automate manual tasks such as drafting text, collating data from across different sources, or identifying anomalous details in a file or image.Summarization stands out as a major benefit of major AI, particularly when used across a company’s estate. The chief appeal of products such as Microsoft Copilot or Google’s Vertex Agents is that they can provide users with accurate answers to specific questions grounded in their company’s data. For example, a user could ask for a summary of an internal medical policy.AI code generation is another major use case for generative AI. Using an AI pair programmer, developers can speed up their workflows and focus on problems that require expert attention rather than sinking time into simpler work. The capability for these tools to translate code from one language to another has massive applications for legacy codebases, which may be written in obscure languages like COBOL. Easy code translation could save companies time and money down the line or even prevent critical outages, as experts with firsthand experience of these old languages are harder and harder to find.More recent developments have allowed generative AI models to be used for tasks such as live video analysis through computer vision, which has applications from accessibility in tech to more autonomous robots in a manufacturing environment.What are the concerns surrounding generative AI?Widespread use of generative AI has been matched with concerns over its potential risks and harms. From the earliest models in public use, it has been clear that AI has drawbacks such as ‘hallucinations’ – the term used to describe incorrect statements confidently reported by an LLM.Hallucinations are just one problem with generative AI. Leaders will need to keep up to date on the latest issues and remedies in the space as they seek to integrate it within their tech stacks, not least because of an anticipated increase in regulatory oversight of AI similar to the GDPR.Generative AI legal risksThe rapid growth of the generative AI market has led to widespread discussions over the importance of ethical AI. One of the most basic concerns when it comes to generative AI models is who owns the data used to train the models – with some developers already facing lawsuits from artists, writers, and publishing houses over the alleged use of copyrighted material for training LLMs.This is the tip of the iceberg for the legal issues of generative AI and governments around the world are progressing AI legislation to control the risks and harms that AI could pose.The AI Bill of Rights was drafted in the US in 2022, as a framework for shaping future regulation. But the US has fallen behind on AI since, having lagged behind the EU and UK's AI approach.The EU AI Act seeks to regulate AI models – inclusive of generative AI – according to their assessed risk. Businesses will need to know how their AI is being used and have a good understanding of the data used to train the models they use, or face hefty fines. Generative AI job lossesAI-linked job cuts are a major point of concern for employees and the speed and sophistication of generative AI has fanned anxieties in this space.In 2023, IBM’s CEO Arvind Krishna was forced to go into damage control mode after stating that generative AI would benefit productivity at firms at the expense of human roles. However, Microsoft found that more workers care about AI benefits than its job impacts in its 2023 Work Trend Index, emphasizing how the benefits of generative AI are being increasingly weighed up against its downsides.Job losses due to generative AI are not a given. Leaders can pursue upskilling to prevent AI cuts, insulating workers with AI skills that keep them in their roles longer.Generative AI security risksGenerative AI threats, those specifically linked to attackers misusing generative AI to launch more sophisticated attacks on victims, are a major focal point for security teams as the technology becomes widespread. Though the One risk of generative AI that’s already been widely discussed is the potential to exacerbate the rise of deepfakes. These images or videos are created in such a way that renders a lifelike imitation of a person, often a celebrity but also potentially a prominent business leader, in such a way that it can trick others.Real-time deepfakes are now becoming a more serious threat, while voice cloning tools such as Microsoft’s VALL-E or OpenAI’s Voice Engine can reproduce realistic copies of people’s voices using less than a minute of sample audio. Both could be effective weapons in a new era of social engineering.At the same time as attackers are figuring out how to use AI to enhance their attacks, AI cyber security is being used by defense teams to counter these threats in more sophisticated ways. Tools such as Microsoft Security Copilot or Gemini in Security Command Center can help identify and summarize threats, or suggest actions for effectively responding to threats.While it’s tempting to see generative AI as a malign force, given the early chaos it has sewn in the creative industries and across parts of the economy, that doesn’t mean it can’t be tamed and channeled into productive use cases. That said, there are many questions that need to be addressed first, with regulation a hot topic at the moment.

Generative artificial intelligence can help federal employees do their jobs better in certain cases, but there are risks to watch out for, according to the Office of Personnel Management.The federal HR shop issued guidance today on the Responsible Use of Generative AI, which points out some key pitfalls — as well as benefits — of using the emerging technology in federal work, such as document drafting, coding, translation, data analysis and more.First, it's important to make sure your agency has cleared employees to use GenAI apps in the workplace. Agencies have different policies about onboarding tools that assist in writing, computer coding and image generation. While these tools are often freely available over the open internet, it's up to agencies to authorize access. Some agencies may have their own enterprise GenAI tools. In any case, OPM notes, feds should ""expect that your use of GenAI technology may be logged and monitored.""Even approved tools can generate outputs that aren't suitable for public-facing or even internal use, because of the potential for copyright infringement and plagiarism, as well as the release of personal information contained in training materials used by these large language models. Additionally, OPM notes the risk ""to agency credibility if content is inaccurate, unreliable or discriminatory.""OPM urges feds to impose human checks on AI outputs before any publication or dissemination of written materials or AI-generated images. It is especially important to ""review AI-generated material for potentially biased, harmful, stereotypical, or otherwise offensive language or images,"" the guidance states. Additionally, some agencies may require some disclaimer or watermark that identifies AI-generated material. The guidance comes 180 days after the release of the Biden administration's executive order on AI. The White House noted separately that all federal agencies completed the 180-day deliverables contained in the order on schedule. These include, on the government operations front, guidance from the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs on deploying AI in the workplace, as well as multi-agency guidance on the responsible and equitable use of GenAI in public benefits programs.

The history of technology is the story of human progress. Every big advance opens up wonderful possibilities and poses pivotal questions. We all sense what a leap forward artificial intelligence (AI) could be. We’re optimistic about its potential but wary of any unintended consequences.
At first glance, music may not be the obvious place to look for signposts of AI’s future. But think of the new worlds unlocked by the inventions like the printing press, phonograph, radio and internet. Each pushed music further and faster as an art form, and proved its power to drive the adoption of new technology. Music has often been the canary in the coal mine. 


  

AI is no different. Music has already given us glimpses of what this incredible technology can do when artists are on board — whether it’s musicians permitting fans to create new songs using replicas of their voices, artists’ estates empowering posthumous biopics featuring perfect replicas of late stars, or singers who have lost their voice to illness miraculously recording again. 
At the same time, we’ve witnessed the specter of AI’s possible downside for artists: vast scraping and copying of creative works, and the rise of deep fakes where artists’ voices, faces and identities are appropriated without their consent, to depict them doing, saying, and singing things that never happened.
The starkly different positive and negative uses of AI that music is grappling with today represent two alternate versions of the future — with artists at the tip of the spear. 
Every person’s voice and image are as individual as their fingerprints and lie at the very core of their identity and livelihood. This issue of misleading deep fakes is starting to impact everyone — politicians impersonated in deep fake videos, families defrauded by voice clones pretending to be relatives, people placed into pornography without consent, and even schoolchildren victimized with their faces inserted into humiliating scenes. 
Surprisingly, there currently is no federal law that fully protects our identities from use without permission. And that must change as soon as possible.
With my experience at YouTube and Netflix and now Warner Music Group, innovation is in my DNA. However, responsible AI will depend on human beings being able to protect their identities. In order to achieve that, we need four things:


  


Consent: The use of people’s likeness and voice rights to train AI models and create output from them requires consent
Monetization: The grant of likeness and voice rights must be subject to free-market licenses

In order to operationalize consent and monetization at scale, we need: 

Attribution: AI models must identify outputs through labels and watermarks, which in turn must be recognized by all distribution platforms.
Provenance: AI developers must be required to keep sufficiently detailed, publicly available records of the material used to train their models to enable the enforcement of rights.

I am honored to be testifying on April 30 before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property to offer ideas related to Sens. Chris Coons’s (D-Del.) and Marsha Blackburn’s (R-Tenn.) NO FAKES Act proposal — which is aimed at defending the unique human identities of every American. It’s very encouraging that the No AI FRAUD Act, introduced by Reps. María Salazar (R-Fla.) and Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), enjoys bipartisan support in the House. 
These proposals would establish clear ground rules, helping to prevent a world where AI can appropriate a person’s identity without their permission. This would also have a “halo effect,” helping to curb misinformation, identity theft and hate-fueled content.



Critics will try to muddy the waters by raising supposed implications for news reporting or parodies. And any proposed legislation should expressly acknowledge the First Amendment’s broad protections — while also forbidding serious harms that fall outside them. As always, the music community will stand up for freedom of speech. 
I am excited to see what the future holds; it’s a road we need to travel thoughtfully but swiftly. Ultimately, the question isn’t where AI is taking humanity, it’s where humanity will take AI. Together, we share in that opportunity and responsibility. 
Robert Kyncl is the CEO of Warner Music Group.

Every big advance opens up wonderful possibilities and poses pivotal questions. We all sense what a leap forward artificial intelligence (AI) could be. We’re optimistic about its potential but wary of any unintended consequences. At first glance, music may not be the obvious place to look for signposts of AI’s future. But think of the new worlds unlocked by the inventions like the printing press, phonograph, radio and internet. Each pushed music further and faster as an art form, and proved its power to drive the adoption of new technology. Music has often been the canary in the coal mine.&nbsp; AI is no different. Music has already given us glimpses of what this incredible technology can do when artists are on board — whether it’s musicians permitting fans to create new songs using replicas of their voices, artists’ estates empowering posthumous biopics featuring perfect replicas of late stars, or singers who have lost their voice to illness miraculously recording again.&nbsp; At the same time, we’ve witnessed the specter of AI’s possible downside for artists: vast scraping and copying of creative works, and the rise of deep fakes where artists’ voices, faces and identities are appropriated without their consent, to depict them doing, saying, and singing things that never happened. The starkly different positive and negative uses of AI that music is grappling with today represent two alternate versions of the future — with artists at the tip of the spear.&nbsp; Every person’s voice and image are as individual as their fingerprints and lie at the very core of their identity and livelihood. This issue of misleading deep fakes is starting to impact everyone — politicians impersonated in deep fake videos, families defrauded by voice clones pretending to be relatives, people placed into pornography without consent, and even schoolchildren victimized with their faces inserted into humiliating scenes.&nbsp; Surprisingly, there currently is no federal law that fully protects our identities from use without permission.&nbsp;And that must change as soon as possible. With my experience at YouTube and Netflix and now Warner Music Group, innovation is in my DNA. However, responsible AI will depend on human beings being able to protect their identities. In order to achieve that, we need four things: In order to operationalize consent and monetization at scale, we need:&nbsp; I am honored to be testifying on April 30 before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property to offer ideas related to Sens. Chris Coons’s (D-Del.) and Marsha Blackburn’s (R-Tenn.) NO FAKES Act proposal — which is aimed at defending the unique human identities of every American. It’s very encouraging that the No AI FRAUD Act, introduced by Reps. María Salazar (R-Fla.) and Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), enjoys bipartisan support in the House.&nbsp; These proposals would establish clear ground rules, helping to prevent a world where AI can appropriate a person’s identity without their permission. This would also have a “halo effect,” helping to curb misinformation, identity theft and hate-fueled content. Critics will try to muddy the waters by raising supposed implications for news reporting or parodies. And any proposed legislation should expressly acknowledge the First Amendment’s broad protections — while also forbidding serious harms that fall outside them. As always, the music community will stand up for freedom of speech.&nbsp; I am excited to see what the future holds; it’s a road we need to travel thoughtfully but swiftly. Ultimately, the question isn’t where AI is taking humanity, it’s where humanity will take AI. Together, we share in that opportunity and responsibility.&nbsp; Robert Kyncl&nbsp;is the CEO of Warner Music Group.","['Opinion', 'Technology']","[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': ""The Hill's Headlines – April 30, 2024"", 'description': 'EDUCATION\r\nAnti-War\xa0protesters take over\xa0a building on the campus of\xa0Columbia University\r\n\xa0\r\nCOURT BATTLES\r\nTestimony resumes in\xa0Hush money\xa0trial as\xa0judge rules Trump violated gag order, warns of jail time\r\n\xa0\r\nCAMPAIGN\r\nPoll: President Biden trails Donald Trump in Seven Swing States\r\n\xa0\r\nSTATE WATCH\r\n4 officers killed, 4 others wounded in shootout at Charlotte, NC, home\r\n\xa0\r\nECONOMY\r\nHigher-than-expected wages, benefits in Q1 could delay Fed rate cuts', 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://c104216-ucdn.mp.lura.live/expiretime=2082787200/17724041bf1cdc242b8950fd8ac7540335bdae2d6d273e1b119c3a44fcea5f96//hill/vupl_lin/FAD/8BD/FAD8BD6E44CA60E63FE681800E6E6299-0-1714497767297_160x90.jpg', 'contentUrl': '', 'uploadDate': '2024-04-30T12:22:00-04:00', 'duration': 'P0DT0H1M0S'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From automating complex analysis to simulating scenarios that assist in decision-making, GenAI use cases are making a big impact across a broad swath of industries, including financial services, consultancies, information technology, legal, telecommunication and more.Certainly, organizations recognize GenAI's potential with the increasing adoption of AI within organizations. According to a PWC survey, 73% of U.S. companies have adopted AI in some areas of their business. Yet, discussion persists about GenAI’s role within the workplace, given fears over job displacement, bias, decision-making transparency and more. Despite this, GenAI has made AI technology much more accessible to employees within organizations, regardless of their specific roles.In fact, a LexisNexis Future of Work survey showed that 72% of professionals anticipate a positive impact from GenAI, and only 4% see it as a threat to job security. GenAI can automate mundane tasks, allowing users to focus on more specialized, impactful and strategic tasks. This, in turn, can increase employee productivity and job satisfaction while ensuring human ambition and innovation walk hand in hand.AI’s Productivity BoostGenAI's rapid rise marks a crucial shift in how organizations must operate and strategize to augment every role. GenAI applications are as diverse as they are impactful. It’s not just hype; GenAI is already poised to increase labor productivity by 0.1 to 0.6% annually through 2040.GenAI has also created value across multiple sectors and industries. Significant business functions, including Sales, Marketing, Customer Operations and Technology have leveraged GenAI to increase productivity. In technology, for example, GenAI-based coding assistants are a massive help to software developers in suggesting code snippets, refactoring code, fixing bugs, understanding complex code, writing unit tests, documentation and creating complete end-to-end applications.As employees experiment and explore with GenAI tools, their comfort level with the technology increases. Eighty-six percent of professionals ‘agree' or ‘strongly agree' with a willingness to embrace GenAI for both creative and professional work. Sixty-eight percent of employees plan to use GenAI tools for work purposes, while 69% are already using these tools to assist with daily tasks. The data makes it clear that organizations that adopt GenAI can boost productivity, and employees are willing to use it to accelerate efficiency.Productivity Gains Are a Given, But Also AI Helps with Job SatisfactionOne of the most significant opportunities around GenAI lies in its power to help with job satisfaction. While professionals have fairly balanced expectations on how far adoption will go, 82% expect generative AI to take over a range of repetitive administrative tasks by automating routine tasks and data analysis, freeing them to focus on more strategic aspects of their work.When asked how they perceive GenAI's role in the work environment, more than two-thirds of professionals see it as a ‘helpful tool' or ‘supportive co-worker.' As a result, they recognize AI's potential to enhance, not hinder, job performance and are embracing it with a positive mindset toward eliminating repetitive tasks and freeing up time for more rewarding, higher-value work.Most professionals do not see generative AI as a detriment to job satisfaction, either. Over half (51%) say job satisfaction has improved significantly or moderately thanks to GenAI, while only 10% felt that it decreases job satisfaction. A fundamental rethink is necessary where and how organizations implement GenAI tools within the workplace.Recommendations to Improve Engagement and Job SatisfactionOrganizations need to consider employee engagement throughout the adoption process of GenAI tools. Here are some recommendations to improve engagement and thereby increase job satisfaction:Engage your employees to identify the use cases that are most impactful for a particular role or group. Pick tasks that are most time-consuming and tedious, such that solving them would free up time to focus on more critical items.Identify the GenAI tools and large language models (LLMs) that are most effective for solving the identified use case. Take the time to experiment, test and validate the output. Ensure that you account for a diverse set of inputs for the use case and measure the output quality, including the hallucination rate, to help build trust within your employee base using the solution.Provide training to your team. Take advantage of the vast information available on the web, with videos, code samples, tool vendor resources and tutorials on using the specific tool, LLM, associated prompts and guardrails. Create mentors and experts within the team to help coach the rest. Showcase examples of lessons learned and success stories to inspire team members who may not see the value.Identify and measure KPIs. These could include adoption, productivity gains, costs saved or repurposed, employee satisfaction, quality improvement and other KPIs that may be specific to the team or business.Gen AI isn't just for technologists anymore; it's making potent tools accessible to everyone. Most business professionals who once viewed these technologies with skepticism now accept and even welcome them. And it's no secret why, given GenAI's power to present organizations and employees alike with unprecedented opportunities toward the future of work.

With both established tech enterprises and smaller AI startups vying for the next generative AI breakthrough, future prospects for generative AI are changing as rapidly as the technology itself. For better understand its future, this guide provides a snapshot of generative AI’s past and present, along with a deep dive into what the years ahead likely hold for generative AI.

Generative AI’s Future: 8 Predictions
Looking ahead, expect to see generative AI trends focused on three main pools: quick and sweeping technological advances, faster-than-expected digital transformations, and increasing emphasis on the societal and global impact of artificial intelligence. These specific predictions and growing trends are most likely on the horizon:
1. Growth in Multimodality
Multimodality — the idea that a generative AI tool is designed to accept inputs and generate outputs in multiple formats — is starting to become a top priority for consumers, and AI vendors are taking notice.
OpenAI was one of the first to provide multimodal model access to users through GPT-4, and Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude 3 are some of the major models that have followed suit. So far though, most AI companies have not made multimodal models publicly available; even many who now offer multimodal models have significant limitations on possible inputs and outputs.
In the near future, multimodal generative AI is likely to become less of a unique selling point and more of a consumer expectation of generative AI models, at least in all paid LLM subscriptions.
Additionally, expect multimodal modeling itself to grow in complexity and accuracy to meet consumer demands for an all-in-one tool. This may look like improving the quality of image and non-text outputs or adding better capabilities and features for things like videos, file attachments (as Claude has already done), and internet search widgets (as Gemini has already done).
ChatGPT currently enables users to work with text (including code), voice, and image inputs and outputs, but there are no video input or output capabilities built into ChatGPT. This may change soon, as OpenAI is experimenting with Sora, its new text-to-video generation tool, and will likely embed some of its capabilities into ChatGPT as they have done with DALL-E.
Similarly, while Google’s Gemini currently supports text, code, image, and voice inputs and outputs, there are major limitations on image possibilities, as the tool is currently unable to generate images with people. Google seems to be actively working on this limitation behind the scenes, leading me to believe that it will go away soon.
With my free Google Gemini account, I can generate fairly accurate image results based on my prompts. I can also attach images to my prompts and have Gemini explain the image or frame its responses around the image and text I submit. GPT-4, Gemini, and a growing number of other generative AI models are offering multimodal content generation capabilities to their customers; expect this to be more commonplace in the coming months. Source: Shelby Hiter via Gemini.
The first image Gemini generated was accurate but somewhat incomplete. With further prompting, I was able to get a more accurate assortment of images to choose from. As image and multimodal models continue to mature, I expect this level of results — or better — to come through in the first round of prompting in most cases. Source: Shelby Hiter via Gemini.
2. Wider Adoption of AI as a Service
AI as a service is already growing in popularity across artificial intelligence and machine learning business use cases, but it is only just beginning to take off for generative AI.
However, as the adoption rate of generative AI technology continues to increase, many more businesses are going to start feeling the pain of falling behind their competitors. When this happens, the companies that are unable or unwilling to invest in the infrastructure to build their own AI models and internal AI teams will likely turn to consultants and managed services firms that specialize in generative AI and have experience with their industry or project type.
Specifically, watch as AI modeling as a service (AIMaaS) grows its market share. More AI companies are going to work toward public offerings of customizable, lightweight, and/or open-source models to extend their reach to new audiences. Generative AI-as-a-service initiatives may also focus heavily on the support framework businesses need to do generative AI well. This will naturally lead to more companies specializing and other companies investing in AI governance and AI security management services, for example.
3. Movement Toward AGI and Related Research
Artificial general intelligence, which is the concept of AI reaching the point where it can outperform humans in most taskwork and critical thinking assignments, is a major buzzword among AI companies today, but so far, it’s little more than that.
Google’s Deepmind is one of the leaders in defining and innovating in this area, along with OpenAI, Meta, Adept AI, and others. At this point, there’s not much agreement on what AGI is, what it will look like, and how AI leaders will know if they’ve reached the point of AGI or not.
So far, most of the research and work on AGI has happened in silos. In the future, AGI will continue to be an R&D priority, but much like other important tech and AI initiatives of the past, it will likely become more collaborative, if for no other reason than to develop a consistent definition and framework for the concept. While AI leaders may not achieve true AGI or anything close to it in the coming years, generative AI will continue to creep closer to this goal while AI companies work to more clearly define it.

4. Significant Workforce Disruption and Reformation
Most experts and tech leaders agree that generative AI is going to significantly change what the workforce and workplace look like, but they’re torn on whether this will be a net positive or net negative for the employees themselves.
In this early stage of workforce impact, generative AI is primarily supporting office workers with automation, AI-powered content and recommendations, analytics, and other resources to help them get through their more mundane and routine tasks. Though there is some skepticism both at the organizational and employee levels, new users continue to discover generative AI’s ability to help them with work like drafting and sending emails, preparing reports, and creating interesting content for social media, all of which saves them time for higher-level strategic work.
Even with these more simplistic use cases, generative AI has already shown its nascent potential to completely change the way we work across industries, sectors, departments, and roles. Early predictions expected generative AI would mostly handle assembly line, manufacturing, and other physical labor work, but to this point, generative AI has made its most immediate and far-reaching impacts on creative, clerical, and customer service tasks and roles.
Workers such as marketers, salespeople, designers, developers, customer service agents, office managers, and assistants are already feeling the effects of this technological innovation and fear that they will eventually lose their jobs to generative AI. Indeed, most experts agree that these jobs and others will not look the same as they do now in just a couple of years. But there are mixed opinions about what the “refactored” workforce will look like for these people — will their job simply change or will it be eliminated entirely?
With all of these unknowns and fears hanging in the air, workplaces and universities are currently working on offering coursework, generative AI certifications, and training programs for professional usage of AI and generative AI. Undergraduate and graduate programs of AI study are beginning to pop up, and in the coming months and years, this degree path may become as common as those in data science or computer science.
5. Increasing Regulatory, Ethical, and Societal Pressures
In March 2024, the EU AI Act that had been discussed and reviewed for several years was officially approved by the EU Parliament. Over the coming months and years, organizations that use AI in the EU or in connection with EU citizen data will be held to this new regulation and its stipulations.
This is the first major regulation to focus on generative AI and its impact on data privacy, but as consumer and societal concerns grow; don’t expect it to be the last. There are already state regulations in California, Virginia, and Colorado, and several industries have their own frameworks and rules for how generative AI can be used.
On a global scale, the United Nations has begun to discuss the importance of AI governance, international collaboration and cooperation, and responsible AI development and deployment through established global frameworks. While it’s unlikely that this will turn into an enforceable global regulation, it is a significant conversation that will likely frame different countries’ and regions’ approaches to ethical AI and regulation.
6. Bigger Emphasis on Security, Privacy, and Governance
More tools like Watson’s OpenScale are likely to pop up independently or as part of generative AI solutions packages as a growing number of business leaders and consumers demand improved AI explainability, transparency, privacy, and overall governance. Source: IBM.
With the regulations already in place and expected to come in the future, not to mention public demand, AI companies and the businesses that use this technology will soon invest more heavily in AI governance technologies, services, and policies, as well as security resources that directly address generative AI vulnerabilities.
A small number of companies are focused on improving their AI governance posture, but as AI usage and fears grow, this will become a greater necessity. Companies will begin to use dedicated AI governance and security platforms on a greater scale, human-in-the-loop AI model and content review will become the standard, and all companies that use generative AI in any capacity will operate with some kind of AI policy to protect against major liabilities and damage.
7. Greater Focus on Quality and Hallucination Management
As governments, regulatory bodies, businesses, and users uncover dangerous, stolen, inaccurate, or otherwise poor results in the content created through generative AI, they’ll continue to put pressure on AI companies to improve their data sourcing and training processes, output quality, and hallucination management strategies.
While an emphasis on quality outcomes is part of many AI companies’ current strategies, this approach and transparency with the public will only expand to help AI leaders maintain reputations and market share.
So what will generative AI quality management look like? Some of today’s leaders are providing hints for the future.
For example, with each generation of its models, OpenAI has improved its accuracy and reduced the frequency of AI hallucinations. In addition to actually doing this work, they’ve also provided detailed documentation and research data to show how their models are working and improving over time.
On a different note, Google’s Gemini already has a fairly comprehensive feedback management system for users, where they can easily give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down with additional feedback sent to Google. They can also modify responses, report legal issues, and double-check generated content against internet sources with a simple click.
These features provide users with the assurance that their feedback matters, which is a win on all sides: Users feel good about the product and Google gets regular user-generated feedback about how their tool is performing.
In a matter of months, I expect to see more generative AI companies adopt this kind of approach for better community-driven quality assurance in generative AI.
8. Widespread Embedded AI for Better Customer Experiences
Many companies are already embedding generative AI into their enterprise and customer-facing tools to improve internal workflows and external user experiences. This is most commonly happening with established generative AI models, like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, which are frequently getting embedded as-is or are being incorporated into users’ preexisting apps, websites, and chatbots.
Expect to see this embedded generative AI approach as an almost-universal part of online experience management in the coming years. Customers will come to expect that generative AI is a core part of their search experiences and will deprioritize the tools that cannot provide tailored answers and recommendations as they research, shop, and plan experiences for themselves.

Generative AI’s Recent Past Suggests Its Future
With how much has happened in the world of generative AI, it’s hard to believe that most people weren’t talking about this technology until OpenAI first launched ChatGPT in November 2022. Many of generative AI’s greatest milestones were reached in 2023, as OpenAI and other hopeful AI startups — not to mention leading cloud companies and other technology companies — raced to develop the highest-quality models and the most compelling use cases for the technology.
Below, we’ve quickly summarized some of generative AI’s biggest developments in 2023, looking both at significant technological advancements and societal impacts:

Continued growth and reshuffling of AI startups: Dozens of generative AI startups opened, closed, rebranded, or partnered with larger tech companies. This constant shuffling continues today.
AI virtual assistants and copilots: Though GitHub Copilot has been around in some form since 2021, most of the Microsoft Copilot technology and other copilots that are being released today first emerged in 2023. These built-in work assistants can help with content generation, enterprise search, coding, data analysis, and more.
LLM-driven search and content generation: Though large language models did not first appear in 2023, the variety and capabilities that we see now mostly developed in 2023. Throughout this past year, vendors have continued to improve models’ transparency, explainability, accuracy, and connectivity with the internet for better and more comprehensive results.
User-friendly and affordable interfaces: A growing number of AI vendors have released free or low-cost versions of their generative AI tools in packages that are not just for business use. For example, Inflection released Pi — a generative AI companion that focuses on human-like conversational AI — in May 2023. Additionally, vendors continue to expand their tools’ usability in mobile and lightweight interfaces that all users can access.
High-powered models with a new focus on multimodality: ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are all top examples of generative AI models that came out with new versions in 2023 that could handle multimodal requests.
Increasing noise about regulations on the horizon: The EU AI Act was first brought forward in 2021, but as it moved through committees and was discussed over the following years, it increased discussions about generative AI regulations and ethics throughout the course of 2023.

Generative AI: The Current Landscape
The generative AI landscape has transformed significantly over the past several months, and it’s poised to continue at this rapid pace. What we’ve covered below is a snapshot of what’s happening with generative AI in early 2024; expect many of these details to shift or change soon, as that has been the nature of the generative AI landscape so far.
Though it has not been widely adopted in many industries, generative AI continues to build its reputation and gain important footholds with both professional and recreational user bases. These are some of the main ways generative AI is being used today:

Personal and recreational LLM usage for simple questions, conversational AI, research support, etc.
Coding and software development, with an emphasis on code completion and quality assurance reviews.
E-commerce and inventory management.
Customer and online experience management (shopping, travel planning, research support, etc.).

Consumer Trust and Ethical Considerations
According to Forrester’s December 2023 Consumer Pulse Survey results, “only 29% agreed that they would trust information from gen AI” and “45% of online adults agreed that gen AI poses a serious threat to society.” In the same results, though, 50% believed that this technology could also help them to find the information they need more effectively.
Clearly, public sentiment on generative AI is currently very mixed. In North America, in particular, there’s excitement and interest in the technology, with more users experimenting with generative AI tools than in most other parts of the globe. However, even among those with enthusiasm for generative AI, there is a general caution about data security, ethics, and the general trust gap that comes with a lack of transparency, misuse and abuse possibilities like deepfakes, and fears about future job security.
To earn consumer trust, more ethical AI measures must be taken at the regulatory and company levels. The EU AI Act, which recently passed into law, is a great step in this direction, as it specifies banned apps and use cases, obligations for high-risk systems, transparency obligations, and more to ensure private data is protected. However, it is also the responsibility of AI companies and businesses that use AI to be transparent, ethical, and responsible beyond what this regulation requires.
Taking steps toward more ethical AI will not only bolster their reputation and customer base but also put in place safeguards to prevent harmful AI from taking over in the future.

Strategies for Navigating the Future of Generative AI
Generative AI is clearly here to stay, regardless of whether your business chooses to incorporate this technology. The key to working with generative AI without letting it overrun your business priorities is to go in with well-defined effective AI strategies and clear-cut goals for using AI in a beneficial way. Some of these strategies may help:
Create an AI Strategy Specific to Your Business
This strategy should explain what technologies can be used, who can use them, how they can be used, and more. Keep strategies and policies both flexible and iterative as technologies, priorities, and regulations change.
Support Employees Through Role and Workplace Transitions
At the rate generative AI innovation is moving, there’s little doubt that existing jobs will be uprooted or transformed entirely. To support your workforce and ease some of this stress, be the type of employer that offers upskilling and training resources that will help staffers — and your company — in the long run.
Think Globally and Collaboratively
If you’re in a position of power or influence, consider doing work to mitigate the increasing global inequities that are likely to come from widespread generative AI adoption.
Partner with firms in developing countries, work toward generative AI innovations that benefit people and the planet, and support multilingual solutions and data training that are globally unbiased.
In general, partnering with leaders in other countries and organizations will lead to better technology and outcomes for all.
Embrace AI Innovations With Caution
Especially in the pursuit of AGI, be cautious about how you use generative AI and how these tools interact with your data and intellectual property. While generative AI has massive positive potential, the same can be said for its potential to do harm. Pay attention to how generative AI innovations are transpiring and don’t be afraid to hold AI companies accountable for a more responsible AI approach.
Bottom Line: Preparing for the Future of Generative AI
Generative AI has already proven its remarkable potential to reshape industries, economies, and societies even more than initially thought. Research firms and technology companies are continually adjusting their predictions for the future of generative AI, realizing that the technology may be able to take on more of the physical taskwork and cognitive work that human workers do — and by a much earlier date — than previously assumed.
But with this incredible technological development should come a heavy dose of caution and careful planning. Generative AI developers and users alike must consider the ethical implications of this technology and continue to do the work to keep it transparent, explainable, and aligned with public preferences and opinions for how this technology should be used. They must also consider some of the more far-reaching consequences — such as greater global disparities between the rich and the poor and more damage to the environment — and look for creative ways to create generative AI that truly does more good than harm.
So what’s the best way forward toward a hopeful future for generative AI? Collaboration. AI leaders, users, and skeptics from all over the globe, different lines of work, and different areas of expertise must collaboratively navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by generative AI to ensure a future that benefits all.

How can MIT’s community leverage generative AI to support learning and work on campus and beyond?
At MIT’s Festival of Learning 2024, faculty and instructors, students, staff, and alumni exchanged perspectives about the digital tools and innovations they’re experimenting with in the classroom. Panelists agreed that generative AI should be used to scaffold — not replace — learning experiences.
This annual event, co-sponsored by MIT Open Learning and the Office of the Vice Chancellor, celebrates teaching and learning innovations. When introducing new teaching and learning technologies, panelists stressed the importance of iteration and teaching students how to develop critical thinking skills while leveraging technologies like generative AI.
“The Festival of Learning brings the MIT community together to explore and celebrate what we do every day in the classroom,” said Christopher Capozzola, senior associate dean for open learning. “This year's deep dive into generative AI was reflective and practical — yet another remarkable instance of ‘mind and hand’ here at the Institute.”

            2024 Festival of Learning: Highlights        

    



Incorporating generative AI into learning experiences 
MIT faculty and instructors aren’t just willing to experiment with generative AI — some believe it’s a necessary tool to prepare students to be competitive in the workforce. “In a future state, we will know how to teach skills with generative AI, but we need to be making iterative steps to get there instead of waiting around,” said Melissa Webster, lecturer in managerial communication at MIT Sloan School of Management. 
Some educators are revisiting their courses’ learning goals and redesigning assignments so students can achieve the desired outcomes in a world with AI. Webster, for example, previously paired written and oral assignments so students would develop ways of thinking. But, she saw an opportunity for teaching experimentation with generative AI. If students are using tools such as ChatGPT to help produce writing, Webster asked, “how do we still get the thinking part in there?”
One of the new assignments Webster developed asked students to generate cover letters through ChatGPT and critique the results from the perspective of future hiring managers. Beyond learning how to refine generative AI prompts to produce better outputs, Webster shared that “students are thinking more about their thinking.” Reviewing their ChatGPT-generated cover letter helped students determine what to say and how to say it, supporting their development of higher-level strategic skills like persuasion and understanding audiences.
Takako Aikawa, senior lecturer at the MIT Global Studies and Languages Section, redesigned a vocabulary exercise to ensure students developed a deeper understanding of the Japanese language, rather than just right or wrong answers. Students compared short sentences written by themselves and by ChatGPT and developed broader vocabulary and grammar patterns beyond the textbook. “This type of activity enhances not only their linguistic skills but stimulates their metacognitive or analytical thinking,” said Aikawa. “They have to think in Japanese for these exercises.”
While these panelists and other Institute faculty and instructors are redesigning their assignments, many MIT undergraduate and graduate students across different academic departments are leveraging generative AI for efficiency: creating presentations, summarizing notes, and quickly retrieving specific ideas from long documents. But this technology can also creatively personalize learning experiences. Its ability to communicate information in different ways allows students with different backgrounds and abilities to adapt course material in a way that’s specific to their particular context. 
Generative AI, for example, can help with student-centered learning at the K-12 level. Joe Diaz, program manager and STEAM educator for MIT pK-12 at Open Learning, encouraged educators to foster learning experiences where the student can take ownership. “Take something that kids care about and they’re passionate about, and they can discern where [generative AI] might not be correct or trustworthy,” said Diaz.
Panelists encouraged educators to think about generative AI in ways that move beyond a course policy statement. When incorporating generative AI into assignments, the key is to be clear about learning goals and open to sharing examples of how generative AI could be used in ways that align with those goals. 
The importance of critical thinking
Although generative AI can have positive impacts on educational experiences, users need to understand why large language models might produce incorrect or biased results. Faculty, instructors, and student panelists emphasized that it’s critical to contextualize how generative AI works. “[Instructors] try to explain what goes on in the back end and that really does help my understanding when reading the answers that I’m getting from ChatGPT or Copilot,” said Joyce Yuan, a senior in computer science. 
Jesse Thaler, professor of physics and director of the National Science Foundation Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions, warned about trusting a probabilistic tool to give definitive answers without uncertainty bands. “The interface and the output needs to be of a form that there are these pieces that you can verify or things that you can cross-check,” Thaler said.
When introducing tools like calculators or generative AI, the faculty and instructors on the panel said it’s essential for students to develop critical thinking skills in those particular academic and professional contexts. Computer science courses, for example, could permit students to use ChatGPT for help with their homework if the problem sets are broad enough that generative AI tools wouldn’t capture the full answer. However, introductory students who haven’t developed the understanding of programming concepts need to be able to discern whether the information ChatGPT generated was accurate or not.
Ana Bell, senior lecturer of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and MITx digital learning scientist, dedicated one class toward the end of the semester of Course 6.100L (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python) to teach students how to use ChatGPT for programming questions. She wanted students to understand why setting up generative AI tools with the context for programming problems, inputting as many details as possible, will help achieve the best possible results. “Even after it gives you a response back, you have to be critical about that response,” said Bell. By waiting to introduce ChatGPT until this stage, students were able to look at generative AI’s answers critically because they had spent the semester developing the skills to be able to identify whether problem sets were incorrect or might not work for every case. 
A scaffold for learning experiences
The bottom line from the panelists during the Festival of Learning was that generative AI should provide scaffolding for engaging learning experiences where students can still achieve desired learning goals. The MIT undergraduate and graduate student panelists found it invaluable when educators set expectations for the course about when and how it’s appropriate to use AI tools. Informing students of the learning goals allows them to understand whether generative AI will help or hinder their learning. Student panelists asked for trust that they would use generative AI as a starting point, or treat it like a brainstorming session with a friend for a group project. Faculty and instructor panelists said they will continue iterating their lesson plans to best support student learning and critical thinking. 
Panelists from both sides of the classroom discussed the importance of generative AI users being responsible for the content they produce and avoiding automation bias — trusting the technology’s response implicitly without thinking critically about why it produced that answer and whether it’s accurate. But since generative AI is built by people making design decisions, Thaler told students, “You have power to change the behavior of those tools.”

EU and Japan strengthen joint work on digital identity, semiconductors, and artificial intelligence






Thierry Breton @ThierryBreton 








The EU and Japan held their second Digital Partnership Council in Brussels on April 30. Thierry Breton, the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Taro Kono, the Japanese Minister for Digital Transformation, co-chaired the Council along with Takeaki Matsumoto, the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, and Taku Ishii, the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry.
During the meeting, the EU and Japan reaffirmed the significance of their strategic partnership to promote shared values and a vision for digital transformation that prioritises people and fundamental rights. Both parties also acknowledged the successful implementation of the Digital Partnership and reviewed the progress made since the first Digital Partnership Council in 2023. They agreed on a list of new deliverables to further cooperate on core digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, 6G, semiconductors, high-performance computing (HPC), and quantum technology. The two countries also aim to strengthen data and platform economy collaboration, submarine cables, eID, and cybersecurity.
The EU and Japan are among the most significant digital economies in the world. They launched the first-ever Digital Partnership on May 12 2022, during the 29th Japan-EU summit in Tokyo. The partnership aims to advance Cooperation on digital issues primarily through collaborative research on cutting-edge technologies, regulatory dialogue and convergence, and shaping common positions in international fora. The EU-Japan Digital Partnership is part of the EU’s strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, which aims to strengthen the EU’s partnerships in Asia. 
The EU and Japan signed a Memorandum of Cooperation
The European Union and Japan signed a Memorandum of Cooperation to collaborate on digital identities and trust services. The agreement will promote a shared understanding of digital identity initiatives between the two countries, which will benefit e-commerce and business opportunities by increasing efficiency and reducing bureaucracy. The Memorandum aims to facilitate data-free flow with trust through Cooperation and use cases based on the EU Digital Identity Wallet and trust services. It is expected to be presented as a “joint best practice” at the next OECD Ministerial meeting scheduled for May 2-3, 2024.
Furthermore, in semiconductors, the EU and Japan established a team of experts to develop a research programme to implement the Memorandum of Cooperation signed in July 2023. They are also preparing an administrative arrangement to foster the exchange of information on public support schemes. 
The EU and Japan will continue their joint work on high-performance computing (HPC) and have identified hybrid quantum-HPC applications to further cooperate. They will also consider topics for joint projects in basic quantum research. The two partners are also exploring Cooperation on cybersecurity, including standards and ways to address the skills gap. 
Regarding 6G technologies, the EU and Japan have launched collaborative research projects and intend to support global standardisation initiatives, which are crucial in developing 6G technologies. Both parties reaffirmed their shared vision for open and resilient networks.
The EU and Japan also announced their intention to enhance Cooperation between the EU AI Office and Japan’s AI Safety Institute. They will continue supporting the G7 Hiroshima AI Process and Code of Conduct to shape trustworthy AI global governance. The EU also encouraged Japanese companies to participate in the AI Pact launched by the Commission to foster early compliance with key provisions of the AI Act voluntarily before it enters into force and becomes generally applicable. 
The EU and Japan confirmed the importance of deploying secure and resilient submarine cable infrastructures in line with the Memorandum of Cooperation on submarine cables for secure, resilient, and sustainable global connectivity signed on July 3, 2023, between the European Commission and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Both parties will continue Cooperation on developing direct connectivity links between Europe and Japan, such as via the Arctic, to bring forward commercial opportunities, trusted cross-border data flows, and oceanographic research.
Lastly, to ensure a safe online environment where freedom of expression is guaranteed, the EU and Japan agreed to explore establishing a regular information-sharing channel on online platform regulations, such as the European Digital Services and Digital Markets Acts. 
The parties will meet in Tokyo, Japan, 2025 for the next Digital Partnership Council.

At AWS re:Invent 2023, we previewed Amazon Q Business, a generative artificial intelligence (generative AI)–powered assistant that can answer questions, provide summaries, generate content, and securely complete tasks based on data and information in your enterprise systems.
With Amazon Q Business, you can deploy a secure, private, generative AI assistant that empowers your organization’s users to be more creative, data-driven, efficient, prepared, and productive. During the preview, we heard lots of customer feedback and used that feedback to prioritize our enhancements to the service.
Today, we are announcing the general availability of Amazon Q Business with many new features, including custom plugins, and a preview of Amazon Q Apps, generative AI–powered customized and sharable applications using natural language in a single step for your organization.
In this blog post, I will briefly introduce the key features of Amazon Q Business with the new features now available and take a look at the features of Amazon Q Apps. Let’s get started!
Introducing Amazon Q Business Amazon Q Business connects seamlessly to over 40 popular enterprise data sources and stores document and permission information, including Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Microsoft 365, and Salesforce. It ensures that you access content securely with existing credentials using single sign-on, according to your permissions, and also includes enterprise-level access controls.

Amazon Q Business makes it easy for users to get answers to questions like company policies, products, business results, or code, using its web-based chat assistant. You can point Amazon Q Business at your enterprise data repositories, and it’ll search across all data, summarize logically, analyze trends, and engage in dialog with users.
With Amazon Q Business, you can build secure and private generative AI assistants with enterprise-grade access controls at scale. You can also use administrative guardrails, document enrichment, and relevance tuning to customize and control responses that are consistent with your company’s guidelines.
Here are the key features of Amazon Q Business with new features now available:
End-user web experience With the built-in web experience, you can ask a question, receive a response, and then ask follow-up questions and add new information with in-text source citations while keeping the context from the previous answer. You can only get a response from data sources that you have access to.

With general availability, we’re introducing a new content creation mode in the web experience. In this mode, Amazon Q Business does not use or access the enterprise content but instead uses generative AI models built into Amazon Q Business for creative use cases such as summarization of responses and crafting personalized emails. To use the content creation mode, you can turn off Respond from approved sources in the conversation settings.

To learn more, visit Using an Amazon Q Business web experience and Customizing an Amazon Q Business web experience in the AWS documentation.
Pre-built data connectors and plugins You can connect, index, and sync your enterprise data using over 40 pre-built data connectors or an Amazon Kendra retriever, as well as web crawling or uploading your documents directly.
Amazon Q Business ingests content using a built-in semantic document retriever. It also retrieves and respects permission information such as access control lists (ACLs) to allow it to manage access to the data after retrieval. When the data is ingested, your data is secured with the Service-managed key of AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

You can configure plugins to perform actions in enterprise systems, including Jira, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. Users can create a Jira issue or a Salesforce case while chatting in the chat assistant. You can also deploy a Microsoft Teams gateway or a Slack gateway to use an Amazon Q Business assistant in your teams or channels.
With general availability, you can build custom plugins to connect to any third-party application through APIs so that users can use natural language prompts to perform actions such as submitting time-off requests or sending meeting invites directly through Amazon Q Business assistant. Users can also search real-time data, such as time-off balances, scheduled meetings, and more.

When you choose Custom plugin, you can define an OpenAPI schema to connect your third-party application. You can upload the OpenAPI schema to Amazon S3 or copy it to the Amazon Q Business console in-line schema editor compatible with the Swagger OpenAPI specification.

To learn more, visit Data source connectors and Configure plugins in the AWS documentation.
Admin control and guardrails You can configure global controls to give users the option to either generate large language model (LLM)-only responses or generate responses from connected data sources. You can specify whether all chat responses will be generated using only enterprise data or whether your application can also use its underlying LLM to generate responses when it can’t find answers in your enterprise data. You can also block specific words.
With topic-level controls, you can specify restricted topics and configure behavior rules in response to the topics, such as answering using enterprise data or blocking completely.

To learn more, visit Admin control and guardrails in the AWS documentation.
You can alter document metadata or attributes and content during the document ingestion process by configuring basic logic to specify a metadata field name, select a condition, and enter or select a value and target actions, such as update or delete. You can also use AWS Lambda functions to manipulate document fields and content, such as using optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from images.

To learn more, visit Document attributes and types in Amazon Q Business and Document enrichment in Amazon Q Business in the AWS documentation.
Enhanced enterprise-grade security and management Starting April 30, you will need to use AWS IAM Identity Center for user identity management of all new applications rather than using the legacy identity management. You can securely connect your workforce to Amazon Q Business applications either in the web experience or your own interface.

You can also centrally manage workforce access using IAM Identity Center alongside your existing IAM roles and policies. As the number of your accounts scales, IAM Identity Center gives you the option to use it as a single place to manage user access to all your applications. To learn more, visit Setting up Amazon Q Business with IAM Identity Center in the AWS documentation.
At general availability, Amazon Q Business is now integrated with various AWS services to securely connect and store the data and easily deploy and track access logs.
You can use AWS PrivateLink to access Amazon Q Business securely in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) environment using a VPC endpoint. You can use the Amazon Q Business template for AWS CloudFormation to easily automate the creation and provisioning of infrastructure resources. You can also use AWS CloudTrail to record actions taken by a user, role, or AWS service in Amazon Q Business.
Also, we support Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) endpoints, based on the United States and Canadian government standards and security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information.
To learn more, visit Security in Amazon Q Business and Monitoring Amazon Q Business in the AWS documentation.
Build and share apps with new Amazon Q Apps (preview) Today we are announcing the preview of Amazon Q Apps, a new capability within Amazon Q Business for your organization’s users to easily and quickly create generative AI-powered apps based on company data, without requiring any prior coding experience.
With Amazon Q Apps, users simply describe the app they want, in natural language, or they can take an existing conversation where Amazon Q Business helped them solve a problem. With a few clicks, Amazon Q Business will instantly generate an app that accomplishes their desired task that can be easily shared across their organization.
If you are familiar with PartyRock, you can easily use this code-free builder with the added benefit of connecting it to your enterprise data already with Amazon Q Business.
To create a new Amazon Q App, choose Apps in your web experience and enter a simple text expression for a task in the input box. You can try out samples, such as a content creator, interview question generator, meeting note summarizer, and grammar checker.
I will make a document assistant to review and correct a document using the following prompt:

You are a professional editor tasked with reviewing and correcting a document for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and inconsistencies in style and tone. Given a file, your goal is to recommend changes to ensure that the document adheres to the highest standards of writing while preserving the author’s original intent and meaning. You should provide a numbered list for all suggested revisions and the supporting reason.


When you choose the Generate button, a document editing assistant app will be automatically generated with two cards—one to upload a document file as an input and another text output card that gives edit suggestions.

When you choose the Add card button, you can add more cards, such as a user input, text output, file upload, or pre-configured plugin by your administrator. If you want to create a Jira ticket to request publishing a post in the corporate blog channel as an author, you can add a Jira Plugin with the result of edited suggestions from the uploaded file.

Once you are ready to share the app, choose the Publish button. You can securely share this app to your organization’s catalog for others to use, enhancing productivity. Your colleagues can choose shared apps, modify them, and publish their own versions to the organizational catalog instead of starting from scratch.

Choose Library to see all of the published Amazon Q Apps. You can search the catalog by labels and open your favorite apps.

Amazon Q Apps inherit robust security and governance controls from Amazon Q Business, including user authentication and access controls, which empower organizations to safely share apps across functions that warrant governed collaboration and innovation.
In the administrator console, you can see your Amazon Q Apps and control or remove them from the library.

To learn more, visit Amazon Q Apps in the AWS documentation.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Artificial intelligence is a double-edged sword when it comes to cybersecurity — and will be a core driver of demand for new cybersecurity professionals, according to the keynote speaker at an event organized by the Washington State Cybersecurity Center of Excellence.
Generative AI, said Jim Reavis, CEO of the nonprofit Cloud Security Alliance, is “the change dynamic that’s sort of the elephant in the room.”
“Generative AI creates a lot of work for us in that it creates all these new, different attack vectors,” said Reavis, ranging from potentially more effective phishing emails to more rapid, automated vulnerability scanning. “It’s going to create all these zero day vulnerabilities.”
But Reavis said simultaneously, the cybersecurity profession has taken notice of generative AI’s potential.
“Every cybersecurity company is trying to figure out how they leverage generative AI to actually make their solutions better,” he said, including using it to scale up solutions and “automate things that you didn’t think you could automate before.”
Reavis’ keynote was part of an afternoon-long public event last Wednesday in Bellingham, Wash., called, “Securing the Next Generation of Technology Workers.” 
The focus, however, was directly on cybersecurity since the venue — Whatcom Community College — hosts several state or federal cybersecurity initiatives, including both the National Cybersecurity Training & Education Center (NCyTE), funded by the National Science Foundation, and the state’s Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (CCoE).
More need for more pros
Brent Lundstrom, director of CCoE, said AI is just one of several developments spurring demand for more professionals and new positions. He said, in talking with industry in his role directing the statewide cybersecurity information hub, that the move to “cloud-first” infrastructure is another factor.
“People used to be running their own servers and owning those servers and now they’re doing that in a public cloud environment,” he said. “It brings in a lot of different complications.”
Another trend contributing to demand? Growing organization concerns about “governance, risk and compliance,” the types of regulation and policy matters that can also overlap with AI. 
“There’s a concern about your privacy and what you put into the AI technologies and how that information is stored,” he said.
All told, Lundstrom estimated there were more than 7,500 unfilled jobs in cybersecurity across the state and the CCoE, founded in 2022, was continuing to work to bring employer needs and cybersecurity workforce education into better alignment. 
Reavis cited estimates that, in total, there were 5.5 million cybersecurity professionals today. He compared that to the roughly 12 million police officers at work. 
“When you understand and think about technology enveloping us like never before, and more and more of our life depends upon it, you can easily make the case that that 5 million cybersecurity professionals is a drop in the bucket,” Reavis said.
Advice to students and industry

About 100 employers, educators and students — including those from Whatcom Community College’s cybersecurity program — attended the afternoon forum. 
As part of the event, a panel of cybersecurity leaders from Boeing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, TIRO Security, the Washington State Auditor’s Office and the Cloud Security Alliance offered career advice to the students and potential students in the audience.
One repeated theme: Students should network, whether it’s in person at inexpensive regional BSides cybersecurity conferences or virtually with professionals on LinkedIn. And industry should reach out to education programs to get involved with students’ capstone projects and create more internships.
“I’d also love to see more industry internships turn into full-time jobs,” said Jessica Lewallen, IT security auditor in the Washington State Auditor’s Office. She described her earlier career progression from an internship role to full-time work with the City of Anacortes as “let’s find somebody here who can at least mostly do the job and we’ll train them from there.”
“That was amazing for my career,” she said. “I’d love to see more of those opportunities.”
All the recent developments lead to a future cybersecurity workforce that keynoter Reavis said will have to be able to knowledgeably apply a broad and likely AI-enhanced tool set.
“The amount of creativity, the amount of patience, the amount of thinking outside of the box, the amount of not just following instructions, but having real creativity, using all the different skill sets you have, become really important in how we’re able to be cyber warriors,” he said. “How we’re able to protect things.”

It was revealed that there is currently no direct correlation nor is this something to change “at least in the short run,” due to limitations of the technology. The report said:“It is not yet able to reliably do multi-step work that involves planning, reasoning, or memory.”The study cited previous work in 2023 that administered hundreds of questions requiring the aforementioned skills to both humans and top-performing AI systems. On average, humans scored 92% correct answers, while machines came in at only 15%.Nonetheless, the study said that generative AI is on track to improve quickly with “intense research” to understand how to troubleshoot its weaknesses. Related: OpenAI hit with privacy complaint in Austria, potential EU law breachIt used an example of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 system, the version released in late 2022 that was a major catalyst for the current AI frenzy, performing better than only 10% of humans on the United States bar exam. Its successor, GPT-4, performed better than 90% only a year later.It concluded that “there is no shortage of important work to be done in every society. A great deal of this work… can’t be done by the robots and AI of today, as powerful as they are.” The new Industrial RevolutionThe Google-released study called AI a “general purpose technology” and likened it to the steam engine, which was the spark that ignited the global Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s.Unlike the gradual spread of technology during the Industrial Revolution, the impacts of generative AI are anticipated to manifest more swiftly.The study highlighted primarily that this is due to the existing infrastructure being largely in place, allowing for swift global implementation of improvements and because it is easily accessible for people to begin working with.“Most generative AI’s users don’t have to master a new user interface or programming language… It requires time and practice to become proficient at interacting with generative AI, but it doesn’t require many ‘computer skills.’”Transforming the workforce According to the study, while the technology may not cause “massive technological unemployment,” there is enough evidence that it could contribute to “hollowing out” the labor force among higher-paying jobs.“For all the work done in a modern economy finds that generative AI affects more of the tasks done by college graduates than by high-school only graduates.” There is also potential for the technology to disrupt the way competition between businesses plays out. The report states that generative AI could further empower a small group of “superstars” in a given industry in a way that would allow them outpace their rivals. “Fading incumbents will conduct layoffs, and the number of people who need to find new jobs and acquire new skills will increase,” it said. However, according to research, companies that had invested heavily in machine learning were not the ones conducting layoffs.

After being named an AI2050 Early Career Fellow, Wharton Assistant Professor of Operations, Information, and Decisions Daniel Rock discussed his goals and plans for the position and the potential implications of AI with The Daily Pennsylvanian.

The AI2050 initiative focuses on addressing the potential risks and challenges associated with artificial intelligence, and has developed a working list of these problems that it can help researchers in solving. Rock, by joining the second cohort of young researchers named to the position, will receive up to $300,000 from Schmidt Sciences, a philanthropic organization dedicated to fostering the advancement of science and technology.

Following individuals' nominations for the honor, fellows are required to submit a proposal to help articulate how they hope to solve a problem related to AI2050’s central motivating question — if AI is ""hugely beneficial"" to society in 2050, what happened and what were the most important problems solved along the way?

In his interview with the DP, Rock spoke about the implications of AI beyond its scientific technicalities. He described AI as not ""just about algorithms and computer science, [but] about social impact, economic impact, and so on.”

Rock highlighted the program’s ability to support researchers doing interdisciplinary work that may be otherwise difficult to fund, specifically focusing on the $300,000 award to fellows.

“They [Schmidt Sciences] are committed to enabling work that is difficult to otherwise enable,” he said. 
	






Professor Rock’s research has previously focused on the economic effects of digital technologies, emphasizing the role of artificial intelligence. He said that he will build upon his experience with labor driven data sets to make a new toolkit, which will analyze unstructured economic data of labor market trends to measure the impact of artificial intelligence on “job creation and technological dissemination,” according to Schmidt Sciences. 

Rock also said that he aims to pave the way for future economic research by creating open-sourced large language model encoders, which will enable other researchers to use the data sets for distinct research areas. 

“The impact of this kind of work can be much bigger if we can bring in lots of people to bring their creativity and intelligence to it, too,” he said.

Rock added that his previous inquiries into questions regarding how technology will change workers’ position within the workforce will help inform his future research agenda, which focuses on identifying and measuring long term trends. 

Although fellows do not typically collaborate with each other and focus on their area of expertise, Professor Rock will work alongside numerous other colleagues on the project. This includes Stanford researcher Erik Brynjolfsson, Chapman researcher Sarah Bana, Boston College researcher Sebastian Steffen, and other Ph.D. students and faculty at Wharton.

Rock told the DP that he looks forward to continuing to collaborate with colleagues to execute this project and is “very grateful to be part of [the] program.”

Outsizing the city states’ limited manpower, AI is increasing Singapore’s manufacturing output, optimizing customs facilitation, creating new jobs, and spurring innovation. Though many in Singapore are poised to benefit from the adoption of AI technologies, including automation and robotization, some will not. Low-wage migrant workers, who have long played a critical role in the country’s economy and relationships with its neighbors, are extremely vulnerable to job displacement. As AI automation shifts conceptions of value and expertise, challenges may compound for workers long treated as expendable in the world’s most expensive city. Concerns about job security in the age of artificial intelligence are ubiquitous. However, Singapore’s ambitions for global leadership in AI have fueled efforts to upskill and future-proof the workforce from these anxieties. Since 2015, Singapore’s proactive SkillsFuture Initiative has provided citizens and residents over the age of 25 subsidized access to thousands of courses and job transition support. In 2023 alone, about 520,000 individuals participated in training programs supported by the initiative. Singapore’s workforce has been the world’s fastest in adopting AI skills. Singapore’s lifelong learning initiatives have been lauded as an example of inclusive workforce development. Notably, SkillsFuture subsidies are increased for those more traditionally disadvantaged in digital adoption, including older professionals and people with disabilities. However, the exclusion of migrant workers from these programs challenges Singapore’s expressed commitment to inclusivity. Many of these workers already accrue substantial debt from basic training and certification fees needed to work in Singapore, let alone additional expenses to develop digital skills. Without careful regulations, artificial intelligence will exacerbate socioeconomic divides between workers in Singapore and across the region. Singapore must evaluate its responsibilities to the transnational division of labor as it sets an example for AI adoption. To start, the challenges that AI poses to the region’s low-wage workers must be included in Singapore’s domestic and foreign policy discussions. Of the city-state’s 1.4 million foreign workers in 2019, 999,000 were low-wage work permit holders. With the prospect of higher wages in Singapore, workers from South and Southeast Asia move to the city state for roles in construction, manufacturing, shipping, services, and domestic work. Migrant workers fill crucial gaps for jobs that resident Singaporeans see as undesirable, accounting for about one out of three low-wage service jobs in Singapore. This relationship allows Singapore to hold its unemployment rate steady even as labor demand ebbs and flows — taking in migrant laborers when they are needed and sending them home when they are not. The COVID-19 pandemic was a harrowing display of the exploitative nature of this cycle. With economic uncertainty, border closures, and spikes in xenophobic sentiment, foreign workers were the hardest hit by country-wide unemployment. In total, 181,500 foreigners in Singapore lost their jobs at the height of the pandemic — far exceeding foreign unemployment during prior financial crises. With tightened restrictions on foreign work permits, many migrant workers suddenly had to uproot their lives and leave the country. During this period, those classified as “low-skilled” foreign workers made up 76 percent of job losses. Technological adoption spurred by the pandemic may render some job losses permanent. A joint survey by Microsoft and IDC Asia Pacific found that nearly three quarters of Singapore's firms accelerated their pace of digitalization due to COVID-19. At the same time, Singapore increased its deployment of AI-powered robots, particularly in sectors normally occupied by migrant workers. To keep up with these changes, it is estimated that Singapore needs 1.2 million additional digitally skilled workers to join its workforce by 2025. As a result, many more may be forced to leave Singapore’s workforce. Oxford Economics estimates that each new industrial robot wipes out 1.6 manufacturing jobs, with the least-skilled regions of a country doubly as affected as higher-skilled regions. As the second most robot-dense country in the world, the socioeconomic impacts of robotization are substantial. Singapore now has 730 industrial robots per every 10,000 employees, with an average 27 percent increase each year since 2015. During this same period, employment in Singapore’s manufacturing sector decreased every year, even as Singapore’s manufacturing industry grew. The seemingly inverse correlation between employment rate and economic output underscores a shifting valuation of manual labor in Singapore. Artificial intelligence may exacerbate the dehumanization and devaluation of migrant worker contributions to Singapore. For workers, this may result in lower wages and worse standards of living and employment. Conditions for migrant workers in Singapore are already subpar. Migrants from India and Bangladesh make one-sixth of the average Singaporean salary, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, segregated dormitories for Singapore’s foreign workers received international attention for their deplorable state. Singapore’s changing labor demands also impact neighboring countries. According to Singapore University of Social Sciences economist Walter Theseira, when jobless migrant workers return home, they bring the societal costs of unemployment with them. These challenges are exacerbated for even poorer populations in source countries. Working experience in Singapore could give former migrant workers an advantage for employment in their home countries, which might displace those who never had the funds or opportunity to leave. Singapore undermines its commitments to narrowing the development gap among member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and leading inclusive AI adoption if it does not address its role in the looming wave of transnational unemployment. The global push for AI regulation-setting is an opportune time for Singapore to introduce reforms for ethical, responsible, and mutually empowering labor migration. The first change is sociocultural. With AI automation redefining productivity, it is more important than ever for Singapore to distinguish an individual’s economic contributions from their personal skill and success. After all, one in five migrant workers are employed as foreign domestic workers, making invaluable contributions to the care of Singaporean families despite little economic acknowledgment or compensation for reproductive labor. The language of “low-skilled” to describe work that requires little to no professional training devalues social and vocational contributions of Singapore’s lowest paid workers. A preoccupation with efficiency may distort conceptions of what it means to be human and what it means to be Singaporean in the digital age. A notable example is Singapore’s centuries-old hawker culture, which is at high risk of disappearing as more youth aspire to become professionals, managers, executives, or technicians (PMETs) in Singapore. Rethinking Singapore’s “low-skilled,” “semi-skilled,” and “high-skilled” labels can reverse dehumanizing perceptions and practices toward foreign workers as well as foster a more constructive society-wide relationship with artificial intelligence. Second, Singapore should push to safeguard rights for AI-affected migrant workers in Southeast Asia. One worker rights organization proposes that Singapore establish a buffer period for displaced workers to find a new job before facing deportation. Setting an ASEAN-wide standard could help protect workers on every level of the intraregional labor market. Additionally, Singapore should lead research efforts to examine how AI will influence job displacement and skill demands in the region. Regular reports on these trends can prepare the integrated economies for potential labor supply shocks, while also informing working-age individuals on how to enhance their competitiveness in line with the bloc’s longer-term digital economy goals. While these initiatives might offer greater benefits to worker-sending nations than to Singapore, taking leadership on ASEAN-wide labor rights could signify that Singapore recognizes the contributions of foreign workers to the city-state’s success story. This generates potential to enhance Singapore’s relationships with its neighbors, address past controversies regarding worker rights violations, and position Singapore as a leader in both AI and its ethical adoption. As Singapore integrates artificial intelligence technologies across its economy, the rights and future of Singapore's low-wage migrant workers will become an increasingly pressing issue for Southeast Asia. The international community must pay attention to how Singapore’s decisions set a precedent for AI in the global landscape of labor.

<p><em>By</em> <strong>Zahid Lone </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked both awe and apprehension. While hailed for its potential to revolutionize industries and streamline processes, there's a growing concern that AI could pose a significant threat to employment generation. This sentiment has ignited a fervent debate among experts and policymakers worldwide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proponents of AI argue that it has the capacity to enhance productivity, efficiency, and innovation across various sectors. From automated manufacturing processes to intelligent customer service systems, AI applications promise to streamline operations and unlock new avenues for growth. Advocates often highlight the potential for AI to create new job opportunities, particularly in specialized fields such as data science, machine learning, and robotics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, amidst the optimism, skeptics raise valid concerns about the darker implications of widespread AI adoption. One of the most pressing apprehensions revolves around the displacement of human labour by intelligent machines. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, there's a looming threat that they could render certain jobs obsolete, leading to widespread unemployment and economic upheaval. The manufacturing industry serves as a poignant example of this phenomenon. With the rise of automated assembly lines and robotic technologies, traditional manufacturing roles have dwindled, leaving many workers displaced. Similar trends are observed across various sectors, including retail, transportation, and customer service, where AI-powered solutions are increasingly replacing human workers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, the integration of AI into white-collar professions is raising concerns about the future of knowledge-based jobs. Advanced algorithms and machine learning are increasingly capable of performing tasks that were once exclusive to human intellect, such as data analysis, legal research, and even creative endeavors like content generation. This shift poses a significant challenge for workers whose livelihoods depend on cognitive skills and expertise. Critics caution that unless proactive measures are taken to address the potential socio-economic ramifications of AI, the widening gap between technological advancement and employment opportunities could exacerbate inequality and social unrest. As AI continues to reshape the labour market, policymakers face the daunting task of navigating the delicate balance between innovation and job preservation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In response to these challenges, calls for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of AI on employment are gaining traction. Investing in education and training is paramount for preparing individuals for an AI-driven economy. This involves prioritizing lifelong learning programs that impart technical skills like data science and programming, as well as nurturing critical thinking, adaptability, and creativity. By prioritizing education, societies can ensure their workforce remains agile and equipped to navigate the evolving landscape of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reskilling and upskilling initiatives are vital to help workers transition into new roles that complement AI technologies. Governments and businesses should invest in tailored programs catering to diverse industries and demographics, ensuring inclusivity and preventing anyone from being left behind due to automation. Empowering individuals through reskilling and upskilling opportunities enables them to adapt to changing job requirements and seize new employment prospects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ethical AI deployment and robust social safety nets are essential components in shaping a future where AI augments human capabilities while safeguarding against negative impacts on employment. Establishing ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks ensures responsible AI deployment, mitigating unintended consequences like bias and discrimination. Implementing social safety nets such as universal basic income and healthcare coverage provides support for workers facing job displacement, fostering economic stability and facilitating retraining for alternative employment opportunities. Embracing these strategies fosters a culture of innovation, inclusivity, and social responsibility, leading to a more resilient and equitable society for all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the debate over the impact of AI on employment rages on, one thing remains clear: the need for a proactive and inclusive approach to harnessing the potential of this transformative technology. While AI undoubtedly holds the promise of unparalleled progress, its implications for the future of work must be carefully considered to ensure a sustainable and equitable society in the age of automation. Thus, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both immense opportunities and significant challenges for employment generation. While AI has the potential to enhance productivity and innovation across various sectors, there are legitimate concerns about its impact on job displacement and economic inequality. To navigate this complex landscape, proactive measures such as investing in education, reskilling initiatives, ethical AI deployment, and robust social safety nets are crucial. By embracing these strategies, societies can harness the transformative power of AI while ensuring a sustainable and inclusive future for all in the age of automation.</p>

Top 10 Generative AI Tools You Need to Know
1. ChatGPT
ChatGPT is the most well-known AI chatbot on the market and is extremely easy to use. Simply enter a written query or prompt and press enter, and the solution will use natural language processing (NLP) to scan your input and generate a written response.Advertisements




This tool is a general-purpose AI assistant, meaning the user can ask questions as part of a back-and-forth conversation or use it to create written content such as articles, emails, lists, poems, songs, code, and stories.
To start using it, visit https://chat.openai.com, sign up, and begin asking your new AI friend any questions you like, and start to experience the power of AI.
It’s worth noting that ChatGPT can hallucinate or make up facts, so it’s essential to fact-check any information it gives you.
2. Microsoft CoPilot
Microsoft CoPilot is Microsoft’s search-engine chatbot based on the GPT-4 LLM, available via a sidebar in the Edge web browser, as well as on desktop on Windows 11. With CopIlot, you can enter search queries with text or images or conduct a voice search, and CoPilot, with an assist from Bing, will respond with a written response or image, depending on your query.
One of CoPilot’s main selling points is its capabilities as a search tool. It uses training data connected to the Internet, which means you can ask it questions about current events and news like a search engine.
When responding, it also includes a list of sources and relevant links so that you can conduct further research into a given topic. The chatbot can also create AI-generated images upon request.
3. Google Gemini
Google Gemini, previously known as Bard, is Google’s conversational chatbot and AI assistant, built on the PaLM2 LLM.
The user interface is simple and easy to use. Just enter a query via text or voice, and Gemini can respond with text, images, and videos based on content from Google Search.
Gemini will respond to each prompt with three drafted responses, which you can change between to get the most comprehensive response for your needs. It’s also connected to the Internet, meaning you can use it to summarize other online content and current events.
The chatbot’s integration with Adobe Firefly also means it can be used to create AI-generated images.
4. Jasper
Jasper is an AI-driven copywriting assistant that uses a proprietary AI model alongside third-party models like GPT-3 to help users create brand-conscious content.
This chatbot is designed to generate text replicating a brand’s tone of voice to create content for marketing collateral such as web pages, emails, adverts, sales listings, and blogs.
By entering a written command, you can create new documents or scratch or use existing templates. The assistant will respond with text output. You can craft the output response by entering a content description or brief and providing details on your tone of voice and keywords.
The key difference between Jasper and other tools, like ChatGPT and Bard, is that it focuses on producing marketing content rather than conversational text output.
5. DALL-E 3
DALL-E 2 is an AI tool released by Open AI, which uses GPT-3 and deep learning to convert text prompts into images. To use it, create an account on the OpenAI website, enter a prompt into the search bar, and DALL-E 2 will generate an image.
If the design isn’t quite right, you can choose other variations. Once you find the right design, you can share and save it.
The image output quality will largely depend on the depth of your initial prompt, so it’s worth trying to give as much detail as possible for DALL-E 2 to process.
DALL-E 2 is a popular image generation tool because it is easier to use than more complex ones like Midjourney.
While DALL-E 3 exists, it is only available as a premium model, although some third-party services such as Microsoft CoPilot allow you to use it for free.
6. Quillbot
Quillbot is an AI assistant that uses natural language processing to paraphrase a piece of text.
Essentially, the user enters a piece of text into a prompt box located on the Quillbot AI website, and then the chatbot will check the content for grammar and suggest ways to improve it.
Users can choose between paraphrasing text, summarizing written content, checking grammar, and generating citations based on their needs.
Quillbot is helpful for those who want to produce and proofread fluid, easy-to-read personal and commercial content.
7. Reclaim
Reclaim is an AI scheduling app that can identify the best time for meetings, tasks, or breaks. Users can connect to Google Calendar and automatically schedule meetings while blocking time for rest and even travel if necessary.
Users can also integrate to-do lists created with third-party tools, including ClickUp, Todoist, Asana, Jira, Linear, and Google Tasks. Users can also create and add tasks to the calendar directly via Slack messages.
This app is a good fit for users and teams that want to optimize their calendar availability with automated scheduling while preserving their work-life balance with regular break periods. Techopedia has also recently explored other AI scheduling assistants.
8. Ada
Ada is an AI-powered medical assistant that checks symptoms. It has been trained on clinical evidence to help users track their symptoms. For example, users can grade the severity of their symptoms and view medical guidance on the treatment options available.
The solution includes a condition library, which provides a central repository of health conditions that users can refer to for further information.
One peer-reviewed study found that Ada was significantly more accurate in recognizing inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) than physicians, scoring 70% compared to 54%, and was even more accurate than physicians in suggesting the final diagnosis.
That being said, it’s important to highlight that assistance from generative AI apps is no substitute for support from a trained and licensed medical professional. As such, these tools are best used alongside guidance from a qualified physician.
9. Fireflies
Fireflies is an automated note-taking app that can automatically transcribe and summarize virtual meetings in over 69 languages. Simply invite Fireflies.ai Notetaker to meetings on your calendar, and you can start creating transcriptions of meetings on platforms including Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meets, and Webex.
Once you’ve created a recording, you can use an AI-powered search to filter for keywords and talking points. Users can also add comments, pins, and reactions to transcriptions and share them with other users via third-party apps like Slack, Notion, and Asana.
10. Clara
Clara is an AI virtual assistant for scheduling meetings. It can be given a custom email signature and job title and used by adding the chatbot to an email via the cc option.
Once added to the conversation, the chatbot will schedule a meeting with your contact in natural language on your behalf. This includes automated follow-up emails.
After organizing the meeting, Clara can send you an invite with the event details. This helps to save a lot of back and forth when arranging the meeting with other recipients.
In addition, you can also issue commands to Clara to help manage meetings. For instance, you can tell Clara to automatically send a reminder to all participants 24 hours before scheduled meetings or enter codewords to notify them when a meeting is urgent.

								OPM issues generative AI guidance, competency model for AI roles required by Biden order							

								The guidance was among several actions required by the federal workforce agency within 180 days of President Joe Biden’s executive order on the technology.							


By
Madison Alder



April 29, 2024






 
											U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Headquarters, Washington, D.C.										





Guidance on generative AI and a competency model for AI roles are among the latest actions that the Office of Personnel Management has completed under President Joe Biden’s executive order on the technology, an agency spokesperson said.
In a statement provided to FedScoop ahead of the Monday announcement, OPM disclosed it would issue guidance on use of generative AI tools for the federal workforce; a competency model and skills-based hiring guidance for AI positions to help agencies find people with the skills needed for those roles; and an AI competency model specifically for civil engineering. 
All of those actions were among those the agency was required to complete at the 180-day mark of the October executive order, which would have been over the weekend. The spokesperson also noted that the agency established an interagency working group for AI, as required by the order. 
OPM was given multiple actions under the sweeping order, most of which were aimed at helping agencies attract and retain a federal workforce prepared to address AI. That role is important as the government is working to rapidly hire for 100 AI positions by this summer. The latest actions from OPM give federal agencies a better roadmap for hiring workers in those positions.

They also add to OPM’s existing work under the order, which has included authorizing direct hire authority for AI-related positions and outlining incentives for attracting and retaining AI workers in the federal government. 
Notably, OPM’s action on the responsible use of generative AI comes as agencies across the government have been developing their own unique approaches to those tools for their workforces. Those policies have ranged from banning the use of certain third-party tools to allowing use across the workforce with guidelines. 
The OPM guidance, which was posted publicly Monday, outlines risks and benefits of the technology along with best practices for implementing it in work. 
Though it ultimately directs employees to consult their agency’s policy, the guidance provides examples of uses and specific considerations for those uses, such as summarizing notes and transcripts, drafting content, and using generative tools for software and code development. 
“GenAI has the potential to improve the way the federal workforce delivers results for the public,” the guidance says. “Federal employees can leverage GenAI to enhance creativity, efficiency, and productivity. Federal agencies and employees are encouraged to consider how best to use these tools to fulfill their missions.”

Under the order, OPM was required to create that guidance in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget. 
In addition to the competency models and guidance, the OPM spokesperson also disclosed that the agency issued an AI classification policy and talent acquisition guidance. While those actions support the rest of OPM’s work, they weren’t required by Biden’s executive order but rather the 2020 AI in Government Act. The spokesperson described those actions as addressing “position classification, job evaluation, qualifications, and assessments for AI positions.”
OPM is seeking feedback on that policy and guidance in a 30-day comment period ending May 29. 
This story was updated April 29, 2024, with additional information and links from OPM released Monday.

In the fast-paced realm of supply chain and logistics, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has stirred both excitement and apprehension. While businesses are eager to harness its potential, concerns loom large among workers, fearing the specter of obsolescence or undervaluation of their skills.


Recent insights from Gartner underscore this contrast, warning that failure to bridge this gap could spell trouble for supply chain functions. A survey of 822 business executives involved in their organization’s generative AI strategy revealed that 81% of supply chain executives intend to leverage the technology to trim headcounts by 2025.
However, cautionary notes accompany these aspirations. Gartner urges supply chain leaders to temper their expectations regarding labor cost reduction and instead focus on empowering their existing workforce for heightened productivity. According to Sam Berndt, senior research director at Gartner’s supply chain practice, “Gen AI should be an opportunity for chief supply chain officers to make good on many of their talent aspirations, including freeing their teams up for higher-value work and attracting top-tier technical talent.”
Crucially, transparency emerges as a cornerstone for navigating this transformative terrain. Supply chain leaders are advised to communicate openly about their plans for generative AI to dispel unfounded anxieties and foster an environment of trust. Berndt emphasizes, “Even a skeptical CSCO with minimal plans for Gen AI should provide clear communications about the organization’s plans for the technology and how it will affect the future of work.”


Moreover, the onus lies on leaders to identify diverse use cases for generative AI beyond conventional applications like chatbots. By fostering a culture of experimentation, organizations can discern new roles necessitated by this technology and pivot accordingly. Equally important is the imperative to equip employees with the requisite skills to engage with generative AI, capitalizing on the prevailing interest in cultivating proficiency in this domain.
In essence, the rise of generative AI presents a pivotal juncture for the supply chain and logistics. Navigating this landscape demands a strategic blend of foresight, transparency, and investment in human capital, ensuring that the workforce emerges as a potent ally in harnessing the full potential of this transformative technology.

During a technology conference session about generative AI governance on Monday, Connecticut Chief Information Officer Mark Raymond outlined the many steps his office is taking to ensure that artificial intelligence is used ethically and responsibly. But amid his warnings, he said it’s important for leaders to impart an optimistic and “hopeful” attitude about AI that won’t discourage agencies from pursuing powerful uses of the technology.
Raymond said that Connecticut, which published its AI governance policy in February, has since been briefing agency staff on how they should be integrating AI and introducing them to the state AI board members who can provide guidance when it’s unclear how state policy applies to their projects. Governance, Raymond said, shouldn’t be about shutting down ideas or discouraging potentially constructive work.
“You want to be seen as being hopeful and doing this in a safe manner,” he told the National Association of State Chief Information Officers midyear conference in National Harbor, Maryland. “Because the other perspective is not a good one regularly.”
Raymond and his co-presenter, New Jersey Chief Technology Officer Chris Rein, said they’ve been exploring how to use AI in domains that are considered “low risk.” In New Jersey, Rein said, the state has undertaken a handful of projects that use generative AI, including with the state’s Economic Development Authority, Motor Vehicle Commission and Department of Labor and Workforce Development.

Rein said one project is testing how generative AI can reduce the amount of time it takes for staff to field incoming calls from residents asking about their benefits. He said that complex procedure manuals make fielding requests a ponderous affair, which AI can accelerate while improving outcomes for residents. He said one project improved the number of resolved calls by 50%.
But across all the state’s generative AI work, Rein said, projects are being approached in a careful and controlled manner.
“We’re definitely focusing on some internal uses at agencies first,” he said. “It’s easier to turn off something when it’s controlled internally and [used by] smaller groups. Only one of our use cases goes right out to the public and we’re taking a long, hard look at that.”
The encouraging-but-careful approach is common among state CIOs, but not all public officials have been so measured in recent weeks. New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently defended to the press his decision to keep online a chatbot that is delivering false information to the public. “You can’t live in a lab,” he said at a press conference this month after a reporter criticized a chatbot that was providing the public with faulty information about tenant and worker rights.
After his session, Raymond told StateScoop government should be using generative AI to understand what the public wants to know about, but not necessarily to generate responses on the fly.

“We shouldn’t be using [generative AI] to create new content and responses, because we have to curate that, we have to make sure that that’s good,” Ramond said. “One of the really powerful things large language models can do is you can implement that in a chatbot to understand the question and get them to already-curated content, instead of providing hallucinated content. That’s a great use case that helps improve government in ways that you would really have a difficult time to do on our own.”
Rein said he is also holding generative AI output to a high standard.
“In one of our first implementations, we had an 80-85% accuracy rate, and that’s far too inaccurate to let something go out to the public when you’re a state government,” Rein said.
Before generative AI use in government can mature, Raymond said, there are numerous steps officials should take, including creating an inventory of AI assets that note whether each tool is involved in making decisions and whether it underwent an “impact assessment.” Raymond said Connecticut uses cybersecurity scanning tools that don’t include a “human in the loop” but in most other cases, humans supervise Connecticut’s AI.
During his presentation, Raymond also directed advice to the many technology vendor representatives in the audience, including an admonition against pitching tools without disclosing information about their data’s provenance.

“You’ve got to give it the ingredient label,” he said. “You gotta say: Where did your egg come from? How did you train it? How do you test it? How do you make sure the bias isn’t in there? Because we have to answer all those questions, and then after you help us implement it, we still have to continue testing.”
Raymond also told tech companies not to present agreements that would require the state government to engage in ethically questionable acts. He recalled an incident in which a vendor wanted him to sign an agreement for a “standard” AI model that would train itself on the public’s data.
“One of the things that we’re seeing quite a bit is AI sneaking into people’s products. I don’t want to have to pull the plug on the entire system because we don’t like something that’s happening with your AI,” he said. “So give us the ability to say ‘I’m operating without the AI.’ Our law says if we find something that is some kind of bias that’s against what we need to do, we’re required to stop using it, and if our only option is to shut off the whole thing, that’s bad for you, that’s bad for us.”

MeriTalk's editorial mission is to engage Federal chief information officers, along with their industry counterparts and Federal IT policymakers at the most senior levels of government, through news, feature stories, exclusive studies and reports, events, and professional multimedia productions.",,,,http://www.schema.org,Organization,MeriTalk,,,,https://www.meritalk.com/,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced at a White House event today that the agency is launching a project to overhaul the Federal government’s hiring process for the IT management job series – transitioning to a fully skills-based approach by the summer of 2025. 
OPM also issued new guidance for skills-based hiring in AI-related roles today – as mandated by the Biden administration’s October AI executive order (EO). 
During the White House Convening on Good Paying Jobs in Cyber event today, OPM Deputy Director Rob Shriver announced that the agency has launched a comprehensive project to transition the government’s Information Technology Management job series to a skills-based approach for hiring. 
“In collaboration with our agency partners, we chose to focus on the 2210 series because that reflects the majority of the technical hires across the Federal government, including, of course, a whole lot of cybersecurity professionals,” Shriver said. “It accounts for nearly 100,000 current Federal employees and it is also one of our most in-demand roles in government, so that 100,000 is growing.”  
“Of course, with the emergence of new technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, skills-based hiring becomes ever more critical to finding and onboarding people who have gained these skill sets through whatever pathway,” he continued. “We need these skills in government – we can’t be fussy about how people got them and in fact, we’ve got to honor these alternative paths.”  
Speaking at the same event today, National Cyber Director Harry Coker – who has publicly said the cyber workforce is his top priority – highlighted that the government is leading by example.   
“For the first time, the Biden-Harris administration is committing to converting an entire series of technical employees that work in every Federal agency and represent a majority of the Federal IT workforce to skills-based hiring,” Coker said. “This is a major milestone in our national effort to move to skills-based hiring.”  
“It represents an important commitment and vital work ahead. This process will take time, but we’ll get it done by the summer of 2025,” he said. “You’ll hear us making a similar commitment to skills-based hiring with Federal contractors, employees that work shoulder to shoulder with Federal employees to advance our mission. And you’ll hear about new commitments being made by private sector companies representing more than a dozen industries.” 
OPM said it is currently reviewing Federal agency skill qualification requirements, including the 2210 IT Specialist Qualification and Classification Standard, and will use this pilot to expand the use of competency-based hiring more broadly across the Federal Government in fiscal year 2025. 
OPM’s announcements came on the 180-day mark of the AI EO, and the White House announced today that all Federal agencies have completed their assigned tasks on schedule. 
The agency unveiled the new skills-based hiring guidance and competency model for AI work today, aiming to empower agencies to “shift towards a skills-centric paradigm” that emphasizes practical skills over educational pedigrees or past titles and prioritizes talent with “AI proficiencies tailored to organizational objectives,” OPM said in its memo.  
“For new or rapidly evolving fields, such as those associated with AI, data, and technology, it is crucial that agencies adopt this skills-based hiring approach,” the agency said. “This ensures the Federal workforce can readily adapt to the changing landscape and integrate innovative skills that may not yet be captured in traditional education or certification frameworks.”  
Today’s guidance supports Biden’s AI EO as well as the Trump-era AI in Government Act of 2020.  
In July, OPM issued general and technical competencies to support agencies’ efforts to target AI skills needed to fill positions to expand AI capabilities governmentwide. Since its issuance, OPM consulted with subject matter experts from Federal agencies and conducted environmental scans, focus groups, and governmentwide surveys. 
Today’s guidance includes 43 general competencies and 14 technical competencies found to be important for performing AI work. It also expands on OPM’s July memo by including competencies by grade.  
“When assessing job applicants based on competencies and proficiency levels, rather than just minimum qualifications, agencies are required to use validated (that is, job-related) assessment tools,” the guidance section of the memo states. “Use of validated assessment tools, such as cognitive tests and structured interviews, is critical when assessing job applicants to validate competency-based qualifications.”  
OPM Announces More AI Workforce Guidance, Progress 
OPM also issued new guidance on the responsible use of generative AI for the Federal workforce to support Federal employees in learning about the new tool’s potential benefits and risks, exploring best practices for safely, securely, and responsibly using generative AI in work, and finding ways to learn more about generative AI.    
The guidance states that agencies should practice basic cyber hygiene, like ensuring they don’t input any information into generative AI tools that’s not allowed. It also tasks employees to follow their individual agency guidelines for using the tool.  
It does offer examples and recommendations for generative AI uses, including summarizing information, creating communication materials, and developing code.  
Among its other announcements today, OPM highlighted its contribution to the “Increasing AI Capacity Across the Federal Government: AI Talent Surge Progress and Recommendations” report to the president. The report was submitted by the AI and Tech Talent Task Force, which includes OPM. 
The April 26 report offers insight into the progress of the Federal government’s AI Talent Surge, noting that programs hiring through the surge saw an average 288 percent increase in AI applications compared to previous periods, and some tech talent programs saw up to 600-2,000 percent increases in AI applications.  
“Moreover, public interest in Federal AI roles remains high. From January through March 2024, applications for AI and AI-enabling roles have doubled as compared to similar periods in 2022 and 2023,” the report says. “The message is clear: the public is ready and motivated to join the Federal Government to work on AI priorities.”  
As for hiring, the report notes that more than 172 new AI hires have been made within the Federal government since the AI EO was unveiled in October.  
The report notes that AI capacity gaps across agencies remain – like insufficient data, compute, and technical infrastructure. To help increase AI capacity, the AI and Tech Talent Task Force made 10 recommendations, including to increase funding for AI and tech talent; launching a Federal AI scholarship-for-service program; and exploring AI talent with global partners.

More from At WorkWorker fired after X-rated reply-all emailWin for glam banker facing 120 fraud chargesHow some Aussies will get $21k super bumpLeading experts have revealed the jobs most likely to become obsolete thanks to the rapid rollout of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence technology.Last week, news.com.au reported that a major fast food chain in the United States had replaced its drive-through staff with AI voice recognition, with machines now taking orders in place of humans.Experts in Australia said that type of technology could be implemented here within the year – and warned major disruptions in the food service sector would be just the start of things to come across many industries.A major fast-food chain has replaced its drive-through workers with an AI assistant that can take orders in a matter of seconds.A major fast-food chain has replaced its drive-through workers with an AI assistant that can take orders in a matter of seconds.Automation driven by AI, coupled with the country’s ageing population and a transition to a net-zero emissions goal, will have a significant impact, according to analysis by consulting giant McKinsey.In a recent report, it warned 1.3 million Australian workers might need to transition out of their current jobs and into new professions between now and 2030.That equates to about nine per cent of the nation’s total workforce.Occupations set to be hit hardest including office support, customer service and sales, and food services, McKinsey forecast.Research by workplace technology firm Pearson and AI solutions provider ServiceNow warned any jobs that include a lot of repetitive and technical duties will be significantly impacted.It too forecasted the total number of job losses to be in the vicinity of 1.3 million over the next several years.Job losses in the food services sector will be just the beginning, experts warn. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Andrew HenshawAbout a quarter of jobs in the retail sector alone could be replaced by AI, in what the Pearson research described as a “tectonic shift”.It also estimated that almost 46 per cent of banking roles, 28 per cent of accounting positions and 36 per cent of finance bookkeeping jobs could be automated by 2027.Niusha Shafiabady, an associate professor in Charles Darwin University’s Faculty of Science and Technology, and an expert in machine learning, intelligent modelling and systems design, has researched the industries and roles most at risk.Some face major upheaval over the coming years, with the pace of change set to be rapid in certain areas.Admin gigs going fastIn the scheme of things, programmatic and AI technology is relatively cheap and easy to implement in some businesses, and it’s those that will be among the first to see job losses.“Jobs that rely on humans following pre-existing instructions and don’t need many or any analytical thinking skills will be impacted relatively quickly,” Professor Shafiabady said.“I’m talking about clerical or secretary roles, and jobs in administration, for example.”In a report on labour market changes last year, the World Economic Forum predicted there would be 26 million fewer admin jobs globally by 2027.Positions overseeing data entry, basic accounting, bookkeeping and payroll, ticketing and cashiering, and executive secretarial services will be decimated, the WEF report warned. Professor Shafiabady concurred and said after identifying six of the most at-risk roles in Australia, she found they all sat within the admin realm.Call centre workers were near the top of the list, she said.“The tasks for this type of job can be replicated by an AI computer system, so it will be displaced,” she said.Also at risk are those working as secretaries and foreign language interprets, with advanced technologies able to replicate many of those functions.Even secretaries working in healthcare, such as a GP clinic receptionist, could be “relatively easily replaced”.“A bookkeeper’s job could also be displaced relatively quickly, since the information flow can be captured by software systems,” she said. “At the very least, the number of required positions for this role are likely to decrease.”The Pearson research forecasts a quarter of jobs in retail could be lost due to AI tech implementation. Picture: istockAnd those Aussies whose job requires them entering some kind of data into a computer system should brace for an imminent disruption, she said.As demonstrated in a viral video last week, those taking orders at chain restaurants in Australia could become obsolete relatively quickly because the existing technology has been proven to be effective.Finance industry ripe for disruptionOne of the first AI systems Professor Shafiabady ever designed was for a bank, with the purpose of conducting financial audits.Technologies have come a long way since then, she noted, and much of the “logic” of auditing could be coded into software and many essential tasks might be automated.Another role that could see some of its tasks automated is accounting, which might not lead to humans in those jobs replaced entirely, but could streamline workflows and see a reduction in the number of positions needed.The same goes for financial analysts, she said, with decision-making logic potentially able to be replicated by technology. Huge number of Aussies affectedWhile new tech jobs will be created as a result of mass AI adoption, there won’t be enough on offer to replace those lost.For example, the Pearson research suggests some 80,000 tech roles could be created in the retail sector when AI is adopted, but some 250,000 positions are likely to be impacted.In addition, the adoption of AI could streamline positions by absorbing responsibilities in professions like system administrator, telecommunications engineers and hardware technicians, the Pearson research found.AI has the potential to disrupt a number of industries, leading to heavy job losses. Picture: istockSo significant are the consequences that Professor Shafiabady said parents with young children should start thinking about the futures that await them.“If you have a kid who’s around seven or so, I’d start thinking about the implications of these changes to help them decide what kind of career they might have. You want to think about whether it will exist in the future.“If we allow technology to take over occupations, many people will lose their jobs and this will have economic implications that will change our society.”Jobs that are robustBroadly speaking, any job that requires physical labour is likely to avoid major disruption for some time, given replacing them would require costly advanced robotic solutions.Among them are manual roles in mining – the largest industry in the country.“Take a driller,” Professor Shafiabady said. “Since this skill set requires hardware, its being displaced would require building a smart robot and could be costly.”Jobs that require physical labour tend to be at much lower risk.Similarly, many jobs in the construction sector, from painters to bricklayers and site supervisors, have a significantly lower risk of being replaced.“The fact is the cost of hiring for a position such as a construction labourer globally, versus manufacturing and maintaining a robot to do the same thing, means this type of role is unlikely to be displaced soon.”With risk comes opportunityA report about the future of work by professional networking site LinkedIn found a surge in job advertisements demanding AI expertise.“Companies are looking to hire professionals with AI skills across both technical and non-technical roles,” the report said.The top five industries looking for job candidates with AI expertise are professional services, administrative and support services, government administration, manufacturing and retail, it found.Demand for AI skills in technical roles, like data scientist and software engineer, has been on the rise since December 2022, the report noted.The World Economic Forum's projections on industries set to see the largest growth in jobs.However, companies are increasingly looking to hire professionals with AI literacy into non-technical positions too, like sales and supply chain.“The diffusion of AI talent and skills across global economies will continue to increase as more companies embrace AI across their workflows,” it said. “While many AI jobs require AI skills like machine learning, deep learning and data structures, most of those roles require a mix of AI and non-AI skills (people and digital skills). People skills include communication, leadership, and organisational skills.”So, it seems very human qualities remain useful across most industries – for now.Big global ramificationsIn January, the International Monetary Fund released a report that forecast 40 per cent of all jobs globally will be impacted by the rollout of AI.But in advanced economies, like Australia, that figure could be as high as 60 per cent, the IMF warned.“Historically, automation and information technology have tended to affect routine tasks, but one of the things that sets AI apart is its ability to impact high-skilled jobs,” IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said.“We are on the brink of a technological revolution that could jump-start productivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the world. “Yet it could also replace jobs and deepen inequality.”On a scale of most prepared to least prepared countries, Australia fell roughly in the middle, the IMF report revealed.In a similarly gloomy outlook last year, finance giant Goldman Sachs created a stir when it released a report predicting 300 million jobs globally could be lost to AI automation.Read More

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) describes algorithms that can be used to produce new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. It is developing all the time and is now being used as a support mechanism for all kinds of content-based creations. 



Employers in all sectors are seeing an increase in candidates using AI tools (for example, ChatGPT) to help them complete job application forms. Essentially, this involves putting application questions into an AI tool and then copying the answers it supplies into the application form, either word-for-word or with some minor edits. Why does it matter? AI-generated job applications can often be generic, impersonal and may not accurately reflect an applicant's qualifications, knowledge, skills, and experiences. There is also a risk that it can generate false or misleading information. Job applications contain questions where candidates are reasonably expected to do some research (normally using an online search engine) before answering. The difference in using a search engine is that an individual has enough understanding to interpret the responses received. When AI is used, the search results will be automatically interpreted to provide an answer, and therefore an individual doesn’t require any understanding of the topic at all. This will be problematic if the candidate is selected to progress to a later stage of the recruitment process when realistically they are unsuitable for the role.




What are the indicators that AI has been used?If multiple applicants have provided the same answer either word-for-word, similar, or in a different order or tweaked, it is likely that AI has been used. Other strong indicators can be found within written responses such as:stilted, impersonal language (robotic sounding or plain) inconsistency in the language, writing style or tone of voice throughout the over-use of semi colonsoverly long or complex sentences that have a range of unusual vocabulary, patterns or phrases.




Can employers know for certain?Currently there is no official marketed technology to detect AI. If an employer’s organisation has access to an AI app they could put the questions in there and see what response is supplied. Employers could also consider using screening software that is designed to detect/identify AI generated content, however, the accuracy of these tools is questionable and not verifiable. 




What should employers do if they are sure that a candidate has used AI to complete an application?Employers should consider all factors before making a decision. It may depend on the number and type of question(s) that AI has been used to answer. If an employer still believes the individual is a suitable candidate, it is recommended that they have a verbal discussion with them to check they have the required understanding and knowledge in order for their application to be taken forward. If the candidate is allowed to progress employers must ensure there are robust and thorough assessment methods to further test the knowledge and skills required for the post.




Is there anything employers can do to deter or discourage candidates from using AI?Employing organisations could consider creating a policy about candidates using AI and input measures to mitigate the risks. It is advisable to seek guidance from your organisation’s HR and legal departments before implementing such a policy. A statement or disclaimer could be added to job descriptions and application forms advising that the use of AI is monitored and if applicants have used it then they are required to declare this. Application forms should contain appropriate, role-based specific questions to establish that a candidate has the depth of understanding that is required and consequently make it more difficult for AI to generate adequate responses.




Should employers ban candidates from using AI?It is not recommended to automatically reject applications where the candidate is suspected of using AI (or has openly declared it), however, that decision would need to be made by the individual organisation according to policy. Transparency is important and employers may consider conveying the following messages to candidates:AI-generated content may lack specificity and fail to address key criteria outlined in the job description.Personalisation is essential to convey individual skills, knowledge, and experiences effectively.Over reliance on AI-generated content is discouraged and may diminish the applicant's chances of success.




Are there any positives/benefits to candidates using AI?​​​​​​​AI is becoming more prevalent, and employers need to adapt to its presence and use in the workplace, as much as employees and job seekers are doing. It could be argued that taking advantage of technology to streamline repetitive tasks shows good time management and an openness to changing work style. Studies suggest that more candidates than ever are using AI to help them fill in job applications and this will only continue to increase, particularly those from traditionally disadvantaged groups who are more likely to use AI. Therefore, it is important that employers don’t inadvertently exclude potential candidates in the talent pool by being intolerant to AI. 




AI in the futureAI will continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, therefore, we will aim to track the latest developments and update and expand guidance as appropriate.

Initially, it appeared resistant to using the phrase at all.In the time since, however, chief executive Tim Cook has teased that Apple is working on new generative AI features. He said earlier this year that Apple was investing “a tremendous amount of time and effort”, though without saying what those are.Some of those updates might be revealed at Apple’s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, in June. Apple’s marketing chief, Greg Joswiak, announced that event by saying it would be “Absolutely Incredible”, using capital letters in an apparent hint that AI features are coming.Now, however, Apple’s release of what it called “OpenELM” might offer a hint at how those features could work. Apple says the name stands for “Open-source Efficient Language Models”, and that they are relatively small models specifically calibrated for certain tasks.Apple’s developers said the release was made public in the name of “reproducibility and transparency”, which is “crucial for advancing open research, ensuring the trustworthiness of results, and enabling investigations into data and model biases, as well as potential risks”. It did not give any indication that they would be used in future products.However, the fact that Apple is focusing on small and efficient models might be a hint at the way they will appear in the iPhone. Such small models are built specifically to run on consumer devices, rather than the large cloud services that are required to power some other, less efficient AI tools.Apple appears to be looking to build AI models that can run on the iPhone itself, without sending data to its servers. That would be in keeping with Apple’s commitment to privacy, as well as helping to ensure that any AI-powered features run more quickly and do not rely on having a fast internet connection.The company already looks to ensure that as much processing happens on its devices as possible. The new Apple Watch, for instance, includes processer updates that allow more of the AI transcription and understanding for Siri to happen on the device itself.Apple’s new releases are language models, of the kind that power ChatGPT. It already uses such technology in its iPhones to improve the automatic suggestions in the keyboard – but it might use similar technology to help write emails or improve Siri, for instance.Earlier this year, Apple researchers also published a new model that allows users to edit photos by writing messages, and another that can understand what is happening on a smartphone and help people navigate them.More aboutAppleAIartificial intelligencePrivacyJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/1Apple releases AI that could show future of iPhonesApple releases AI that could show future of iPhonesGetty Images✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

As a subset of AI, generative systems generate new, original content that follows the patterns and structures of the input data they are trained on. They've been employed successfully in various fields, from creating art and music to simulating realistic human language. As we enter this new age, it becomes essential to understand how this transformative technology might reshape our work lives.A recent report from McKinsey provides a detailed examination of how generative AI stands to impact knowledge work. Traditionally, automation technologies have focused on data management tasks such as collecting and processing data. However, the rise of generative AI, with its inherent natural language capabilities, suggests that the focus of automation could shift dramatically. As the report puts it, “Generative AI’s impact on more physical work activities shifted much less, which isn’t surprising because its capabilities are fundamentally engineered to do cognitive tasks.”With a special emphasis on activities involving decision making and collaboration, generative AI is poised to revolutionize sectors that previously showed low potential for automation. This article explores the report's findings, examining how the incorporation of generative AI is likely to transform the automation potential of knowledge work.Shift in Automation Landscape with Generative AIThe progression of generative AI's capabilities has ushered in an entirely new era for automation. The technologies of the past were well-suited to automating repetitive, data-heavy tasks, but they were less adept at tackling the complexities of cognitive, knowledge-based activities. Generative AI, with its language understanding and generation capabilities, is primed to redefine this landscape significantly.The report estimates that the technical potential to automate the application of expertise has skyrocketed, jumping 34 percentage points. In a similar vein, the potential to automate management and develop talent has risen from 16 percent in 2017 to an astonishing 49 percent in 2023. These are domains traditionally seen as bastions of human-exclusive skills, and their penetration by generative AI signifies a profound shift in the automation landscape.The driving force behind this dramatic rise in automation potential is the capacity of generative AI to understand and use natural language across an array of tasks and activities. It's estimated that roughly 40 percent of activities in the economy require at least a median level of human understanding of natural language. With the generative AI models' ability to comprehend and generate human-like text, a whole new frontier for automation has opened up.This breakthrough has significant implications for jobs involving high levels of communication, supervision, documentation, and general interaction with people. Sectors such as education and technology, which were previously expected to be among the last to see automation, are now at the forefront of this transformative wave. This shift is a testament to the leaps and bounds generative AI has made, and how it's primed to redefine our understanding of automation potential.Generative AI's Impact on Language-Based TasksThese tasks span across various sectors and occupations, but are predominantly found in roles that involve significant communication, supervision, documentation, and general interaction with people. By leveraging generative AI, these language-based tasks can be automated to increase efficiency, reduce human error, and ultimately, revolutionize the way these roles operate.For instance, educators, who have to balance their time between teaching, grading, providing feedback, and administrative work, can offload a considerable amount of their documentation and administrative duties to AI. This not only frees up time for educators to focus on their primary roles but also ensures greater consistency and accuracy in administrative tasks.Similarly, professionals in sectors such as law or healthcare, who spend a substantial amount of their time reading, interpreting, and drafting complex documents, can leverage generative AI to automate some of these tasks. AI can help review contracts, analyze medical reports, and even draft initial versions of documents, freeing up professionals to focus on more nuanced and critical aspects of their work.In effect, generative AI has the potential to redefine the work landscape across sectors. As more language-based tasks are automated, roles and responsibilities will shift, potentially leading to a profound transformation in the nature of work.The Paradox: Generative AI's Impact on Higher-Skill OccupationsInterestingly, unlike previous waves of automation technology, generative AI is poised to impact workers with higher levels of education the most. Traditionally, automation technologies have been “skill-biased,” affecting lower-skilled workers more. However, generative AI turns this concept on its head by presenting a paradox—its biggest incremental impact is likely to be on automating activities of more-educated, higher-skilled workers.This may initially seem counterintuitive, given that higher levels of education often correlate with more complex tasks. However, when examining the skill sets that generative AI targets—such as decision-making, collaboration, expertise application, and especially language understanding—it becomes clear that these are often the purview of professionals with higher educational backgrounds. Roles in law, education, technology, and medicine, for example, all require a high degree of expertise and decision-making capacity, as well as extensive language comprehension and utilization.The ripple effect of this shift could be profound. Educational attainment, often viewed as an indicator of skills, may no longer serve as a robust benchmark in the face of generative AI's capabilities. This challenges the traditional paradigm of workforce development and emphasizes the importance of a more skills-based approach to foster an equitable and efficient system. In essence, generative AI forces us to reconsider our understanding of “skills” and which ones are likely to be replaced or complemented by AI technology.Therefore, the advent of generative AI requires a reassessment of the link between educational attainment and job security in the face of automation. As AI continues to evolve, it's clear that no occupation is entirely immune—a reality that will necessitate a significant rethink in how we approach education and career development.Generative AI and Income DisparityThe impact of generative AI is expected to extend beyond reshaping job roles and responsibilities—it also has the potential to redefine income disparity patterns. Historically, the greatest impact of automation technology has been felt by occupations with wages falling in the middle of the income distribution. Automation for lower-wage occupations was more challenging due to the lower cost of human labor and technical difficulties associated with automating certain tasks. However, generative AI stands to alter this trend significantly.The knowledge-intensive tasks and roles that generative AI targets often correspond to higher-wage knowledge workers. These professions were previously deemed relatively immune to automation due to the complex cognitive tasks they involve. However, advances in generative AI, particularly in natural language understanding and decision-making, mean these roles now have a higher potential for automation.Consequently, generative AI's largest impact could well be on higher-income quintiles. This could potentially lead to a more evenly distributed impact across the income spectrum, contrasting with the ‘hollowing out of the middle' that previous automation technology waves have often precipitated. However, it also underlines a more pressing concern: as generative AI progresses, it becomes clear that even higher-wage, knowledge-intensive roles are not immune to the transformative influence of automation.As generative AI continues to advance, its role in transforming work, redefining skills, and reshaping income disparity will become more pronounced. Therefore, it's crucial for policymakers, educators, and industry leaders to keep pace with these changes, fostering flexible, adaptable workforces and promoting lifelong learning as key tenets of the future of work. Ultimately, as generative AI continues to revolutionize the workplace, it offers not just challenges but also opportunities to create a more equitable, efficient, and innovative economy.Rethinking Automation with Generative AIGenerative AI's potential to reshape the work landscape is profound. It's clear that the technology will have an extensive impact on the tasks we perform, the skills we value, and the income distribution we observe. As generative AI transforms occupations across sectors and skill levels, it forces us to rethink our understanding of automation in the workplace.The rise of generative AI highlights the importance of a new skillset that values adaptability, resilience, and continuous learning. As tasks and roles undergo automation, those that can continually learn and adapt will be the most successful. Companies, therefore, need to foster cultures of lifelong learning and provide resources for workers to continuously upgrade their skills. Moreover, it's important to view these changes not just as a threat but as an opportunity to improve the quality of work and increase overall productivity.In the face of this automation revolution, policymakers also have an essential role to play. As generative AI increases the automation potential of high-skill, high-wage jobs, there's an urgent need to rethink workforce development strategies. Taking a more skills-based approach could lead to more equitable, efficient workforce training, and matching systems.Furthermore, generative AI’s impact on income disparity must be considered. It underscores the need for policies that ensure wealth distribution is equitable and that opportunities are accessible across the income spectrum. As generative AI shapes the future of work, it's paramount that the benefits it brings are shared equitably across society.Overall, the dawn of generative AI signifies a new era in the field of automation—one that can revolutionize knowledge work in ways previously unimaginable. Navigating this change successfully will require foresight, adaptability, and a collective commitment to harnessing the technology's potential for the benefit of all. The future of work with generative AI is still unfolding, and it's a narrative we all have a role in shaping.

What is AI in simple terms?
Artificial intelligence is a computer system that can make predictions about data and rearrange that data in new ways.The term artificial intelligence can broadly be applied to everything from auto-suggested text in an email to photorealistic, real-time generated videos.Within the broad term, types of AI likely to be encountered in business software include generative AI, natural language processing and machine learning.





Artificial intelligence comes in many forms, from simple tools that respond to customers via chat to complex machine learning algorithms that predict the trajectory of an entire organization. Despite years of overpromising, AI doesn’t mean sentient machines that reason like humans; rather, AI encompasses more narrowly focused pattern matching at scale to complement human reasoning.
In order to help business leaders understand what AI capabilities are, how to use artificial intelligence and where to begin an AI journey, it’s essential to first dispel the myths surrounding this huge leap in AI technology.
What is artificial intelligence?
AI is largely a pattern-recognition and prediction computer system that can run at a scale dramatically beyond any human, yet never quite replaces humans. Even at its best, AI delivers acceptable — though not perfect — results, letting people step in, observe the data and reason from there.
Note that while we use AI throughout this cheat sheet, most enterprises engage with a subset of AI called machine learning or deep learning. Contemporary usage of the word in business may imply generative AI, in which trained models remix existing content to form images or sentences in new ways. We’ll use AI here as a shorthand that includes machine learning and deep learning, and specify generative AI when appropriate.
The truth is that current AI technology is limited, but it’s still incredibly powerful. However complicated its processes may seem in practice, at the core of AI-driven applications is the simple ability to identify patterns and make inferences based on those patterns.
AI isn’t truly intelligent, and it’s often as biased as the data we choose to feed into our ML models. That doesn’t mean AI isn’t useful for businesses and consumers trying to solve real-world problems — it means that we’re nowhere close to machines that can actually make independent decisions or arrive at conclusions without being given the proper data first. It’s also true that AI can tend to confirm our biases rather than eliminate them.
How does artificial intelligence work?
AI is a complex system designed to model human behavior and intelligence. It combines large amounts of data with algorithms — sometimes modeled after neurons — to analyze, understand and make decisions or predictions about future states. To make accurate predictions, AI systems require large amounts of data to learn from; this data is gathered from various sources, processed, analyzed and organized in a suitable format for the AI algorithms.
AI algorithms are the core of AI systems and are designed to analyze and interpret data, identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on the input. By continuously collecting new data and retraining the models, AI systems can adapt to changing conditions and improve their performance.
The core process of how AI works involves the following subdomains:

Machine learning: A branch of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed.
Deep learning: A subfield of machine learning that mimics the workings of the human brain’s neural networks, using multiple layers of artificial neural networks to learn and understand complex patterns and features in data.
Neural networks: A computational model, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, that can process and analyze large amounts of data to recognize patterns, make predictions or classify information.
Natural language processing: A branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, enabling machines to understand, interpret and generate human language.
Computer vision: A branch of AI that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from images or videos.
Cognitive computing: A model that aims to create AI systems that can simulate human-like intelligence and interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive way.
Generative AI: A combination of other subdomains on this list, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing and cognitive computer, generative AI creates remixed content such as conversations or videos.

Generative AI
Generative AI systems are capable of creating content, such as images, videos, music or text, that is nearly indistinguishable from human-generated content. They can autonomously generate new outputs based on their learned patterns and styles.
Generative adversarial networks are an example of generative AI, where one network generates content, and another network evaluates and provides feedback to improve the quality of the generated output.
Popular examples of generative AI include:

OpenAI’s ChatGPT: A generative pretrained transformer is a language model developed by OpenAI to generate human-like text based on a given prompt. The latest model, GPT-4, was trained on Microsoft Azure AI supercomputers and is available on ChatGPT Plus.
Microsoft Copilot: A generative AI assistant trained on GPT-4.
Google Gemini: A chatbot and productivity assistant running on Google’s LaMDA model, experimentally integrated into Google Search.
Stable Diffusion: A model from Stability AI that makes images from text prompts.


What can artificial intelligence do?
Artificial intelligence is essentially pattern matching at scale. With its pattern recognition capabilities, modern AI can perform image recognition, understand the natural language and writing patterns of humans, make connections between different types of data, identify abnormalities in patterns, strategize, predict and more.
While humans are unable to as easily comb through the amount of data that machines can to uncover patterns, machines struggle when presented with an outlier that might be easy for a human to spot but contradicts the training data. Therefore, the best AI applications are highly focused and combine human reasoning with the brute power of ML.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, AI and ML saw a massive market growth. The global pandemic also shifted AI priorities and applications: Instead of solely focusing on financial analysis and consumer insight, post-pandemic AI projects have trended toward customer experience and cost optimization.
AI bots can perform many basic customer service tasks, freeing employees up to only address cases that need human intervention. AI like this has been particularly widespread since the start of the pandemic, when workers forced out of call centers put stress on customer service.
Since then, the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, popularized generative AI.

What are the business applications of AI?
In the business world, there are plenty of AI applications, but perhaps none is gaining traction as much as business and predictive analytics and its end goal: prescriptive analytics.
Business analytics is a complicated set of processes that aim to model the present state of a business, predict where it will go if kept on its current trajectory and model potential futures with a given set of changes. Predicting the future with an established model of the past can be easy enough, but prescriptive analysis, which aims to find the best possible outcome by tweaking an organization’s current course, can be downright impossible without AI help.
Other AI use cases for businesses include the following:

Recruiting and employment: AI can streamline recruiting by filtering through larger numbers of candidates more quickly than a human and by noticing qualified people who may be overlooked.
Fraud detection: AI is great at picking up on subtle differences and irregular behavior, such as subtle indicators of financial fraud that humans may miss.
Cybersecurity: AI is great at detecting indicators of hacking and other cybersecurity issues.
Data management: Using AI, you can categorize raw data and find relationships between items that were previously unknown.
Customer relations: Modern AI-powered chatbots are incredibly good at carrying on conversations thanks to natural language processing, making them a great first line of customer service.
Healthcare: Not only are some AI applications able to detect cancer and other health concerns before doctors, they can also provide feedback on patient care based on long-term records and trends.
Predicting market trends: Much like prescriptive analysis in the business analytics world, AI systems can be trained to predict trends in larger markets, which can lead to businesses getting a jump on emerging trends.
Reducing energy use: AI can streamline energy use in buildings and even across cities, as well as make better predictions for construction planning, oil and gas drilling, and other energy-centric projects.
Marketing: AI systems can be trained to increase the value of marketing both toward individuals and larger markets, helping organizations save money and get better marketing results.

What AI platforms are available?
When adopting an AI strategy, it’s important to know what software is available for business-focused AI. There are a wide variety of platforms available from the usual cloud computing suspects like Google, AWS, Microsoft and IBM, and choosing the right one can mean the difference between success and failure.
AWS Machine Learning
AWS Machine Learning offers a wide variety of services that run in the AWS cloud. AI services, prebuilt frameworks, analytics tools and more are all available, with many designed to take the legwork out of getting started and others like SageMaker for Business Analysts designed to enable corporations to get AI insight without writing code. AWS offers prebuilt AI algorithms, one-click ML training and training tools for developers getting started in or expanding their knowledge of AI development.

Google Cloud
Google Cloud offers similar AI solutions to AWS, as well as having several prebuilt total AI solutions that organizations can ideally plug into their organizations with minimal effort. Google also distinguishes itself by innovating some of the industry standards for AI like TensorFlow, an open-source ML library.

Microsoft AI
Microsoft’s AI platform comes with pre-generated services, ready-to-deploy cloud computing infrastructure and a variety of additional AI tools that can be plugged into existing models. Its AI Lab also offers a wide range of AI apps that developers can tinker with and learn from what others have done. Microsoft also offers an AI school with educational tracks specifically for business applications.

OpenAI
Developers can choose between a variety of text and image generative AI models from OpenAI, makers of the popular chatbot ChatGPT. As of November 2023, OpenAI offered fine-tuned, custom models based on GPT-4. These custom models are appropriate for organizations with large proprietary datasets and can be accessed through an API. In April 2024, OpenAI added a playground for comparing different models’ quality and performance, as well as other quality of life and integration updates.

IBM watsonx
IBM’s Watson was an early example of question-answering AI and has evolved in several directions as business software. Now, IBM is mostly leaning into watsonx instead, which is a cloud-hosted generative AI and data analytics platform. IBM offers on-site servers custom-built for AI tasks for businesses that don’t want to rely on cloud hosting.

What AI skills do businesses need to invest in?
Perhaps the most critical skill needed to use AI is knowing when to skip AI altogether. The reality of AI is that many problems could be solved by applying simple regression analysis or if/then statements. Most AI, in other words, isn’t AI at all: It’s only basic math and common sense.
For more complicated, AI-oriented tasks, the associated data science breaks down into two categories: that which is intended for human consumption and that which is intended for machine consumption.
SEE: Learn what you need to know to become a machine learning engineer.
In the latter case, AI involves complex digital models that apply ML models and AI algorithms to large amounts of data. These systems then act autonomously to generate a particular ad or customer experience or make real-time stock trades. Hence, machine-oriented AI professions require “exceptionally strong mathematical, statistical and computational fluency to build models that can quickly make good predictions,” as former Google and Foursquare data scientist Michael Li has noted.
By contrast, the skills needed for more human-oriented data science and AI skew toward storytelling. Given that no data is unbiased, the role of human intelligence is to help the data tell clear stories. Such AI storytellers use data visualization to facilitate exploration and insights into that data.
For many in AI, the most sophisticated math they’ll do is power analyses and significance tests. They might write SQL queries to get data, do basic math on that data, graph results and then explain the results. Not gee whiz data science, but it’s incredibly helpful for breaking down complex data into actionable insights, to use the data science lingo.
With all that in mind, it’s still true that skills needed for an AI project differ based on business needs and the platform being used, though most of the biggest platforms support most, if not all, of the most commonly used AI programming languages and skills needed.
Many business AI platforms offer training courses in the specifics of running their architecture and the programming languages needed to develop more AI tools. Businesses that are serious about AI should plan to either hire new employees or give existing ones the time and resources necessary to train in the skills needed to make AI projects succeed.
How can businesses start using AI?
Getting started with business AI isn’t as easy as simply spending money on an AI platform provider and spinning up some prebuilt models and algorithms. There’s a lot that goes into successfully adding AI to an organization.
At the heart of it all is good project planning. Adding artificial intelligence to a business, no matter how it will be used, is like any business transformation initiative. Here’s an outline of just one way to approach getting started with business AI.
Determine your AI objective
To begin, figure out how AI can be used in your organization and to what end. By focusing on a narrower implementation with a specific goal, you can better allocate resources.
Identify what needs to happen to get there
Once you know where you want to be, you can figure out where you are and how to make the journey. This could include starting to sort existing data, gathering new data, hiring talent and other preliminary steps.
Build a team
With an end goal in sight and a plan to get there, it’s time to assemble the best team to make it happen. This can include current employees, but don’t be afraid to go outside the organization to find the most qualified people. Be sure to allow existing staff to train so they have the opportunity to contribute to the project.
Choose an AI platform
Some AI platforms may be better suited to particular projects, but by and large they all offer similar products in order to compete with each other. Let your team give recommendations on which AI platform to choose — they’re the experts who will be in the trenches.
Begin implementation
With a goal, team and platform, you’re ready to start working in earnest. This won’t be quick: AI models need to be trained, testing on subsets of data has to be performed and lots of tweaks will need to be made before a business AI is ready to hit the real world. In fact, you should expect that the vast majority of your time won’t be spent crafting trendy algorithms, but rather in data preparation.

ISTANBUL, TURKEY - MAY 06:  A woman views historical documents and photographs displayed in a high ... [+] tech art installation at Salt Galata on May 6, 2017 in Istanbul, Turkey. The ""Archive Dreaming"" installation by artist Refik Anadol uses artificial intelligence to visualize nearly 2 million historical Ottoman documents and photographs from the SALT Research Archive. Controlled by a single tablet in the center of a mirrored room the artist used machine learning algorithms to combine historical documents, art, graphics and photographs to create an immersive installation allowing people to scroll, read and explore the archives. The SALT Galata archives include around 1.7 million documents ranging from the late-Ottoman era to the present day. The exhibition is on show at SALT Galata art space through till June 11, 2017.

AI is changing business profoundly and quickly. It is enabling new business models, making existing business models radically more efficient, and creating the potential for products conceived in entirely new ways. It is also making individual contributors more productive at day-to-day tasks, from writing code to writing memos. How should business leaders manage the breadth and depth and speed of this disruption?

Many people are advocating for a new role, that of a Chief AI Officer. President Joe Biden has issued an Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which requires that each agency designate such a leader. The Department of Justice is the first to do so, naming a Princeton computer scientist its Chief AI Officer. Mark Minevich, a Forbes Contributor, writes about ""The Rise Of The Chief AI Officer: Powering AI’s Corporate Revolution."" The New York Times headlined, ""Hottest Job in Corporate America? The Executive in Charge of A.I.”

PROMOTED
Clearly something is happening. A common element in these articles is the description of a job with an extraordinary breadth. The person must be strategic, operational, deeply technical, transformational, and capable of integrating ethics with AI initiatives. Is this even possible? If it were, is it really the path to the integration of AI into the business?

In many ways, the call for a Chief AI Officer is akin to previous organizational responses to major new technological capabilities, like the Head of Re-engineering, the Chief eBusiness Officer, the Chief Data Officer and the Chief Innovation Officer. In each case, the goal was to put an executive in charge who could work across functions, break down silos, and accelerate change.

But Jane Edison Stevenson, Vice Chair of Board and CEO Services at Korn Ferry, believes that something more fundamental is happening this time. She has lived through the earlier waves with a bird's eye view as an executive recruiter, and she was a leader in recruiting some of the very early Chief Innovation Officers. Stevenson believes that AI is a disruptive technology that all executives need to embrace - and she has not come across any who are in denial about this wave of change. The question remains: how should businesses adapt?.

The larger frame within which to place this challenge is what Stevenson calls enterprise leadership: the ""ability to both perform and transform simultaneously and to think horizontally, not just vertically."" “The ability to perform consistently is table stakes,"" she told me in an interview. ""The need (is) to transform real-time, every day, at the same time that you perform"". AI is an important part of the current complexity this new breed of executives must manage. Although a Chief AI Officer may provide coordination and awareness, the need is deeper.

So what should executives do to respond to the AI revolution? It depends on your function. The Chief Strategy Officer needs to become deeply aware of the potential of AI to challenge the business model and strategy of the firm. This includes the potential for AI to create a new set of competitors who compete by embedding AI into every aspect of their operations. In Competing in the Age of AI, Marco Iansiti and Karim Lakhani give examples of companies that have created an 'AI factory' at the heart of their operations. Companies as different as Moderna and Ant Financial generate economies of scope and economies of scale at the same time. They do so by using AI to improve and speed up entire processes. People become monitors of the process and are out of the flow of execution. The Chief Strategy Officer needs to understand these new operating models and lead the organization on paths that can survive the existential threats and realize the extraordinary potential of AI.
The Chief Innovation Officer needs to look at AI through a different lens. He or she needs to foster experimentation with the ways AI is being used to dramatically increase both innovation speed and breadth. Experiments with specialized tools like Ethan Mollick's Innovator, available through ChatGPT, indicate the potential. Mollick has shown that his students at the University of Pennsylvania move through the front end of innovation faster and more creatively when using such tools. He mandates their use in his classes.
AlgoVerde, a Silicon Valley startup, has integrated a generative AI innovation platform across the design lifecycle. Vladimir Jacimovic, CEO of AlgoVerde, says that the use of virtual twins of both customers and technical experts ""can speed the path of innovation from business challenge to concept by a factor of ten""(emphasis added). To understand the role that generative AI could play in their functions, Chief Innovation Officers need to do experiments and encourage their staffs to do the same.
Chief Technology Officers and R&D leaders face a different opportunity. They can use AI to simulate products before they are even prototyped, including their integration with customer systems. They can speed up R&D processes, sometimes dramatically. Daniil Boiko, Robert MacKnight and Gabe Gomes, all of Carnegie Mellon University, used generative AI to create an AI system ""for autonomous design, planning, and execution of scientific experiments,"" for example, greatly increasing the pace of their research. Generative AI can also be used to increase the design space for products, as AutoDesk has demonstrated with 3D printing designs created using generative techniques. Finally, CTOs can use generative AI to create smart and accessible products - products that are easier to use and to personalize than was previously possible.
Chief Operating Officers must lead the use of AI to improve operations. This often starts with the automation of point solutions. Many companies see call centers as a ripe opportunity, though simple displacement of jobs may not be the best approach. There is room for an entirely new wave of re-engineering, one driven from the shop floor up.
Even Chief HR Officers have a unique role in the integration of AI into operations. They need to understand the emerging tools and how individuals can be empowered to use them in their work. There are already concerns that such tools might leak confidential information or create security threats. At the same time, a large body of studies is demonstrating that the use of large language models can increase productivity across a range of knowledge work in surprising ways (see “Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier: Field Experimental Evidence of the Effects of AI on Knowledge Worker Productivity and Quality). Today, many companies limit the use of generative AI because of security and IP concerns. CHROs can break down roadblocks and encourage experimentation and sharing of results. CHROs may also take a lead in highlighting ethical issues.
The point is that the role of leading in the Age of AI is not one that can be managed by an individual, no matter how skilled. Each member of the C-Suite needs to find ways that will move his or her role to the next level. This requires that they each become educated on the potential - and spend time experimenting with tools themselves. Without some hands-on experience, the potential will seem abstract.
The easiest thing in the world a CEO can do to respond to the threat of this uncertain and poorly understood technology is to appoint a Chief AI Officer. The problem is that it is unlikely to be the silver bullet that it promises to be. At worse, it might cause others to defer their own learning journey and delay real adoption.

Not all jobs are vulnerable to artificial intelligence, according to three AI experts, who say some jobs will simply evolve in the future.
Consumers still prefer personalized support over chatbots, and AI still lacks the creativity to handle some complex problems and strategic planning.
In some industries such as cybersecurity AI will usher in new career opportunities.
Employees in many industries are worried about whether artificial intelligence will make their jobs irrelevant. While these fears are valid, the human element is still highly valued, according to a trio of AI experts who were asked to reflect on whether AI is likely to steal jobs in the near future.Getty ImagesSome studies have shown that people still prefer to receive more personalized support from employees than from AI technology – receiving customer service from a person rather than a chatbot, for example. Back in 2019, 86% of people said they preferred interacting with a real person to a chatbot, according to a survey of 1,000 consumers by CGS, a business applications, outsourcing and learning company. In 2023, that number hadn’t changed much, with 80% of consumers still preferring human interaction, according to a survey by Invoca, a company that uses AI in call tracking and conversational analytics solutions.Read: 13 Signs You May Be Facing a Layoff.Will AI Take My Job?Even with the accelerated adoption of AI, the human touch is still necessary, wrote Cory Halbardier, chief operating officer of Blazeo, an ad conversion platform, in an email.“Take chatbots for instance – especially for small businesses that don't have the time or resources to tend to leads 24/7, automated tools are imperative,” Halbardier said. “If no live person is guiding these tools, many customers don't receive the empathy, understanding and communication they need.

He’s seen AI's potential not just as a disruptor, but as a catalyst for creating new opportunities and enhancing the effectiveness of human efforts in the cybersecurity realm.“AI is indeed reshaping jobs, but it's important to distinguish between job displacement and job transformation,” Taylor said in an email. “In cybersecurity, for example, AI has taken over tedious tasks such as monitoring network traffic for anomalies, which allows human analysts to focus on more complex threat analyses and strategic security planning.” Taylor emphasized that this shift is elevating the roles of IT professionals, making their work more impactful and strategic. Rather than stealing jobs, he says, AI is augmenting the human workforce by providing tools that can handle the increasing volume and sophistication of cyberthreats.READ: 10 Best-Paying Tech JobsWhat Jobs Will AI Replace?The jobs that AI will replace are “simple, menial jobs” that involve basic data entry and basic problem-solving, wrote AI researcher Regina Grogan, in an email. The reason for this is that AI lacks the human ingenuity and creativity to solve extremely complex problems – for now.“AI models struggle to take many conflicting factors and ideas into account; the nuance isn't there,” Grogan said. “Lots of jobs people do, at least in the white-collar sector, involve a lot of nuance, judgment and decision-making. AI doesn't perform well there.”When considering which jobs AI will replace, Reade suggested sectors where AI can perform tasks more efficiently and with fewer errors than humans. He reemphasized that this doesn't always mean job loss. Instead, it often means job evolution. For instance, he pointed out that AI's role in software development is growing, particularly in areas like automated testing and code generation.READ: 15 Jobs to Consider for a Career ChangeWill AI Replace Programmers?Some experts say that computer programmers are particularly vulnerable to AI. But Grogan points out that it isn’t that easy for AI to produce the same quality of work as human programmers. “When I see code written by AI, I also see lots of problems,” she said. “It's easy, as of yet, to inject malicious attacks into the code and into large language models in general. So, from the lens of security, it's probably not a great idea to copy and paste AI-generated code from the internet into your codebase – not only for logistical reasons like problems in the code but because of malicious code attacks that can affect the security of your company.”Instead of eliminating programmer positions, Grogan believes AI could create jobs focused on secure code and secure code review. “This is because if people are actually going to use AI-generated code, they have to focus on the security of their organization,” she said. “We've seen AI-related cyberattacks rise across the board, so if companies are going to use AI, they have to take the right precautions.” Grogan also predicts that as people become more concerned about the privacy and security of some of these applications, AI is likely to create many jobs in data security and data privacy.Reade agreed that AI is unlikely to replace programmers outright. Instead, he predicts it will change the nature of programming jobs, requiring programmers to adapt and work alongside AI, leveraging its capabilities to enhance productivity and innovation. “While AI might automate certain programming tasks, the demand for skilled programmers capable of designing algorithms, improving AI systems and integrating ethical AI use into software development is on the rise,” Reade said.What Is Career Cushioning?Career cushioning is when professionals create backup career opportunities in case they lose their jobsRobin MadellOct. 31, 2023Tags: careers, Company Culture, artificial intelligence, employmentAbout On CareersOur expert contributors give their best advice on answering common interview questions, perfecting job applications, negotiating salary and more.Find savvy job advice from the brains behind top careers blogs and websites, including Robin Madell, Robin Reshwan and Hallie Crawford.RECOMMENDEDCareersHow to Be More Assertive at WorkOn Careers7 Benefits of Working From HomeCareersHow to Quit a Job You Just StartedCareers20 Best Questions to Ask an InterviewerOn CareersWrite a Goodbye Email to Co-Workers",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', 'name': 'Will Artificial Intelligence Steal My Job?', '@id': 'https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-steal-my-job', 'url': 'https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-steal-my-job'}",,"Employees in many industries are worried about whether artificial intelligence will make their jobs irrelevant.

In April 1860, the Pony Express launched its operation to much fanfare. Using a series of riders on horses to relay messages from Missouri to California, it became an instant icon of the Wild West.
The service lasted all of eighteen months. The Pony Express couldn’t compete with the transcontinental telegraph, completed in 1861, which delivered messages in a fraction of the time.
With AI poised to transform work today, we all have some degree of fear that our jobs will go the way of the Pony Express. But we miss the full story when we focus only on the fate of the famed riders.
 
 
 













 
 

How the newfangled technology of the telegraph made one job obsolete while spawning countless others is an example of an important historical lesson for today: major technological advancements are catalysts for creating jobs, even entire new industries.

AI stands to be the next revolutionary advancement because it has the ability to learn and far surpass human intelligence, enabling it to analyze data more deeply and generate insights that would be impossible for humans alone. Rather than killing jobs, AI will create new jobs that were unimaginable just a few years before.
What should enterprises learn from the past in order to thrive during this rapidly advancing intelligence revolution?
 
 
 













 
 

New technology, same pattern
Every major technological revolution follows a similar pattern: a new technology comes along which upends the old ways of doing things, resulting in major changes to how we live, work, and think.
During the agricultural revolution, we built villages and towns, took on new jobs to support farming, and started thinking differently about things like land ownership and trade. The industrial revolution that followed saw us moving to cities, working in manufacturing, and developing new ideas like consumerism and automation.
Electricity, telecommunications, the computer, and every other major technological development has had the same effect: the world transformed in ways that we’d never imagined just a generation before.
 
 
 













 
 

The level of change these technological revolutions bring about is monumental. For example, in 1870 half of all workers in the United States were agricultural; by 1900, one generation later, that number had dropped to one-third. Now that number is around 4%. There are more people to feed today but that’s offset by how much more efficient agricultural work has become.
Artificial intelligence is the next great disruptor. We are witnessing an intelligence revolution where AI will give us access to capabilities, information, and insights that go well beyond human capacity. Just like the revolutions before, this one will fundamentally transform how we live, work, and think.
Technology as a job creator
One change we already see unfolding is how we consume data. We do not need to find data, search through results, or spend time compiling information in the same way as the past. As a result, how we think about information, including authorship, may change dramatically. This example is just the tip of the iceberg for what is coming.
 
 
 













 
 

So what will work look like in the AI-first era? It can be hard to predict because these moments are so transformative. After all, you couldn’t imagine the job of electrician before electricity.
We can see patterns emerging. Companies are wanting to build large language models, so we know jobs to build, maintain, and utilize these LLMs will multiply. But we also know jobs will be created that are beyond the limits of our current imagination.
Fifty percent of the workforce no longer in agriculture today doesn’t mean that fifty percent of workers are unemployed. Instead, they moved into other industries. History shows us that during each of these technological revolutions, the net outcome is job creation, especially in entirely new sectors.
 
 
 













 
 

Yes, the telegraph killed the Pony Express, but anyone looking around in 1861 would have found a job market flourishing with new professions like line repair staff and skilled operators. It’s crucial to note that many of these new jobs went to women and provided better pay, mobility, and independence during a time of limited opportunity.
The intelligence revolution will be just as transformative for work, and we can look back for insight into what changes AI might bring. Most of the new jobs created during other tech revolutions fall into one of two categories: (1) jobs that support the new technology and (2) jobs that use the new technology.
On the support side, we’ll see a major expansion in IT jobs that help develop and implement AI. These will be the steam engine builders and loom fabricators for the AI age. Recently, many companies have prioritized jobs that support AI. They are hyper focused on AI development, paying a premium for those with AI skills, while devaluing or even eliminating other positions.
 
 
 













 
 

But just as a factory of loom builders alone couldn’t make fabric, an enterprise of AI builders alone cannot use AI. We need to think about what to do with the technology, rather than just having the technology itself.
Jobs that use the new technology are equally important as the builders of the technology, even if we don’t know what most of those future jobs might be.
No crystal ball, no problem
Given the lack of clarity on what the jobs and uses of AI will be in the future, what should businesses do? This uncertainty actually suggests a clear path forward. Businesses should of course be investing in jobs that support AI. Chief AI Officer, Prompt Engineer, and AI Research Scientist are a few examples.
 
 
 













 
 

But what happens when we build all these amazing AI capabilities without developing the use cases? We also must invest in workers with the skills to identify and develop the applications for AI.

Companies need workers who can imagine how we might live, work, and think in new ways. Open-mindedness is crucial because, in this moment of transition, fixating on what’s already been done and assumed limitations hinders innovation. Skills like problem solving and critical thinking are invaluable. We need strong analytical thinkers who can get to the root of problems and imagine innovative solutions harnessing AI.
In short, creativity is just as important as domain expertise for enterprises looking to capitalize on the intelligence revolution.
 
 
 













 
 

Such soft skills are harder to quantify or hire for than say a computer science degree, but they are critical. One of AI’s many future use cases will be to help enterprises better map employees’ full skillsets and develop workers’ soft and hard skills.
Just like with past technological revolutions, we can’t predict what is coming. But we can work to have the right people in place at the right time to help enterprises and society transform.
A fast revolution
Today’s intelligence revolution does differ from the past because of the pace of change. After decades of effort, the first telegraphs appeared in the 1830s. It took another thirty years, and financial support from Congress to help complete the line, before the telegraph could actually outcompete the Pony Express.
 
 
 













 
 

Today, geography and money are not holding AI back and the technology has already advanced substantially in a matter of months. AI may follow the same pattern as past tech advancements, but it is on an exponentially accelerated timeline. We’re right at the start and will get to witness, and also hopefully shape, how this new technology will transform the world.
Much of the textbook chapter on the intelligence revolution is still being written, but I feel pretty confident that the chapter title will not be “job killer.” Given how fast things are changing, we shouldn’t have to wait too long to find out.

A.I. is detecting early signs of the disease, in some cases years before doctors would find the cancer on a traditional scan.  A chemotherapy alternative called immunotherapy is showing promise in treating cancer — and a new artificial intelligence tool could help ensure that patients have the best possible experience.    Immunotherapy, first approved in 2011, uses the cancer patient’s own immune system to target and fight cancer. While it doesn’t work for everyone, for the 15% to 20% who do see results, it can be life-saving.  WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?  Like any medication, immunotherapy has the potential for adverse side effects — which can be severe for some.   Studies show that some 10% to 15% of patients develop ""significant toxicities.""  A chemotherapy alternative called immunotherapy is showing promise in treating cancer — and a new artificial intelligence tool could help ensure that patients have the best possible experience. (iStock)Headquartered in Chicago, GE HealthCare — working in tandem with Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) in Nashville, Tennessee — has created an AI model that's designed to help remove some of the uncertainties surrounding immunotherapy.  Over the five years it’s been in development, the AI model was trained on thousands of patients’ electronic health records (EHRs) to recognize patterns in how they responded to immunotherapy, focusing on safety and effectiveness.AI MODEL COULD HELP PREDICT LUNG CANCER RISKS IN NON-SMOKERS, STUDY FINDS: ‘SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT’  ""The model predicts which patients are likely to derive the benefit from immunotherapy versus those patients who may not,"" said Jan Wolber, global digital product leader at GE HealthCare’s pharmaceutical diagnostics segment, in an interview with Fox News Digital.    ""It also predicts which patients have a likelihood of developing one or more significant toxicities.""When pulling data from the patient’s health record, the model looks at demographic information, preexisting diagnoses, lifestyle habits (such as smoking), medication history and more.  Immunotherapy, which was first approved in 2011, uses the cancer patient’s immune system to target and fight cancer.  (iStock)""All of these data are already being collected by the patient’s oncologist, or they’re filling out a form in the waiting room ahead of time,"" said Travis Osterman, a medical oncologist and associate chief medical information officer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in an interview with Fox News Digital.    (Osterman is working with Wolber on the development of the AI model.)BREAST CANCER BREAKTHROUGH: AI PREDICTS A THIRD OF CASES PRIOR TO DIAGNOSIS IN MAMMOGRAPHY STUDY""We're not asking for additional blood samples or complex imaging. These are all data points that we're already collecting — vital signs, diagnoses, lab values, those sorts of things.""  In a study, the AI model showed 70% to 80% accuracy in predicting patients’ responses to immunotherapies, according to an article published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Clinical Cancer Informatics.    ""While the models are not perfect, this is actually a very good result,"" Wolber said. ""We can implement those models with very little additional effort because there are no additional measurements required in the clinic.""‘Natural progression’This type of technology is ""a natural progression of what we've been doing in medicine for a very long time,"" Osterman said.  ""The only difference is, instead of surveying patients, we're taking the entirety of the medical record and looking for risk factors that contribute to an outcome,"" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.  The AI model was trained on thousands of patients’ electronic health records to recognize patterns in how they responded to immunotherapy, focusing on safety and effectiveness. (iStock)With immunotherapy, there is generally a lower response rate than with chemotherapy, Osterman noted — but some patients have ""incredible responses"" and ultimately become cancer-free.  ""I would be horrified to know that one of my patients that I didn't give immunotherapy to could have been one of the tremendous responders,"" he told Fox News Digital.   Conversely, Osterman noted that in rare cases, immunotherapy can have some serious side effects.""I would be horrified to know that one of my patients that I didn't give immunotherapy to could have been one of the tremendous responders."" ""I would say about half of patients don't have any side effects, but for those who do, some of them are really life-altering,"" he said.   ""We don't want to miss anyone, but we also don't want to harm anyone.""    At the core of the AI project, Osterman said, is the ability to ""put all the information into the exam room,"" so the oncologist can counsel the patient about the risks and benefits of this particular therapy and make the best, most informed decision about their care. Combining technology and human expertiseDr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, was not involved in the AI model’s development but commented on its potential.""AI models are emerging that are helping to manage responses to cancer treatments,"" he told Fox News Digital.   Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, was not involved in the AI model’s development but weighed in on its potential. ""AI models are emerging that are helping to manage responses to cancer treatments,"" he said. (Dr. Marc Siegel)  ""These can allow for more treatment options and be more predictive of outcome.""  AI models like this one are an example of ""the essential future of personalized medicine,"" Siegel said, ""where each patient is approached differently and their cancer is analyzed and treated with precision using genetic and protein analysis.""As long as physicians and scientists remain in charge — ""not a computer or robot"" — Siegel said that ""there is no downside.""Potential limitations    The AI model does carry some degree of limitations, the experts acknowledged.""The models obviously do not return 100% accuracy,"" Wolber told Fox News Digital.

Rather, it's a tool that provides data points to the clinician and informs them as they make patient management decisions.Osterman pointed out that the AI model uses a ""relatively small dataset.""""We would love to be able to refine our predictions by learning on bigger data sets,"" he said.  The tool is not a ""black box"" that will provide a surefire answer, one of the researchers said; rather, it's a tool that provides data points to clinicians and informs them as they make patient management decisions. (iStock)    The team is currently looking for partnerships that will enable them to test the AI model in new settings and achieve even higher accuracy in its predictions.   Another challenge, Osterman said, is the need to integrate these AI recommendations into the workflow.""This is pretty new for us as a health care community, and I think we're all going to be wrestling with that question,"" he said.   CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER  Looking ahead, once the AI model has achieved the necessary regulatory approvals, GE HealthCare plans to make the technology available for widespread use by clinicians — perhaps even expanding to other care areas, such as neurology or cardiology.There is also the potential to incorporate it into drug development.""We don't want to miss anyone, but we also don't want to harm anyone.""   ""One of the things that drug makers struggle with is that some of the agents that may be really useful for some patients could be really toxic for others,"" Osterman said.""If they were able to pick which patients could go into a trial and exclude patients with the highest risk of toxicity, that could mean the difference between that drug being made available or not.""

Labor’s Principles on Use of Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and Technology in the Workplace

 April 11, 2024April 24, 2024 



Labor’s Principles on Use of Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and Technology in the Workplace
Labor has developed principles for the use of Artificial Intelligence, automation, and other technology in the workplace that can harness the potential to improve working conditions and make work safer and more productive.

There is nothing inevitable about AI technology. The future of workers, and the extent to which AI and other technology will displace workers or impact their work, should not be determined by tech companies. The Labor Movement defends the interests of all workers by challenging corporate interests’ push to replace people with robots. Truck drivers, bus drivers, janitors, construction workers, social workers, firefighters, and nurses are not replaceable, and our unions will stand together to protect good jobs and the quality services our members provide.
Workers must have control over the use of technology at work. There is no substitute for a collective bargaining agreement that allows workers to negotiate the uses of technology in the workplace. Regulation of AI, automated decision systems, automation, and other technologies should require that workers are part of the development, procurement, and deployment of technology at work. Technology should make work safer, more productive, and increase workers’ skills, not worsen conditions or eliminate jobs. The best way to do that is to treat technology, including AI, as a tool for workers to control, not that controls them.
Workers have a right to informed consent. Before implementing workplace technologies, workers should have the right to be notified of the technology, justification for its use, what data will be collected, and how it will be used. Workers must have the right to access and control the use of their data, especially when used to make employment decisions. Workers should control the use of their data, work product, and likeness whether used to train generative AI systems or to be used by third parties.
Human oversight is critical. New technology like AI is a powerful tool, but it is just a tool that needs human oversight. There must be a role for humans in making and overseeing all consequential workplace and employment decisions. This includes decisions that impact the public such as service provision, benefit eligibility, court proceedings, or other public programs. Automation, such as driverless vehicles, also must have human oversight with the ability to override if necessary. There are also some decisions that are too important for technology to be the sole decision-maker, such as for hiring, discipline, terminations, work quotas, or wage setting.
Prevent the abuse of technology. Technology has the power to mine our data and track and control our every move. Facial recognition, predictive behavioral analysis, profiling, and other surveillance technology should not be used on or off the job. This is especially important when it is used to profile or predict the likelihood of workers to organize or file complaints or be used to prevent workers from exercising their right to organize or other protected rights. Algorithmic management tools or quotas should never be allowed to require a worker to violate labor or health and safety laws. Technology should be tested and assessed before deployment to screen out the potential for abuse or law violations. The companies that train AI or other technology should be held liable when technology causes harm, violates the law, or has other adverse impacts.
There is dignity in work, and we must fight to protect good jobs. AI and other technology could potentially displace millions of workers. Technology policies should preserve jobs and avoid mass displacement of workers in the hopes that public programs will fill the gap.

Which tech skills are growing in value? That’s a crucial question for tech professionals who want to maximize their pay and focus their learning time on skills and tools that will pay off.

Analyst firm Foote Partners has just updated its IT Skills Demand and Pay Trends Report (ITSDPT) and IT Skills and Certifications Pay Volatility Index. Many non-certified tech skills earned a pay premium above their base salary equivalent, as well as a market value increase over the past six months. That’s good news for many who work in tech—but which skills saw the biggest increase?

Fortunately, we have a chart:  

For those unfamiliar with the term “MLOps,” it’s “machine learning operations,” or the workflows and techniques associated with machine learning projects. As you might suspect, it has a lot in common with DevOps, which is a set of methodologies and tools that allow organizations to efficiently built and deploy software and apps. 

The other skills on this list lean heavily into data and artificial intelligence (A.I.). If you specialize in anything from prompt engineering to deep learning, there’s demand for your skills, and you can likely leverage that for superior compensation. It’s also helpful to keep in mind that more A.I.-related jobs are coming online: Last month, CompTIA classified 65,241 jobs as “emerging tech,” and 19,100 of those involved artificial intelligence in some way (either as the job itself, or heavily relying on artificial intelligence skills). 

Even if you’re not interested in a job that focuses on A.I., a plethora of tech jobs are integrating A.I. and data tools into their respective workflows. 

If you’re interested in learning more about A.I. on your own, many online courses can help. For example, online learning portals such as Coursera have instructional modules from the likes of DeepLearning.AI, IBM, Vanderbilt University, and other institutions. For those who want a certificate to slap on a resume, Udacity also offers a generative A.I. “nanodegree” program, with a focus on skills such as the OpenAI API, image pre-processing, and more; prerequisite skills include Python, neural networks, and more. Those interested in generative A.I. can turn to Google, which has multiple online tutorials and videos exploring that technology. 
Working effectively in A.I. also involves transferrable skills such as critical thinking and a commitment to continuous learning (essential when you consider how fast this technology is evolving). If you have these skills, you may already be well on your way to a career in A.I., even if you haven’t yet learned the right techniques and tools.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked both awe and apprehension. While hailed for its potential to revolutionize industries and streamline processes, there’s a growing concern that AI could pose a significant threat to employment generation. This sentiment has ignited a fervent debate among experts and policymaker’s worldwide. Proponents of AI argue that it has the capacity to enhance productivity, efficiency, and innovation across various sectors. From automated manufacturing processes to intelligent customer service systems, AI applications promise to streamline operations and unlock new avenues for growth. Advocates often highlight the potential for AI to create new job opportunities, particularly in specialized fields such as data science, machine learning, and robotics.   However, amidst the optimism, skeptics raise valid concerns about the darker implications of widespread AI adoption. One of the most pressing apprehensions revolves around the displacement of human labour by intelligent machines. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, there’s a looming threat that they could render certain jobs obsolete, leading to widespread unemployment and economic upheaval. The manufacturing industry serves as a poignant example of this phenomenon. With the rise of automated assembly lines and robotic technologies, traditional manufacturing roles have dwindled, leaving many workers displaced. Similar trends are observed across various sectors, including retail, transportation, and customer service, where AI-powered solutions are increasingly replacing human workers.   Moreover, the integration of AI into white-collar professions is raising concerns about the future of knowledge-based jobs. Advanced algorithms and machine learning algorithms are increasingly capable of performing tasks that were once exclusive to human intellect, such as data analysis, legal research, and even creative endeavors like content generation. This shift poses a significant challenge for workers whose livelihoods depend on cognitive skills and expertise. Critics caution that unless proactive measures are taken to address the potential socio-economic ramifications of AI, the widening gap between technological advancement and employment opportunities could exacerbate inequality and social unrest. As AI continues to reshape the labour market, policymakers face the daunting task of navigating the delicate balance between innovation and job preservation.   In response to these challenges, calls for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of AI on employment are gaining traction. Investing in education and training is paramount for preparing individuals for an AI-driven economy. This involves prioritizing lifelong learning programs that impart technical skills like data science and programming, as well as nurturing critical thinking, adaptability, and creativity. By prioritizing education, societies can ensure their workforce remains agile and equipped to navigate the evolving landscape of work. Reskilling and up skilling initiatives are vital to help workers transition into new roles that complement AI technologies. Governments and businesses should invest in tailored programs catering to diverse industries and demographics, ensuring inclusivity and preventing anyone from being left behind due to automation. Empowering individuals through reskilling and up skilling opportunities enables them to adapt to changing job requirements and seize new employment prospects.   Ethical AI deployment and robust social safety nets are essential components in shaping a future where AI augments human capabilities while safeguarding against negative impacts on employment. Establishing ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks ensures responsible AI deployment, mitigating unintended consequences like bias and discrimination. Implementing social safety nets such as universal basic income and healthcare coverage provides support for workers facing job displacement, fostering economic stability and facilitating retraining for alternative employment opportunities. Embracing these strategies fosters a culture of innovation, inclusivity, and social responsibility, leading to a more resilient and equitable society for all.   As the debate over the impact of AI on employment rages on, one thing remains clear: the need for a proactive and inclusive approach to harnessing the potential of this transformative technology. While AI undoubtedly holds the promise of unparalleled progress, its implications for the future of work must be carefully considered to ensure a sustainable and equitable society in the age of automation. Thus, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both immense opportunities and significant challenges for employment generation. While AI has the potential to enhance productivity and innovation across various sectors, there are legitimate concerns about its impact on job displacement and economic inequality.   To navigate this complex landscape, proactive measures such as investing in education, reskilling initiatives, ethical AI deployment, and robust social safety nets are crucial. By embracing these strategies, societies can harness the transformative power of AI while ensuring a sustainable and inclusive future for all in the age of automation.     (Author is a Ph.D Scholar, University of Kashmir.

The new operating system is likely to be unveiled at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), and is expected to arrive with the latest iPhone 16 in September.Also Read | Apple removes Meta's WhatsApp, Threads from iOS store as China flags security concernsAccording to Bloomberg's Mark Gurnman, Apple is developing a large language model (LLM) that will be entirely on-device, meaning it will powered by the processor inside the phone instead of being run from the cloud. The use of the ‘on-device’ model for powering generative AI features on iOS 18 should result in a reduction in response time, make it easier for Apple to maintain privacy and may even run offline or in places with low internet connectivity.However, on-device LLMs are not backed by huge servers with billions of parameters (which power most commercial chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini) and as a result, are less powerful and knowledgeable in many cases. The Bloomberg report does state though that Apple could partner with Google, OpenAI or other providers in order to mitigate some of these issues.&nbsp;Gurnman also states that Apple could use a different marketing strategy for its AI features than the competition by stating how these tools help in improving the daily lives of users.&nbsp;Also Read | Apple pitches its $3,500 Vision Pro headset to businesses. Will it catch on?Notably, Apple has reportedly been in touch with companies like OpenAI and Google to improve the quality of AI features in iOS 18. However, Gurnman states that Apple's initial AI features will not be superior to the competition but the Cupertino-based tech giant's implementation of these tools could be a ‘game changer’.While modern smartphones are equipped with specialized components like AI processors, executing complex algorithms directly on the device remains a formidable task. This complexity is highlighted by Samsung's approach, where users are given the option to choose between running certain AI features locally or leveraging server-based processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OTTAWA — Worried artificial intelligence is coming for your job? So is the federal government — enough, at least, to set aside $50 million for skills retraining for workers. 
One of the centrepiece promises in the federal budget released Tuesday was $2.3 billion in investments aiming to boost adoption of the technology and the artificial intelligence industry in Canada.
But tucked alongside that was a promise to invest $50 million over four years “to support workers who may be impacted by AI.” Workers in “potentially disrupted sectors and communities” will receive new skills training through the Sectoral Workforce Solutions Program.
“There is a significant transformation of the economy and society on the horizon around artificial intelligence,” said Joel Blit, an associate professor of economics at the University of Waterloo.
Some jobs will be lost, others will be created, “but there’s going to be a transition period that could be somewhat chaotic.”
While jokes about robots coming to take jobs predate the emergence of generative AI systems in late 2022, the widespread availability of systems like ChatGPT made those fears real for many, even as workers across industries began integrating the technology into their workday.
In June 2023, a briefing note for Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland warned the impact of generative AI “will be felt across all industries and around 40 per cent of all working hours could be impacted.”
“Banking, insurance and energy appear to have higher potential for automation compared to other sectors,” says the note, obtained through access to information and citing information from Accenture. 
“This could have substantial impacts on jobs and skills requirements.”
The budget only singles out “creative industries” as an affected sector that will be covered by the program. In February, the Canadian TV, film, and music industries asked MPs for protection against AI, saying the tech threatens their livelihood and reputations.
Finance Canada did not respond to questions asking what other sectors or types of jobs would be covered under the program. 
“The creative industries was used as an illustrative example, and not intended as an exclusion of other affected areas,” deputy Finance spokesperson Caroline Thériault said in a statement. 
In an interview earlier this year, Bea Bruske, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said unions representing actors and directors have been very worried about how their likenesses or their work could be used by AI systems. But the “reality is that we have to look at the implication of AI in all jobs,” she said. 
Blit explained large language models and other generative AI can write, come up with new ideas and then test those ideas, analyze data, as well as generate computer programming code, music, images, and video.
Those set to be affected are individuals in white-collar professions, like people working in marketing, health care, law and accounting.
In the longer run, “it’s actually quite hard to predict who is going to be impacted,” he said. “What’s going to happen is that entire industries, entire processes are going to be reimagined around this new technology.”
AI is an issue “across sectors, but certainly clerical and customer service jobs are more vulnerable,” Hugh Pouliot, a spokesperson for the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said in an email.
The federal government has used AI in nearly 300 projects and initiatives, new research published earlier this month revealed.
According to Viet Vu, manager of economic research at Toronto Metropolitan University’s the Dais, the impact of AI on workers in a sector like the creative industry doesn’t have to be negative. 
“That’s only the case if you adopt it irresponsibly,” he said, pointing out creative professionals have been adopting new digital tools in their work for years. 
He noted only four per cent of Canadian businesses are using any kind of artificial intelligence or machine learning. “And so we’re really not there yet for these frontier models and frontier technologies” to be making an impact. 
When it comes to the question of how AI will affect the labour market, it’s more useful to think about what types of tasks technology can do better, as opposed to whether it will replace entire jobs, Vu said. 
“A job is composed of so many different tasks that sometimes even if a new technology comes along and 20, 30 per cent of your job can be done using AI, you still have that 60, 70 per cent left,” he said.
“So it’s rare that (an) entire occupation is actually sort of erased out of existence because of technology.”
Finance Canada also did not respond to questions about what new skills the workers would be learning.
Vu said there are two types of skills it makes sense to focus on in retraining — computational thinking, or understanding how computers operate and make decisions, and skills dealing with data. 
There is no AI system in the world that does not use data, he said. “And so being able to actually understand how data is curated, how data is used, even some basic data analytics skills, will go a really long way.”
But given the scope of the change the AI technology is set to trigger, critics say a lot more than $50 million will be necessary.
Blit said the money is a good first step but won’t be “close to enough” when it comes to the scale of the coming transformation, which will be comparable to globalization or the adoption of computers.
Valerio De Stefano, Canada research chair in innovation law and society at York University, agreed more resources will be necessary. 
“Jobs may be reduced to an extent that reskilling may be insufficient,” and the government should look at “forms of unconditional income support such as basic income,” he said. 
The government should also consider demanding AI companies “contribute directly to pay for any social initiative that takes care of people who lose their jobs to technology” and asking “employers who reduce payrolls and increase profits thanks to AI to do the same.”
“Otherwise, society will end up subsidizing tech businesses and other companies as they increase profit without giving back enough for technology to benefit us all.”

Fostering a culture of lifelong learning: Addressing job displacement requires investing in training programmes that furnish employees with the competencies to collaborate with AI technologies, emphasising technical and soft skills. 
Maintaining human oversight Human supervision is vital for monitoring AI operations, serving as a safety net for error correction and intervention to ensure ethical and equitable outcomes. 
Unlocking the opportunities 
Despite the risks, AI offers immense opportunities for enhancing efficiency, spurring innovation and fostering business growth, such as: 
Enhancing operational efficiency: Automating routine tasks with AI frees employees for more complex and fulfilling work, boosting productivity and job satisfaction. 
Driving innovation: AI’s advanced data analysis capabilities can unveil previously inaccessible insights, propelling innovation across product development, marketing and customer service. 
Personalisation at scale: AI facilitates personalised customer experiences on a large scale, improving satisfaction and loyalty by tailoring interactions to individual preferences. 
Predictive analytics for decision making: Leveraging AI for predictive insights enables businesses to anticipate market trends and customer behaviours, informing strategic decision making. 
Harnessing AI’s full potential 
Maximising AI’s benefits requires a strategic approach that includes continuous learning, fostering AI literacy across the organisation, committing to ethical AI usage, and promoting collaboration. 
Real-world examples of AI in the workplace 
From healthcare’s predictive patient care to financial fraud detection and customer service enhancements via chatbots, AI is demonstrating its transformative potential across various sectors, underscoring its role in driving efficiency and innovation. 
Strategies for successful AI integration 
Integrating AI effectively into the workplace transcends technological implementation, necessitating a holistic view that encompasses organisational culture, employee engagement, and ongoing improvement. Essential strategies include securing leadership support, engaging and training employees, starting with pilot projects, and forging partnerships to enhance AI capabilities. 
Looking forward: the future of AI in the workplace 
The intersection of AI and human intelligence is shaping a future workplace characterised by collaborative innovation and efficiency. However, this future also emphasises the need for ethical AI design and policies to ensure a fair transition into this new era. 
Conclusion 
Navigating AI’s integration into the workplace involves understanding and mitigating associated risks while embracing its opportunities for growth and innovation. Achieving successful AI integration hinges on a balanced approach that marries strategic implementation with ethical practices and continuous adaptation. The synergy between human and artificial intelligence promises a transformative impact on the workplace, enhancing productivity, creativity and overall wellbeing.

Global furniture retailer IKEA has long been at the forefront of tech-driven retail innovation. This includes artificial intelligence and augmented reality – two technologies that it has leveraged successfully to improve customer experience and service.


Now, it’s unleashing the power of generative AI to give customers even more power when it comes to designing their ideal homes. It’s also created an ethical AI task force made up of experts from across the entire business to ensure this hugely transformative technology is rolled out responsibly.

It is also investing heavily in skilling its staff so that the entire workforce can effectively use AI to solve problems and drive efficiency.

Recently, I was joined for my podcast by Parag Parekh, Chief Digital Officer at IKEA Retail (Ingka Group), who talked me through the company’s plans and philosophy around digital technology and generative AI in particular. So, let’s take a look at some of the innovative ways it’s being used.

Enhancing Customer Experience
IKEA has unveiled a new generative AI chatbot powered by ChatGPT, with the aim of giving every customer their own AI design assistant.
Initially rolling out in the US, with further expansion to follow, the chatbot can answer questions about products and purchases, as well as make personalized design suggestions.
It’s intended to be used alongside IKEA Kreativ, an innovative online tool that lets users visualize and design their own living spaces in a mixed-reality environment.

Parekh tells me, “If I take a traditional user journey pre the AI era – typically it would be visiting our website … you decide what you really want in your home and then you put it into the basket, come to our stores to check that out, then you complete the purchase and have it delivered to your home.

“Now, come AI … maybe the customer journey is different. You probably aren’t looking at single pieces of furniture, but you’re looking at furnishing your home, bringing that to life. We allow you to actually take a scan of your room and give you an experience of what that furniture would look like.”
With the power of generative AI, users can erase existing furniture and replace it with new items to get an idea of the look and feel that can be achieved.
But it doesn’t end there. Customers can then interact with the AI to give it more information – what style – traditional, Scandinavian, modern – are they looking for? What color schemes do they like? What about the lighting? What is the budget? The AI can then generate any number of options and variations to browse and choose between. It’s a bit like having a professional interior decorator sit with you, helping you create the look you want.
“That’s something that we are experimenting with. You already see part of it with what we have released, but it’s something that’s in the works, and we are working with our creative and planning services to say, how do we really change the customer experience?""
IKEA’s staff, too, will benefit from generative AI tools, particularly from something that Parekh refers to as the “AI toolbox”.
Built on a custom version of Microsoft’s Bing co-pilot, it lets them quickly create content and assets that demonstrate products in relevant ways for customers.
Parekh gives the example of repurposing marketing material for different audiences and markets.
“Here’s a picture of a sofa that’s available on our website … now we’re going into Christmas, and we need to adapt it so that the images and content are relevant to a Christmas campaign.”
Traditionally, this would have involved all of the effort and expense of conducting a new photoshoot and launch campaign.
“You want some Christmas decorations, and the toolbox helps you generate an image with a Christmas tree behind the sofa, and all of a sudden, you have it ready.”

AI In Operations And Supply Chain
Along with cutting-edge generative AI projects like this, IKEA is invested in many “traditional” AI operations aimed at driving efficiency and cutting waste.
This includes optimizing the space used in its fleets of delivery and supply vehicles and using drones to monitor warehouse inventory across 16 of its European stores. It also uses demand sensing to forecast short-term consumer demand patterns. One example has enabled IKEA Portugal to improve the accuracy of its demand forecasting by five percent.
In its brand new 25,000 cubic meter distribution center in Tianjin, near Beijing, China, it is testing Autonomous Mobile Robots. These are designed to pick and pack its 9,500 products in a way that improves working conditions for warehouse staff and more efficiently uses filling and packaging materials, delivering improved sustainability.
Parekh highlights the transformative journey of evolving from traditional physical retail towards omnichannel retailing, emphasizing the need for disruption in the supply chain. He points out the emergence of new expenses, including those associated with handling, storage, and delivery in this new retail environment. Parekh says, ""Here we are looking into how do we use AI to help us to bring affordability back into our supply chain … how do you put in an algorithm which optimizes for cost but also optimizes for a greener planet, and make sure that we ship the product from where it’s the most available and [also] the most convenient for the customer?""

Ethical And Responsible AI
IKEA’s AI task force has been put together to ensure this world-changing technology is rolled out in a way that will be beneficial for as many of its customers as possible while minimizing the potential for it to cause harm.
Parekh says, “This is one of the critical aspects where organizations need to take a much stronger stance.”
At the root of this is a human-centric approach, which involves starting every initiative by asking questions about what it will mean for customers and staff, as well as wider communities in general.
Parekh stresses the need to prioritize human values, asking if actions respect human agency and dignity and if a people-focused approach is central to all initiatives. Affirming these principles, he notes, paves the way for a thorough analysis of various use cases. This approach is characterized by a commitment to fairness, bias elimination, equity, inclusiveness, and privacy respect. Above all, he emphasizes that transparency is key. This commitment started with the introduction of a ""data promise"" in 2020 and continued recently with the relaunch of the company's digital ethics policy in 2023.
In order to ensure staff have the knowledge and understanding needed to implement this, IKEA has rolled out an AI literacy program that aims to train 3,000 staff in the fundamentals of ethical and responsible AI in 2024.
Parekh says, “We believe that 60 percent of our employees will need to be reskilled to do the jobs of tomorrow. And we’d rather start now to make sure that they are ready … that they are embracing it.”

         — 
    


            The use of artificial intelligence will reduce the number of workers at thousands of companies over the next five years, according to a global survey of C-suite executives published Friday.
    

            The wide-ranging poll of 2,000 executives, conducted by Swiss staffing firm Adecco Group in collaboration with research firm Oxford Economics, showed that 41% of them expect to employ fewer people because of the technology.
    

            The survey’s results provide another indication of the potential for AI and generative AI — which can create original text, images and other content in response to prompts from users — to revolutionize employment and the way people work.

            AI is emerging “as a great disruptor in the world of work,” Denis Machuel, chief executive of Adecco Group, said in a statement. “Companies must do more to re-skill and redeploy teams to make the most of this technological leap and avoid unnecessary upheaval.”
    

            The executives surveyed work in 18 industries — including energy, retail and the automotive sector — in nine countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany and Japan. Their workforces represent white-collar and blue-collar jobs.

            Some 46% of executives said they would redeploy employees internally if their jobs were impacted by AI. And two-thirds said they planned to recruit people skilled in AI compared with just over one-third who said they would train their existing workforce in the technology.
    

            The survey makes for grimmer reading for workers than another recent large poll, conducted by the World Economic Forum last year. Responses from more than 800 global companies showed that a quarter of them expected AI to cause job losses, while half thought the technology would create new jobs.
    

            The WEF said employers expected most technologies, including AI, to be “a net positive” for jobs over the following five years. “Big data analytics, climate change and environmental management technologies, and encryption and cybersecurity are expected to be the biggest drivers of job growth,” it noted.
    

            Still, that offers little consolation to the workers AI has already helped push out. In the past year, some tech firms, including file storage service Dropbox and language-learning app Duolingo, have cited AI as a reason for making lay-offs.
    

            Goldman Sachs economists said in March last year that as many as 300 million full-time jobs could be lost or diminished globally by the rise of generative AI, with white-collar workers likely to be the most at risk.

				Sant'Anna Magazine




A new EU-OSHA discussion paper on the application of artificial intelligence to regulate and manage the workforce, realised by Maria Enrica Virgillito, Associate Professor of Economics at the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, and Jacopo Staccioli (Department of Economic Policy, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan), has just been released. The discussion paper is part of the EU Healthy Workplace Campaign “Safe and healthy work in the digital age”.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is shifting the nature of work and work relationships. This paper maps AI-based worker management (AIWM) technologies and their sectoral penetration, through analysis of patent data and content. It puts forward a measurement-based approach that can be used to investigate the impact of AIWM technologies on the workforce, tasks and functions. The findings point to the adverse impact that AIWM can have on workers’ safety and health in terms of control, monitoring, profiling, and more in general techno-stress. Importantly, the research shows only a marginal fraction of patents aimed at improving human wellbeing, underscoring a lack in corporate interest to employ such technologies to improve OSH. On the contrary, the main scopes of application include productivity increases and efficiency gains.

 After a year of ChatGPT, is academia getting to grips with generative AI?         


Students love it but faculty typically hate it. Both are asking for help with it. But how close are institutions to devising AI policies that protect both academic integrity and student employability? New York University Abu Dhabi vice-chancellor Mariët Westermann offers her reflections

Armed with a $2 billion war chest, they’re trying to transform KPMG so its 270,000 workers are trained to use generative artificial intelligence from drafting meeting minutes to analyzing tax documents, from writing spreadsheet formulas to letting their staffers experiment with novel uses in a safe, digital sandbox.  “We’re attempting to put AI into everything we do,” said Steve Chase, vice chair of AI and digital innovation for KPMG US. “That is our mission statement.”Almost all of the 220 top executives at companies the US firm surveyed recently said they planned to invest in generative AI over the next year with nearly half doling out at least $100 million. And KPMG, which offers services from accounting to technology implementation, wants to be in position to compete for their business, said David Rowlands, KPMG’s global head of artificial intelligence. Bloomberg Tax recently sat down with Chase and Rowlands to discuss the firm’s AI vision. The newest form of the technology could be used to help marketing teams write copy faster or assist software developers to check the code they’re writing. Corporations could also use it to track and manage regulations and other legal obligations, Chase said.Mission: AI Training KPMG’s army of accountants and business consultants to use generative AI has been a top focus of the firm. The company wants those professional to serve as ambassadors of the technology, demonstrating how it could be used and knowledgeable enough to answer clients questions, Rowlands said.In January, the firm held a 24-hour marathon of training for staff at affiliates around the world and across service lines.Chase wants KPMG professionals to be able to answer clients’ top questions including how to use AI tools, he said. One of the challenges is developing training courses that keep pace with the technology’s rapid development. “The tech can change faster than the people can change,” Chase said.He predicts that AI skills will become a necessity for workers from accountants to coders to master to remain competitive in the labor market.Promised productivity gains however raise fresh questions about the firm’s own strategies—like whether to expand the role of its support centers that dot the globe and what type of work those locations should handle, Chase said.But the transition to generative AI provides an opportunity for the firm to grow. “There will be more roles for KPMG as a consequence,” Rowlands said.The Big Four firm is trying to get ahead of demand from clients, which is expected to soar over the coming year as companies pivot from experimenting with generative AI to preparing for wide-scale adoption.As a model to its clients, KPMG aims to demonstrate how it adopted the technology, the two leaders said. That includes supporting its workers to incorporate the controls needed to return reliable, verifiable results.Billions PlannedKPMG has leaned heavily on its partnership with Microsoft to put OpenAI and the tech giant’s copilot virtual assistant into the hands of its staffers. But the firm has also designed its own generative AI functions including a tool for tax clients to research their own documents a feature of the firm’s tax platform announced last month.Some tried-and-true methods are proving tough to supplant, however, including spreadsheet software that for decades has been the workhorse of CPA firms and accounting departments.KPMG staff now turn to generative AI to help them construct formulas for Excel—making spreadsheet queries one of the most common AI prompts, Chase said.It’s a race with competitors who are taking similar strides to help their clients find the best use cases and roll out tools that could reshape their workforce.The other Big Four firms weren’t far behind touting their AI bona fides when the technology burst onto the scene roughly a year ago.Since then, PwC’s US arms committed to spending at least $1 billion on the nascent technology. The firm has put generative AI into the hands of its staff lawyers and clients including a tool announced last month that can redline contracts and extract data among other features. Backed by a $1.4 billion investment, EY launched its own version of ChatGPT, called EYQ, in October to help the firm’s professionals brainstorm and conduct research. The firm has also made AI training available to its 400,000-person global workforce and launched a series of services to help clients adopt and to set up governance over the technolog, the firm said. Deloitte’s US affilite has launched a batch of tools to help its tax practice take the bite out of busy seasons, including a tool that lets staff describe how it wants data formatted. Other tools help staff prioritize what areas of a tax return to scrutinize. —with assistance from Isabel Gottlieb.

The New Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Role Balances AI Champion And Risk Manager 



Alla Valente, Senior Analyst                            

Cody Scott, Senior Analyst                              


                        Apr 3 2024                      











 



On March 28, 2024, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum, M-24-10 (basically a regulatory requirement for federal agencies), creating the new role responsible for operationalizing the Executive Order (EO) on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, issued last fall. Per the OMB memo, agencies named in the CFO Act will have 60 days to appoint a chief artificial intelligence officer (CAIO) with a remit to: 1) strengthen AI governance; 2) advance responsible AI innovation; and 3) manage risks from the use of AI.
While new role creation to introduce accountability for advancing the federal agenda isn’t new — in 2019, the OMB did the same in establishing the chief data officer (CDO) role to lead agency digital transformation efforts — what’s unique about the CAIO is the role’s level of authority, seniority, skill set, and broad risk management responsibilities.
We believe that the requirement for federal agencies will accelerate this role in the private sector. Tech execs can use the OMB memo as a starting point for the skills and requirements of a CAIO role, although the specific responsibilities for CAIOs will be unique to each organization’s AI goals, business strategies, and risk appetite. For a deeper understanding of risk management’s role in supporting AI, read Generative AI: What It Means For Governance, Risk, And Compliance.
The CAIO Has Broad Authority For Transformational Change
The OMB memo states that the CAIO role “must be a position at the Senior Executive Service [SES], Scientific and Professional, or Senior Leader level.” This unusually high rank is justified by noting that the CAIO must have the “necessary authority to perform the responsibilities in this section and must be positioned highly enough to engage regularly with other agency leadership, to include the Deputy Secretary or equivalent.” If the agency already has someone appointed to the role, the memo urges agencies to evaluate whether that individual needs additional authority to do their job at this level.

What To Know: The EO gives CAIOs broad responsibility over the coordination, innovation, and risk management for their agency’s use of AI. This position is more than just influencing policy and managing data calls (internal questionnaires) — instead, it requires development of partnership, and strategy, as well as direct operational involvement to bring about change. In other words, this role isn’t reactive. It’s not about simply mitigating AI’s downside risk (often a compliance initiative guised as “risk management”). Rather, it’s about promoting use of AI, which implies that orgs need a strategy and mature understanding of AI use aligned with mission objectives.
What To Avoid: Transformational change happens neither overnight nor in a vacuum. Since the OMB requires this position to be an SES, it speaks to the caliber of results expected from agency performance. Agencies can better plan for success by taking advantage of the existing process maturity across their CIO, CISO, CDO, and CFO teams by partnering to build a cohesive strategy for AI inventorying, risk management, and innovation. Those same processes are often a barrier to change initiatives, however, so leverage internal partnerships and set clear internal roles and responsibilities to clear operational hurdles early on.

This Ain’t Your Average Lateral Hire
The CAIO must have the skills, knowledge, and expertise to do the job, since the primary role of the CAIO is “coordination, innovation, and risk management for their agency’s use of AI specifically, as opposed to data or IT issues in general.” Internal hires are allowed, so long as they have “significant expertise in AI.” This is not a “hire now, learn on the job” position.

What To Know: When federal mandates require a new SES position, you know that the directive is more than just a compliance exercise. For example, in 2019, the OMB required agencies to appoint a chief data officer but without the SES seniority, which meant that the position would function inconsistently across agencies. This marks a shift in expectations by placing accountability and authority within the senior leadership team. It also means the position must be equally adept in technology, operations, and strategy.
What To Avoid: Don’t rush to appoint someone with an existing SES title and take external hires off the table. Given the scope, complexity, and guaranteed changes that this position will have to navigate, treat this directive as an opportunity to look for unique skills and long-term leadership. AI skills and knowledge are new, and few will have direct experience today. But equally as important is the role’s focus on risk management and innovation. Make these attributes key requirements for the position, then determine the best hiring strategy.

A CAIO’s Responsibilities Mirror That Of A Chief Risk Officer
The role may have AI in the title, but risk management shouldn’t be overlooked. The responsibilities detailed in the memo section “Managing Risks from the Use of AI” read like a job description for what Forrester describes as a transformational chief risk officer (CRO) who understands that risk is necessary for growth and innovation and that risk management is an accelerator to go faster, not slower.

What To Know: AI inventories is a start. The CAIO, like a CRO, will need tools that help them identify AI risk, conduct risk assessments, and measure and monitor the agency’s ongoing performance and effectiveness toward AI. To be successful, this role requires an equivalent governance, risk, and compliance technology stack, not a single tool.
What To Avoid: The gut reaction for most OMB mandates is a request for information, but as often with manual collection methods, by the time the data is aggregated into a pretty dashboard, it’s already stale. Data calls alone will not make this role successful nor sustainable. CAIOs will also need to master the five competencies of the Forrester Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Success Cycle — identify, evaluate, respond, monitor, and communicate — to keep pace with innovation and potential pitfalls that they create.

									Even GenAI-Trained Execs Are Confused About It (Our Survey Shows) — So Give Them Better Training				




										David Truog									


						3 hours ago					


				Do executives understand generative AI (genAI) better than consumers do? Nope — apparently not. Our research shows that among consumers, generative AI is poorly understood or not at all (see The State Of Consumer Usage Of Generative AI, 2024). And you might think that execs would be better informed, considering the high-stakes decisions they must […]

Much has been written about the potential impact of generative AI in the workplace, but the perspective of one set of key stakeholders has often been left out: workers themselves.  What’s more, research has found that incorporating the perspective of end users such as workers into the development and implementation of new technologies tends to produce better results than strictly top-down technology development approaches.
About the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research (IWER)IWER is a multidisciplinary research and teaching unit that is located within the MIT Sloan School.  IWER’s mission is to conduct and disseminate cutting-edge research that improves the lives of workers and their loved ones and guides managers in crafting a successful and inclusive future of work.

So argues a new working paper coauthored by an interdisciplinary team of  MIT researchers. The new paper, “Bringing Worker Voice into Generative AI,” was recently published online as part of a new collection called An MIT Exploration of Generative AI. This collection consists of 25 papers on the societal impact of generative AI that were authored by members of the MIT faculty, with support from seed grants from MIT.  “Bringing Worker Voice Into Generative AI” was coauthored by Thomas A. Kochan, the George M. Bunker Professor Emeritus at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a member of the faculty of the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research (IWER); Ben Armstrong, Executive Director and Research Scientist at the MIT Industrial Performance Center; Julie Shah, the H.N. Slater Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT and Director of the Interactive Robotics Group at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); Emilio J. Castilla, the NTU Professor of Work and Organization Studies at MIT Sloan and Co-Director of IWER; Ben Likis, 2024 MBA Candidate at MIT Sloan; and Martha E. Mangelsdorf, Director of Strategic Communications at IWER.
The researchers conducted more than 50 interviews with a cross-section of stakeholders that included AI developers, business leaders, labor leaders, academic experts, and policymakers. In their interviews with AI developers, the authors learned that some factors weigh against incorporating worker input into the design of AI tools—including the pressure technology vendors feel to bring products to market quickly, without taking the time to incorporate worker input. “A number of our interviewees, along with the published works by scholars, suggest that there is a bias toward labor-displacing/replacing humans in the minds of many inventors or technology vendors,” Kochan, Armstrong, Shah, Castilla, Likis, and Mangelsdorf write.
But the authors also found examples of other approaches. They note, for instance, that Microsoft Corp. recently formed a partnership with the AFL-CIO labor federation to share information about how AI is impacting the workplace and to incorporate worker voice and experiences into the development of AI technology. Kochan et al. see this as an approach that might be a model.
In general, “the broader the set of stakeholders involved in defining the problems and opportunities that generative AI technologies can address, the more likely it is that these tools will be used to augment how workers do their jobs rather than displace them,” Kochan, Armstrong, Shah, Castilla, Likis, and Mangelsdorf write.
The authors also argue that, more than many previous new technologies, generative AI is particularly conducive to “bottom-up” innovation processes by workers and teams who use the tools. “This ‘democratization’ feature of generative AI opens up possibilities for the workforce to exert greater influence in how the technology evolves than was possible during many prior technological changes,” Kochan et al. observe. Moreover, the authors’ interviews with business leaders revealed that some companies are indeed incorporating “bottom-up” input from employees as one part of generating promising use cases for generative AI.
The research team also interviewed U.S. labor leaders, and the authors observe that unions have both an increasing interest and capacity to engage proactively with other stakeholders about the impact of AI. Examples include the partnership with Microsoft and collective bargaining agreements reached in 2023 between the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA); these new collective bargaining agreements incorporate protections for members of those unions regarding the use of generative AI in their professions.
The authors conclude with set of recommendations designed to encourage the incorporation of the perspective of the workforce into four phases of AI design and development: 1) defining the problems and opportunities to be addressed; 2) designing the technical and work process features that need to be integrated; 3) educating and training the workforce in the skills needed; and 4) ensuring a fair transition and compensation for those whose jobs are affected.
“We see this report as a first step in encouraging ongoing research, teaching, and outreach by MIT faculty and students to help bring the voices of the workforce into generative AI,” Kochan, Armstrong, Shah, Castilla, Likis, and Mangelsdorf conclude. “We hope this report serves as a catalyst for taking up this critical challenge and opportunity.”

An agreement, signed by Michelle Donelan, the U.K. Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, sets out a plan for collaboration between the two governments.“I think of [the agreement] as marking the next chapter in our journey on AI safety, working hand in glove with the United States government,” Donelan told TIME in an interview at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. on Monday. “I see the role of the United States and the U.K. as being the real driving force in what will become a network of institutes eventually.”The U.K. and U.S. AI Safety Institutes were established just one day apart, around the inaugural AI Safety Summit hosted by the U.K. government at Bletchley Park in November 2023. While the two organizations’ cooperation was announced at the time of their creation, Donelan says that the new agreement “formalizes” and “puts meat on the bones” of that cooperation. She also said it “offers the opportunity for them—the United States government—to lean on us a little bit in the stage where they're establishing and formalizing their institute, because ours is up and running and fully functioning.”The two AI safety testing bodies will develop a common approach to AI safety testing that involves using the same methods and underlying infrastructure, according to a news release. The bodies will look to exchange employees and share information with each other “in accordance with national laws and regulations, and contracts.” The release also stated that the institutes intend to perform a joint testing exercise on an AI model available to the public.“The U.K. and the United States have always been clear that ensuring the safe development of AI is a shared global issue,” said Secretary Raimondo in a press release accompanying the partnership’s announcement. “Reflecting the importance of ongoing international collaboration, today’s announcement will also see both countries sharing vital information about the capabilities and risks associated with AI models and systems, as well as fundamental technical research on AI safety and security.” Safety tests such as those being developed by the U.K. and U.S. AI Safety Institutes are set to play an important role in efforts by lawmakers and tech company executives to mitigate the risks posed by rapidly progressing AI systems. OpenAI and Anthropic, the companies behind the chatbots ChatGPT and Claude, respectively, have published detailed plans for how they expect safety tests to inform their future product development. The recently passed E.U. AI Act and U.S. President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI both require companies developing powerful AI models to disclose the results of safety tests.Read More: Nobody Knows How to Safety-Test AIThe U.K. government under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has played a leading role in marshaling an international response to the most powerful AI models—often referred to as “frontier AI”—convening the first AI Safety Summit and committing £100 million ($125 million) to the U.K. AI Safety Institute. The U.S., however, despite its economic might and the fact that almost all leading AI companies are based on its soil, has so far committed $10 million to the U.S. AI Safety Institute. (The National Institute of Standards and Technology, the government agency that houses the U.S. AI Safety Institute, suffers from chronic underinvestment.) Donelan rejected the suggestion that the U.S. is failing to pull its weight, arguing that the $10 million is not a fair representation of the resources being dedicated to AI across the U.S. government.“They are investing time and energy in this agenda,” said Donelan, fresh off a meeting with Raimondo, who Donelan says “fully appreciates the need for us to work together on gripping the risks to seize the opportunities.” Donelan argues that in addition to the $10 million in funding for the U.S. AI Safety Institute, the U.S. government “is also tapping into the wealth of expertise across government that already exists.”Despite its leadership on some aspects of AI, the U.K. government has decided not to pass legislation that would mitigate the risks from frontier AI. Donelan’s opposite number, the U.K. Labour Party’s Shadow Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Peter Kyle, has said repeatedly that a Labour government would pass laws mandating that tech companies share the results of AI safety tests with the government, rather than relying on voluntary agreements. Donelan however, says the U.K. will refrain from regulating AI in the short term to avoid curbing industry growth or passing laws that are made obsolete by technological progress.“We don't think it would be right to rush to legislate. We've been very outspoken on that,” Donelan told TIME. “That is the area where we do diverge from the E.U. We want to be fostering innovation, we want to be getting this sector to grow in the UK.”The memorandum commits the two countries to developing similar partnerships with other countries. Donelan says that “a number of nations are either in the process of or thinking about setting up their own institutes,” although she did not specify which. (Japan announced the establishment of its own AI Safety Institute in February.) “AI does not respect geographical boundaries,” said Donelan. “We are going to have to work internationally on this agenda, and collaborate and share information and share expertise if we are going to really make sure that this is a force for good for mankind.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 By Editorial Staff


April 05, 2024 - Generative AI use cases and workforce management--specifically in light of severe labor shortages--dominated the conversation at HIMSS 2024.
Rich Birhanzel, senior managing director and global health lead at Accenture, shares his insights on these two pervasive and, at times, controversial issues facing the healthcare industry. Birhanzel highlighted the extensive conversation around AI applications, detailing the most common use cases. Alongside the enthusiasm for AI, he also addressed the growing focus on responsible use and privacy and security concerns.
Moreover, Birhanzel underscored the urgency of addressing the global crisis of patient access due to workforce shortages. He stressed the importance of automation through generative AI. However, this approach may require a cognitive shift as it will change providers' workflows, Birhanzel acknowledged. He emphasized the need for harmonization between technology and human workflows.


Rich Birhanzel:
[Intro clip] Patient access is the global crisis that we have in healthcare today. We don't have enough humans that are trained or could be trained to serve the healthcare needs. We have to embrace technology.

Kelsey Waddill:
Welcome to Season 2 of Industry Perspectives, coming to you from HIMSS 2024 in Orlando, Florida. I'm Kelsey Waddill, Multimedia Manager and Managing Editor at Xtelligent Healthcare Media. And if you didn't get to go to HIMSS this year, first of all, I'm sorry, it was awesome. And second, this episode is for you.
Today, we'll get to hear all the highlights from Rich Birhanzel, senior managing director and global health lead at Accenture, as he and I sit down to discuss some of the main themes of the conference. Rich also offered some of his own insights on workforce management and generative AI. He covered it all very succinctly, and I think you'll really appreciate his perspective. So without further ado, here's what he had to say.
Thank you, Rich, for coming on to Healthcare Strategies. It's a pleasure to get to sit down with you in person. We don't get this kind of opportunity very often. So I just want to start out by talking about, I'm sure you've been having a lot of really interesting conversations here at HIMSS. What are some of the ones that stand out to you? What are the topics that are swirling around here that you think are the most important for people to know about?
Rich Birhanzel:
READ MORE: How Healthcare Technology Can Improve, Worsen Provider BurnoutSo the two things that we've noted--and it's kind of what we expected--AI is everywhere. Everybody's talking about artificial intelligence and what the possibilities are, what the worries are, what progress has been made. So there's a whole lot of conversation about that. And then the second thing is the labor shortage that exists on the clinician side, the challenges that the health systems and hospitals are having in being able to serve as many patients as they were able to do before.
Kelsey Waddill:
And I'm sure those things can get tied together sometimes too because a lot of people are turning to AI as a sort of relief for workforce management right now.
Let's talk about the AI part first. Obviously, we've had a boom in generative AI use this year. Have there been any really interesting kind of use cases or implementations of generative AI that you've seen that you thought [were] maybe going to pick up steam this year?
Rich Birhanzel:
READ MORE: How Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning Impact Care CoordinationSo the progress in healthcare around gen AI--and we're seeing it here at the conferences as demonstrations--has been in maybe four areas.
Contact center is the first because it's very much focused on language and generative AI is particularly useful when you're talking about language. And so the ability to better enable call center agents and create some efficiencies in some of the work that they do is sort of the first place. And we're seeing quite a bit of maturity in the call center space with generative AI.
The second space is the delivery of technology. So, thinking about how you can use some of the generative AI tools to create efficiency in the creation of code, the testing of code, and whatever projects that health companies are pursuing. So this has come fairly quickly over the last couple of quarters, where we're seeing a maturity in the ability to change the way we think about technology delivery.
A third area would be in learning. So again, learning is typically a highly language-focused activity. And so we're seeing quite a bit of progress in the use of generative AI to reinvent the way that we're doing learning. And then also learning is a focused area on teaching people how to get more familiarized with generative AI and be able to use it. Whether it's a call center agent, a claims processor, a physician, a front desk person, whatever it may be, there's a certain amount of understanding that needs to exist.
And then the fourth area is the one that people get the most excited about and you see a lot of this energy over on the show floor, which is around the use of ambient listening technology to listen to a patient and physician, or a patient and nurse conversation and automatically create a patient summary to reduce the amount of administrative burden that clinicians have.
Right now, we see about 20 percent to 40 percent of a clinician's time being focused on documentation. And what these tools have the promise to deliver is to remove that kind of burden. Sometimes that's done while they're talking to the patient, so that can become more efficient. Oftentimes it's done after their workday is done, so then we can give them the opportunity to reset, refresh and get ready for the next day. So a whole lot of energy around these emerging technologies, and these are in the field now. We're seeing experience with it now, and it has the promise to address some of the clinician overload that we see and lack of clinical capacity that is a problem for all of us.
Kelsey Waddill:
Yeah, absolutely. I want to get to that in a second. I was curious, one of the big question marks with AI right now and more broadly in the healthcare system--especially with the Change Healthcare attack--is privacy and security around AI. I'm wondering if you've been having any conversations with people about that and what have been the prevailing thoughts about how to secure these newer technologies?
Rich Birhanzel:
So there's a significant amount of conversation about responsible use. And one of the elements of responsible use among others is the consideration around privacy and security. The point of view we have and what we are seeing people talk about is that we need to think about responsible use before we go deploy these use cases into the field. It has a lot to do with what's the data foundation that the generative AI or AI is based upon. If it's something that's controlled and known inside of a health system, then it's sort of got a certain confidence level because it's data they already have.
When you start to extend that into other data sources, then it becomes a little bit more difficult. And being able to understand what exposure is being created when we deploy these models is essential. And the key part of that is it has to be done early before it gets deployed. And we think about that as part of the responsible use space.
There's other things in there like making sure we don't see bias in the data or bias in the recommendations that are coming back, that we are mindful of health equity as we deploy these tools. Those are examples of things, but there's been a considerable amount of conversation about that. And I think the other consideration here too is the use of generative AI, or AI, to also improve information security and use it as a tool to enhance and improve the way that health organizations protect their data.
Kelsey Waddill:
Makes sense. I'm sure we could dive into that a lot more, but I did want to make sure that we get to the workforce management piece.
Rich Birhanzel:
Sure.
Kelsey Waddill:
And so, obviously, last year we had the Kaiser Permanente strike, partly over this very issue. We've seen a lot of outcry among the provider population about the workload that they're experiencing right now, the administrative burden that they're experiencing. Where is the focus right now in terms of how to address these outcries?
Rich Birhanzel:
It's a great point, and it is a top topic. Patient access is the global crisis that we have in healthcare today. It's not just a US issue, it's an issue around the world. And the truth is we don't have enough humans that are trained or could be trained to serve the healthcare needs that we have around the world. So we have to embrace technology to create efficiency and make better use of the talent that we do have.
The areas of focus right now are about enablement. They're about taking administrative tasks that a clinician, nurse, physician, whatever role on the care team might play and take that role, think about the administrative task, like the documentation of a patient summary. That's a good example. Or a discharge plan as another example. Generative AI and particularly connected ambient listening can do that now, the tech is here. But to get it right, we have to harmonize that tech with the work of the clinician.
So when we take those tasks away, you might have a physician--let's say that part of their normal course of engaging with a patient would be to take handwritten notes or they might prefer or choose to type right into an EMR. That's a cognitive process that has been matured over time. And sometimes they do that not just to document, sometimes maybe they're doing that to catch up to their thoughts and think about what they're going to say next to the patient. But when we take that away and it's just a straight conversation that's being listened to by a computer, and then it's nice that it's going to create a patient summary later, we're changing their cognitive process.
So the energy that needs to happen now to really bring this out at scale is to harmonize that technology with the humans that are going to benefit from it. And that work is in its very early stages. There's much more to be done there to think about how we connect that human experience and improve their work so that we get the end goal here, which is to reduce the burnout, to create some capacity so that the clinicians that we do have can accomplish more and have better experiences in the work that they do.
Kelsey Waddill:
Yeah, can you talk a little bit more about that harmonization process? What is involved? I mean, I imagine that involves a lot of conversation between providers and the innovators who are creating these?
Rich Birhanzel:
Yeah, so it's early stages right now, but the idea with this is to go look at... Let's just take the clinical visit as an example, a typical clinical visit. What does the process usually look like? A nurse might start by taking a few measurements, asking a few questions, some diagnostic, and enter that into the EMR. That might be a typical thing to do. And then after some time waiting for the doctor to come in, if that's what the next step is, then the doctor comes in, might verify some of that information, then start to have a more thorough diagnostic conversation. ""What's going on? How are you feeling?"" And so forth.
And what we're talking about here is taking that process and then re-imagining that process. Imagine a world where the nurse doesn't have to ask all those questions, or particularly doesn't have to document all those questions. We might not even need to do that process step at all. But if we do need to do it, it might just be the nurse talking to the person and we capture that information and automatically update the clinical record. And then the physician comes in the room, and again, they don't need to go back to the EMR, they don't need to go look at handwritten notes or whatever their source might be. They can just have the conversation. They'll know what the information is, they'll have some sort of display and the listening capability will pay attention to the conversation. It will store what's being learned back into the clinical record.
And if there's an order given of, ""hey, we need to go prescribe this,"" or ""we need to go do a certain test,"" that also automatically feeds in the background to create the order, to create whatever needs to come next. So when we do that, what we're really talking about is re-examining both the process, but also the roles of the people in the process--particularly the clinician, but in some cases, in some ways, even the patient. Because it'll feel very different to a patient when you don't have this back and forth of, ""I'm going to tell you something, you're going to go write it down."" It's just a conversation. We think it will feel better in the long run, but it might feel awkward initially. So we'll have to get through that learning curve.
Kelsey Waddill:
Yeah, that's super interesting because almost like a blend of workflow change, but also almost like psychology and philosophy, too.
Rich Birhanzel:
Yes. Very much behavioral science in this, because you're really changing a cognitive process. And what we want to do is really figure out what is that way of leveraging the tech that works best so that the physician and the nurse can do what they're really great at, and the patient can have a good experience, and we remove the things that can be handled easily by technology.
Kelsey Waddill:
To free up the workforce so that they have more time to actually see patients.
Rich Birhanzel:
Yeah.
Kelsey Waddill:
Yeah, amazing. Well, let's hope that this stuff kind of gets off the ground and we can get that sort of harmonization down quickly.
Rich Birhanzel:
Yeah.
Kelsey Waddill:
Well, thank you Rich so much for coming on to Healthcare Strategies, it's been a pleasure to talk with you.
Rich Birhanzel:
Yeah, thank you. Appreciate it.

But that hasn’t stopped lawyers and other legal workers from doing it anyway. Most legal professionals who have used generative AI in their practice have used the technology for legal research, according to data from Bloomberg Law’s 2024 Legal Operations and Technology survey.Respondents were asked how they have used generative AI in their practice, and were presented with a list of possible legal tasks, along with an option to respond that they haven’t used generative AI for work at all. Most respondents (54%) chose that option, saying that they have not used generative AI for work purposes. Among the 46% of respondents who have used AI for work, legal research was the most common way they reported using the technology in their practice. In fact, the use case more than doubled any of the other tasks on the list, except for drafting/templating communication (46%).  At an initial glance, the prevalence of using AI for legal research in early 2024 may appear surprising. There have been numerous headlines spotlighting attorney blunders while using generative AI for legal research that resulted in fake or improper citations being submitted to the court. And as a result, many courts are grappling with how to prevent—and punish—these instances. This recent push to sanction attorneys who file pleadings with AI-generated “caselaw” would seem to discourage legal professionals from using the technology for legal research. However, this type of scrutiny is all a necessary part of the process of technology adoption, especially in the legal industry. It’s worth remembering that just a few years ago, legal professionals had to confront eDiscovery technology and the implications of using technology-assisted review in conversations similar to the ones happening over generative AI now.The reality is, the usability concerns currently surrounding generative AI-powered legal research cannot be adequately addressed until the practice is adequately explored—which law firms, in-house legal departments, and even courts are currently doing.Results from the 2024 Legal Operations and Technology survey will be posted to Bloomberg Law’s Surveys, Reports, and Data Analysis page, which contains reports of the 2021, 2022, and 2023 versions of the survey.Bloomberg Law subscribers can find related content in our Legal Operations page and In Focus: Artificial Intelligence page.If you’re reading this on the Bloomberg Terminal, please run BLAW OUT <GO> to access the hyperlinked content, or click HERE to view the web version of this article.To contact the reporter on this story: Stephanie Pacheco at spacheco@bloombergindustry.comTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robert Combs at rcombs@bloomberglaw.com Learn more about Bloomberg Law or Log In to keep reading:  Learn About Bloomberg Law  AI-powered legal analytics, workflow tools and premium legal & business news.

The AI workforce at Meta has taken a hit following several high-level departures from the tech giant.
Employees are facing challenges in using AI for only existing and successful products rather than experimental projects, which is driving the shift.

Considering the growing demand for AI professionals, social media giant Meta has taken the lead in wooing AI engineers with attractive packages and benefits. However, the company is struggling to hold onto its AI team, with several key members seeking opportunities in AI startups. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has personally penned emails to such professionals in addition to the large salary packages and benefits.
At least three high-level AI employees, including Director of Generative AI Devi Parikh, research scientist Abhishek Das, and Director of Engineering Erik Meijer, have left Meta in recent weeks. Erik Meijer used to lead a 50-person Probability team that worked on machine learning infrastructure. While most of the team was laid off in 2022, Meijer continued working on machine learning frameworks. However, he, too, has now quit, stating that he has an AI startup in the works despite offers from the leading companies in the sector. Parikh and Das also have similar views.

Leading AI professionals increasingly opine that working on LLMs outside big tech companies is better. Meta itself has seen an exodus of more than 30% of employees in its AI projects since the start of 2023. The reasoning behind this is the need to improve access to computing resources and the unwillingness of big tech companies to invest in complex experimental projects despite having access to the billions required for training LLMs.
The departure of AI professionals from Big Tech firms is a trend that has contributed to the emergence of firms such as Anthropic, Cohere, OpenAI, and others. Such companies offer innovators the scope and pace of development that big companies cannot, owing to fears of disruption to the market and customers. Despite this disadvantage, companies like Meta, owing to their resources, will not struggle to meet their AI goals for the foreseeable future.

Those of us who are not lawyers understandably find it difficult to suss out what it really means, and what it does and doesn’t protect. Data scientists don’t spend a lot of time thinking about copyright, unless we’re choosing a license for our open source projects. Even then, sometimes we just skip past that bit and don’t really deal with it, even though we know we should. But the legal world is starting to take a close look at how copyright intersects with generative AI, and this could have a real impact on our work. Before we talk about how it is affecting the world of generative AI, let’s recap the truth of copyright.CopyrightUS copyright law is relevant to what are called “original works of authorship”. This includes things under these categories: literary; musical; dramatic; pantomimes and choreographic work; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; audio-visual works; sound recordings; derivative works; compilations; architectural works.Content must be written or documented to be copyrightable. “Ideas are not copyrightable. Only tangible forms of expression (e.g., a book, play, drawing, film, or photo, etc.) are copyrightable. Once you express your idea in a fixed form — as a digital painting, recorded song, or even scribbled on a napkin — it is automatically copyrighted if it is an original work of authorship.” — Electronic Frontier FoundationBeing protected means that only the copyright holder (the author or creator, descendants inheriting the rights, or purchaser of the rights) can do these things: make and sell copies of the works, create derivative works from the originals, and perform or display the works publicly.Copyright isn’t forever, and it ends after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Usually, this is 70 years after the author’s death or 95 years after publication of the content. (Anything from before 1929 in the US is generally in the “public domain”, which means it is no longer covered by copyright.)Why does copyright exist at all? Recent legal interpretations argue that the whole point is not to just let creators get rich, but to encourage creation so that we have a society containing art and cultural creativity. Basically we exchange money with creators so they are incentivized to create great things for us to have. This means that a lot of courts look at copyright cases and ask, “Is this copy conducive to a creative, artistic, innovative society?” and take that into consideration when making judgments as well.Fair UseIn addition, “fair use” is not a free pass to ignore copyright. There are four tests to decide if a use of content is “fair use”:The purpose and character of the second use: Are you doing something innovative and different with the content, or are you just replicating the original? Is your new thing innovative on its own? If so, it’s more likely to be fair use. Also, if your use is to make money, that is less likely to be fair use.The nature of the original: If the original is creative, it’s harder to break copyright with fair use. If it’s just facts, then you’re more likely to be able to apply fair use (think of quoting research articles or encyclopedias).Amount used: Are you copying the whole thing? Or just, say, a paragraph or a small section? Using as little as is necessary is important for fair use, although sometimes you may need to use a lot for your derivative work.Effect: Are you stealing customers from the original? Are people going to buy or use your copy instead of buying the original? Is the creator going to lose money or market share because of your copy? If so, it’s likely not fair use. (This is relevant even if you don’t make any money.)You have to meet ALL of these tests to get to be fair use, not just one or two. All of this is, of course, subject to legal interpretation. (This article is NOT legal advice!) But now, with these facts in our pocket, let’s think about what Generative AI does and why the concepts above are crashing into Generative AI.Generative AI RecapRegular readers of my column will have a pretty clear understanding of how generative AI is trained already, but let’s do a very quick recap.Giant volumes of data are collected, and a model learns by analyzing the patterns that exist in that data. (As I’ve written before: “Some reports indicate that GPT-4 had on the order of 1 trillion words in its training data. Every one of those words was written by a person, out of their own creative capability. For context, book 1 in the Game of Thrones series was about 292,727 words. So, the training data for GPT-4 was about 3,416,152 copies of that book long.”)When the model has learned the patterns in the data (for an LLM, it learns all about language semantics, grammar, vocabulary, and idioms), then it will be fine tuned by human, so that it will behave as desired when people interact with it. These patterns in the data may be so specific that some scholars argue the model can “memorize” the training data.The model will then be able to answer prompts from users reflecting the patterns it has learned (for an LLM, answering questions in very convincing human-sounding language).There important implications for copyright law in both the inputs (training data) and outputs of these models, so let’s take a closer look.Training Data and Model OutputTraining data is vital to creating generative AI models. The objective is to teach a model to replicate human creativity, so the model needs to see huge volumes of works of human creativity in order to learn what that looks/sounds like. But, as we learned earlier, works that humans create belong to those humans (even if they are jotted down on a napkin). Paying every creator for the rights to their work is financially infeasible for the volumes of data we need to train even a small generative AI model. So, is it fair use for us to feed other people’s work into a training data set and create generative AI models? Let’s go over the Fair Use tests and see where we land.The purpose and character of the second useWe could argue that using data to train the model doesn’t really count as creating a derivative work. For example, is this different from teaching a child using a book or a piece of music? The counter arguments are first, that teaching one child is not the same as using millions of books to generate a product for profit, and second, that generative AI is so keenly able to reproduce content that it’s trained on, that it’s basically a big fancy tool for copying work almost verbatim. Is the result of generative AI sometimes innovative and totally different from the inputs? If it is, that’s probably because of very creative prompt engineering, but does that mean the underlying tool is legal?Philosophically, however, machine learning is trying to reproduce the patterns it has learned from its training data as accurately and precisely as possible. Are the patterns it learns from original works the same as the “heart” of the original works?2. The nature of the originalThis varies widely across the different kinds of generative AI that exist, but because of the sheer volumes of data required to train any model, it seems likely that at least some of it would fit the legal criteria for creativity. In many cases, the whole reason for using human content as training data is to try and get innovative (highly diverse) inputs into the model. Unless someone’s going to go through the entire 1 trillion words for GPT-4 and decide which ones were or weren’t creative, I think this criteria is not met for fair use.3. Amount usedThis is kind of a similar issue to #2. Because, almost by definition generative AI training datasets use everything they can get their hands on, and the volume needs to be huge and comprehensive; there’s not really a “minimal necessary” amount of content.4. EffectFinally, the effect issue is a big sticking point for generative AI. I think we all know people who use ChatGPT or similar tools from time to time instead of searching for the answer to a question in an encyclopedia or newspaper. There is strong evidence that people use services like Dall-E to request visual works “in the style of [Artist Name Here]” despite some apparent efforts from these services to stop that. If the question is whether people will use the generative AI instead of paying the original creator, it certainly seems like that is happening in some sectors. And we can see that companies like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and OpenAI are making billions in valuation and revenue from generative AI, so they’re definitely not going to get an easy pass on this one.Copying as a Concept in ComputingI’d like to stop for a moment to talk about a tangential but important issue. Copyright law is not well equipped to handle computing generally, particularly software and digital artifacts. Copyright law was mostly created in an earlier world, where duplicating a vinyl record or republishing a book was a specialized and expensive task. But today, when anything on any computer can basically be copied in seconds with a click of the mouse, the whole idea of copying things is different from how it used to be. Also, keep in mind that installing any software counts as making a copy. A digital copy means something different in our culture than the kinds of copying that we had before computers. There are significant lines of questioning around how copyright should work in the digital era, because a lot of it no longer seems quite relevant. Have you ever copied a bit of code from GitHub or StackOverflow? I certainly have! Did you carefully scrutinize the content license to make sure it was reproducible for your use case? You should, but did you?New York Times v. OpenAINow that we have a general sense of the shape of this dilemma, how are creators and the law approaching the issue? I think the most interesting such case (there are many) is the one brought by the New York Times, because part of it gets at the meaning of copying in a way I think other cases fail to do.As I mentioned above, the act of duplicating a digital file is so incredibly ubiquitous and normal that it’s hard to imagine enforcing that copying a digital file (at least, without the intent to distribute that exact file to the global public in violation of other fair use tests) is a copyright infringement. I think this is where our attention needs to fall for the generative AI question — not just duplication, but effect on the culture and the market.Is generative AI actually making copies of content? E.g.,training data in, training data back out? The NYT has shown in its filings that you can get verbatim text of NYT articles out of ChatGPT, with very specific prompting. Because the NYT has a paywall, if this is true, it would seem to clearly violate the Effect test of Fair Use. So far, OpenAI’s response has been “well, you used many complicated prompts to ChatGPT to get those verbatim results”, which makes me wonder, is their argument that if the generative AI sometimes produces verbatim copies of content it was trained on, that’s not illegal? (Universal Music Group has filed a similar case related to music, arguing that the generative AI model Claude can reproduce lyrics to songs that are copyrighted nearly verbatim.)We are asking the courts to decide exactly how much and what kind of use of a copyrighted material is acceptable, and that is going to be challenging in this context — I tend to believe that using data for training should not be inherently problematic, but that the important question is how the model gets used and what effect that has.We tend to think of fair use as a single step, like quoting a paragraph in your article with citation. Our system has a body of legal thought that is well prepared for that scenario. But in generative AI, it’s more like two steps. To say that copyright is infringed, it seems to me that if the content gets used in training, it ALSO must be retrievable from the end model in a way that usurps the market for the original material. I don’t think you can separate out the quantity of input content used from the quantity that can be extracted verbatim as output. Is this actually true of ChatGPT, though? We are going to see what the courts think.Ars Technica, The Verge, TechDirtDMCAThere’s another interesting angle to these questions, which is whether or not DMCA (the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) has relevance here. You may be familiar with this law because it’s been used for decades to force social media platforms to remove music and film files that were published without the authorization of the copyright holder. The law was based on the idea that you can kind of go “whac-a-mole” with copyright violators, and get content removed one piece at a time. However, when it comes to training data sets, this obviously won’t fly—you’d need to retrain the entire model, at exorbitant cost in the case of most generative AI, removing the offending file or files from the training data. You could still use DMCA, in theory, to force the output of an offending model to be removed from a site, but proving which model produced the item will be a challenge. But that doesn’t get at the underlying issue of input+output as both being key to the infringement as I have described it.Questions of PowerIf these behaviors are in fact violating copyright, the courts still have to decide what to do about it. Lots of people argue that generative AI is “too big to fail” in a manner of speaking — they can’t abolish the practices that got us here, because everyone loves ChatGPT, right? Generative AI (we are told) is going to revolutionize [insert sector here]!While the question of whether copyright is violated still remains to be decided, I do feel like there should be consequences if it is. At what point do we stop forgiving powerful people and institutions who skirt the law or outright violate it, assuming it is easier to ask forgiveness than permission? It’s not entirely obvious. We would not have many innovations that we rely on today without some people behaving in this fashion, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s worth it. Is there a devaluation of the rule of law that comes from letting these situations pass by?Like many listeners of 99% Invisible these days, I’m reading The Power Broker by Robert Caro. Hearing about how Robert Moses handled questions of law in New York at the turn of the 20th century is fascinating, because his style of handling zoning laws seems reminiscent of the way Uber handled laws around livery drivers in early 2010’s San Francisco, and the way large companies building generative AI are dealing with copyright now. Instead of abiding by laws, they have taken the attitude that legal strictures don’t apply to them because what they are building is so important and valuable.I’m just not convinced that’s true, however. Each case is distinctive in some ways, of course, but the concept that a powerful man can decide that what he thinks is a good idea is inevitably more important than what anyone else thinks rubs me the wrong way. Generative AI may be useful, but to argue that it is more important than having a culturally vibrant and creative society seems disingenuous. The courts still have to decide whether generative AI is having a chilling effect on artists and creators, but the court cases being brought by those creators are arguing that it is.The FutureThe US Copyright Office is not ignoring these challenging problems, although they may be a little late to the party, but they have put out a recent blog post talking about their plans for content related to generative AI. However, it’s very short on specifics and only tells us that reports are forthcoming in the future. The three areas this department’s work is going to focus on are:“digital replicas”: basically deepfakes and digital twins of people (think stunt doubles and actors having to get scanned at work so they can be mimicked digitally)“copyrightability of works incorporating AI-generated material”“training AI models on copyrighted works”These are all important topics, and I hope the results will be thoughtful. (I’ll write about them once these reports come out.) I hope the policymakers engaged in this work will be well informed and technically skilled, because it could be very easy for a bureaucrat to make this whole situation worse with ill-advised new rules.Another future possibility is that ethical datasets will be developed for training. This is something already being done by some folks at HuggingFace in the form of a code dataset called The Stack. Could we do this sort of thing for other forms of content?ConclusionRegardless of what the government or industry comes up with, however, the courts are proceeding to decide this problem. What happens if one of the cases in the courts is lost by the generative AI side?It may at least mean that some of the money being produced by generative AI will be passed back to creators. I’m not terribly convinced that the whole idea of generative AI will disappear, although we did see the end of a lot of companies during the era of Napster. Courts could bankrupt companies producing generative AI, and/or ban the production of generative AI models — this is not impossible! I don’t think it’s the most likely outcome, however- instead, I think we’ll see some penalties and some fragmentation of the law around this (this model is ok, that model is not, and so on), which may or may not make the situation any clearer legally.I would really like it if the courts take up the question of when and how a generative AI model should be considered infringing, not separating the input and output questions but examining them together as a single whole, because I think that is key to understanding the situation. If they do, we might be able to come up with legal frameworks that make sense for the new technology we are dealing with. If not, I fear we’ll end up further into a quagmire of laws woefully unprepared to guide our digital innovations. We need copyright law that makes more sense in the context of our digital world. But we also need to intelligently protect human art and science and creativity in various forms, and I don’t think AI-generated content is worth trading that away.Read more of my content at www.stephaniekirmer.com.References and Additional ReadingTeaching CopyrightWelcomeThere's a lot of misinformation out there about legal rights and responsibilities in the digital era.This is…www.eff.orgLooking Forward: The U.S. Copyright Office’s AI Initiative in 2024 | CopyrightThis blog post previews the next steps of the U.S. Copyright Office’s comprehensive initiative to examine the copyright…blogs.loc.govThe scary truth about AI copyright is nobody knows what will happen nextGenerative AI models have taken off in 2022.

											Skills Needed to Work Effectively with Artificial Intelligence

Many employees and managers are excited about how AI can make their work easier and more efficient. But others are concerned that AI will replace people, dampen creativity and ingenuity, make their own skills obsolete, and create workplaces that feel more machine-centric and less human.
While many fear AI will make our workplaces soulless, research suggests that it could actually push us to improve our human-centered soft skills. Workers and companies need to be intentional about cultivating these skills, which are often more difficult to master, harder to measure, and frequently get pushed aside in favor of technical skill sets. The latest research shows that in the AI age, employers expect to increasingly value “soft skills” that enhance human interactions and foster rich, people-centered company cultures. They anticipate that AI will work best when it enhances people’s talents and helps build human connectedness.
Studies reveal two categories of human skills that leaders see as critical — and which organizations are actually teaching to their employees.

Effective interpersonal skills, such as basic conflict resolution, communication, skills of disconnecting from emotions, and even mindfulness practices.
Domain expertise, with a focus on preserving that knowledge among experienced talent and developing it among young inexperienced workers.


 
BGSF staffing firm asked their 218K+ LinkedIn followers to vote on the soft skills they believe will be most important in the workplace in 2024. Here’s what they discovered…

Poll Question: “Which soft skills are most important in the AI-dominated workplace?”





Critical Thinking (47%)
It’s not a surprise that critical thinking received the most votes (47%), as this is a uniquely human skill requiring logic, rational thinking, and unbiased evaluation. According to Fast Company, critical thinking is a necessary skill to evaluate generative AI responses which could contain biases and errors from the vast amounts of patterns and structures in data processing. Employees with the skills to critically assess, question, and filter AI outputs will make the human-AI collaboration a more successful partnership.



Emotional Intelligence (23%)
According to Forbes Advisor, emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions and the emotions of others. Emotional intelligence ranked 2nd in the BGSF poll and becomes increasingly important when navigating social dynamics in an ever-evolving global workplace. 



Creativity (18%)
Creativity came in third, receiving (18%) of the votes. The ability to be creative is an essential skill for effective problem-solving. Creative thinkers often tackle issues from fresh perspectives. According to Forbes Advisor, creative soft skills include brainstorming, imagination, curiosity, and experimentation. According to a study by Hendarman and Cantner, developing soft skills such as creativity and problem-solving may lead to new ideas and services that add value and solve problems, helping the team members and overall organization be more successful.



Unbiased Decision Making (12%)
Although this category came in last (12%), it’s important to note that unbiased decision-making is a uniquely human skill requiring rational thinking, reflective consideration, and the ability to ensure that any AI deployed aligns with your organization’s values and is never used in ways that could be harmful or unjust. This skill will become even more important as AI continues to evolve and impact the workplace.
If done thoughtfully, a renewed focus on soft skills could result in vastly improved workplaces where human connection, strong values, rich communication, and dynamic innovation abound. AI is challenging us to confront many complex workplace issues—and the possibilities for success and new opportunities are endless if handled with care. It’s on us to decide whether we will let AI enhance or diminish the uniquely valuable skills and connections that make us human.

The labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is best known for his in-depth studies showing how much technology and trade have eroded the incomes of millions of American workers over the years.But Mr. Autor is now making the case that the new wave of technology — generative artificial intelligence, which can produce hyper-realistic images and video and convincingly imitate humans’ voices and writing — could reverse that trend.“A.I., if used well, can assist with restoring the middle-skill, middle-class heart of the U.S. labor market that has been hollowed out by automation and globalization,” Mr. Autor wrote in a paper that Noema Magazine published in February.Mr. Autor’s stance on A.I. looks like a stunning conversion for a longtime expert on technology’s work force casualties. But he said the facts had changed and so had his thinking. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTModern A.I., Mr. Autor said, is a fundamentally different technology, opening the door to new possibilities. It can, he continued, change the economics of high-stakes decision-making so more people can take on some of the work that is now the province of elite, and expensive, experts like doctors, lawyers, software engineers and college professors. And if more people, including those without college degrees, can do more valuable work, they should be paid more, lifting more workers into the middle class.The researcher, whom The Economist once called “the academic voice of the American worker,” started his career as a software developer and a leader of a computer-education nonprofit before switching to economics — and spending decades examining the impact of technology and globalization on workers and wages.Mr. Autor, 59, was an author of an influential study in 2003 that concluded that 60 percent of the shift in demand favoring college-educated workers over the previous three decades was attributable to computerization. Later research examined the role of technology in wage polarization and in skewing employment growth toward low-wage service jobs.Other economists view Mr. Autor’s latest treatise as a stimulating, though speculative, thought exercise.“I’m a great admirer of David Autor’s work, but his hypothesis is only one possible scenario,” said Laura Tyson, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, who was chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration. “There is broad agreement that A.I. will produce a productivity benefit, but how that translates into wages and employment is very uncertain.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThat uncertainty usually veers toward pessimism. Not just Silicon Valley doomsayers, but mainstream economists predict that many jobs, from call center workers to software developers, are at risk. In a report last year, Goldman Sachs concluded that generative A.I. could automate activities equivalent to 300 million full-time jobs globally.ImageA call center in Montgomery, Ala. A research project by two M.I.T. graduate students that Mr. Autor advised, showed that A.I. increased the productivity of all workers, but the less skilled benefited the most.Credit...Bob Miller for The New York TimesIn Mr. Autor’s latest report, which was also published in the National Bureau of Economic Research, he discounts the likelihood that A.I. can replace human judgment entirely. And he sees the demand for health care, software, education and legal advice as almost limitless, so that lowering costs should expand those fields as their products and services become more widely affordable.It’s “not a forecast but an argument” for an alternative path ahead, very different from the jobs apocalypse foreseen by Elon Musk, among others, he said.Until now, Mr. Autor said, computers were programmed to follow rules. They relentlessly got better, faster and cheaper. And routine tasks, in an office or a factory, could be reduced to a series of step-by-step rules that have increasingly been automated. Those jobs were typically done by middle-skill workers without four-year college degrees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA.I., by contrast, is trained on vast troves of data — virtually all the text, images and software code on the internet. When prompted, powerful A.I. chatbots like Open AI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini can generate reports and computer programs or answer questions.“It doesn’t know rules,” Mr. Autor said. “It learns by absorbing lots and lots of examples. It’s completely different from what we had in computing.”An A.I. helper, he said, equipped with a storehouse of learned examples can offer “guidance” (in health care, did you consider this diagnosis?) and “guardrails” (don’t prescribe these two drugs together).In that way, Mr. Autor said, A.I. becomes not a job killer but a “worker complementary technology,” which enables someone without as much expertise to do more valuable work.Early studies of generative A.I. in the workplace point to the potential. One research project by two M.I.T. graduate students, whom Mr. Autor advised, assigned tasks like writing short reports or news releases to office professionals. A.I. increased the productivity of all workers, but the less skilled and experienced benefited the most. Later research with call center workers and computer programmers found a similar pattern.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut even if A.I. delivers the largest productivity gains to less-experienced workers, that does not mean they will reap the rewards of higher pay and better career paths. That will also depend on corporate behavior, worker bargaining power and policy incentives.Daron Acemoglu, an M.I.T. economist and occasional collaborator of Mr. Autor’s, said his colleague’s vision is one possible path ahead, but not necessarily the most likely one. History, Mr. Acemoglu said, is not with the lift-all-boats optimists.“We’ve been here before with other digital technologies, and it hasn’t happened,” he said.Mr. Autor acknowledges the challenges. “But I do think there is value in imagining a positive outcome, encouraging debate and preparing for a better future,” he said. “This technology is a tool, and how we decide to use it is up to us.”Steve Lohr writes about technology and its impact on the economy, jobs and the workplace.

As AI continues to permeate business life, companies are starting to ask themselves if they need AI expertise at the C-suite level.
According to LinkedIn, the number of companies with a “Head of AI” position has more than tripled in the last five years, and is up 13% since 2022. 
Chief AI Officers (CAIOs) are “brought in to really align an organization’s AI strategy and goals, depending on the existing roles and business need,” said Anne Yarovoy Khan, of counsel in the Fisher Phillips’ Irvine office, and a member of the firm’s AI, privacy and cyber, and PEO and staffing practice groups.
Not every company will need to jump in and have an AI executive at the C-suite level, but AI executives are becoming more commonplace. Here’s what HR professionals need to know.

The employee benefits that matter in 2024

With the uncertainty brought on by the pandemic, employers are further customizing benefits to both attract and retain employees. Discover which priorities HR leaders are focusing on in this Trendline. 








The CAIO role isn’t defined, but requires a certain set of skills
Right now, the role of the CAIO is new and may not be well defined. But a CAIO can do a number of things, Khan said, including developing AI strategy with “a look to longer term objectives, including where the organization is going.” They can also oversee AI governance, consider privacy-related aspects of AI, mitigate risk of AI deployment, oversee training and education on AI, and ensure transparency in AI use.
This person can’t just be a technical whiz, she added. Knowledge of AI is required, but the CAIO will need to team up with others across the organization “to effectively execute strategy and ensuring compliance as well,” she said, adding that an ideal CAIO would “stay on top of the changing landscape of AI, bring in executive leadership and work cross functionally.” 
Since executive-level AI pros are still relatively new, finding the right person for these jobs, or even knowing what they’ll do, will take some time. That’s why it’s key they have the right skills to execute on whatever those goals may be.
“Historically, jobs were defined by titles. But the smart companies are realizing they need to start defining the job as a collection of skills and tasks, not simply titles,” Ryan Roslansky, CEO of Linkedin said at Talent Connect in October 2023. “Then start thinking about how those tasks are required to change as AI continues to advance, and then what new skills we require to succeed.”
Determining what level executive an AI pro should be
While the title CAIO itself is a buzzword right now, that doesn’t mean every organization needs someone elevated to that high of an executive level.

Sal DiFranco, managing partner of the global advanced technology practice for DHR Global, said there’s more talk about a senior vice president or vice president of AI. He likened it to about 10 years ago when clients were looking to hire IoT experts at that level, and they went on to report to the CIO or CTO.
A VP or SVP of AI will make sense for a lot of companies, he added, and they’ll most likely also report to the CIO or CTO. “They’re the ones with the technology and know what’s happening in the space.” 
DiFranco recently interviewed a CISO candidate for a large retail company that is starting their AI initiative and leadership council in the CIO and CTO office, he said. The person in the job will the point person to lead the strategy on finding a leader for the organization, and most likely it will be an SVP or C-level reporting to the CIO.
Most of his clients looking for AI executives are looking for candidates who are experts in AI of course, but also machine and deep learning, he said. They also might need experience in robotics depending on the kind of company they’d be working for, he added, like those in manufacturing. 
Having leadership skills and being able to explain technical topics to a non-tech audience will also make for successful AI executives. “They have to be somebody who understands how to navigate an organization and all functions in an organization. Is it HR, is it finance, is it sales, is it technology?” DiFranco said. They need to be able to talk to stakeholders across the organization about how AI will impact their function or line of business. “Those influence skills,” he said, “are absolutely critical.”

The advancements in technology have sparked debates and raised important questions about the impact of AI on our daily lives. Is it the 21st century’s version of the Industrial Revolution? How will it shape the future of work? These are crucial inquiries that demand attention.In the early months of 2023, the Washington Post stated that the AI “gold rush” had arrived. Major companies like Alphabet and Microsoft made significant job cuts to invest billions of dollars in generative artificial intelligence. This wave of excitement followed the release of ChatGPT, an AI-based chatbot system, in late 2022. The potential of AI seemed boundless.However, amidst the hype, there are several key takeaways. Firstly, it’s essential to recognize that AI is already deeply embedded in our lives. A study conducted by Sam Ransbotham, a professor of analytics at Boston College, revealed that most people are already using AI in some form, even if they are unaware of it. GPS systems and spell check tools are just a few examples of the everyday AI-powered tools that people rely on. The pervasive nature of AI is often unnoticed but undeniable.Ransbotham also highlighted the competitive advantage that AI offers. It is not about “robots” taking away jobs, but rather about individuals who can adapt and embrace AI technology. Those who can effectively utilize AI in their work will not only remain employed but also outperform their peers. On an organizational level, companies that fail to leverage AI run the risk of widespread job losses and financial collapse. The potential impact is significant.While AI-powered tools hold tremendous potential for improving skills, enhancing learning environments, and refining various industries, including healthcare and education, there are also notable concerns. Ransbotham highlighted that relying too heavily on AI can hinder the development of general skills. For instance, using AI from the outset in essay writing eliminates the important process of learning through mistakes. The long-term consequences of such reliance on AI are yet to be fully understood.Another critical issue is the lack of regulation in the AI industry. Companies developing generative AI tools operate with little oversight or transparency. The absence of control raises questions about who runs these tools and what their objectives may be. Ransbotham likened this situation to the unregulated meatpacking industry of the early 20th century, which ultimately necessitated the creation of the Food and Drug Administration. Governments must consider effective regulations for AI to ensure ethical and responsible use.Ultimately, Ransbotham emphasized that AI tools are neutral and their usage depends on humans. Drawing an analogy between AI and the discovery of rocks by cavemen, he explained that it is up to individuals to decide whether these tools will be used as weapons or as instruments for progress. The critical factor now is how governments and individuals choose to manage and harness the potential of  AI going forward.In conclusion, AI is already shaping our lives and work environments. It presents both incredible opportunities and notable challenges. Understanding the impact of AI and effectively managing its implementation will be crucial in shaping a future that benefits everyone. By embracing responsible AI practices and establishing necessary regulations, societies can navigate this technological revolution with confidence, ensuring that the future remains bright and promising.Frequently Asked QuestionsQ: What is artificial intelligence (AI)?

The market for  AI in retail is expected to reach $19.9 billion by 2025, driven by the need to enhance customer engagement and improve operational efficiency.While the potential benefits of AI are significant, there are also challenges and concerns associated with its implementation. One of the major issues is the ethical and responsible use of AI. As AI systems become more advanced, there is a growing need for regulations to ensure transparency and accountability in decision-making processes. Governments and regulatory bodies are working towards developing frameworks to address these concerns.Additionally, there are concerns about the impact of AI on the workforce. While AI is expected to automate certain tasks, it is more likely to augment human capabilities rather than replace jobs entirely. However, there is a need for individuals to adapt and acquire the necessary skills to work alongside AI technologies. This will require investments in education and training programs to upskill the workforce and prepare them for the future of work.In conclusion, AI has the potential to transform industries and revolutionize the way we work. While there are concerns and challenges associated with its implementation, it is important to recognize the opportunities it presents. By effectively leveraging AI technologies, organizations can enhance their operations, improve customer experiences, and drive innovation. With the right regulations and responsible practices, AI can be harnessed to create a future that benefits everyone.

These individuals, originally hired to train algorithms, often end up shouldering the responsibility of executing much of the AI’s tasks. A recent report by The Information shed light on these vital workers, particularly in the context of Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology. This technology, which allowed customers to conveniently grab grocery items from store shelves and exit without the need for traditional checkouts, had been reliant on over 1,000 individuals in India who diligently watched and labeled videos to ensure accurate checkouts.While Amazon highlights on its website the employment of “computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning” in Just Walk Out, it fails to make mention of these offshore contractors. When questioned, Amazon clarified that these workers were simply annotating videos to enhance the system and only validated a small fraction of shopping visits when the  AI systems were incapable of determining a purchase.This revelation from Amazon serves as a stark reminder that the effective functioning of “artificial intelligence” often hinges upon the presence of human overseers. In fact, Amazon itself has an entire business unit called Amazon Turk, which assists other companies in training and operating their own  AI systems. Countless freelancers across the globe identify themselves as “M-Turkers,” and the unit draws its name from the renowned tale of the Mechanical Turk, an 18th-century chess-playing automaton steered covertly by a concealed human controller.The prevalence of humans laboring behind the scenes of seemingly advanced  AI technology extends well beyond Amazon’s case. Numerous other companies have failed to disclose their reliance on human involvement in driving their supposedly cutting-edge AI systems. Facebook, for instance, shut down its text-based virtual assistant M in 2018 after two years of operation, during which human workers were extensively utilized to train and operate its underlying  AI system. Similarly, a startup named x.ai, which boasted an “AI personal assistant” for scheduling meetings, was compelled to cease operations in 2021 as it encountered difficulties in achieving true algorithmic autonomy.Another example is the British startup Builder.ai, which marketed AI software capable of building apps but relied partly on software developers in India and elsewhere to fulfill that task, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.This reality underscores the fine line between the anticipation of algorithmic replacement and utilizing human workers as a temporary solution—an approach often justified by marketers under the guise of eventual automation. Such “pseudo AI” or “AI washing” was prevalent even prior to the recent surge of generative  AI technologies.For instance, West Monroe Partners, a firm specializing in due diligence for private equity firms, examined marketing material provided by 40 US firms up for sale in 2019. The analysis revealed that these companies exaggerated their technology’s capabilities in the realm of  AI and machine learning by an average of over 30%. Along similar lines, MMC, a London-based venture capital firm, discovered that out of 2,830 European startups classified as AI companies, only 1,580 legitimately aligned with that description.One of the obvious concerns arising from the involvement of humans in AI is the potential invasion of privacy. Amazon’s utilization of “supervised learning” in its  AI systems prompted thousands of contractors to listen in on individuals’ commands to Alexa. However, the proliferation of misleading claims in the AI industry also poses risks.Fortunately, regulators are stepping up their efforts to address this issue and hold companies accountable for misleading  AI claims. Ismail Ramsey, the US attorney for the Northern District of California, recently announced his intention to target startups that deceive investors regarding their usage of AI before going public. Additionally, in February, the Chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, warned that AI washing could violate securities laws. Subsequently, two investment firms reached settlements totaling $400,000 with the SEC for overstating their employment of  AI.Even in cases where AI systems are accurately represented, it is crucial to recognize the existence of a vast industry of hidden workers supporting many high-tech AI systems, often receiving minimal compensation. Esteemed academics like Kate Crawford and authors like Madhumita’s Code Dependent have extensively documented this phenomenon, shedding light on the realities of  AI beyond the glamour and hype.FAQQ: What is “AI washing”?
A: “AI washing” refers to the practice of leveraging the hype and ambiguity surrounding AI to exaggerate the capabilities of a technology that is not entirely AI-driven.Q: How are regulators addressing misleading AI claims?
A: Regulators, such as the US attorney for the Northern District of California and the Chair of the SEC, are actively targeting startups and companies that mislead investors about their use and capabilities of  AI, with the intention of imposing penalties and enforcing transparency.Q: What are some examples of companies relying on human labor for  AI tasks?
A: Facebook, x.ai, and Builder.ai are among the companies that employed human workers instead of fully autonomous algorithms for tasks related to their AI systems.Sources:

– Code Dependent by Madhumita – [source_link_3]In addition to the revelations about Amazon’s reliance on human workers for its AI technology, it is important to understand the wider industry landscape, market forecasts, and key issues related to the industry and its products.The  AI industry is experiencing significant growth and is expected to continue expanding in the coming years. Market research firm Tractica forecasts that  AI software revenue will reach $105.8 billion by 2025, a substantial increase from $9.5 billion in 2018. This growth is driven by the increasing adoption of AI across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing.However, the reliance on human labor in AI systems raises ethical and transparency concerns. Many companies, including Amazon, Facebook, x.ai, and Builder.ai, have been found to conceal the extent of human involvement in their AI operations. This lack of transparency not only misrepresents the capabilities of  AI systems but also raises privacy concerns, as seen in the case of Amazon’s contractors listening to Alexa commands.Regulators are taking steps to address these issues and hold companies accountable for misleading  AI claims. The US attorney for the Northern District of California has expressed intentions to target startups that deceive investors about their use of AI before going public. The Chair of the SEC has also warned that AI washing could violate securities laws, resulting in enforcement actions and settlements with investment firms that overstated their AI capabilities.The concept of “AI washing” has emerged as a notable concern.  AI washing refers to the practice of exaggerating the capabilities of a technology that is not entirely AI-driven, leveraging the hype and ambiguity surrounding AI. This phenomenon was prevalent even before the recent surge of generative  AI technologies. Studies have shown that companies often overstate their technology’s capabilities in AI and machine learning, with some European startups misrepresenting themselves as AI companies.It is crucial to recognize the existence of a vast industry of hidden workers supporting many high-tech AI systems, often receiving minimal compensation. These workers, such as the M-Turkers in Amazon’s case, play a crucial role in training and operating  AI systems. Researchers and authors have extensively documented this phenomenon, shedding light on the realities of AI beyond the glamour and hype. Works like Kate Crawford’s research and Madhumita’s book “Code Dependent” offer valuable insights into the hidden workforce behind  AI.Overall, while the AI industry continues to advance, it is important to address issues related to human involvement, misleading claims, privacy, and transparency. Regulators, researchers, and authors are working to bring attention to these concerns and hold companies accountable for their actions.Sources:

Ben & Jerry’s grocery store freezers. Abercrombie & Fitch’s marketing. Many mainstays of the American customer experience are increasingly powered by artificial intelligence.The question is whether the technology will actually make companies more efficient.Rapid productivity improvement is the dream for both companies and economic policymakers. If output per hour holds steady, firms must either sacrifice profits or raise prices to pay for wage increases or investment projects. But when firms figure out how to produce more per working hour, it means that they can maintain or expand profits even as they pay or invest more. Economies experiencing productivity booms can experience rapid wage gains and quick growth without as much risk of rapid inflation.But many economists and officials seem dubious that A.I. — especially generative A.I., which is still in its infancy — has spread enough to show up in productivity data already.Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, recently suggested that A.I. “may” have the potential to increase productivity growth, “but probably not in the short run.” John C. Williams, president of the New York Fed, has made similar remarks, specifically citing the work of the Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Gordon has argued that new technologies in recent years, while important, have probably not been transformative enough to give a lasting lift to productivity growth.“The enthusiasm about large language models and ChatGPT has gone a bit overboard,” he said in an interview.The last time productivity really picked up, in the 1990s, computer manufacturing was getting a lot more efficient at the same time that computers themselves were making everything else more efficient — allowing for a sector-spanning productivity increase. Today’s gains may be less broad, he thinks.Other economists are more optimistic. Erik Brynjolfsson at Stanford University has bet Mr. Gordon $400 that productivity will take off this decade. His optimism is based partly on A.I. He ran an experiment with it at a large call center, where it especially helped less experienced workers, and has co-founded a company meant to teach firms how to leverage the technology.Many companies seem to be in Mr. Brynjolfsson’s camp, hopeful that the shiny new tool will revolutionize their workplaces. Companies are using A.I. and generative A.I. for everything from writing marketing emails to helping set prices to answering employees’ human resources and legal questions.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHere are a few areas where companies say the latest A.I. technology is being used in ways that could influence productivity, pulled from interviews, earnings calls and financial filings.Got an annoying task? There’s an A.I. for that.Employees spend a lot of time trying to figure out human-resources-related questions. Companies have been investing in generative A.I. to help answer those queries more quickly.At Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States, with 1.6 million workers, the company’s employee app has a section called “My Assistant,” which is backed by generative A.I. The feature uses the technology to quickly answer questions like “Do I have dental coverage?,” summarize meeting notes and help write job descriptions.Walmart rolled out the technology to its U.S. corporate work force last year. The retailer has been clear that the tool is meant to boost productivity. In an interview last year, Donna Morris, Walmart’s chief people officer, said one of the goals was to eliminate some mundane work so employees could focus on tasks that had more impact. It’s expected to be a “huge productivity lift” for the company, she said.

Behind the JournalismOur business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Here’s more on our standards and practices.The algorithms want to sell you things.Tony Spring, Macy’s chief executive, said the department-store chain was experimenting with A.I. to tailor its marketing. The company is using generative A.I. to write elements of emails, and is exploring ways to use the technology to add product descriptions online and to replicate images of outfits or other products for sale over new backgrounds.“It’s certainly showing up as a tool for some colleagues to reduce workload,” Mr. Spring said in an interview.Abercrombie & Fitch is using generative A.I. to help design clothes and write descriptions for its website and app. Designers use Midjourney, an A.I. graphics program, to help them generate images as they brainstorm clothing ideas. Workers in Abercrombie’s marketing department also use generative A.I. to help write the blurbs for products’ descriptions. (Employees later edit the copy.)Samir Desai, Abercrombie & Fitch’s chief digital officer, said the technology helped speed up a laborious process, given that Abercrombie and its brands could post a couple of hundred new products on its website in a single week.“I think right now it’s a lot of trust and belief that these are productivity enhancers, efficiency boosters,” Mr. Desai said, noting that it was difficult to quantify how much time and money was being saved. “I think we’ll start to see that manifest itself in just how much work certain teams are able to get through versus the prior years.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA.I. pairs well with burgers and ice cream.Some companies are hoping to use the latest A.I. technology to help match prices to demand, somewhat like the way that Uber sets prices for cars based on how many people want to ride.Wendy’s, for instance, has floated the idea of using A.I. to identify slower times of the day and discount the prices of menu items on its digital boards.The technology could also help with inventory management. Ben & Jerry’s put cameras that use A.I. into the freezers at grocery stores to help alert the company when a location was running low on pints of Cherry Garcia or Chunky Monkey. The camera sporadically captures an image of the freezer shelves, and the technology assesses the quantity that’s left, sending alerts to Ben & Jerry’s parent company and its distributors.“The software identifies what is about to run out and also helps plan the most efficient routes for trucks that can restock the inventory,” Catherine Reynolds, a spokeswoman for Unilever, the parent of Ben & Jerry’s, said in a statement.The A.I. technology is installed in 8,000 freezers, and the company said it planned to significantly increase that number this year. On average, freezers with the A.I. technology increased sales 13 percent because they were replenished with fresh pints of ice cream, particularly the most in-demand flavors, Ms. Reynolds said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA.I. is getting into the weeds.Deere, the maker of farm equipment, has been using A.I. alongside cameras to improve herbicide sprayers. The equipment recognizes and targets weeds specifically, allowing for more precise use of chemicals. The technology was introduced in 2022, and the company estimates that it covered 100 million acres and saved eight million gallons of herbicide last year.The technology can allow “customers to reduce their herbicide use, lower their costs and minimize impact on their crops and land,” John C. May II, the firm’s chief executive, said at a news conference in February.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAre these game-changing improvements?Skepticism of A.I.’s potential for major change is based largely on the fact that many of its applications mimic things software can already do: There are clear improvements, but not necessarily game-changing ones.But while it could take time for companies to fully harness A.I. tools, the fact that the applications are potentially so broad has made some economists optimistic about what the new technologies could mean for productivity growth.Analysts at Vanguard think that A.I. could be “transformative” to the U.S. economy in the second half of the 2020s, said Joseph Davis, the financial firm’s global chief economist. He said the technology could save workers meaningful time — perhaps 20 percent — in about 80 percent of occupations.“We’re not seeing it in the data yet,” he said, explaining that he thinks that a recent pickup in productivity has been more of a snapback from a steep drop-off during the pandemic. “The good news is that there’s another wave coming.”Jordyn Holman is a business reporter for The Times, covering the retail industry and consumer behavior.

AI training revolution: Upskilling for a new era

        A recent Coursera for Business webinar explored how generative AI can be leveraged for workforce development and training.

In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, the role of HR professionals has expanded beyond traditional functions like recruitment and talent management. With the advent of transformative technologies like Generative AI (GenAI), HR leaders are increasingly tasked with driving innovation and facilitating continuous learning and development within their organisations.
Coursera for Business, in collaboration with HRM Asia, recently hosted a webinar aimed at empowering HR professionals with the knowledge and strategies to harness GenAI for workforce development. The former’s GenAI Academy offers structured training programmes designed to bridge the skills gap and equip employees with the capabilities needed to thrive in a GenAI-powered world.
Amandeep Singh Kohli, Regional Director – Asia at Coursera, emphasised the importance of keeping people at the core of any GenAI strategy. “GenAI is a tool in your arsenal to make sure that you become more productive,” he said. This human-centric approach is crucial for successful GenAI implementation, he continued, adding that GenAI should not be seen as a replacement for human employees but rather as a way to augment their skills and make them more effective.
The webinar featured a panel discussion moderated by Shawn Liew, Head of Content Development for HRM Asia. Titled Building an Effective Skills Programme to Improve Employee Productivity and Performance with Generative AI, the discussion included representatives from organisations like Singtel and Maybank.
Datuk Dr Nora Manaf, Group Chief Human Capital Officer at Maybank, shared insights into Maybank’s experience with GenAI implementation to provide a compelling narrative of the organisation’s proactive approach to embracing this transformative technology. She underscored the importance of effective communication, literacy-building initiatives, and tangible business outcomes driven by GenAI adoption.
Datuk Nora’s emphasis on demystifying GenAI sets the tone for Maybank’s approach to technology adoption. “Demystifying is the first thing that we do,” she explained, highlighting the bank’s commitment to bringing all employees to a minimum level of literacy and understanding. This disciplined approach ensures that Maybank’s workforce is equipped with the necessary knowledge to embrace GenAI’s potential fully.
Furthermore, she elaborated on Maybank’s literacy-building initiatives, emphasising the importance of establishing a baseline of understanding of GenAI concepts. “We offer a self-administered assessment to help employees gauge their understanding of basic terms. It’s not intended for reporting purposes, but rather for self-evaluation,” she shared.
Datuk Nora’s anecdote about Maybank’s use cases further illustrates the tangible impact of GenAI on business outcomes. She cited an example of a pilot programme where they used ChatGPT technology to train salespeople. “The results were impressive,” she said, “with the GenAI-trained group achieving nearly three times the sales realisation compared to the traditionally trained group.” This demonstrates the tangible benefits that GenAI can bring to employee productivity and performance.
Simon Wong, Associate Director of People Development at Singtel, echoed the sentiment. “GenAI democratises access to technology,” he asserted, capturing the essence of GenAI’s transformative power. He highlighted how GenAI transcends traditional communication barriers, enabling anyone proficient in a language to leverage its capabilities. Wong’s remarks underscore how GenAI facilitates inclusivity by empowering all individuals from all backgrounds, including primary school students, to utilise its tools in educational settings.
In the context of Singtel’s utilisation of GenAI, Wong elaborated on the diverse applications within the organisation. He discussed how departments with the requisite skills harness GenAI to develop chatbots and applications tailored to internal employees and external stakeholders. This approach underscored Singtel’s commitment to leveraging GenAI to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience.
Moreover, Wong emphasised Singtel’s comprehensive training interventions designed to cater to different learner categories. These interventions include role-based training, broad-based training for a larger population, and self-paced learning via an e-learning platform. By offering various learning modules, Singtel ensures that employees acquire a fundamental understanding of GenAI, empowering them to leverage its capabilities effectively.
The success stories shared during the webinar highlight the importance of a well-defined GenAI implementation strategy. Coursera’s Kohli aptly summarised the current state of GenAI adoption within organisations as a “GenAI conundrum”. Leaders face a dilemma: the potential benefits of GenAI are undeniable, but the fear of technical risks and data security concerns can lead to hesitation.
However, the potential of GenAI far outweighs the risks, he said. “Leaders with access to better technologies are well-positioned to navigate this change effectively. Just like a Formula One race car needs good brakes alongside its powerful engine, organisations must balance rapid innovation with high-quality training and data security measures.”

Coursera recognises this challenge and offers structured training programmes to help organisations equip their workforce with the necessary skills and knowledge. “We understand this risk of moving too fast, the risk of moving too slow,” Kohli acknowledged. “But while you’re navigating all of these, Coursera offers a structured training programme for you to take so that eventually when all of these regulatory concerns go away your employees can be productive as quickly as you want them.”
The future of work will be shaped by GenAI. By embracing this technology and prioritising a human-centric approach to training, organisations can navigate the GenAI conundrum with confidence, Kohli suggested. With careful planning and a focus on employee development, organisations can leverage GenAI to build a futureproof workforce that is prepared to thrive in the age of intelligent automation.

Adaptation of this technology is becoming increasingly important in any country, particularly one developing artificial intelligence. In collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Robotics Association Nepal, and a myriad of local partners, The Asia Foundation held the “Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Prosperous Nepal” on March 3, emphasizing the future of work. The conference focused on the ethics, practicality, and developmental implications of AI for Nepal’s AI technology sector. National and international experts were in attendance to participate in critical discussions, present their research, work on AI and robotics, and deliver keynote speeches. Attendees explored various facets of AI, including its policy implications in relation to national development and its potential applications in the market. Breakout sessions featured presentations from tech experts on combating misinformation and disinformation. The final panel discussion focused on strategies to accelerate the Nepali innovation industry through AI. Following the conference, the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MoEST) delivered its resolution on the country’s AI policy framework. This framework will be shared with partner organizations, stakeholders, and participants for input. The Ministry aims to align the policy with national development goals to foster more innovation in various sectors with government support and existing frameworks that enable research to transform fields like healthcare. The resolution from MoEST stresses collaboration, capacity building, meaningful public service, and the integration of artificial intelligence into education, agriculture, and the industrial sector, among other things. It also emphasizes the necessity of continuous research and innovation to ensure Nepal stays ahead in the rapidly evolving field while also emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and data privacy in the development and implementation of AI technologies.",,https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'Article', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/'}, 'author': {'name': 'olivia', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#/schema/person/cd04acb691b43b96ad0ba190ff14f023'}, 'headline': 'Future of Work in Nepal: Conference on Artificial Intelligence', 'datePublished': '2024-04-04T22:19:04+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-04-04T22:19:04+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/'}, 'wordCount': 302, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#organization'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Conference-49-scaled.jpg', 'keywords': ['The Future of Work'], 'articleSection': ['Program Snapshot'], 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/', 'url': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/', 'name': 'Future of Work in Nepal: Conference on Artificial Intelligence - The Asia Foundation', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Conference-49-scaled.jpg', 'datePublished': '2024-04-04T22:19:04+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-04-04T22:19:04+00:00', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/']}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Conference-49-scaled.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Conference-49-scaled.jpg', 'width': 1100, 'height': 733, 'caption': 'A group of people stand in front of a presentation screen with trophies in hand.'}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://asiafoundation.org/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Future of Work in Nepal: Conference on Artificial Intelligence'}]}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#website', 'url': 'https://asiafoundation.org/', 'name': 'The Asia Foundation', 'description': 'Working for a peaceful, just, and thriving Asia.', 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#organization'}, 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': {'@type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://asiafoundation.org/?s={search_term_string}'}, 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@type': 'Organization', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#organization', 'name': 'The Asia Foundation', 'url': 'https://asiafoundation.org/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#/schema/logo/image/', 'url': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/logo-234.png', 'contentUrl': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/logo-234.png', 'width': 234, 'height': 32, 'caption': 'The Asia Foundation'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#/schema/logo/image/'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/TheAsiaFoundation/', 'https://x.com/Asia_Foundation', 'https://www.instagram.com/theasiafoundation/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-asia-foundation', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/AsiaFoundation']}, {'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#/schema/person/cd04acb691b43b96ad0ba190ff14f023', 'name': 'olivia'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would appear that what was billed as an AI endeavour included thousands of Indians adding items to carts and charging the customers depending on what objects they walked out with.Just Walkt Out was billed a self-checkout system powered by cameras and censors, giving the illusion of an automated system.Amazon had claimed: “The feat is a combination of computer vision, object recognition, advanced sensors, deep machine learning models, and generative AI—a type of artificial intelligence that has recently captured the public’s imagination.”Jon Jenkins, vice president of Just Walk Out technology had said: “Our tech is able to distinguish shoppers from one another, without collecting or using any of their biometric information. Just Walk Out technology detects when a shopper’s hand interacts with a product on the shelf. When that happens, machine learning algorithms make sure the correct item is added to the virtual cart—all without any specific knowledge about the person.”The truth however is a little less exciting.A report in Gizmodo states: “Just over half of Amazon Fresh stores are equipped with Just Walk Out. The technology allows customers to skip checkout altogether by scanning a QR code when they enter the store. Though it seemed completely automated, Just Walk Out relied on more than 1,000 people in India watching and labeling videos to ensure accurate checkouts. The cashiers were simply moved off-site, and they watched you as you shopped.”Further reports state that it was a very expensive affair to maintain the equipment and included a host of issues like receipts being sent late to completely wrong orders. Basically, instead of having a cashier, a vast array of equipment was needed to do the same thing and offsite cashiers were needed to do the same thing.Reports further add that Amazon is now considering moving towards Dash Carts, a technology that has an inbuilt scanner and screen in the cart.An Amazon spokesperson told Gizmodo that they are rolling out Amazon Dash Cart to replace its Just Walk Out technology.Just Walk Out was first introduced in 2016. According to a report in The Information, 700 out of the 1000 Just Walk Out sales required human intervention. X users have a field dayX users were quite happy to learn about the human intervention that was required in Amazon’s Just Walk Out feature that bought into the old Silicon Valley myth that AI is actually powered by off-shore Indian workers.Another user wrote: “Amazon billed its ""Just Walk Out"" stores as some triumph of AI. In reality, it was powered by thousands of low-paid Indian workers manually adding up items in your cart as you shopped. How insanely dystopian.”Another pointed out: “It seems that in this case, ""A.I."" stands for ""Actually, we just relocated the cashier jobs to India"".”A third said: “We're gonna see more of this as AI spreads: technologies that promote efficiency by getting rid of superfluous jobs but actually just shuffle people out of view so companies can cut wages for the same position.”Amazon ReactsReacting to the report, an Amazon spokesperson said: “We’ve invested a lot of time redesigning a number of our Amazon Fresh stores over the last year, offering a better overall shopping experience with more value, convenience, and selection—and so far we’ve seen positive results, with higher customer shopping satisfaction scores and increased purchasing. We’ve also heard from customers that while they enjoyed the benefit of skipping the checkout line with Just Walk Out, they also wanted the ability to easily find nearby products and deals, view their receipt as they shop, and know how much money they saved while shopping throughout the store. To deliver even more convenience to our customers, we’re rolling out Amazon Dash Cart, our smart-shopping carts, which allows customers all these benefits including skipping the checkout line.”The spokesperson further added: ""The characterization that Just Walk Out technology relies on human reviewers is inaccurate. The primary role of our Machine Learning data associates is to annotate video images, which is necessary for continuously improving the underlying machine learning model powering Just Walk Out technology.

Fast FactsIndeed Tuesday launched Smart Sourcing, an AI-powered product suite. The intention is to quickly and efficiently connect employers with the most relevant candidates. The suite will offer 'instant recommendations' to employers based on active job listings. Like its predecessor, the internet, artificial intelligence has become the latest technology to take the world by storm. In these early stages of generative AI, companies have been pushing for greater application and more integration for months, in everything from internet searches to email writing. The latest integration the tech sector has dreamed up is a marriage between generative AI and the exhaustive trudge that is the job hunt. Digital-recruitment platform Indeed  (RCRUY)  on Tuesday announced Smart Sourcing, a suite of generative AI-powered tools designed to make job searching easier and more efficient for all parties involved. A whole new world: Cybersecurity expert calls out the breaking of online trustRead MoreA whole new world: Cybersecurity expert calls out the breaking of online trustRead MoreFor job seekers: Update to Indeed ProfileThe Smart Sourcing launch comes in hand with an update to Indeed Profile, which, according to the company, is meant to help job seekers better represent themselves to potential employers. A new update will enable users to make themselves visible to and available to outreach from employers. The AI offerings include an AI-powered writing tool to describe peoples' work experience on their Indeed Profiles. Indeed did not specify when this feature would become available but said it was coming soon.For employers: a number of new featuresThe bulk of the new features, however, are coming to employers. Smart Sourcing enables employers to receive instant recommendations for the most relevant candidates for any active job listings. It specifically surfaces people who are actively seeking jobs and have been active on Indeed within the past 30 days. These recommendations include AI-generated candidate summaries, which explain whether a candidate meets given qualifications and if they might be a good fit for a given role.An example of the employer-side of Indeed's Smart Sourcing tool. IndeedThe platform then enables employers to send AI-generated messages to their favorite candidates, meant to speed up the interviewing process. Indeed said that 92% of the employers already using the platform said it was their ""preferred product for finding active candidates."" Indeed did not disclose how many employers are already using Smart Sourcing. Indeed Chief Executive Chris Hyams said in a statement that hiring remains a ""challenging and inefficient"" process. He hopes that these new AI-powered tools will ""transform"" the job-search market, he said. The ethics of artificial intelligence: A path toward responsible AIRead MoreThe ethics of artificial intelligence: A path toward responsible AIRead MoreAlgorithmic discrimination: a major concernThis latest push to integrate AI-powered decision-making technology into yet more verticals comes amid ongoing and unanswered concern about algorithmic bias, discrimination and hallucination. Hallucinations, as AI researcher and cognitive scientist Gary Marcus has regularly pointed out, occur when the output of a generative AI application is confidently wrong. Hallucinations, according to Marcus, are an unavoidable hallmark of the large language model paradigm.At the same time, such models have become well-known for exhibiting bias and discrimination. Bloomberg conducted a study last year of text-to-image model Stability Diffusion, finding that ""the world according to Stable Diffusion is run by white male CEOs. Women are rarely doctors, lawyers or judges. Men with dark skin commit crimes, while women with dark skin flip burgers.""Numerous studies have pointed out a similar issue, with one finding that the output of three popular text-to-image generators ""consistently under-represent(ed) marginalized identities.""The issue is not just with image generators; several other recent studies have highlighted problems of bias inherent to the large-language-model architecture. The problem derives largely from unfair or biased training data, something that's difficult to address when the internet at large is the data source in question. ""It is clear that these powerful computational tools, if not diligently designed and audited, have the potential to perpetuate and even amplify existing biases, particularly those related to race, gender and other societal constructs,"" a 2023 paper states.A 2024 Unesco study found that such bias disproportionately affects women and girls, saying specifically that the bias has been perpetuated in the AI-assisted job-recruitment process. The study states that LLMs can ""reinforce stereotypes, biases and violence"" against women and girls through discriminatory AI-powered decision-making, such as an AI recruitment tool discounting a qualified female candidate.OpenAI board member has a scary prediction for the future of workRead MoreOpenAI board member has a scary prediction for the future of workRead MoreIndeed and ethical AI: a Responsible-AI teamAsked at a news conference Monday about such issues, Raj Mukherjee, an executive vice president at Indeed, said that AI has the power to ""transform society but also can be harnessed to harm people."" He cited Indeed's responsible-AI team, which he said works to make the product ""more fair and less biased."" He did not explain how Indeed achieves this. ""It's not that we are making it so obscure why someone has been a matched candidate for a particular role,"" Maggie Hulce, an executive vice president at Indeed, added. ""We're being really clear on what are the dimensions that seem to be well-aligned.""The executives did not specify how Indeed is ensuring that the Smart Sourcing tech is fair and unbiased. Indeed's head of responsible AI, Trey Causey, told TheStreet that no system can ever be completely unbiased.Causey did say that Indeed uses a ""combination of qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate those systems’ performance along a number of dimensions, including fairness. Users are provided with mechanisms to provide feedback about GenAI outputs and we use that feedback to continually improve our systems.""Contact Ian with tips and AI stories via email, ian.krietzberg@thearenagroup.net, or Signal 732-804-1223.By Ian KrietzbergIan Krietzberg is a tech reporter for The Street.

			10 things your campus should be doing to launch generative AI

Every community college is dealing with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence; the positive implications for increased efficiencies, improved student services, more creative and relevant curriculum and the transformation of workforce readiness and training are profound.  
However, community colleges need to confront certain realities that could impede our success in implementation including:

The cost of the transformation of curriculum, services and workforce preparation will be substantial. We operate with significant fiscal limitations so need to be prudent and organized in our efforts to embrace Generative AI
Limited staffing. Again, we will need to work with the staffing we have and, where possible, develop more creative ways to implement AI strategies on campus.
Those we serve in the workplace likely don’t know what they need and we are equally ill-equipped to tell them.


This article is part of a monthly column provided by the Instructional Technology Council, an affiliated council of the American Association of Community Colleges.

A number of community colleges have been early standouts in their approach to generative AI, but for most community colleges, it is hard to even know where to start. The Instructional Technology Council (ITC) created an AI Affinity Group to bring together institutions and individuals that have been “early-adopters” and “early-adapters” of generative AI. The special panel has been methodical in its review of the essentials each community college needs to establish a productive approach to the exploration and implementation of generative AI.  
The result: ITC recommendations regarding the 10 things your campus should be doing to launch generative AI:
1.) Develop initial policies to establish a framework for exploration and application. Campus policies for generative AI will always be a work in progress, but initial policies to consider include: Ethics – identifying parameters and guardrails for the ethical use of generative AI; Privacy – to protect students and staff and academic integrity – to strike a balance that reaffirms the criticality of academic integrity while opening the door to exploration and utilization rather than slamming the door shut.
2.) Create a permanent campus committee to oversee AI and emergent technologies. The committee will necessarily comprise campus stakeholder groups rather than technology experts (since campuses don’t have many experts – yet). Broad campus representation is critical to ensure a cross-section of voices are heard. In addition, the scope of the committee should include emergent technologies (virtual reality, for instance) since additional challenges are coming with other technologies as well.
3.) Secure funding to support professional development, exploration and implementation. The oversight committee will help to develop needed professional development training at a scale and scope that is unprecedented. Secure and regular funding will ensure that the training program can meet the needs of all campus stakeholder groups. ITC also encourages institutions to be proactive in seeking grant funding to supplement the costs of an extensive professional development program over several years. An increasing number of grant opportunities are emerging in this field, especially related to workforce development. There are increased opportunities to collaborate with other institutions and/or workforce partners.
4.) Identify the key stakeholders at your institution (key groups). This may vary, but for most institutions, the likely stakeholder groups include:

Faculty (full- and part-time)
Students
IT support
Administrators
Student services
Leadership

Recognizing these key groups will help to understand how to effectively tailor and diversify professional development training. Generative AI training cannot be “one size fits all”; rather it needs to be engaging and relevant to fit the needs of each particular stakeholder group.
5.) Create a culture of open dialog in with those that fear the emergence of AI can feel safe in expressing their concerns. On each campus, there are colleagues in each stakeholder’s group that perceive generative AI as an existential threat. Institutions should listen and promote dialogue. An approach that “reaches back” to ensure everyone moves forward is a positive an empathic approach that will promote greater buy-in in the long-term.
6.) Scaffold professional development (PD) for each identified stakeholder group. The oversight committee, working with the campus PD coordinator, should be developing a full-year generative AI professional development plan that includes sessions for each stakeholder group.  In addition, the training should scaffold the training sessions to promote evolution and growth in understanding and application. 
7.) Recognize the need to invite external expertise (most campuses do not have experts – need PD that engages, impresses and builds confidence). As previously mentioned, several campuses are leaders at the community college level. Rather than re-inventing the wheel, you can jump-start your exploration of generative AI by inviting presenters from those leaders. This may also lead to collaborations as well.
8.) Focus PD training on “how to explore/utilize” rather than on “how AI works.” For most of our colleagues, there is not a real desire to understand how generative AI works – after, most of us don’t understand our phones or other devices. Rather, most want to understand how to use this new technology and want specific strategies for implementation. 
9.) Reach out to your community – determine what AI skills/abilities are needed in the local workforce – then build backwards to create the curriculum and training needed. Community colleges are different from universities. For community colleges, the best approach to generative AI is working backwards: learn what your local economy and workforce need/will need related to AI and other emergent technologies and then develop the degrees, certificates, skills certificates and soft skills to support your community. Admittedly, there is a risk that your community simply doesn’t know what it needs, but that creates an opportunity to work together to determine the needs as well as the college response to support those needs.
10.) Look for partners/collaborators both within higher education and in the greater community. You do not have to embark on this journey alone. The 21st century represents a paradigm shift in what we must learn, how to learn and how to adapt to a rapidly changing set of needs for the workforce. Partnerships with your community, with other higher education institutions, with local school districts and with organizations like the Instructional Technology Council can create a culture of connections and relevance. There are a variety of ways to foster this climate of collaboration; you can determine what works best for you.
The ITC AI Affinity Group will continue to assess generative AI and will share additional recommendations as warranted.

More than four in 10 translators said that their income has decreased because of generative AI, while more than three-quarters believe the emerging technology will negatively affect their future income.The SoA, the UK’s largest trade union for writers, illustrators and translators, ran the survey in January. It found that 37% of translators had used generative AI to support their work, and 8% used it because they were asked by their publisher or commissioning organisation.Thomas Bunstead, whose translations from Spanish include The Book of All Loves by Agustín Fernández Mallo, said it is important to draw a distinction between literary translators and “commercial” translators. “Though a third of translators have responded to the SoA survey saying they think they’ve lost work to AI already, literary translation remains in the hands of humans,” he said. “The work that has presumably been handed over to AI will be the kind of uncomplicated bread-and-butter stuff which doesn’t require so much nuance,” such as instruction manuals.“Idiomatic, knotty and complex writing,” is likely to remain with human translators, agrees Nichola Smalley, whose translations from Swedish and Norwegian include A System So Magnificent It Is Blinding by Amanda Svensson. “But perhaps the people translating crime and romance novels who are currently getting less work due to AI will all start getting into the complex stuff and we’ll all be fighting for space in that niche. I hope not!”Ian Giles, the co-chair of the Translators Association whose translations from Scandinavian languages into English include the forthcoming The Cuckoo by Camilla Läckberg, said that his income from commercial translation work has fallen significantly since the beginning of 2023. The loss of non-literary streams of income for literary translators will mean the “raising of the bar to entry into the industry, with only those with wealth able to translate literature for publication”. He also said that cost-cutting is not confined to non-literary translation – a publisher specialising in ebooks and audiobooks for which he previously translated has switched to a process known as post-editing, when an AI translator has a first go at translating a text before a human editor checks it and makes tweaks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to BookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

CEO Robert Casten Carlberg said that “integrating AI into the translators’ toolbox” will enhance productivity “without sacrificing creativity or quality”.However, Smalley said there are concerns that post-editing can create “a lot more work” for translators, who have to carefully compare texts to catch misreadings and “poor or unidiomatic” style. “Colleagues who have done this kind of post-editing work say that it requires a far higher degree of attention, because the AI generated text often reads so plausibly,” she said.The survey results come in the wake of a boom in popularity of translated books, highlighted Bunstead. He added that “translators, like all freelancers, can go through lean periods. They won’t always know for certain the reasons why, but AI is currently the obvious explanation. A few years ago Brexit insularity was the root of all our money worries.”Of the 787 SoA members who responded – including writers of fiction and nonfiction, scriptwriters, poets and journalists, as well as illustrators and translators – 94% reported wanting credit or compensation when their work is used to develop generative AI tools. In light of the survey, the SoA said that there is an “urgent need” for government regulation of AI tools to ensure they are developed and used “ethically and lawfully”.“I’m certain that the act of creative and literary translation will live on in one shape or another,” said Giles. “For many there is a deep-seated desire to translate and I also believe there is an audience that desires human-translated content.”Explore more on these topicsBooksPublishingArtificial intelligence (AI)Fiction in translationnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedSunday was world’s hottest ever recorded day, data suggestsWhen a bad Trump joke becomes an affair of state, Germany has lost more than its sense of humourFatma Aydemir‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysWho might Kamala Harris pick for VP?

Generative AI doesn’t exist in a vacuum. The rapid advancements we’ve seen in generative AI over the past year or so have been made possible by other tech breakthroughs. Cloud computing, for example, democratizes access to AI technologies. 5G amplifies the potential of generative AI by facilitating real-time analytics and AI processing. And the Internet of Things provides a rich source of data for generative AI models to mine.


In other words, generative AI has been aided and influenced by many other technologies. But what about the flip side? How might generative AI itself accelerate other technologies? Here are a few predictions.

Generative AI In The Metaverse
Whether you’re on board with the metaverse or not, there’s no denying that the concept of immersive digital spaces where we can work, game, socialize, shop, and learn is compelling. Generative AI could enhance metaverse environments by enabling automatic content creation on the fly. As an example, imagine playing a VR game with unique characters and challenges being created in real time, just for you. Generative AI can power features like this in the metaverse, crafting more immersive, personalized experiences for gamers and other metaverse users.

PROMOTED
Just as most businesses today have a website and social media presence, in the future I believe most will have some sort of metaverse presence – be it a virtual shop, an immersive brand experience, or a virtual campus for employees to visit. Generative AI could prove to be a valuable tool for any business that wants to create a metaverse presence. After all, generative AI solutions can write computer code as well as create content – which means businesses could, in theory, design their own immersive 3D metaverse spaces simply by telling a generative AI tool what they want to build.

Get Ready For AI-Equipped Robots
Generative AI will also influence robotics by enabling the development of robots that can learn and adapt to new tasks dynamically. This will help to create more autonomous robots – and broaden the range of tasks that robots can undertake. For instance, the robots of the future will be capable not just of impressive physical feats, but also having natural conversations with humans and making complex decisions. In other words, generative AI will help to make robots intelligent.

This will likely expand the range of jobs impacted by AI automation. So far, generative AI enables us to automate certain cognitive and creative tasks, including some of the work done by designers, teachers, musicians, marketers, and more. Physical jobs such as construction, assembly line work, cleaning, and so on are (by and large) unaffected by the wave of generative AI transformation – at least for now. But combine generative AI with robots and that may change. We could see AI-equipped robots working in all sorts of sectors, such as factory floors, retail stores, hotels, and construction sites.

Combining Materials Science And Generative AI
Generative AI is already beginning to play a role in the discovery and design of new materials. How? By simulating various properties, analyzing vast datasets, and applying predictive analysis to project outcomes. Basically, generative AI can help to reduce the trial-and-error involved in material discovery and design.

This will aid and expedite the discovery of materials with novel properties. It will enable rapid prototyping of new materials, and even enable materials to be more easily customized for specific industries and applications.
Accelerating Synthetic Biology And Gene Technology
As with materials science, generative AI also promises much for synthetic biology and gene technology, acting as a catalyst in the synthesis of novel biological systems (and the refinement of existing ones). By leveraging vast datasets derived from genomic sequences and biological research, generative AI models can predict the potential outcomes of genetic alterations, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of research and innovation.
This could benefit our world in several ways. For one thing, it could lead to a new era of personalized medicine, where treatments can be tailor-made to suit an individual’s genetic makeup. Or it could aid the development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) designed to enhance crop yield, nutritional value, and resistance to pests.
Hooking The Brain Up To ChatGPT? Introducing Brain-Computer Interfaces
Brain-computer interfaces – devices that allow the human brain to communicate directly with a computer, for example, via an implant or chip – may sound like science fiction. But companies like Neuralink are already working on such interfaces.
Combine brain-computer interfaces with generative AI and the possibilities are truly mind-blowing. You could, for example, have access to the entire internet instantly from your brain, and need only think of a question to be presented with the AI’s answer. It’s astonishing stuff – the ultimate merger between humans and machines.
The key takeaway is that we’re at a critical inflection point, where multiple groundbreaking technologies are coming together. From now on we will continue to see massive acceleration of machine intelligence – and we can expect that to accelerate other cutting-edge technologies in turn.

A new report on generative AI reveals that most service professionals believe GenAI will be a large part of their future — and the work to prepare for that needs to begin now

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is no longer the technology of the future — it is here now. The process of integrating GenAI systems into daily work — and figuring out what that means for the future of professional work — has begun.
Professionals in service industries such as legal, tax & accounting, risk & fraud, and government operations have long adapted to new ways of working, at varying degrees and to differing extents. Upon ChatGPT’s initial public release in late-2022, however, GenAI and related technologies have promised a more disruptive potential. Indeed, GenAI offers the opportunity to create entirely new content, in plain language or easy-to-understand images, in a way that mimics human output in a fraction of the time.
To dig into the potential GenAI revolution and its impact on how professional service work is done, the Thomson Reuters Institute recently published its 2024 Generative AI in Professional Services report. The survey was conduct online with 1,128 respondents in January and February 2024. Respondents were screened to ensure that they were familiar with GenAI technology and were located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
Interestingly, the report found that while GenAI usage is currently not widespread, many professionals believe that GenAI can and should be used in the future — and many of their organizations are already making preparations for that reality.
The current state of GenAI
As the report shows, GenAI use is still in its nascent stages, with many more organizations exploring the technology than actively using it on a daily basis. About one-quarter of the report’s survey respondents said their organizations were already using GenAI or had active plans to use it, with usage higher among all legal and corporate risk & fraud respondents than for tax & accounting or government respondents.
Almost one-third of all respondents said their organizations were still considering whether or not to use GenAI. This could be one-off usage of public platforms such as ChatGPT, but increasingly, this also includes tools built specifically for industry use cases — such as legal research or drafting tools, or those that could spot accounting irregularities or aid in tax return preparation, risk assessment, and compliance reporting.
At the same time, the report shows that many service professionals are still figuring how to integrate GenAI into their daily work product and into their overall business plans as well, with no uniform answer among legal and tax professionals as to how they plan to approach GenAI costs and whether GenAI will cause their rates to raise.
Looking to the future
For all the questions currently surrounding GenAI, there is a growing feeling that its presence will continue to be felt for years, across all industries.
In fact, early sentiments skewed positively towards GenAI’s impact on professional services. A large portion of respondents (44%) said they were hopeful or excited about GenAI’s introduction into their industry, while more than one-third of respondents (35%) said they were hesitant, and 18% said they were concerned or fearful.

This sentiment is reflected in how many believe GenAI can and should be used for work in their respective industries. A large majority (81%) said GenAI can be applied to their work, while fewer (54%) said they believe GenAI should be applied to their work. These figures are slightly higher than the responses to a similar question asked of for legal and tax professionals in a previous survey done in Spring 2023.
Further, among those respondents who said they believe GenAI should be applied to their work, many focused particularly on the business impact of the technology. Tax industry respondents, for example, pointed to increasing efficiency and productivity, streamlining work processes, and improving quality and accuracy of work. Legal industry respondents, meanwhile, pointed to GenAI’s potential for cost savings, its ability to allow professionals to spend more time on high-value tasks, and its capacity to aid in quality control checks.
Overall, the 2024 Generative AI in Professional Services report illustrates how the professional services market is reacting quickly to a potentially disruptive force in GenAI. Although its true impact may seem a proposition for far in the future, planning for its impact now is critical.
As our research shows, those proactive organizations that have already begun to explore how GenAI will change the future of their work will gain a distinctive advantage of those organizations without such inclination or planning.

THE TUC special taskforce report on an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Employment Rights Bill is published today, April 18. Comprising of the TUC, the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, unions academics and employment rights specialists the taskforce was set up to try to secure proper regulation of AI and algorithmic management to halt Britain’s tech sector from becoming the “wild west” of the economy. The report makes several key recommendations including a legal requirement for employers to consult unions on the use of “high risk” and intrusive forms of AI in the workplace; a legal right for job seekers and workers to have a human review of decisions made by AI systems so they can challenge AI decisions that are unfair and discriminatory; amendments to the Equality Act to guard against discriminatory algorithms; protections against unfair dismissal by AI; a prohibition on some uses of emotion recognition technology and a right to a personalised explanation of high-risk risk decisions made by AI workers in Britain’s media, digital and tech sector, accounting for over two million jobs will be on the AI front line. One of the key problems is that union membership in the tech sector remains stubbornly low in many countries, with a diverse employment base — from large corporations to small start-ups — many with precarious and third-party employment. From the 1980s onwards unions tried to recruit new members in tech areas by setting up specialist ‘associations' to attract tech workers or using high profile  campaigns imported from USA where “start up unions” such alliance@ibm (which joined the Communication Workers of America) in global companies. What sounded good failed to achieve mass union membership after years of grinding management opposition, and “re-balancing the workforce”. But maybe things have turned the corner. In 2023 workers at the Swedish fin-tech company Klarna demanded representation and collective bargaining by joining Unionen. The company told the workforce collective bargaining “did not fit their business model.” The Unionen union organised immediate strike action and 5,000 workers in Stockholm won union recognition and a collective agreement. In the US workers in the video gaming company Sega of America followed Raven Software, Blizzard Albany, ZeniMax, and game developer Tender Claws in winning union recognition. AEGIS-CWA (Allied Employees Guild Improving SEGA — Communication Workers of America) organised across Sega facilities including workers in marketing, product development and sales to build membership and making it now the largest video game union in the US. In Romania, Sindicatul IT Timisoara (SITT the Romanian IT Union) now represents 3,000 tech and outsourced workers at Alcatel-Lucent, Wipro, Accenture and Alto and were helped in organising by the European Union federation Uni Europa. In Britain the CWU, via the United Tech and Allied Workers Union Branch, is organising workers in Apple stores; the white-collar union Prospect has launched a tech sector and Unite’s London Digital and Tech branch has seen a membership boost since 2023. James Bowen the secretary of the Unite London Digital and Tech branch told me: “The branch had doubled in size over due to organising in ‘big tech’ firms such as Google. We’ve also grown at firms where we were well established, such as Voyix and Atleos thanks to the work of our Representative during pay negotiations. We are recruiting members from a diverse range of companies such as Accenture, the BBC, Cap Gemini and Computacenter.” The branch organised protests at Google at its Kings Cross HQ in London over redundancies which gained a national profile — and increased union membership. 2023 was a pivotal year with over a quarter-of-a-million workers in tech industries globally laid off. So far in 2024, there have been layoffs at Pixar, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla and TikTok among others.
Microsoft’s 1,900 global layoffs in January this year have made tech workers “union conscious.” The fact is they are no different to other workers — they join unions for protection and representation, and to find collective and just solutions to problems.” And the good news, Bowen says, is “that members are keeping up their membership even when the threat of lay offs recedes.” He says AI will be a major challenge: “AI can replace a real person and workers become concerned for their jobs. Service desk, first-line roles which are heavily scripted can be replaced by an online chatbot. AI can be used to write code, reducing the number of software developers required so there are fears over job security.”
And there are fears over AI discrimination: “People have biases and this impacts the many choices that are made when building and training an AI whose purpose is to make decisions which impacts people’s lives. There’s a good argument to be made that AI should not make any management decisions.” The branch is also running meetings for tech workers on AI with speakers from Equity, the performing arts and entertainment union, on the impact of AI on voice-over artists. “Clare Vernade an ex-member of ours who now teaches ‘machine learning’ has done a session and were are happy to share our experiences and the video of Clare’s presentation is available on our site. Other Unite reps have been in touch with us wanting to discuss how we are handling AI.” On April 25, in partnership with Media North and the Festival Of Debate, Unite national officer for the print, media, digital and tech sector, Louisa Bull, along with the NUJ general secretary Michelle Stannistreet will run the session AI: Threats And Opportunities For The Media — see www.festivalofdebate.com to book your place.

Artificial Intelligence is the process of building intelligent machines from vast volumes of data. Systems learn from past learning and experiences and perform human-like tasks. It enhances the speed, precision, and effectiveness of human efforts. AI uses complex algorithms and methods to build machines that can make decisions on their own. Machine Learning and Deep learning forms the core of Artificial Intelligence. 

AI is now being used in almost every sector of business:
Transportation
Healthcare
Banking
Retail
Entertainment
E-Commerce
Now that you know what AI really is, let’s look at what are the different types of artificial intelligence?
Check out:Best AI and ML courses 
Types of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence can be broadly classified into several types based on capabilities, functionalities, and technologies. Here's an overview of the different types of AI:
1. Based on Capabilities
Narrow AI (Weak AI)
This type of AI is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches, or driving a car). Most current AI systems, including those that can play complex games like chess and Go, fall under this category. They operate under a limited pre-defined range or set of contexts.
General AI (Strong AI)
A type of AI endowed with broad human-like cognitive capabilities, enabling it to tackle new and unfamiliar tasks autonomously. Such a robust AI framework possesses the capacity to discern, assimilate, and utilize its intelligence to resolve any challenge without needing human guidance.
Superintelligent AI
This represents a future form of AI where machines could surpass human intelligence across all fields, including creativity, general wisdom, and problem-solving. Superintelligence is speculative and not yet realized.
2. Based on Functionalities
Reactive Machines
These AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions. They analyze and respond to different situations. IBM's Deep Blue, which beat Garry Kasparov at chess, is an example.
Limited Memory
These AI systems can make informed and improved decisions by studying the past data they have collected. Most present-day AI applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving cars, fall into this category.
Theory of Mind
This is a more advanced type of AI that researchers are still working on. It would entail understanding and remembering emotions, beliefs, needs, and depending on those, making decisions. This type requires the machine to understand humans truly.
Self-aware AI
This represents the future of AI, where machines will have their own consciousness, sentience, and self-awareness. This type of AI is still theoretical and would be capable of understanding and possessing emotions, which could lead them to form beliefs and desires.

That was a research question addressed by MIT Sloan Professor Danielle Li at a recent session of the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research (IWER) weekly seminar series.
On April 9, Li gave a presentation based on her National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working paper “Generative AI at Work,” coauthored with Erik Brynjolfsson, the Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Professor and Senior Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, and Lindsey Raymond, a doctoral candidate at MIT Sloan. Li is an Associate Professor of  Technological Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Strategic Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, as well as a Faculty Research Fellow at NBER.

MIT Sloan Associate Professor Danielle Li
Li, Brynjolfsson, and Raymond studied the rollout of an AI conversational support tool for workers providing technical customer support via chat for a Fortune 500 company that sells software products to small businesses. The tool was rolled out in the workplace in 2020 and 2021, and the researchers were able to analyze data from 3 million chats involving 5179 customer support workers, including 1.2 million chats involving 1636 workers after they had access to the AI tool.
This AI tool offered conversational suggestions and links to resources to the workers providing customer support, but the workers had the choice about whether or not to adopt the tool’s suggestions. Li explained that not all of the tool’s suggestions were great, so workers didn’t blindly follow its advice; in fact, they adhered to only about 38% of the tool’s suggestions, on average.
Overall, access to the new tool increased worker productivity by about 14% on average, with the productivity gains concentrated among lower-skill, newer workers. For the most skilled workers, the efficiency gains from the tool were close to zero. By using the tool, “newer workers move down the experience curve faster,” Li explained, noting that such generative AI tools learn from the behavior of better workers and disseminate those best practices to lower-skilled workers.
There were also some signs that tips from the AI tool made a difficult job more pleasant: Customers swore less at workers and were less likely to ask to speak to a manager, and worker turnover decreased. With the AI tool’s assistance, newer workers get yelled at less frequently by unhappy customers, Li said.

Foundation models will form the basis of generative AI's future in the enterprise.
Large language models (LLMs) fall into a category called foundation models. Language models take language input and generate synthesized output. Foundation models work with multiple data types. They are multimodal, meaning they work in other modes besides language.







This enables businesses to draw new connections across data types and expand the range of tasks that AI can be used for. As a starting point, a company can use foundation models to create custom generative AI models, using a tool such as LangChain, with features tailored to its use case.
The GPT-n class of LLMs has become a prime example of this. The release of powerful LLMs such as GPT-4 spurred discussions of artificial general intelligence -- basically, saying that AI can do anything. Since its release, numerous applications powered by GPTs have been created.
GPT-4 and other foundation models are trained on a broad corpus of unlabeled data and can be adapted to many tasks. That's what makes it a foundation model.

What is a foundation model?
Foundation models are a new paradigm in AI system development. AI was previously trained on task-specific data to perform a narrow range of functions.
A foundation model is a large-scale machine learning model trained on a broad data set that can be adapted and fine-tuned for a wide variety of applications and downstream tasks. Foundation models are known for their generality and adaptability.
GPT-4, Dall-E 2 and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are all foundation models. The term was coined by authors at the Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Models and Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) in a 2021 paper called ""On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models.""
The authors of the paper stated: ""While many of the iconic foundation models at the time of writing are language models, the term language model is simply too narrow for our purpose: as we describe, the scope of foundation models goes well beyond language.""
The name foundation model underscores the fundamental incompleteness of the models, according to the paper. They are the foundation for specific spinoff models that are trained to accomplish a narrower, more specialized set of tasks. The authors of the Stanford HAI paper stated: ""We also chose the term 'foundation' to connote the significance of architectural stability, safety, and security: poorly constructed foundations are a recipe for disaster and well-executed foundations are a reliable bedrock for future applications.""


Characteristics of foundation models
The main traits of foundation models include the following:

Scale. To make foundation models powerful, there are three ingredients that enable scale for foundation models:



Hardware improvements. GPUs, which power foundation models' chips, have significantly increased throughput and memory.
Transformer model architecture. Transformers are the machine learning model architecture that powers many language models, such as BERT and GPT-4.
Data availability. There is a lot of data for these models to train on and learn from. Foundation models need large quantities of unstructured data to train.



Traditional training. Foundation models use traditional machine learning training methods, such as a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning, or reinforcement learning from human feedback.
Transfer learning. By using knowledge learned from one task and applying it to another, models use transfer learning on surrogate tasks and then fine-tune to a specific one. Pretraining is the type of transfer learning used in the GPT-n series of language models.
Emergence. Model behavior is induced rather than explicitly constructed. The model produces results that are not directly related to any one mechanism in the model.
Homogenization. Homogenization means that a wide range of applications could be powered by a single generic learning algorithm. The same underlying method is used in many domains. The Stanford Institute HAI paper stated that almost all state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models are adapted from one of only a few foundation models.



Examples of foundation model applications
Foundation models are fine-tuned to create apps. GPT-3 and GPT-4 have become the basis for many applications in the short time they've been around, with ChatGPT being the most notable. A paper from researchers at OpenAI, OpenResearch and the University of Pennsylvania posited that GPTs -- the AI model -- exhibit qualities of general-purpose technologies. General-purpose technologies, such as the steam engine, printing press and GPTs, are characterized by widespread proliferation, continuous improvement and the generation of complementary innovations. These complementary technologies can work with, support or build on top of the GPT.
The paper's findings showed that, with access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the U.S. could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality.



One example of a foundation model is Microsoft's Florence, which is used to provide production-ready computer vision services in Azure AI Vision. The application uses the model to analyze images, read text and detect faces with prebuilt image tagging.
Sweden is attempting to build a foundational LLM for all major languages in the Nordic region: Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Faroese. It would be used primarily by the public sector. The Swedish consortium running the project has gained access to the supercomputer Berzelius, along with hardware and software help from Nvidia. The model is still in development, but early versions are available on Hugging Face.
Hugging Face is an open source repository of many LLMs, sort of like a GitHub for AI. It provides tools that enable users to build, train and deploy machine learning models.


How are foundation models used?
Foundation models serve as the base for more specific applications. A business can take a foundation model, train it on its own data and fine-tune it to a specific task or a set of domain-specific tasks.
Several platforms, including Amazon SageMaker, IBM Watsonx, Google Cloud Vertex AI and Microsoft Azure AI provide organizations with a service for building, training and deploying AI models.
For example, an organization could use one of these platforms to take a model from Hugging Face, train the model on its proprietary data and fine-tune the model using prompt engineering.


Opportunities and challenges of foundation models
Foundation models are multimodal because they have multiple capabilities, including language, audio and vision.
Because of their general adaptability, foundation models could provide numerous opportunities and use cases in a variety of different industries, including the following:

Healthcare. In this industry, foundation models show promise for generative tasks, such as drug discovery. An IBM foundation model -- Controlled Generation of Molecules, better known as CogMol -- recently generated a set of new COVID-19 antivirals using a common architecture called a variational autoencoder. IBM's MoLFormer-XL is another foundation model currently being used by Moderna to design messenger RNA medicines.
Law. Law uses generative tasks that foundation models could help with. However, they currently lack the reasoning ability to generate truthful documents. If they could be developed to show provenance and guarantee factuality, then they would be beneficial in this field.
Education. Education is a complex domain that requires nuanced human interaction to understand students' goals and learning styles. There are many individual data streams in education that together are too limited to train foundation models. Still, foundation models could be broadly applicable to generative tasks, such as problem generation.

Despite their broad potential, foundation models pose many challenges, including the following:

Bias. Because foundation models stem from only a core few technologies, inherent biases due to social or moral issues in those few models might spread through every AI application.
System. Computer systems are a key bottleneck for scaling model size and data quantity. Training foundation models might require a prohibitively large amount of memory. The training is expensive and computationally intensive.
Data availability. Foundation models need access to large amounts of training data to function. If that data is cut off or restricted, they don't have the fuel to function.
Security. Foundation models represent a single point of failure, which makes them a viable target for cyberattackers.
Environment. It takes a large environmental toll to train and run large foundation models, like GPT-4.
Emergence. The outcomes of foundation models can be difficult to trace back to a particular step in the creation process.



Foundation model research
""On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models"" is just one of the influential research papers about foundation models. AI research is being published at a significant clip. Here are some other foundational AI research papers to know about:

""Attention Is All You Need."" This paper introduced the transformer architecture, which became a new standard in AI systems using NLP.
""BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding."" This paper introduced BERT, which became a widely used language model for pretraining.
""Language Models are Few-Shot Learners."" This paper introduced GPT-3, which laid the groundwork for ChatGPT. GPT-3 could perform a wide range of NLP tasks with little to no task-specific training.
""DALL-E: Creating Images from Text."" This paper was the basis of Dall-E, an AI that generates images from natural language output.

Ben Lutkevich is the site editor for Software Quality. Previously, he wrote definitions and features for Whatis.com.

Why Is Generative AI Important?
Generative AI is important because it takes AI in a more mature direction, making the technology more accessible and useful to a larger audience.
Individuals can make use of this technology in their daily lives at little to no cost. More important, breakthrough innovations in areas like medical imaging and drug discovery are now possible to develop at scale because of generative AI.
Finally, this technology can better define, contextualize, and automate business operational tasks than previous types of AI ever could, making this a technology that is already being applied to and ripe for more enterprise use cases.
How Does Generative AI Work?
Depending on what users are trying to generate, generative AI works through different types of large AI large language models that undergo extensive training with massive datasets and deep learning algorithms on an ongoing basis.
This type of training allows generative AI tools to pull data-driven knowledge from all corners of the web and other resources, which makes it possible for these AIs to generate believable, human-like data and results. The deep learning, neural network design intends to mimic a human brain, which also helps generative AI software to understand context, relationships, patterns, and other connections that have traditionally required human thinking to grasp.
To learn how generative AI models work and how users can make the most of their capabilities, read this guide: What Is a Generative AI Model?

This comprehensive study explores the attitudes, perceptions, and usage of GenAI among professionals in the legal, tax & accounting, risk & fraud, and government sectors. Conducted in early 2024, the survey gathered valuable insights from respondents across the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, primarily featuring partners, managers, directors, general counsel, assistant general counsel, attorneys, and judges. The report offers a deep dive into the transformative impact of GenAI on professional services, and here is a brief summary of how legal professionals specifically perceive AI-powered technology and its potential applications in their daily work. Key findings The report reveals a positive outlook toward GenAI, with about one-quarter of professionals saying their organizations have already begun to update workflows by incorporating GenAI. However, concerns regarding the potential for unethical and fraudulent uses of GenAI were also acknowledged, underscoring the need for robust ethical frameworks and responsible implementation strategies.  Perceptions of GenAI for legal professionals Legal professionals are seeing the benefits of GenAI, with 88% of corporate legal departments believing it can be applied to their work. The top reason for this optimism is the potential for increased efficiency and productivity. GenAI can automate many of the time-consuming tasks that legal professionals currently perform, such as document review, contract analysis, and legal research, freeing them up to focus on more strategic and complex work. It could also amplify skills and work for paralegals and legal assistants. Despite the automation, there are some concerns about the potential for unethical and fraudulent uses of GenAI. Some people worry that GenAI could be used to create fake legal documents or to mislead judges and juries.  The unauthorized practice of law looms as a perceived threat specific to the legal industry, as shown in the report. Some GenAI technology lacks the legal expertise and qualifications to provide legal advice, yet they could potentially be deployed to offer such services without proper regulation. “The example of Michael Cohen relying on AI to generate case cites resulted in fake legal citations being relied on by his counsel. AI cannot replace a lawyer’s research and understanding of legal issues,” explained one law firm partner. However, most professionals believe that the benefits of GenAI outweigh the risks, with nearly half of all respondents saying they were hopeful or excited about the future of GenAI.  Usage of GenAI for legal professionals The majority of legal professionals believe that GenAI can be applied to their work. Just 12% of legal industry respondents say they use legal-specific GenAI today, but an additional 43% said they plan to do so within the next three years.  Using industry-specific GenAI tools for legal work ensures that the data and machine learning algorithms used are tailored to the specific needs and regulations of the legal industry. This increases the accuracy and reliability of the results, making it a more responsible and safe option compared to using public-facing GenAI tools, that may not have the necessary safeguards in place.  The use of industry-specific GenAI tool use has the potential to equal, or even surpass, public-facing GenAI use for the legal industry by 2027.See why in the full report  GenAI’s impact on the legal industry The use of GenAI is raising questions about how rates may change. As legal GenAI becomes more sophisticated and can handle more complex tasks, law firms may be able to adopt alternative fee arrangements instead of the billable hour model, allowing them to offer their services at lower rates, making legal services more accessible. Clients are also beginning to demand that their outside firms use GenAI. More than half of respondents from corporate legal departments (58%), as well as nearly half of court systems (44%) and government legal departments (40%), said the outside firms they work with should be using GenAI.   The future of work Despite certain challenges, the possibility of GenAI’s impact on the legal profession is clear. GenAI has the potential to make legal professionals more efficient, productive, and flexible. Some organizations are already planning for structural changes to the way they approach personnel and business operations, and some organizations are actively training their legal teams and staff on proper GenAI usage. Those organizations that wait could risk becoming quickly left behind. The future of work for legal professionals with GenAI is bright.  2024 Generative AI in Professional Services Read the full report Never miss an update – check out more on the topic of artificial intelligence for legal professionals.   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceInnovationLegal Topics","['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]",,,,,1-888-728-7677,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The result is a new open-access collection of 25 research papers that provide road maps, policy recommendations, and calls for action about generative AI from MIT experts. Topics range from using generative AI in education, manufacturing, and drug development to how generative AI will affect inequality and music discovery.
The research papers are being widely shared as quickly as possible because generative AI is evolving at a rapid pace and they could “serve as a springboard for further research, study and conversation about how we as a society can build a successful AI future,” Kornbluth said in an introduction to the collection. The papers are all works in progress and may be further developed. They have not been formally peer-reviewed.
MIT Sloan faculty members and researchers contributed to the following research projects. 
AI in engineering and manufacturing 
From Automation to Augmentation: Redefining Engineering Design and Manufacturing in the Age of NextGen-AI
This paper examines the barriers, risks, and potential rewards of using generative AI for design and manufacturing. MIT Institute professor Daron Acemoglu, MIT Sloan economist Simon Johnson, and co-authors interviewed manufacturing experts and industry leaders to find weaknesses that need to be addressed by the next generation of generative AI tools.
Implementing Generative AI in U.S. Hospital Systems
AI can transform health care, but there are often challenges when new technologies are introduced into clinical settings. In this paper, the researchers, including MIT Sloan professors Kate Kellogg and Retsef Levi, look at the difference between deploying narrow, or traditional, AI and generative AI in health care systems and how challenges associated with both technologies inform where AI might be most effective. 
AI’s impact on work and productivity 
The Impact of Generative AI on Labor Market Matching
MIT Sloan PhD student Justin Kaashoek and MIT Sloan professors Manish Raghavan andJohn J. Horton discuss areas where generative AI might appear in the labor market, including AI-generated cover letters, resumes, and job postings. The researchers examine the risks and benefits of these uses and identify ways to mitigate risks while promoting the benefits of AI.
The Productivity Effects of Generative AI: Evidence From a Field Experiment With GitHub Copilot
Two field experiments found evidence that software developers at Microsoft and Accenture who were given access to an AI-based coding assistant became more productive. The researchers, including MIT Sloan professor Mert Demirer, indicated that their findings are preliminary and that the team is still in the process of collecting additional data.
Bringing Worker Voice Into Generative AI
Input from workers can increase the likelihood that organizations use generative AI tools effectively and that workers’ job quality improves. The researchers, including MIT Sloan professors Thomas A. Kochan and Emilio J. Castilla and MIT Sloan MBA candidate Ben Likis, identified ways to bring workers’ voices into the development and use of generative AI.
Practical AI applications 
Generative AI From Theory to Practice: A Case Study of Financial Advice
Researchers, including MIT Sloan professor Andrew W. Lo, looked at the most pressing issues facing the adoption of large language models. Using financial advice as a test for determining the shortcomings of LLMs, the researchers suggest ways to improve generative AI in general. 
Labeling AI-Generated Content: Promises, Perils, and Future Directions
How should policymakers, platforms, and practitioners decide how to label AI-generated content? MIT Sloan professor David G. Rand and other researchers outlined two goals for labels: communicating whether a piece of content was created or edited using AI, and diminishing the likelihood that content misleads or deceives its viewers. They found that under certain conditions, labeling can decrease individuals’ likelihood of believing or engaging with misleading AI-generated images.

Study: Generative AI helps inexperienced workers  


New AI capabilities rely on massive, widely sourced, and under-documented training data. In their paper, the researchers, including MIT professorSandy Pentland, identify the shortcomings of existing tools for data authenticity and consent and argue for new universal data provenance standards.
Generative AI for Pro-Democracy Platforms
Generative AI has the potential to promote civil discourse, gather citizen input on policy questions, and strengthen democratic practices. A research team that includes Pentland presents a framework to help policymakers, technologists, and the public assess potential opportunities and risks when incorporating generative AI into online platforms for discussion and deliberation.
Generative AI and the Future of Inequality
Many fear that generative AI could lead to more inequality and even mass unemployment. MIT Sloan professor Nathan Wilmers summarizes existing research about how generative AI will likely affect the labor market and inequality. In particular, Wilmers looks at how the effects of generative AI will likely differ from previous technologies.

For all the hype about artificial intelligence revolutionizing the world, its impact on the boardroom has so far been minimal. Until very recently, many corporations would have found the idea of appointing a chief metaverse or chief artificial intelligence officer laughable, yet the latter is quickly becoming the C-suite’s hottest new role.


Despite not even existing just a few years ago, these new C-level positions are being filled not just at bleeding-edge startups but in more established enterprises, too. According to Foundry’s AI Priorities Study 2023, 11% of midsize to large organizations have already designated an individual for the chief AI officer (CAIO) role, and another 21% of organizations are actively seeking one.

But simply appointing a new member of C-Suite is no guarantee you’ll solve the challenges or reap the opportunities presented by AI or Web3. A well placed hire to get AI embedded in your company’s DNA can be the ticket to a fast, innovative approach.

As Teresa Carlson, an advisor at General Catalyst and the former Worldwide Public Sector executive for Amazon Web Services, told me, “In the U.S. government, CAIO roles will serve as a critical leadership position as they transition the use of AI in mission critical capabilities. A relevant example is the U.S. intelligence community just named John Beiler as the chief artificial intelligence officer at the office of the Director of National Intelligence. His role will be to direct the deployment of AI and machine learning along with covering privacy, protections, and civil liberties that of course must be taken into account when the IC develops algorithms. The IC community will need a consolidated view across all agencies on an AI strategy which the CIO will play a critical role.”

The much harder (though ultimately far more valuable) task is to understand how these roles contribute to your organization’s core strategy, what kind of work they actually entail, and how new technologies transform the dynamics and responsibilities within the boardroom. That may require a new, dedicated CxO. Equally, it might be far better to evolve an existing role. So rather than rushing to fill a new boardroom chair, businesses would do better to take a breath and work out precisely what they want to achieve—and who’s best to do it.

Who’s in charge?
On the face of it, creating one of these new “chief” job roles makes sense. Who better to champion and oversee the transformative capabilities of AI and the metaverse than someone with a dedicated seat at the top table? But hang on a second. Let’s say your organization is an insurance firm—one of the many industries that are profoundly affected by AI. What’s the value in appointing a data scientist to the C-suite if they don’t know the difference between an underwriter and a broker, say?
The key lesson is: Don’t be dazzled by people who know how AI works. Never forget that you will always know your own business better than they do—and that’s what matters most.An installation uses artificial intelligence to visualize historical documents and photographs.Getty Images
There’s a very good argument that the best person to take on responsibility for AI initiatives already sits in the boardroom. For example, the chief marketing officer (if that’s where AI is going to have the most meaningful, transformative and strategic impact on your business). By the same token, it might be the chief technology officer, given this role requires a thorough understanding of both tech and business priorities. It could even be the CEO.
Recent history gives us examples of how new job titles are often subsumed into other, more traditional C-suite roles. We only have to look at the chief cloud officer (CCO) role, a position that was crucial as we transitioned into the cloud computing era, but which eventually just came to be a standard part of the CTO or CIO’s responsibilities. The same fate could feasibly fall on the CAIO and CMO, although events like CAIO Summit 2023 are working to make them indispensable.
On the other hand, having a dedicated CxO may well be the best option. Lan Guan agrees. As the chief AI officer at Accenture
ACN
-0.4% and an exceptional female leader at a huge multinational IT company with over 730,000 employees, she told me she believes every business should have a CAIO. “Artificial intelligence doesn’t happen in a vacuum,” she says. “It needs evangelists and champions. Above all, it needs leaders. We weren’t alone in seeing the enormous potential of generative combined with classical AI to transform the enterprise, but that wouldn’t have happened nearly as fast or as well without creating a dedicated role.”Lan Guan is the chief artificial intelligence officer at Accenture.Lan Guan
No matter how advanced, technology is always a tool that works best when applied to clearly defined and well-understood problems. It is always the servant of wider organizational goals rather than your business’ master. That’s why the best people to oversee AI and Metaverse initiatives might well be those who are already in charge.
The New C-Suite
I know from personal experience just how impactful an effective chief metaverse or artificial intelligence officer can be in transforming a business. But real success depends not on the role itself, but how well enterprises understand the changes within the traditional boardroom dynamic that they entail.
Because these new technologies have a virtually unlimited range of applications since they touch on so many aspects of business operations, the person in charge of AI or the metaverse needs to be something of a Renaissance (wo)man. Not only do they need to build teams with a wide range of technical and vertical skill sets, they also need to navigate the complex organizational politics of having such a wide-roving brief.Digital generated image of young woman jumping out from portal gate and being scattered to ... [+] particles. Metaverse concept.getty
For example, will this person have responsibility for internal investments and external partnerships? How much control do they get over setting and spending budgets? Who reports to them and to whom do they report? How does this reshape the chain of command? These are just some of the questions to consider when fitting new technology into existing corporate structures. They are also key considerations when selecting who will be in charge.
A Peek Into the Inbox
Following President Biden’s executive order on AI, many federal agencies are now required to name a CAIO, responsible for promoting AI and managing its risks and rewards. If the government installs CAIOs, we can be sure that major businesses will follow suit.
But what will these people actually do? At the federal level, CAIOs will “spearhead internal policy decisions, regulations and workforce recruitment to implement and utilize AI tools effectively.” In the corporate world, however, whoever’s in charge of AI and metaverse initiatives will have a much more varied and indeed challenging set of responsibilities.
Cathy Hackl, known to many as the “godmother of the metaverse” and a former chief metaverse officer, explains how hard it is to pin down these roles. “Every day is different, and you never know what challenges are going to land in your inbox,” she told me. “The only thing that never really changes is that my role requires me to be an evangelist and educator. I spend a lot of my time traveling, presenting and speaking—both at industry events and internally at my company.”Cathy Hackl is known to many as the “godmother of the metaverse.”Cathy Hackl
Hackl added, “I work across practically every line of business, so it’s a big challenge to be thoroughly on top of the detail about each department. I need to ensure I understand what their goals are, and they need to know how new technology can help accomplish them. But there’s also a lot of roll-your-sleeves-up, down-and-dirty work with the technology itself, whether it’s designing virtual components or shepherding implementation projects.”
If that sounds like a lot to have on your plate, it barely scratches the surface of the challenges ahead. Take ethics, for example. As the Women Leaders in Data and AI’s Executive Champion Award 2023, this is a particularly strong focus for me.
The overarching challenge is how to integrate AI in the corporate world, drive innovation, and try not to slow down any implementation timelines, all while being completely ethical, transparent and honest.
Whose role is it to predict unforeseen risks that any implementation could contain, and to handle change management? Who’s responsible for making sure that no one is disadvantaged by new technologies—so often designed and built by white men—and guard against unwitting discrimination? It may be that the most valuable CxO for your business reputation is actually a chief ethics officer rather than a head of metaverse.
None of this is to deny that the roles I mentioned at the beginning of this article have enormous potential value, and could be transformative for your organization. It is to point out that there’s a huge amount of preparatory work to do before you order those new business cards. In any technological revolution, one of the most difficult things to resist is the urge to jump on the bandwagon so as not to be left behind.
My advice? Let fools rush in and make their own mistakes. This opportunity is far too precious to waste, so take your time to think about what you want to achieve rather than what you’re going to name the role.

This is the foundation of Thomson Reuters CoCounsel generative AI (GenAI). Westlaw, Practical Law, and CoCounsel Drafting are built on 150 years of human insight, categorization like the Key Number System, and editorial enhancements that ensure the quality and structure of the source material. Thomson Reuters CoCounsel Core searches and analyzes your own trusted documents and delivers insights you can verify. Having humans in the loop as the AI is trained, deployed, and used is the way to ensure that work product has the integrity and accuracy clients need.  For Thomson Reuters, “human in the loop” means that knowledgeable attorney editors work with technologists to train the system and reduce hallucinations. It means human designers work with end users and attorney editors to ensure that the system understands prompts the way a legal researcher is likely to write them. And it means that a human attorney reads and validates every result and suggested text before using it in a brief or contract.   Generative AI in Westlaw Precision with CoCounselGenAI will help legal researchers using Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel. In addition to searching Westlaw Precision with Boolean and natural language searches, legal researchers are now able to engage with Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel in a conversational manner, much like they would with a colleague. AI-Assisted Research on Westlaw Precision can read and synthesize content across databases to bring back a clear answer to a question like, “Can social media publicity prove that a trademark is famous for a dilution claim?” It also provides the authority the answer relies on so users can verify the response and understand the nuance of the law.  Providing the authority for the answer is one way the GenAI features from Thomson Reuters minimize hallucinations. When you can see the reasons for the response, you can verify for yourself that the answer makes sense and is based in fact.   Westlaw Precision with CoCounselGet a relevant answer with links to trusted Westlaw authority in momentsJumpstart your legal research  Generative AI in Practical LawThomson Reuters Practical Law also incorporates GenAI. The Practical Law team has been providing know-how for decades, with content developed by attorneys who are experts in their practice areas. Legal practitioners rely on it to help them get started on new matters and new areas of law. With the more chat-like experience that GenAI enables, that experience will be even better.  Ask Practical Law AI will help attorneys get to the answers they need faster. For example, if you have a question about how to get started drafting an indemnification provision, you can simply type your question, without filtering to a practice area or sorting through practice notes. The model will return the answer after consulting the trusted Practical Law resources. It will also provide the sources for the answer and steps for further research.   Ask Practical Law AI Introducing Ask Practical Law AI on Practical Law: Generative AI meets legal how-toRead blog post CoCounsel Core from Thomson ReutersCoCounsel Core is a package of GenAI skills from Casetext, part of Thomson Reuters. The one-year-old product does document review, deposition preparation, contract analysis, and timeline creation in minutes. It uses GPT-4 from OpenAI to analyze your document set.  For instance, you can upload a set of contracts to CoCounsel Core and ask the tool specific questions like, “What are the payment terms?”, “Do these contracts comply with company policy?”, or “Where are disputes brought?” CoCounsel Core will give you an answer and show you which language it relied on to develop that answer.   Using GenAI to draft legal documentsCoCounsel Drafting is an end-to-end drafting solution, that pairs GenAI capabilities with trusted Thomson Reuters content. It enables you to easily find the best starting point, use content from Practical Law and your contract repository to improve your contract language, create, manage, and compare playbooks with 3rd party contracts, and draft with confidence using a seamless integration with Microsoft Word. CoCounsel Drafting reimagines the drafting workflow. Eliminate the pains that come with every day drafting using secure generative AI capabilities trusted by legal professionals.  GenAI grounded in truthThere’s still a lot of hype surrounding GenAI. Many people are excited about how these capabilities can streamline their work. At the same time, there’s a fair bit of skepticism about tools that function as a black box.

Earlier this year, a New York law firm made headlines after getting blasted by a judge for using ChatGPT to estimate its legal costs.
Among documents submitted to the court, Cuddy Law Firm included an analysis from OpenAI's generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool. Lawyers from the firm had asked the chatbot how much they should charge their client for the case they'd just won — and tried to use it to help justify the $113,484.62 bill.
Judge Paul Engelmayer was not pleased. He said that ChatGPT wasn't a good tool for calculating legal fees because the platform didn't have the right information to make an informed decision. He called the move ""utterly and unusually unpersuasive.""
While legal tech companies are pushing tools into the market, lawyers are still in the dark about how to use generative AI, let alone the best ways.
However, even though this technology is still evolving, there are ways to use generative AI to make legal work easier.
Generative AI tools on the market
Generative AI refers to technology that generates content based on prompts entered into the system. For example, a tool like ChatGPT can generate questions to ask a client on an intake form or create an image for a blog post about how to find a lawyer.
ChatGPT may be the most talked about AI tool, but it's not the only one on the market. For law firms, the most common tools include Microsoft's Copilot, which is integrated into Office 365, Google's Gemini, and Claude AI from Anthropic, which is competing with OpenAI to create the most human-like AI tool.
Legal tech companies are quickly adopting generative AI tools such as CoCounsel, a legal assistant that can review documents, help draft communication, and search documents.
There’s also Lexis AI+ from LexisNexis, which can summarize case law, help draft client emails, and search for cases.
In Canada, CanLII is rolling out a generative AI tool that summarizes case law, legislation, and administrative tribunal decisions. It's available in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and the Yukon.
What makes these legal AI tools different from ChatGPT is that they're built on existing legal databases to ensure more accurate information.
Jennifer Wondracek, a law school professor and director of the law library at Capital University Law School in Ohio, recently spoke at the American Bar Association's ABA TECHSHOW about how lawyers should be using generative AI.
""AI has been around since 1955,"" she says. ""We have Siri, Alexa and so many other AI products around us. What's important is figuring out what you need and understanding how AI works.""
Wondracek recommends reading the terms and conditions of any generative AI tool before using it, as it can present privacy and confidentiality issues. These tools are trained on data, and where that data comes from is the main issue for large language models like ChatGPT and Copilot. Currently in the United States, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are among the companies facing lawsuits for copyright infringement.
Users also have to opt-out to ensure their data isn't being used to train the software. Even then, there can be loopholes. Law firms have recently discovered that Microsoft's privacy policy allows the company's employees to read AI prompts to identify any hate or violent content.
While some of these tools have free access, those versions won't protect your data.
""You have to buy licenses because it has stronger privacy terms,"" Wondracek says. ""But even paid personal licenses may not have the data protection clauses you need for legal work, so look for enterprise or business-oriented licenses.""
Sanjay Khanna became the chief information officer at Cox and Palmer last year at the beginning of the ChatGPT craze. He's excited about the technology but wants firms to think about governance and compliance before deciding what to use.
""The legal industry can benefit greatly from generative AI due to the amount of data that can be used to create new content for legal and non-legal matters,"" Khanna says.
""It's important that firms assess and analyze the data utilized and ensure that client confidentiality and legal regulatory standards are followed.""
Khanna says getting the best results from generative AI requires organization. At Cox and Palmer, that's meant streamlining information management processes on how documents are stored, searched, and retrieved.
How lawyers can use generative AI
Here's the thing: generative AI is only as good as what you ask it. That's why prompt engineering is quickly becoming one of the many skills tech companies are clamouring for. It's the practice of creating inquiries for AI tools that will produce optimal outputs. It's more sophisticated than searching for a phrase or words since most generative AI tools also allow users to upload documents.
""Think about what you want and how to ask for it,"" says Wondracek. ""When I'm researching children under the age of 18, I have to think about the different ways we name people that age: minors, children, infants, etc. Think about what jurisdiction you're looking for too.""
Then there's the issue of hallucinations — the phenomenon where generative AI tools create false information as a result of trying to fill in data gaps in the system's database. While some legal AI companies claim to be hallucination-free, Wondracek says they can’t be fully eliminated.
""Legal AI companies are sitting on top of legal databases and that helps to try to mitigate them,"" she says, adding that ultimately, hallucinations are part of the package.
""It's a trade-off. You can tweak the underlying commands used to retrieve data but hallucinations will still occur.""
One of her tips is to always check your work. Guidelines from law societies in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan all require lawyers to check what they've generated from AI tools. Lawyers must also ensure confidential client information isn't entered into generative AI systems.
Wondracek says verifying information means reading every case you've cited to ensure the right law has been referenced and to confirm that the court cases exist.
The common thread when lawyers have been caught using fake citations? They’d all used ChatGPT for legal research, something Wondracek says should be a no-go.
Instead, lawyers should think of generative AI as a great place to start or finish — ""the sandwich method"" of doing legal work. For instance, start with generative AI tools to create questions for discovery or come to it after completing a draft of oral arguments to help make them more persuasive.
""You can have it write a high-level memo or look at contract clauses. You can feed it long PDFs and ask questions about the document. There are many mundane tasks generative AI can do,"" Wondracek says, noting she uses it to create onboarding checklists for new employees.
""But ChatGPT is not intended to do research.""
While mundane may not sound as exciting as having the technology do all the work, she says it can help lawyers make things easier and faster in their legal practice.
""There's lots of other things generative AI can do. Lawyers need to explore and figure out what works for them.”

What Percentage of Emerging Tech Jobs Focus on A.I.?

Some 29 percent of “emerging tech” jobs involve artificial intelligence (A.I.) skills, according to the latest CompTIA Tech Job Report. 

Last month, CompTIA classified 65,241 jobs as “emerging tech,” and 19,100 of those involved artificial intelligence in some way (either as the job itself, or heavily relying on artificial intelligence skills). The top states for A.I. job postings included (in descending order) California, Texas, Virginia, New York, and Washington, DC—no surprise, as these tech hubs host a plethora of tech giants with the funding and talent necessary to build out solid A.I. stacks. 

If you’re interested in mastering A.I. skills as part of your next job hunt, keep in mind that it all comes down to more than just mastering, say, TensorFlow or other tools. You’ll need to master a handful of more abstract, transferrable skills that’ll allow you to operate effectively in this brave new world.

Those skills (as we’ve broken down before) include: 


Critical thinking and problem-solving
Data literacy
Intellectual curiosity
Commitment to continuous learning
Identifying and addressing ethical challenges in tech/A.I.


If you want to quickly boost your knowledge about A.I. itself, multiple online resources can help you. For example, online learning portals such as Coursera have courses from the likes of DeepLearning.AI, IBM, Vanderbilt University, and other institutions. For those who want a certificate to slap on a resume, Udacity also offers a generative A.I. “nanodegree” program, with a focus on skills such as the OpenAI API, image pre-processing, and more; prerequisite skills include Python, neural networks, and more.

If you want to learn generative A.I. skills as fast as possible, Google also has online tutorials focusing on that tech, which include videos, quizzes, and short lessons:

Generative AI, explained
Introduction to Generative AI 
Introduction to Large Language Models 
Generative AI Fundamentals Skill Badge 
What is Generative AI Studio? 
Introduction to Generative AI Studio 
Introduction to Image Generation 
Introduction to Responsible AI 
Responsible AI: Applying AI Principles with Google Cloud 



Once you have those skills in place, A.I.-centric jobs will often ask you to use them to build models and help companies analyze data. For example, an average day for a machine learning engineer might involve the following: 

Researching, designing and implementing ML models and systems
Implementing machine learning algorithms and tools
Scaling data science prototypes
Selecting appropriate data sets, verifying data quality, cleaning and organizing data (in collaboration with data engineers)
Performing statistical analysis
Executing tests and optimizing machine learning models and algorithms
Monitoring systems in production and retraining them to improve performance
Utilizing machine learning libraries

Yes, these skills are complicated and can take some time to learn—but demand for A.I.-related jobs is clearly high, and those who’ve mastered the necessary tools and tricks can earn premium pay. Last year, a study by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Access Partnership found that employers “are willing to pay an average of 47 percent more for IT workers with A.I. skills.”

The State Department is encouraging its workforce to use generative AI tools, having launched a new internal chatbot to a thousand users this week. The move comes as the agency leans heavily on chatbots and other artificial intelligence-based tools amid the Biden administration’s push for departments to look for use cases for the technology. 
“Of our workforce, there are a lot of people who haven’t been playing with ChatGPT,” State Chief Information Officer Kelly Fletcher said Thursday at AIScoop’s AITalks event in Washington, D.C. “We’re encouraging them to do so, but they need training.”
The internal chatbot, which FedScoop previously reported on, is an example of how the agency is weighing how generative AI might help with tasks like summarization and translation. It comes in response to staff demand. 
Beyond the chatbot, the State Department is using artificial intelligence for other purposes, including declassifying documents, said Matthew Graviss, the agency’s chief data and artificial intelligence officer. The department is also using open-source models to help create a digital research assistant for certain mandated reports, though he didn’t name those documents.

The department is also using public tools with public information to help synthesize information for ambassadors, Graviss said. “You don’t need FedRAMP this and FISMA that to do that kind of stuff,” he added. “Public tools work.” 
Earlier this month, FedScoop reported that the Department of State had removed several references to artificial intelligence use cases in its executive order-required inventory. 
Other agencies, meanwhile, have taken a variety of approaches to generative AI, with some more cautious about exploring the technology. Others are setting up sandboxes to explore generative AI tools, working, for instance, with versions of OpenAI tools available on Azure for Government.

Faculty unions are starting to take their concerns about artificial intelligence out of peer group discussions and into contract negotiations.
The advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)—which largely hit the general public when ChatGPT launched in November 2022 —immediately began causing concern for some faculty members across the nation. Faculty unions, from local state associations to national behemoths, are now discussing how to ensure their concerns are addressed by their institutions’ administrators.
“It’s looking at ethical concerns, data protection and educators’ involvement as AI continues to evolve,” said Noel Candelaria, secretary-treasurer at the National Education Association (NEA).

The NEA represents nearly 200,000 members and expects to have language finalized in July that members can use as a framework for their own bargaining. The union expects to lay groundwork focused on questions—centered on issues such as ethical concerns, data protection and educators' involvement—that faculty should be asking administrators as they create AI policies.
“We know what it looks like right now, but it will evolve and look different in how we as educators remain a central part of the policy processes,” he said.
Boston University faculty were alarmed earlier this month after the university’s dean of arts and sciences, Stan Sclaroff, emailed faculty suggesting they use AI to help manage course discussions, labs and student feedback during a strike by graduate students.

“What Dean Sclaroff is advocating in his memo is that in cases where some discussion groups have been affected by the union’s job action, professors should consider a wide range of teaching tools available to them to offset the absence of a striking teaching assistant,” Boston University said in a statement to Inside Higher Ed.
That AI was mentioned at all among other “creative” options raised alarm bells for Service Employees International Union Local 509 chapter, which represents BU faculty and staff.
“We sincerely hope that the university would reconsider this suggestion and instead focus on properly compensating the people who do the work that is crucial in keeping the university running,” the union’s BU chapter said in an email to Inside Higher Ed.

Some large university unions, including the California Faculty Association and the United University Professions, or UUP, which represents the State University of New York System, aren’t concerned about being immediately replaced by AI. 
“I think job replacement is a valid concern and I think [faculty and staff] could understandably be nervous about it,” said Kevin Wehr, bargaining team chair for the California Faculty Association. “Am I in a panic? No. Should others be? No, I don’t think they should think the sky is falling. We have a lot of issues facing higher ed and this is just one of many.”
However, concerns about the impact of AI on faculty members’ intellectual property rights and workload, and potential diminished autonomy have cropped up among faculty unions across the nation.

“We’re not being luddites; it’s not, ‘tech is bad and people will lose their jobs,’” said Laurie Stoff, a member of United Campus Workers of Arizona, which represents the state’s three public universities. Stoff, a professor at Arizona State University, is also a member of the Faculty Senate’s “AI Concerns” subcommittee. 
“Our argument is it’s our job to serve students, educate them, ensure their success, uplift them and provide them the best opportunities for their learning. We don’t see this as a valuable way to do that,” she said of the notion of using AI for teaching.
“There’s a lot we could potentially learn from other sectors of laborers who have dealt with automation in the past,” said Alissa Karl, the UUP’s vice president for academics. “We can be in a place where we’re creative and look to other industries.”
The State University of New York system has doubled down on investments in AI over the last few years, including a $200 million statewide AI initiative to boost research, policymaking and workforce development. The UUP’s contract was ratified in August 2023 and expires in 2026.
Although none of the union representatives interviewed called for the banning of artificial intelligence in higher ed, Karl said specific, detail-oriented conversations are best for discussions on AI policies. 
“We’ve heard off-the-cuff assertions from leadership about how easy it would make our lives to use AI to write syllabi, which has created a lot of alarm,” she said. “If someone generated a syllabus with the assistance of AI, would they be disciplined for it? We don’t know. We don’t have clear guardrails and boundaries.”
Multiple unions—including the NEA and the American Federation for Teachers—suggest the “gold standard” of creating AI policies is getting specific language in labor agreements that are enforceable if a disagreement arises between faculty and administration. 
The unions recommend faculty and staff members working at institutions or in states without strong unions—such as Arizona where it is illegal to have collective bargaining agreements—get college administrators to codify AI policy language in an employee handbook. Stoff, of Arizona State University, cited using demonstrations, social media, petitions and direct requests to the state regents, to press for better work environments. 
“Our goal is to make the universities the best place they can be for the students we serve, because our working conditions are our students’ learning conditions,” Stoff said. “When we improve those, everyone benefits—the whole university becomes a better, more welcoming, more constructive place.”

Login     Listen to this article 4 min    One in two lawyers in Australia and New Zealand have already used generative artificial intelligence to perform day-to-day tasks and almost the entire profession believe it will change how legal work is carried out in future.These were the key findings of a recent survey of more than 560 lawyers and legal professionals by legal information and analytics provider LexisNexis, which found that in-house lawyers were adopting the tools more quickly than their law firm counterparts.Allens chief innovation and legal solutions officer Lisa Kozaris: “While it certainly doesn’t replace the work that a lawyer would do, it really gets them to an advanced first draft much more quickly.” Louise KennerleyDrafting emails and conducting legal research were the most popular applications of generative AI. The research found 18 per cent used it for the former and 15 per cent used it for the latter.Other popular uses included summarising documents, understanding legal concepts and improving work quality and efficiency.Allens chief innovation and legal solutions officer Lisa Kozaris said the survey’s findings aligned with the law firm’s experience of generative AI.Related QuotesAdvertisementShe told The Australian Financial Review that lawyers at the firm were mostly using the technology to summarise lengthy documents, compare clauses across different documents and identify key points and action items from meetings.Others use it to check the tone of an email, translate documents or help explain technical concepts such as “spinning reserve” in power generation.“It’s not to be used instead of research, but [using it] to give an initial sense of a technical concept has been another use case,” Ms Kozaris said.Lawyers at the firm have access to Microsoft Copilot and two in-house tools: Chronology Plus, which helps lawyers create and present chronologies, and Airlie, the law firm’s own version of ChatGPT that was developed with Microsoft and built on the tech giant’s Azure platform.“While it certainly doesn’t replace the work that a lawyer would do, it really gets them to an advanced first draft much more quickly,” Ms Kozaris said, adding that close to half the firm are using the tools every day.“It means that lawyers can then really sort of apply their judgments and finesse the final work product, as opposed to doing summarisation or copying and pasting information.”AdvertisementMs Kozaris said Allens chose to develop its own version of ChatGPT so that lawyers could use the technology without sending client data beyond the company’s digital systems and without inadvertently training the next model of ChatGPT.“We’ve developed a huge volume of documents from advising clients in lots of different sectors over many years, so we’re now experimenting with [pointing Airlie] to collections of our own knowledge, so that our lawyers can really [use the tool] with much more reliable data,” Ms Kozaris said.‘It’s really about experimenting’King & Wood Mallesons senior associate Kendra Fouracre said she used generative AI to draft, proof, edit and otherwise improve emails and other written communications sent to clients.She said it was also helpful in transcribing and producing summaries of meetings.“It’s really about experimenting, being curious and actually continually learning what generative AI is best for [in] the legal profession,” Ms Fouracre said.AdvertisementTo ensure the tools are used ethically and responsibly, KWM requires every lawyer to undergo mandatory training to understand the limitations of generative AI tools before they are allowed to use them. Ms Fouracre said this helped to maintain high standards of governance.The LexisNexis survey found that almost all respondents (94 per cent) agreed generative AI would have an impact on routine tasks leading to significant efficiencies. But 52 per cent were also sceptical about generative AI’s ability to conduct legal research due to questions over its accuracy, traceability, completeness and ability to provide citations.In-house lawyers lead the wayGreg Dickason, LexisNexis’ managing director for Asia and the Pacific, said the research also revealed that in-house lawyers were keener adopters of generative AI than their law firm counterparts.Fifty-two per cent of in-house lawyers had already used AI, compared to 42 per cent in law firms, the research found.Mr Dickason said this could be because in-house lawyers were less risk averse and unencumbered by billable hours.“They’ll do whatever they can to get the job done,” he said, noting in-house lawyers often had to make do with fewer resources as well.RelatedHow soon will machines outsmart us?

        ""It could enhance workers’ productivity but also threatens some jobs. Investing in digital infrastructure and skills, as well as in strong social safety nets will determine the pace of AI adoption and its impact on productivity,"" she said.
    




        Earlier, Kristalina Georgieva urged African governments to adopt AI as a catalyst for rapid economic development across the continent.
    




        She emphasized AI's transformative potential in reshaping global economies, particularly in labor markets.
    




        Addressing attendees at the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Summit, Georgieva outlined key areas crucial for fostering growth.
    




        She said ""This is the likely largest transformation of our economies that we have experienced since the Industrial Revolution. It can be this big bang that allows us to live longer, healthier, better educated, more productive lives. But it is not given that we would take advantage of the benefits and manage well the risks. We face urgently the necessity to embrace AI and make the best out of it.""

I’ve been in the business of helping major, multinational companies build workforce resilience for more than a decade. Now, a once-in-a-generation change is upon us. With generative AI, we will soon surmount one of the biggest obstacles to improving how people work and live: making vast, complex workforce well-being data accessible, understandable, and actionable.


The power of resilient workforces for business growth is undeniable. As AON research shows, organizations that improve well-being increase company performance by up to 55%. In my company, we’ve helped our customers lower turnover, decrease burnout, and save millions of dollars by building the resilience of their workforce.

PROMOTED
This work begins with methodologically rigorous data collection on core psychological factors that influence workforce performance. For example, which departments have strong problem-solving skills, or lack a sense of trust? Which division shows emotional signs of stress, such as anger or frustration?

Data collection is non-negotiable. You can’t fix what you can’t see. At the same time, we are more motivated to fix what we can see, especially when we understand why performance and engagement problems are occurring and how to address them.

Getting to that “why” is the hard part. A tremendous amount of complex information comes out of the data collection. Leaders typically do not have the skills or the staff to analyze it, let alone operationalize it. Training up or hiring new staff isn’t affordable for most businesses. In an era of scarce labor, finding the right talent is itself a problem.

If we can’t make sense of the data, we can’t see what’s really happening in our workforces. We end up spending money on the wrong things, attempting to solve problems that might not be the vital issues. We’re feeling our way in the dark.

We turn the lights on with generative AI.
Pair thorough psycho-cognitive data collection with the astounding analytic capacity of generative AI, and we get sophisticated workforce insights faster, more efficiently, and in ordinary language. We will not need Ph.D.-level analyst support to understand what the information’s telling us. We’ll be able to enhance and advance our well-being and resilience data in a snap. With generative AI, we can be the data professionals who truly know what’s going on in our companies.
With this analysis, C-suite leaders and managers alike will also be able to see clearly which actions best foster resilience in their people. The clarity will in turn equip us to take swift, accurate, and effective action.
What’s more, as we build our generative AI tools to speak in natural language, we’ll be able to share our data insights with colleagues and supervisors simply and persuasively. The all-important “why” that drives engagement—from individual employee behavior change for greater resilience to CHRO sign-off on a resilience initiative—will be at our fingertips.
With generative AI tools, business and HR leaders will be able to:


Be more connected to our businesses. AI will help us identify, with unprecedented speed, which specific business units are struggling with resilience and in which ways. If sales has low confidence, or a shipping unit has high anxiety, we’ll be able to pinpoint those trends precisely.
Understand how motivational and behavioral factors drive performance. These tools will show how underlying psychosocial factors drive engagement, i.e., how lack of confidence relates to burnout rates, or how poor emotion control can drive low productivity.
Operationalize our knowledge. Generative AI will help us connect data analysis with action. Which resilience-based interventions are proven to best improve chronic frustration? What’s our most effective path to greater problem-solving skill? Then we’ll be able to deploy those plans.
Share insights across departments and job roles. No longer will we struggle to convey what we’ve learned to our customers and colleagues. With precise insights delivered in ordinary language, generative AI lets all stakeholders see how key psycho-cognitive factors impact performance and how to most effectively address them. We’ll be able to see the likely upside of taking action, as well as the risk of doing nothing


Generative AI to build resilience in the workforce may well be revolutionary technology. Let’s be clear, though. AI is not the endgame. It is only a tool, and one that needs strong, ethical standards to govern our use of it. But as we develop this tool, as it helps us see and solve problems better and faster, it will accelerate our power to build exceptional workforces, grow our businesses, and know what it takes to help people work and live at their best.

  What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?  
 Artificial intelligence (AI) technology allows computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving tasks. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take action to achieve a specific goal. AI research began in the 1950s and was used in the 1960s by the United States Department of Defense when it trained computers to mimic human reasoning.1 


 A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning (ML), a concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without human assistance.


Key Takeaways
Artificial intelligence technology allows computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities.Algorithms are part of the structure of artificial intelligence, where simple algorithms are used in simple applications, while more complex ones help frame strong artificial intelligence.Artificial intelligence technology is apparent in computers that play chess, self-driving cars, and banking systems to detect fraudulent activity. 
  How Artificial Intelligence (AI) Works  
 Artificial intelligence commonly brought to mind the implementation of robots. As technology evolved, previous benchmarks that define artificial intelligence became outdated. Technologies that enable Artificial Intelligence include:1



Computer vision enables computers to identify objects and people in pictures and photos.
Natural language processing (NLP) allows computers to understand human language.
Graphical processing units are computer chips that help computers form graphics and images through mathematical calculations. 
The Internet of Things is the network of physical devices, vehicles, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, that collect and share data.
Application programming allows two or more computer programs or components to communicate with each other.





Algorithms often play a part in the structure of artificial intelligence, where simple algorithms are used in simple applications, while more complex ones help frame strong artificial intelligence.
  Types of Artificial Intelligence  
 Narrow AI: Also known as Weak AI, this system is designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games like personal assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Users ask the assistant a question, and it answers it for you.

 General AI: This type includes strong artificial intelligence systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. They tend to be more complex and complicated and can be found in applications like self-driving cars or hospital operating rooms.



Super AI is a strictly theoretical type of AI and has not yet been realized. Super AI would think, reason, learn, and possess cognitive abilities that surpass those of human beings.
  Using Artificial Intelligence  
 Artificial intelligence can be applied to many sectors and industries, including the healthcare industry for suggesting drug dosages, identifying treatments, and aiding in surgical procedures in the operating room.


 Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. AI has applications in the financial industry, where it detects and flags fraudulent banking activity. Applications for AI can help streamline and make trading easier.


 In 2022, AI entered the mainstream with applications of Generative Pre-Training Transformer. The most popular applications are OpenAI's DALL-E text-to-image tool and ChatGPT. According to a 2024 survey by Deloitte, 79% of respondents who are leaders in the AI industry, expect generative AI to transform their organizations by 2027.2


 What Is Reactive AI?
Reactive AI is a type of Narrow AI that uses algorithms to optimize outputs based on a set of inputs. Chess-playing AIs, for example, are reactive systems that optimize the best strategy to win the game. Reactive AI tends to be fairly static, unable to learn or adapt to novel situations.


 What Are the Concerns Surrounding the Use of AI?
Many are concerned with how artificial intelligence may affect human employment. With many industries looking to automate certain jobs with intelligent machinery, there is a concern that employees would be pushed out of the workforce. Self-driving cars may remove the need for taxis and car-share programs, while manufacturers may easily replace human labor with machines, making people's skills obsolete.


 How Is AI Used in Healthcare?
In healthcare settings, AI is used to assist in diagnostics. AI can identify small anomalies in scans to better triangulate diagnoses from a patient's symptoms and vitals. AI can classify patients, maintain and track medical records, and deal with health insurance claims.


  The Bottom Line  
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an evolving technology that tries to simulate human intelligence using machines. AI encompasses various subfields, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning, which allow systems to learn and adapt in novel ways from training data. It has vast applications across multiple industries, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. While AI offers significant advancements, it also raises ethical, privacy, and employment concerns.

Nearly Half of High School Students Say Generative AI will Significantly Change the Future Workforce, Global Survey Reveals

Most U.S. and U.K. 16- to 18-year-olds polled are looking to schools to help them prepare for the new AI landscape
Philadelphia, PA, April 3, 2024 — With the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI), nearly one in two high school students polled think the workforce as we know it today will undergo a major transformation, a new global survey shows.
More than 48% of those queried believe that hard skills will become less important and soft skills, such as reasoning and creativity, will increase in demand, according to the survey, conducted in March by the Philadelphia-based Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).
As a result, 28% of the students said workers will need to acquire new skills to thrive in the new AI workplace, and more than two-thirds are looking to their schools to help position them for future success.
The survey polled 825 11th and 12th-grade students from across the U.S. and sixth-form students in England and Wales to get their insights on the impact of generative AI on their academics and future careers. The 16- to 18-year-old students queried are participants in this year’s MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge (M3 Challenge), an annual internet-based, intensive math modelling contest organized by SIAM.
When asked what best reflects their thoughts about generative AI, the majority (47%) stated they worry that it will be difficult for students of the future to reach their full potential in a generative AI world, relying on technology more than their own capabilities. About 40% said generative AI will change the world as we know it today, impacting almost every industry and career, and that it will be increasingly important to master generative AI tools to succeed academically and in the future workforce.
Nearly half of the students polled expressed some degree of concern about the potential loss of jobs in the future workforce due to certain roles becoming automated or obsolete. Only 19% think the AI workforce of the future will deliver greater productivity as people work faster and smarter.
Dr. Karen Bliss, Senior Manager of Education and Outreach at SIAM said:
“The survey demonstrates that many students feel that they need to take steps now to prepare for an evolving workplace,”.
Schools can do more
To that end, Bliss explained that most survey respondents are looking to their schools for help and guidance, with 68% saying their school isn’t doing enough to prepare students for the future world of AI.


How can high schools prepare students for the future world of AI? The majority (62%) of those queried suggested that schools offer guidance on the ethics of using AI, including boundaries related to AI content creation, misuse, and plagiarism.
Other recommendations included having schools provide practical training on how to most effectively use generative AI tools for academics (58%), teach the limitations of AI as it relates to academics (41%), and help identify careers that may be – or are less likely to be – disrupted by AI so students can plan their future academics accordingly (38%).
“Interestingly, one in five students would like to see schools offer extracurricular activities to boost their AI skills and experience, while almost as many think it would be helpful if teachers make using generative AI tools mandatory in assignments,” Bliss said.
Other survey findings
With many mathematics teachers grappling with the place of generative AI in math class, the survey asked respondents for their thoughts on this topic. Almost half (46%) said they think mathematics skills will become more important with the growth of generative AI, while 26% stated that they don’t think it will have much effect.
Of the students who predicted mathematics skills will increase in importance in the future, 68% explained that effective use of AI still requires human reasoning and those with a good grasp of math are more apt to succeed. Others said that as the AI field continues to grow, there will be more demand for mathematicians to develop AI tools and systems (56%) and that data analysis is an important part of using AI, a skill honed by mathematics studies (52%).
Dr. Kathleen Kavanagh, Director of the Institute for STEM Education at Clarkson University and an M3 Challenge judge said:
“With the fast emergence of AI tools, these are exciting times in mathematics and computer science since we will be able to tackle a broader range of problems more efficiently,”
“AI can certainly help with some tasks, but it cannot replace critical thinking, logical reasoning, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Now more than ever, students need to pay attention in math classes and build those skills so that they can successfully navigate in a complex, rapidly changing world.”
Now in its 19th year, the M3 Challenge involves high school juniors, seniors, and sixth-form students, working in small teams for 14 consecutive hours to devise a solution to a real-world problem using mathematical modelling. Of the hundreds of participating teams, nine finalist teams were selected from across the U.S., England, and Wales, after having their submissions judged by an international panel of Ph.D.-level mathematicians. Finalist teams will receive an all-expenses-paid trip to New York City to participate in the competition’s final judging event, which will take place on April 29.

					Founder & President, Moss Networks				




April 8, 2024




 








Bonnie Moss, president and founder of Moss Networks navigates through the haze of sensationalism, revealing the true capabilities, implications, and potential pitfalls of Generative AI. From its impact on employment to its role in safeguarding privacy.
Generative AI is one of the more exciting technologies to hit the market in a long time. But at times, it’s also one of the most misunderstood. This is a shame because the confusion and hype surrounding it isn’t doing anyone – providers, users, and potential beneficiaries – any favors.
The sooner we clear things up, the sooner we reap its true benefits.
Generative AI is Not Going to Wipe Out Humanity
I recognize that the Center for AI Safety warned that AI could lead to societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war. The Center’s statement made headlines for days. The many voices of reason were lost in those sensational headlines, specifically the numerous experts who rightly countered that generative AI was far from that capability.
The fact is that generative AI needs humans to train it on things humans have created. Take ChatGPT as an example, which essentially predicts what someone might say based on what people have said in the past. Generative AI can’t make the kind of colossal leap required to enslave humanity – a scenario so profoundly unique it would require massive amounts of human-labeled data to execute. 
At that point, who is doing the evil deed, the data scientists who curate and label the data or the AI itself? Maybe someday, there will be a technology capable of enslaving humans without our input, but it won’t be AI, given its dependence on humans.
It does seem to me, however, that this warning is an attempt to deflect attention away from the real challenges of AI, namely discrimination and potential violations of privacy – precisely the things the regulators are warning us about.

Generative AI, like All AI, Will Change Work, Not Eliminate Workers
AI has scared the American workforce ever since I can remember. Back in 2016, a survey conducted by KRC Research found that 82% of workers feared that AI was coming for their jobs.
In April 2023, a Goldman Sachs report warned generative AI could eliminate up to 300 million jobs – if it lived up to its touted capabilities. Hollywood writers went on strike partly due to a fear of ChatGPT writing television and movie scripts. After all, entertainment studios did have open job recommendations for generative AI specialists. Those job descriptions described different tasks, such as deploying it to make better content recommendations to end users.
But writers need not fear – at least not yet. Research from Freelancer.com found that AI wasn’t equal to the creativity of humans. Freelancer.com looked at 280,000 jobs posted to its site and found that in the second quarter of 2023, while the writers’ strike began, creative writing jobs were up 58%.
“AI can’t replace creativity yet. While workers and businesses are benefiting from productivity gains offered by generative AI, the data suggests that the technology in its current form isn’t able to replace creative work. We saw a similar trend occur in the first quarter of the year, as creative design jobs were flourishing despite interest for generative AI tripling,” Matt Barrie, Chief Executive at Freelancer.com, says in the report. What’s more, many freelance writers are earning serious money. CNBC found writers on the site who charge a rate of $250 per hour.
But generative AI, like all AI, is changing work for the better by eliminating the drudgery of repetitive tasks and enabling workers to focus on their jobs’ strategic and creative aspects. For instance, OpenWeb’s 2024 Media Trends ReportOpens a new window  notes that publishers see generative AI as allowing them to reimagine critical roles, such as revenue and ad operations.
The Real Benefits of Generative AI
Hallucinations and inaccuracies aside, generative AI offers tangible benefits, mostly by helping internal experts speed up their work. 
Take the healthcare industry as an example.  Trenholm Ninestein in Medical EconomicsOpens a new window  writes, “Large language models can help internal data analysts within a hospital find ways to optimize revenue and ensure compliance by asking the model specific questions in natural language about billing codes, insurance regulations, reimbursement guidelines, or any other billing-related queries. The model can help retrieve relevant information and provide insights to support decision-making.”
He continues, “It can also help reduce billing errors by providing real-time suggestions and recommendations to coding staff during the coding process. It can help ensure accurate and compliant coding by offering insights into appropriate codes, modifiers, or documentation requirements based on industry-standard coding guidelines.” 
This is the kind of game-changing efficiency that the OpenWeb publishers discussed. By eliminating the grunt work of formatting questions into language computers can understand, practitioners can get to the information they need to glean strategic insights and make decisions faster and more easily. This is a key benefit of generative AI.
Another is the ability of generative AI to solve some of the privacy challenges that consumer data poses. Rather than use consumer data to train critical customer service-oriented models, generative AI can create synthetic data that acts like real-life data but is privacy-compliant. If this seems far out to you, rest assured that companies like Nurdle are doing just that.
If 2023 was the year of generative AI hype and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), let’s hope that 2024 is a year of realistic awareness of what this incredibly powerful tool can do for workers. While I don’t see it poised to cause massive layoffs or extinctions any time soon, it can make a lot of jobs more efficient and even more satisfying for many people.

‘Think-and-Execute’: A Machine Learning Framework that Encapsulates the Common Logical Structure of a Job Using Pseudocode for Efficient Reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs)

By Tanya Malhotra -   April 8, 2024

In Large Language Models (LLMs), reasoning involves dissecting a problem’s logical structure and turning it into a sequence of logical steps that lead to a solution. For LLMs, this procedure has proven difficult, particularly in algorithmic reasoning where intricate logical patterns must be interpreted and transformed into a series of processes.
Understanding patterns inside an issue and decomposing them into a series of logical stages to arrive at a solution are key components of algorithmic thinking. Although a variety of reasoning tasks have demonstrated the potential of LLMs, algorithmic reasoning remains difficult because of its complex structure.

In order to convey the reasoning required to solve a particular instance or topic, recent studies have tried to address this challenge by employing programming languages like Python. It is challenging to write executable code that faithfully captures the reasoning in a single inference call and does it in real-time. Even if two instances need the same logic, the code created for one cannot be utilized for another.
In recent research, a team of researchers from Yonsei University and KAIST AI has presented THINK-AND-EXECUTE, a unique architecture that splits the language model reasoning process into two parts to get over the limitations. The two parts are as follows.

THINK: The framework looks for a task-level logic in this phase that is shared by all instances of a certain task. Next, pseudocode, which offers a more adaptive and flexible representation than programming languages like Python, has been used to express the shared logic. 


EXECUTE: The framework adapts the task-level logic to each unique instance after it has been defined and stated in pseudocode. Subsequently, it emulates the pseudocode execution for every occurrence, efficiently utilizing the found logic to resolve the issue.

The effectiveness of THINK-AND-EXECUTE has been shown through comprehensive trials on seven algorithmic thinking tasks. The framework beats multiple robust baselines, including Program-of-Thought (PoT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which rely on instance-specific reasoning techniques. This implies that learning task-level logic can help LLMs become more proficient reasoners. Even though these models have been trained to follow instructions in regular language, the results have demonstrated that pseudocode is a more useful tool for directing LLM thinking than natural language. 
The team has summarized their primary contributions as follows.

A new and unique thinking paradigm known as THINK-AND-EXECUTE has been suggested. This framework encapsulates the common logical structure of a given job using pseudocode. The method allows for more efficient reasoning in LLMs by utilizing pseudocode, which provides flexibility and adaptability. 


The team has shown that THINK-AND-EXECUTE outperforms well-established baselines like Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought prompting, based on substantial research on a variety of algorithmic tasks inside the Big-Bench Hard dataset. This demonstrates how well the system works to improve reasoning abilities in a variety of issue domains.


Utilizing THINK-AND-EXECUTE, the team has demonstrated the effectiveness of the method by effectively transferring the pseudocode produced by an LLM to smaller language models. This indicates that the approach is both generalizable and scalable, meaning it can be applied to a variety of model topologies and sizes.

HR is fundamentally about managing humans – so how will the job change in a future where powerful generative AI tools are everywhere?

Empathy, emotional intelligence and an understanding of human nature are essential when it comes to managing a human workforce. Not exactly qualities that machines – even ones as human-like as ChatGPT – are renowned for!


So are we going to see widespread replacement of human HR departments with cold, calculating chatbots that only care about measuring human efficiency and weeding out weakness?

Well, hopefully not. Instead, I think that HR professionals will use generative AI to automate routine and repetitive elements of their work, freeing time for them to nurture and develop the human-to-human skills needed for their more high-value tasks.

Here’s my overview of how I believe the work of HR departments will change – and, in many cases, already is. I'll also take a look at the wider implications for how the place of these essential professionals in society is likely to evolve over the next five to 10 years.

Recruitment And Talent-Hunting
Finding talented people is always a challenge, but generative AI tools will help out with the routine and administerial work. Not just by doing it more quickly, but by finding more efficient and personalized ways to reach out to prospective hires and advertise a workplace.
At the start of the process, it will be used to generate ideas around ideal candidate personas, creating overviews of the skills, qualities and personality traits that might make an applicant right for the job. Then, it can create dynamic, personalized job descriptions aimed at encouraging a wider pool of applicants.
For companies that hire thousands every year, it will be used to carry out initial assessments to ensure candidates meet basic criteria. After that, it can offer simulated interviews and roleplays to help candidates prepare for their application. Rather than used as a form of screening, it should be thought of as a tool that will help recruiters and other HR professionals to get a better understanding of candidates as unique human beings, before meeting them face-to-face.

Workforce Development 
Businesses are going to need to ensure their workforces are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the AI era, and this responsibility falls on the shoulders of HR workers.

Generative AI is great for training – it can create anything from complex technical manuals to simple step-by-step walkthroughs. Public models like ChatGPT already capable of doing this, but businesses will increasingly invest in training their own private AI models tailored to their needs.
These reports can be personalized to individual learners, taking into account their unique skills and learning requirements.
As we move forward, we will find generative video and even world simulation tools becoming available. These will be used to create even more engaging, personalized training experiences. Language models will provide feedback in real-time, just as if the trainee had an instructor standing with them.
There are some risks here – we know generative AI doesn’t always get things right, which could lead to dangerous misinformation or mistakes. So, there will always be a need for transparency about how these systems operate, as well as human oversight.
Workplace Management And Analytics
Rather than spending hours studying metrics and statistics, generative AI tools can quickly analyze data and compile reports highlighting key workforce trends.
It can identify future staffing needs and highlight areas and causes of high staff turnover. It will provide quick, relevant insights into factors like employee sentiment and satisfaction. It will also be used to create narrative and visual projections around the impact of strategic HR decisions.
All of these will make it simpler for HR professionals to understand the underlying human element driving the success or failure of a business.
Of course, we have to be careful when it comes to converting human activities and emotions into numbers. Bias in the way data is collected or the way it’s analyzed can lead to unfair outcomes, and overly-intrusive data gathering or AI initiatives can create unhappy employees. Risks in all of these areas must be carefully assessed and guarded against.
Employee Experience
It’s the job of HR departments to create inclusive, positive experiences for workers throughout the business. Ensuring employees are able to carry out their duties effectively without being hindered or held up by internal processes is a critical task.
Here, generative AI will be used for creating onboarding material that’s relevant to individual new hires, providing answers to common HR queries in a personalized and relevant way through chatbots, and gathering and interpreting employee feedback.
Here, quality of service is of utmost importance. Few things are as irritating as talking to bad chatbots. At the same time, more people are coming to accept that when used well, they can be a very efficient way of getting information.
This all helps HR departments to understand “pain points” that employees go through on a day-to-day basis, as they carry out their work as well as navigate their own career pathways.
The Changing Role Of HR Professionals 
With generative AI taking on the routine and administrative elements of their work, the perception of HR professionals in the workplace will change dramatically. The higher level of visibility given to the human-centric elements of their work will mean they are less likely to be perceived as “back office” or even “faceless” functions, instead becoming more deeply ingrained in the working lives of their colleagues. The role of HR professionals in staff wellness and the development of healthy work/life balance, as well as promoting inclusion and diversity, will come to the front.
This means that the strategic value of HR professionals will grow exponentially. Moving beyond being facilitators of operational efficiency, they will have the chance to become champions of positive organizational change, ethical application of technology, and curators of healthy, caring workplace culture.

The Department of Veterans Affairs plans to pilot several applications of generative AI, a spokesperson for the agency told FedScoop. As part of a “generative AI meta pilot,” the agency plans to test the technologies on open-source large language models that have now been brought into the VA’s already authorized-to-operate platforms. 
Generative AI applications are in “high demand” at the agency, VA spokesperson Gary Kunich told FedScoop. Amid that interest, the department now plans to test the use of generative AI to summarize feedback from VA.gov users and employee surveys run by the Veterans Experience Office, assist employees in human resources and the Veterans Benefits Administration with reading through internal policies, and draft contracting documents, including statements of work and descriptions of jobs. 
There are other generative AI projects, too. The agency is pursuing an ongoing pilot with GitHub Copilot, a generative AI-powered code-completion tool, as well as a generative AI “meta pilot” focused on search, summarization, and content drafting. Current AI tech sprints within the agency related to ambient dictation for clinical encounters and community care document processing also involve generative AI. 
These use cases have not yet been listed on the agency’s public AI inventory, which agencies are required to produce annually by an executive order. As FedScoop reported earlier this year, agencies still vary widely in their approach to generative AI.

But the VA has also ditched at least one generative AI pilot. Last year, the agency experimented with using generative AI in the form of a chatbot but later decided to abandon the project, according to Kunich. The current chatbot used by the agency remains rules- and retrieval-based, though it takes advantage of natural language understanding and processing. 
Current guidance for the technology at the agency, which FedScoop obtained through a public records request, states that no “web-based, publicly available generative AI service has been approved for use with VA sensitive data.” Department staff are also instructed to limit the sharing and saving of data on these systems and to check the output of large language models for accuracy.

A recent survey conducted by staffing firm Adecco Group sheds light on this growing concern, revealing that 41% of executives at large companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforce due to AI in the next five years.Generative AI, a technology that can create realistic text, images, and videos, is gaining traction in various industries. While some view it as a tool to eliminate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency, others worry about the potential obsolescence of entire job roles.According to Denis Machuel, the CEO of Adecco Group,  AI will inevitably impact nearly all jobs in some way or another. It has the potential to both create and eliminate jobs, acting as a double-edged sword. However, he also believes that the impact will be balanced, as the digital revolution of the past decade has shown that new jobs can emerge from technological advancements.The survey included executives from 18 different industries across nine countries, encompassing a wide range of white-collar and blue-collar jobs. The results paint a more alarming picture compared to a previous poll conducted by the World Economic Forum, which revealed that half of the companies believed  AI would generate new jobs rather than eliminate them.Recent layoffs within the tech industry further validate these concerns. Companies like Google and Microsoft are redirecting their focus towards AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini, which has resulted in job cuts. Even non-tech companies like Dropbox and Duolingo have attributed downsizing to the implementation of AI technologies.Economists at Goldman Sachs have previously warned that generative AI has the potential to eliminate or significantly impact approximately 300 million jobs globally, with white-collar workers being the most vulnerable. The findings of the Adecco survey align with this prediction, indicating that this reality may materialize within the next five years.Frequently Asked Questions:1. What is  AI?AI, or  artificial intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses a wide range of technologies that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, problem-solving, and decision-making.2. What is generative AI?Generative AI is a specific branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the creation of new content, such as text, images, and videos, that is indistinguishable from content created by humans. It utilizes algorithms and deep learning techniques to generate original and realistic outputs.3. How will AI impact the job market? AI is expected to have a significant impact on the job market, with some jobs becoming obsolete and new ones emerging. While AI has the potential to automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity, it may also lead to job displacements in certain industries. The ultimate impact will depend on how organizations adapt to and integrate AI technologies.(Source: Adecco Group’s survey on the impact of AI on jobs)In addition to the insights provided in the article, it is worth noting that the impact of AI on jobs extends beyond the fear of job cuts and obsolescence. The rise of AI technology also presents new opportunities and challenges within industries.The growth of generative  AI in various sectors can be attributed to its ability to streamline processes, improve efficiencies, and enhance productivity. Industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and customer service are among those that have embraced AI technologies to optimize their operations.For example, in healthcare, AI-powered algorithms can analyze medical images and patient data to assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment decisions. In finance, AI algorithms can analyze market trends and make predictions to aid investment strategies. In customer service, AI-powered chatbots can handle routine customer inquiries, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex customer issues.Market forecasts support the idea of significant growth in the  AI industry. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global AI market is projected to reach $733.7 billion by 2027, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.2% from 2020 to 2027. This indicates a strong demand for AI technologies across various sectors.However, there are also concerns regarding the ethical implications and potential biases associated with AI. The algorithms used in AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data, often collected from real-world scenarios. If the data used to train these algorithms is biased or lacks diversity, it can lead to discriminatory outcomes in AI applications, perpetuating existing inequalities.To address these concerns, organizations and policymakers are advocating for responsible  AI development and deployment. Initiatives such as the development of ethical AI guidelines, algorithmic transparency, and diversity in AI teams are being promoted to ensure that AI technologies are fair, unbiased, and accountable.In conclusion, while the fear of job losses due to AI is valid, it is essential to consider the broader impact of AI on industries and the potential for new job opportunities. The market forecast reflects the growing demand for AI technologies, and the industry is continually evolving to address concerns related to ethics and biases in AI applications.For more information on the impact of AI on industries and the job market, you can visit the following link: Grand View Research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After watching a video on TikTok, she found a side hustle: training artificial intelligence models for a website called Data Annotation Tech.For a few hours every day, Ms. Becker, 33, who lives in Schwenksville, Pa., would sit at her laptop and interact with an A.I.-powered chatbot. For every hour of work, she was paid $20 to $40. From December to March, she made over $10,000.The boom in A.I. technology has put a more sophisticated spin on a kind of gig work that doesn’t require leaving the house. The growth of large language models like the technology powering OpenAI’s ChatGPT has fueled the need for trainers like Ms. Becker, fluent English speakers who can produce quality writing.ImageMs. Becker playing with her son and daughter at their home in Schwenksville, Pa.Credit...Hannah Yoon for The New York TimesIt is not a secret that A.I. models learn from humans. For years, makers of A.I. systems like Google and OpenAI have relied on low-paid workers, typically contractors employed through other companies, to help computers visually identify subjects. (The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, on claims of copyright infringement.) They might label vehicles and pedestrians for self-driving cars or identify images on photos used to train A.I. systems.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut as A.I. technology has become more sophisticated, so has the job of people who must painstakingly teach it. Yesterday’s photo tagger is today’s essay writer.There are usually two types of work for these trainers: supervised learning, where the A.I. learns from human-generated writing, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, where the chatbot learns from how humans rate their responses.Companies that specialize in data curation, including the San Francisco-based start-ups Scale AI and Surge AI, hire contractors and sell their training data to bigger developers. Developers of A.I. models, such as the Toronto-based start-up Cohere, also recruit in-house data annotators.It is difficult to estimate the total number of these gig workers, researchers said. But Scale AI, which hires contractors through its subsidiaries, Remotasks and Outlier, said it was common to see tens of thousands of people working on the platform at a given time.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut as with other types of gig work, the ease of flexible hours comes with its own challenges. Some workers said they never interacted with administrators behind the recruitment sites, and others had been cut off from the work with no explanation. Researchers have also raised concerns over a lack of standards, since workers typically don’t receive training on what are considered to be appropriate chatbot answers.To become one of these contractors, workers have to pass an assessment, which includes questions like whether a social media post should be considered hateful, and why. Another one requires a more creative approach, asking contracting prospects to write a fictional short story about a green dancing octopus, set in Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX offices on Nov. 8, 2022. (That was the day Binance, an FTX competitor, said it would buy Mr. Bankman-Fried’s company before later quickly backing out of the deal.)Sometimes, companies look for subject matter experts. Scale AI has posted jobs for contract writers who hold master’s or doctoral degrees in Hindi and Japanese. Outlier has job listings that mention requirements like academic degrees in math, chemistry and physics.“What really makes the A.I. useful to its users is the human layer of data, and that really needs to be done by smart humans and skilled humans and humans with a particular degree of expertise and a creative bent,” said Willow Primack, vice president of data operations at Scale AI. “We have been focusing on contractors, particularly within North America, as a result.”Alynzia Fenske, a self-published fiction writer, had never interacted with an A.I. chatbot before hearing a lot from fellow writers who considered A.I. a threat. So when she came across a video on TikTok about Data Annotation Tech, part of her motivation was just to learn as much about A.I. as she could and see for herself whether the fears surrounding A.I. were warranted.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It’s giving me a whole different view of it now that I’ve been working with it,” said Ms. Fenske, 28, who lives in Oakley, Wis. “It is comforting knowing that there are human beings behind it.” Since February, she has been aiming for 15 hours of data annotation work every week so she can support herself while pursuing a writing career.Ese Agboh, 28, a master’s student studying computer science at the University of Arkansas, was given the task of coding projects, which paid $40 to $45 an hour. She would ask the chatbot to design a motion sensor program that helps gymgoers count their repetitions, and then evaluate the computer codes written by the A.I. In another case, she would load a data set about grocery items to the program and ask the chatbot to design a monthly budget. Sometimes she would even evaluate other annotators’ codes, which experts said are used to ensure data quality.She made $2,500. But her account was permanently suspended by the platform for violating its code of conduct. She did not receive an explanation, but she suspected that it was because she worked while in Nigeria, since the site wanted workers based in only certain countries.ImageEse Agboh, a University of Arkansas computer science master’s student, helped a chatbot with coding projects.Credit...Alyssa Pointer for The New York TimesThat is the fundamental challenge of online gig work: It can disappear at any time. With no one available for help, frustrated contractors turned to social media, sharing their experiences on Reddit and TikTok. Jackie Mitchell, 26, gained a large following on TikTok because of her content on side hustles, including data annotation work.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I get the appeal,” she said, referring to side hustles as an “unfortunate necessity” in this economy and “a hallmark of my generation and the generation above me.”Public records show that Surge AI owns Data Annotation Tech. Neither the company nor its chief executive, Edwin Chen, responded to requests for comments.It is common for companies to hire contractors through subsidiaries. They do so to protect the identity of their customers, and it helps them avoid bad press associated with working conditions for its low-paid contract workers, said James Muldoon, a University of Essex management professor whose research focuses on A.I. data work.A majority of today’s data workers depend on wages from their gig work. Milagros Miceli, a sociologist and computer scientist researching labor conditions in data work, said that while “a lot of people are doing this for fun, because of the gamification that comes with it,” a bulk of the work is still “done by workers who actually really need the money and do this as a main income.”Researchers are also concerned about the lack of safety standards in data labeling. Workers are sometimes asked to address sensitive issues like whether certain events or acts should be considered genocide or what gender should appear in an A.I.-generated image of a soccer team, but they are not trained on how to make that evaluation.“It’s fundamentally not a good idea to outsource or crowdsource concerns about safety and ethics,” Professor Muldoon said. “You need to be guided by principles and values, and what your company actually decides as the right thing to do on a particular issue.”Yiwen Lu reports on technology for The Times.

Like many global organizations, German logistics company DHL had career sites for almost every country in which the company operates — nearly 200 of them. Most of the  sites, however, lacked brand consistency and none of them were leveraged to attract new hires. They were merely a place to fill out a job application.
DHL’s country-centric career sites also had limited integrations across a multitude of applicant tracking systems — this at a time when skills-based hiring had been growing to meet digitization and other business transformation efforts.
That prompted DHL to turn to generative artificial intelligence (genAI) to fix its talent recruitment problem by consolidating its 200 disparate sites into one site that parsed job seekers into ranked lists to match the company’s needed skillsets, and to which recruiters could quickly respond.
 
 
 













 
 

To create its unified site, DHL put together its own internal AI team and partnered with Phenom, a Philadelphia-based HR tech startup that sells a SaaS-based platform offering genAI and automation tools.

Though the company now has just one career site, each of its national locations can maintain their own identities with real-time customization capabilities. For example, in Prague, DHL created a site specifically to attract frontline workers for the peak holiday shopping season. (The low unemployment rate in the Czech Republic had made finding talent a challenge.)
 Since the revamped site went live, the number of job seekers per job increased by 25%, 800,000 job searches found a relevant job within 5 milliseconds using AI-enabled features, and more than 200,000 job seekers became applicants in less than 14 minutes of the site’s launch.

Meredith Wellard, vice president of Group Talent Acquisition, Learning and Growth at DHL, oversaw the AI project from the HR side. DHL’s Express division had recently launched the Phenom Intelligent Talent Experience platform and saw early wins, piquing Wellard’s interest. So, she decided to expand it to the entire company. The results were almost immediate. Wellard said the new AI-based career site produced a spike in candidate traffic, greater overall engagement, and faster hires. The shift to a more engaging career site was particularly good at attracting frontline workers, especially truck drivers, delivery people, and warehouse workers.
Wellard spoke with Computerworld about the genAI HR project, and offered insights into how the project rolled out and what other companies should look out for when executing their own genAI-based tech plans. The following are excerpts from that interview:
Tell me about your job at DHL. “I’ve been with DHL for 18 years. Over the last five years, I’ve been working in our corporate center, looking after the group topics when it comes to everything from employer, brand, the way we position ourselves in the markets, attracting and recruiting team members, building their skills, building them into internal talents and then, in principle, also offboarding them in a respectful way. Although we don’t do a whole lot of that.”
 
 
 













 
 

When did you start the project and what hurdles were you facing? “We started the project around 2019. That’s when all of this tech was quite new. We were only just starting to hear about this cool thing called Machine Learning or AI. They were trying to get their heads around what it meant and whether it would really be useful. So probably for the first 12 months, it was about us learning.
“I think that’s an important part for any team venturing out on new technology — learn before you get distracted by the shiny things, you know, that great sales pitch that many companies can do. So, we did a lot of learning, and we were cleaning up our applicant tracking system landscape at that same time — that’s the sort of back end of the recruiting process. Then at one of our divisions — our Express Division — they had actually done quite a lot of work and found Phenom and they had decided to try using Phenom and see if it worked for them. That was quite successful. So, off the back of their success, we thought, ‘You know what? I think this could work for the whole globe.’

“AI is not going to get rid of our jobs. Our jobs are not going to be taken by AI. Our jobs are going to be taken by people who know how to use AI.”
Meredith Wellard
“We set up what we called our Skydiver project. The reason we called it Skydiver was because it was fast, and it was like a jump out of a plane — kind of risky. It worked. We partnered with Phenom and over a six-month period we got the career site up and running. After six months, I think we had like maybe five languages on the site and 70 career sites [consolidated on it]. After about 18 months, we were down to about 11 career sites [that weren’t on it] and up to 21 languages. As of today, which is three years on, we’re on about 40 languages and we’ve got one career site.”
 
 
 













 
 

DHL had 200 career sites. First of all, can you explain that? Why did you have 200 career sites? “So, as you know, we have [about] 600,000 employees, and we’re in basically every country in the world — so, 220 countries. We do operate in a decentralized model, so the power is in the hands of the countries. They need to be really relevant to the local markets. We’re in a service industry, so it’s super important that you know the local environment is reflecting who they are very well when it comes to our recruiting activities.
“We also have a ‘global as necessary, as local as possible’ mindset, and we probably we missed a bit of the global part when we allowed whichever country that wanted to to set up a career site. And a lot of them did. By the time we started to think about partnering with some [of] these great career site tech companies or talent experience platform companies, we realized that we had quite some work to harmonize the landscape and bring together all of those career sites. Some of those sites had a lot of love and care put into creating them on a local level, but they had no [click-throughs] because they were turning up on page 17 of a Google search.
“And so it was quite important for us at the beginning to take those 200 or so career sites and figure out how to bring those together so that the local environments don’t lose what they need in terms of the localization. And it’s way more than language. It’s also things like the way the visuals appear, the way the jobs are presented, how users can click on them.
 
 
 













 
 

“We did a lot of research in the early days, looking at what would someone in Denmark expect from a career site versus someone in Japan, and from a user experience point of view those two are so different…culture-wise — even the visuals like the real estate usage expectations in a country like Japan versus Denmark, where it’s rather more sparse, and you know, spacious. It’s a cultural preference.
“So, we had to take care of all of those things and at the same time really take care to communicate and educate our business around how it wouldn’t be a natural thing for an HR professional — who knows everything about HR, legal aspects, recruiting, what a good interview looks like — it wouldn’t naturally be that they should know what it means to create a good SEO. Or how they could become more transparent on Google search. Or what would it take to have the right words, or the right visuals, or the right number of interactions in order to bring yourself up higher on a search result. This is not something that HR people know necessarily. Some do for sure, but not all of them do.”
What other issues were you facing? “I think the biggest one was definitely, because of those disconnected sites, it was definitely our visibility. The second one is around our brand. We have an amazing consumer brand. Everyone knows DHL — the red and the yellow. It’s bright. It’s engaging. It means a lot to every employee, and…our customers and the partners that we work with.
 
 
 













 
 

“Unfortunately, whilst the consumer brand is still is incredibly powerful, our employer brand was somewhat ad hoc. You know, people were creating things that they thought look nice that they thought represented. But there was no standardization and if you looked at one brand in in Germany, it might not look the same as one in South America. It just didn’t work. So that was the second big thing. We needed to align our brand to be more visible. As an employer, we want to be this great place to work for everyone. We’re this great company to work for, but how can you ensure everyone knows that if you can’t even tell a coherent story out into the market?
“A third thing is we wanted to take care that we minimized the likelihood of things like the fraudulent use of our brands. You hear these things in the market where companies had fraudsters say, ‘Pay me $50 and I’ll get you a job interview here or there.’ We just wanted to make sure that we weren’t exposed to that, because when you’ve got so many different sites, it does increase the risk of that type of activity. So, with that sort of compliance topic, as a company that really values good business practices like compliance, it is important to us. So that was the other thing that we had to address.
“The fourth thing we had to address was just bringing the recruiting audience together. When we have all of us looking together at our talents and saying, ‘OK, well you know if I’m recruiting out of our supply chain division and I’ve picked my gold medalist, but geez, there was three really strong silver medalists.’ We were just letting them go back into the market. We needed to be directing them go into other potential jobs in our company, not back into the market — especially nowadays.”
 
 
 













 
 

What are some of the talent challenges you’re facing, particularly with some of the digital technologies that you’re rolling out. “I don’t think we’re unique in this. There is obviously a huge demand for tech talent across the globe at the moment. And, the demand changes, I feel like it’s changing every six months. We started with everyone wanting blockchain specialists. Then there’s this whole push on project managers and some cloud architects. And they have moved on to the cybersecurity space. Now, most recently, we’ve got the whole generative AI and AI technicians and data analysts and so forth. It’s a constant churn of changing demand, and it’s sort of pulsing.

“I think the initial mode, because it’s what our go-to always has been, is we go to market and say we need this type of person. Of course, because we’re DHL and we’re a logistics company, you [as a job applicant] may wonder why would we need technical people. We realized that our reputation as an employer of technical people — IT-type people — wasn’t that it was a bad reputation. There was literally no reputation. Technical people were not thinking, ‘I can’t wait to get my degree and work for DHL.’
“So we had to really get the story out there why we are a good match for someone who wants to work in that space. We really have that type of technology that is cutting edge in terms of what you do as a technical contributor, it manifests in our business immediately. Whether it’s a proof of concept or a pilot, whether you’re working on Google glasses or Internet of Things, you can actually see how your work impacts customers and the business — and quite quickly. And, I think there are a lot of technical people who want to see the impact of their coding or their design or their project management or whatever on the customer or the business.”
 
 
 













 
 

You partnered with Phenom to help you roll out the genAI for your career site, but did you also build an internal team to roll out this technology? What kind of people were on that? “We have a really good internal team. Phenom became our partner, and we learned a lot from them. They had a lot of expertise about this very new technology. Internally, though, we have a really great coherent team working in a sort of agile working mode. That was also new to us, a working mode being in a scrum-based environment. That team’s made up of a set of HR professionals who know recruiting and who know what it means to bring and attract people onto our business but who also had the ability to translate those HR needs into technical language, if you like. They could talk then to another group of people who we worked with internally, IT professionals who were willing to talk to HR and ask them, ‘What does it mean to transform HR into this technical world?’ 
HR was one of the late adopters of technology. And I think that we found a really great group of IT professionals who were fascinated at how technology manifests to enable our people in a way very different from, say, the operations of finance.”
Did you also include folks from legal, finance, and compliance and others? “We call them our product owners. They’re the ones from the HR and from the business side. They describe what’s needed. They work with our actual operators out in the field, the recruiters and so forth. And they understand what’s required. They talk to IT in the language of IT, and IT says, ‘Here’s what we can provide as a solution.’ Then we say that’s an interesting solution — now let’s talk to compliance about how this will work from a compliance perspective? You know, we can’t be a company that says you can trust us completely unless that trust extends to candidates, applicants and so forth.
 
 
 













 
 

“We also talked to the compliance people. Then we have our procurement partners. They’re  talking about how our relationships are set up and how we can get the most out of these really powerful contracts that we have in place across the globe. And then of course there’s finance, which is looking after all those financial things. And then the managers. And the employees — everyone providing some insights from a personal perspective on how it should work for them. What would they want from your product like this? It’s really the whole company coming together.”
So how far down did you go on the management rung to get input? “All the way to our frontline supervisors in terms of testing it, trying it out, and giving us some feedback on how it looks and feels. We involved everyone…who is actually someone who needs to click the buttons to say, ‘Yes, I approve of this.’
“At the same time…, we spent a lot of time on our employer brand. Looking at what our brand looks like if we want consistency. It’s not just having the technology to do it, but you’ve got to have the right attributes. It’s a reflection of who we are internally. So, we talked, interviewed, surveyed, and ran workshops with literally 3,000 or 4,000 employees — maybe even more — to understand what their experience was working for us. What do they love about us? What should we talk about and not talk about? And through that we created this story around where we are as a company, and about how we’re a great team. And, once you’re in here, you bleed red and yellow. That’s the truth.”
 
 
 













 
 

Can you explain how your new, consolidated jobs site works to direct job seekers to the right open positions? “The nice thing about some of these new technologies is that AI is part of the experience, but it doesn’t feel somehow tricky. [Employees] will say I use ChatGPT to do this or that, and I’m like, it’s OK that you used it for that, just as long as you didn’t present it as your own work. On the career side, AI makes the whole thing super easy. It’s much simpler as part of the search experience. If I want to search for a job in Vietnam, I start to write ‘Vietnam,’ and the AI immediately recognizes where you’re located. It then triggers a set of jobs that start to come to you in the language that you’re writing in. This is very simple algorithm in the end, but it feels very personalized, very relevant.
“The second thing that happens is that you get the job recommendations. We have a Phenom-branded chatbot called Larry that allows customers to personalize it. He pops up and says, ‘Do you want more information?’ You start to enter in things and Larry will say things like, ‘Would you like to apply for a job or are you just browsing?’ He’ll tackle some of the first compliance questions like ‘Would you give permission for us to record some of your data?’ And as it does this, it starts to understand what sort of jobs the applicant or interested person might be a match for through one answer-type questions.

“Then once you get into the platform and start looking at the jobs, of course, it gets a little more intense — not so much for the candidate themselves, but more so for the recruiter who will immediately start to see people recommended for specific roles if they’ve given their consent for that. The [job seeker] didn’t apply for that, but let’s see if he’s interested, because this could be suitable for him.
 
 
 













 
 

“This type of matching AI is very useful for helping us bring to the surface the right people for the right jobs. In the past, it would have required recruiters to go through lists and lists and lists of [resumes] to try and find the right people for the right jobs. So, for me, that’s a super powerful use of the machine learning technology that we just didn’t have access to before.
“And then there’s about a million other things that it does. For example, once you find someone, you can send them an e-mail and the recruiter can click on a little AI helper in that email and choose to send an e-mail to the [job seeker] asking if they’re interested in talking about another opportunity we might have. So, it really makes the job easier.”
So give me an example like before and after, since rolling out the new AI-powered site. So back when you had 200 sites as opposed to now. “Let’s say I’m in South Africa on DHL’s career site. I’m hoping like crazy that someone’s going to find the career site and click on it. Maybe they go there and maybe they see some nice pictures and a statement from some of our employees on how they like the company. Then they might click on a job, and then that might get to a recruiter that information along with all the other people that have clicked on that job. But mostly what happened is that people would put [resumes] in there and probably not hear back, if I’m being honest.
 
 
 













 
 

“Now what happens on our career site is South Africa is in bold, and so they still have a very localized site, but it’s fully integrated with the global site. It’s the same global URL; it’s just that the page would have some local references, probably some local visuals, maybe some of the local employees talking about their experience working at some in South Africa with our company. The real difference is that as a candidate, now I go in and I get guided to the right sort of jobs based on my [resume]. The system parses the [resume], finds my skills and tells me there’s some jobs that might suit me. And then the recruiter who’s looking for someone with those skills doesn’t have to search through hundreds and hundreds of [resumes]. They get presented the ones that have the matching skills to the top of the list.

“So recruiters still have the list of 100 [applicants] if they want to look at them, but the ones that are matching what they’re looking for are at the top of the list. And that list [of applicants] could come not just from my unit…, but also includes DHL’s Express supply chain and our Freight Forwarding units in different parts of the country. They get to see it all now, not just that singular entry point.”
What’s the most unexpected benefit from the genAI-assisted, unified career site? “The unexpected things? This last couple of weeks, we’ve discovered that we are the most visible career platform in Germany. That means if you go searching for a job in Germany, you will find DHL before any other site, and we’re very close to being the number one job site in a lot of other countries as well. That is because it takes a good [career] site platform and it takes a good understanding of how you use that platform. We’ve reached the point where those two things have become really congruent. So we have some great people doing wonderful things with the content, continually updating our tags and the language alignment.
“But we also, of course, have a platform that allows us to do that fast and efficiently and we’ve set up a really nice process where we have people who are responsible for administering the content. In Costa Rica, in Malaysia, and in the Netherlands, it’s 24 hours a day those updates are made. So, for example, if the administrator in a particular company comes to us today and says something like, ‘We’ve just heard that XYZ company is closing down and we immediately want to get something onto the career site so that we can bring their employees to our site,’ we have someone somewhere in the world that can get that content on to the system. We didn’t realize that this would even be possible when we brought the product on.
 
 
 













 
 

“The expected things? Our reputation is improving, particularly with technical talent and young talent. Our ability to customize and really target content to appeal to certain [talent] audiences…has been quite rewarding.”
In what other ways has DHL used generative AI technology other than the career site? “We have what we call our Career Marketplace, which is an internal marketplace recommending people not only for jobs, but also learning networks and mentoring and these types of experiences. We’re in the middle of rolling that out at the moment. That will also include some very nice AI capabilities.
“We use a generative AI chatbot specifically for creating some of our internal marketing content, so, short videos and…training videos and things like that. The chatbot is called GAIA, which stands for Generative AI & Intelligent Automation.
“Internally, it has been super for those things also, because it doesn’t have to be done by a specialist, it can be done by people who have the right tools now. The company has been very wise and very fast, but at the same time cautious in setting up an internal generative AI tool that our employees can use, and that’s safe, and that’s compliant, and that’s able to be accessed by…everyone. Anyone who is the least bit interested in accessing it can. That has had two benefits: one, it gives people an awareness of what generative AI is and that it’s an actually something valuable if you use it well. And two, it also helps those who may have some fear or concerns understand that it’s not a monster. It is just a tool.
In what ways did DHL train its full-time employees in the use of AI? “We have a group within our company that took a more proactive role in informing and educating [employees], running workshops and webinars and inviting people to information sessions that were a bit more formal than our previous sort of soft rollout. And, there also people who are responsible for using AI or creating algorithms or machine learning or data analysts, who have had very formal education, and they’re using some of our learning partners to provide them with proper education on AI.”
Who are your learning partners? Are they universities in the various countries you’re located or online course providers? “We use Coursera a lot, for example. Also, Skillsoft Percipio. We also do have partnerships with universities…and other places that provide us with super advanced levels of education.”
Can you offer any tips for other organizations who are considering rolling out AI? What should they avoid? “I think they should avoid hysteria. I think what our company has done super well is I have never felt scared of AI. It was explained to us that this technology was just something that’s coming. It’s going to help us. It’s not going to cause problems if you get on board. There’s a quote that we’ve kind of thrown around in our business a bit. I can’t remember who it comes from, but it says something like, ‘AI is not going to get rid of our jobs. Our jobs are not going to be taken by AI. Our jobs are going to be taken by people who know how to use AI.’
“It’s not about replacing your job or being something you should be afraid of. It’s about getting your arms around it and learning how it’s going to help you be better at what you do.”

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are no longer just buzzwords but realities reshaping our daily lives, the future of work stands at the brink of a significant transformation. This evolution promises to redefine not just how tasks are accomplished but also the very nature of jobs, posing both opportunities and challenges for the workforce.
The Wave of Change
The advent of AI and automation has heralded unprecedented efficiency and innovation across various sectors. From manufacturing lines where robots assemble products with precision to software algorithms that manage complex data analytics, these technologies are setting new standards for productivity. In the service industry, AI-driven tools are enhancing customer experience through personalized interactions, while in healthcare, they assist in diagnosing diseases with remarkable accuracy.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 50:00Loaded: 1.02%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -50:00 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

However, this wave of technological advancement brings with it concerns of job displacement. Routine and manual jobs are most at risk, as machines can perform these tasks faster and without fatigue. Even certain cognitive roles are being automated, as AI systems develop capabilities to handle tasks requiring analysis and decision-making.
The Undiminished Value of Human Skills
Despite these disruptions, the human element remains irreplaceable in many aspects of work. Skills such as creativity, empathy, and complex problem-solving stand out as uniquely human strengths that AI and automation cannot replicate. For instance, while AI can aid in diagnosing patients, the empathy and care provided by healthcare professionals are crucial for patient recovery. Similarly, in creative industries, AI tools may assist in the creative process, but the original vision and emotional depth of art come from human imagination.
The future of work, therefore, is not about humans versus machines but about how humans can leverage these technologies to enhance their capabilities and explore new opportunities. The emphasis is now on enhancing human capabilities through AI and automation, paving the way for more fulfilling and significant job roles.
Preparing for the Future
As the job landscape evolves, so too must the workforce. Preparing for the future involves embracing lifelong learning and adapting to new roles that emerge as technology advances. Here are key strategies for individuals and organizations:


Skill Development: Continuous learning to acquire new skills or upgrade existing ones is vital. Emphasis should be on digital literacy, technical skills related to AI and automation, and uniquely human skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and interpersonal communication.


Flexibility and Adaptability: The ability to adapt to changing job roles and industries will become increasingly important. Workers may need to transition across different career paths during their lifetime, requiring flexibility and resilience.


Collaborative Workspaces: Organizations should foster environments that promote collaboration between humans and AI. By designing roles that combine the strengths of both, businesses can unlock innovation and efficiency.


Ethical Considerations and Job Creation: As automation displaces certain jobs, societies and economies must consider the ethical implications and focus on creating new employment opportunities in emerging sectors. This includes investing in education and training programs that prepare the workforce for future demands.


Looking Ahead
The future of work is not a distant concept but a rapidly unfolding reality. AI and automation are set to enrich the work environment with efficiencies and innovations, yet the essence of what makes work meaningful — creativity, empathy, and human interaction — remains firmly in the domain of humans. By embracing change, focusing on lifelong skill development, and leveraging the strengths of both humans and machines, individuals and organizations can navigate the future of work with optimism and resilience.
In conclusion, the narrative of the future of work is complex, marked by challenges of adaptation and opportunities for growth. It is a future that calls for a collaborative effort between technology and humanity, ensuring that as we stride into new horizons of work, we carry forward the irreplaceable value of human creativity, empathy, and ingenuity. The journey ahead is not just about adapting to changes but about shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential, making the world of work not only more efficient but also more human.

It is based on data from more than 2 million LinkedIn members in Ireland.The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) defines generative AI as “a machine-learning model that is trained to create new data, rather than making a prediction about a specific data set”. Examples of the technology include ChatGPT.The report said 60 per cent of “Generation X” workers – those born between 1965 and 1980 – have occupations where generative AI can “complement or transform the work they do, freeing up their time for more value-added and creative work”.READ MOREIs it cheaper to visit Center Parcs abroad rather than stay in Longford?

Aer Lingus holds its breath on deal for industrial peaceHow to ... clean up your Threads feedMillennials (1981-1996) were also identified as having a “significant opportunity” to leverage generative AI, with 56 per cent in jobs where generative AI can “complement or transform” their role.For “Generation Z”, which refers to those born from 1997-2012, this number drops to 52 per cent, with the remaining 48 per cent currently working in roles whose core skills are “less able” to leverage generative AI.According to the report, technology, information and media is the sector with the “greatest potential” to harness generative AI tools and technologies.“An AI-enabled workforce is now critical to transforming our enterprise base and supporting future investment to Ireland,” said Mr Lohan.“With AI set to transform a wide range of industries and occupations, leaders will need to be proactive in upskilling their workforce to develop the AI skills and knowledge necessary to leverage the technology.“By continuing to invest in upskilling opportunities, we can unlock the true potential of Ireland’s workforce and ensure we remain a highly attractive location to do business well into the future.”Microsoft Ireland site lead James O’Connor said: “Generative AI is a transformative technology that has significant potential to empower our workforce, enhance productivity and unlock exciting new business opportunities.“These findings point towards the need for Ireland to move to a skills-based labour market.“As generative AI becomes more prolific in the workplace, it is crucial that industry continues to collaborate with Government and academia to empower the current and future generations with the AI skills and knowledge to take full advantage of the technology.”LinkedIn Ireland head Sue Duke said the skills that professionals need to thrive in an AI-powered world of work are “dramatically changing”.“We expect to see a 73 per cent change in skills needed in the Irish workforce by 2030, up from a 54 per cent change expected before the rise of generative AI,” she said.“By policymakers, companies and professionals focusing now on building the right skills in the workforce to adopt and complement generative AI, we have the opportunity to be at the forefront of this transformation and maximise its potential for Ireland’s economy.”Sign up for Business push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phoneFind The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to dateOur Inside Business podcast is published weekly – Find the latest episode here","['https://www.facebook.com/irishtimes/', 'http://www.linkedin.com/company/the-irish-times', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/IrishTimes', 'https://twitter.com/IrishTimes']","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://schema.org/WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/04/12/critical-need-for-irish-workforce-to-embrace-artificial-intelligence-ida/'}",,,,,,,,,,False,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}",,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': '', 'width': 1024, 'height': 547}",,,,,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'postOfficeBoxNumber': 'PO Box 74', 'streetAddress': '24-28 Tara Street', 'addressLocality': 'Dublin 2', 'addressRegion': 'County Dublin', 'addressCountry': 'Ireland', 'postalCode': 'D02 CX89'}","[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Customer Support', 'email': 'services@irishtimes.com', 'telephone': '+353 1 9203901'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Sales', 'email': 'mediasolutions@irishtimes.com', 'telephone': '+353 1 5320978'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'News Desk', 'email': 'newsdesk@irishtimes.com', 'telephone': ''}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Photo: Ty Wright/Bloomberg NewsGenerative AI is reshaping the conversation around hiring at many companies as they realize that one way the pricey technology will pay off is if it helps them employ fewer people to do more work. While early wins from using generative AI don’t necessarily portend future layoffs, they hint at the need for companies to hire less, chief information officers say. This observation comes as business technology leaders seek returns for their increased spending on AI. “We’re looking at a lot of interesting tools and they have a lot of promise—but then when you look at the cost of the tool you say, ‘Am I really going to realize that productivity internally or am I just going to increase my technology cost?’” said KeyBank CIO Amy Brady.Newsletter Sign-upWSJ | CIO JournalThe Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team.PreviewSubscribeBrady said she sees AI playing a role in workforce size to the extent that if it does make workers more efficient, companies will ultimately save money by doing more with smaller workforces. KeyBank deployed a conversational AI tool that is helping reduce the volume of calls coming to the customer service contact center, said Brady. “We probably hired less because we have less call volume,” she said. Anupam Khare, senior vice president and CIO of specialty vehicle maker Oshkosh Corp., also sees generative AI changing the workforce conversation, with employee productivity gains reducing the need to hire, even in the case of backfilling as people are promoted up in the organization.“Three years ago we were a $7 billion company and now we are a $10 billion company—much larger, but our number of people are not increasing in that proportion,” said Khare, who added that Oshkosh has identified 40 potential generative AI use cases and already has a couple in pilot, including code generation.It is too early to see expectations of reduced hiring materialize nationally. U.S. job growth has remained strong, with employers adding a seasonally adjusted 303,000 jobs in March, more than the 200,000 economists expected. Separately the IT job market is expected to shrink, driven in part by declining demand for non-AI skills.  Nationwide Chief Technology Officer Jim Fowler. Photo: NationwideAt insurance company Nationwide Chief Technology Officer Jim Fowler has guided the creation of a tool that analyzes the cost of a given generative AI use case across several different available proprietary large language models. The tool has been helpful, he said, in determining the cost efficiency of each AI model, based on parameters such as the number of requests and the length of inputs and outputs. It has also helped Nationwide determine whether it was more cost effective to stick with a traditional process. For example, in its property and casualty business, Fowler said the company decided not to move forward with a use case that looked for answers on specific customer questions related to claims. But even those results didn’t sway him from a belief that the company will be able to grow without having to hire proportionally more clerical workers. “Our goal is really to allow our associates to do the higher-order thinking work and to take the clerical work away so that we don’t have to add more people as the company grows,” Fowler said.Advertisement

The adoption of generative AI is set to transform the nature of work, with tools replacing certain tasks and reshaping traditional work profiles in various industries.
However, many jobs remain “uniquely human” — sector by sector, the impact of artificial intelligence will be felt differently.
According to consulting firm McKinsey, generative AI’s ability to identify patterns across enormous sets of data and generate new content is “an ability that has often been considered uniquely human”.
With its ability to create, GenAI can “be used to write code, design products, create marketing content and strategies, streamline operations, analyze legal documents, provide customer service via chatbots, and even accelerate scientific discovery.”
This may be great for progress, but it is not so great for people who make their salary in roles that are now under threat.
McKinsey adds that GenAI can be used to automate processes completely or as a tool with “humans in the loop” —which is currently more common “given its current level of maturity”.Advertisements




While some jobs may become partly or even fully automated, some jobs — especially those requiring personal care— cannot be easily replaced by algorithms.
And having skills in the use of AI will create new opportunities for some workers.
In this deep dive, we explore and predict the industries and jobs that may be at risk from — or safe from — the rise of the machines.

Key Takeaways

AI in the workplace continues to grow, with 53% of firms using it in 2023 and 24% planning for 2024.
Despite job concerns, 91% of companies intend to hire — but they do value AI skills in prospective employees.
Roles with social interaction or complex decision-making are less prone to AI replacement, and healthcare, skilled trades, education, and social services show resilience.
As retail and communication sectors undergo a tech transformation, they do create new roles.

AI Job Loss Statistics:  How GenAI May Affect Sectors




An LLM Cannot Drive a Truck or Build a House




Luckily, Some Skills are Uniquely Human




The Bottom Line









AI: State of the World
According to a survey of 750 businesses by Resume Builder, around 53% of companies were using AI in 2023, and 24% plan to start in 2024.
While 44% of companies that use or plan to use AI in 2024 said that employees may be laid off, 91% said they would hire new employees, and 96% said it would be “very beneficial” (65%) or “somewhat beneficial” (31%) for potential candidates to have AI experience.
They added that employees with AI skills are more likely to have job security than those without.
Julia Toothacre, ResumeBuilder’s resume and career strategist, said:
“I would advise employees to consider all parts of their position and what could possibly be taken over by AI.
“Figure out what part of your position can’t be taken over by AI or where AI might need human intervention and become the go-to person for those tasks.
“Employees need to find ways to grow their skills and stay relevant in their field.”
Which jobs will likely see the most and the least impact from AI?
AI Job Loss Predictions: Risky and Safer Sectors
The evolving landscape of the workforce, particularly in the context of AI’s rise, is a topic of intense debate.
Clearly, roles that involve significant social or emotional interactions — such as social workers, healthcare professionals, and teachers — will be less susceptible to being replaced by AI-facilitated automation.
High-level management jobs that require complex decision-making may be less likely to be displaced, as human reasoning will remain important to the process. And customer-facing roles that require relationship-building will also remain in demand.
Anna Tavis, a clinical professor in human capital management at New York University, commented on this shift:
“There is a heightened anticipation surrounding the potential labor cost efficiencies from adopting AI.
 
“While it is believed that AI might replace some jobs or parts of jobs currently performed by human workers, it is important to note that these expectations might be ahead of their time. Nevertheless, given AI advancements, companies are preparing for a major organizational shift.”
The research conducted by Hiring Lab for employment agency Indeed suggests a shift in the impact of technological advancements. While past innovations in computing and robotics mainly displaced manual labor, the rise of generative AI is expected to primarily affect ‘knowledge workers.’ As the technology continues to learn specific skills associated with certain roles, genAI can augment or transform some roles but not others.
Based on their latest AI job loss predictions, 19.8% of jobs face the highest potential exposure, while 34.6% face the lowest potential exposure.
According to monthly reports from employee outplacement services and coaching firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, AI has been cited as the reason for hundreds of US job cuts so far this year, either because employers were pivoting to developing AI or because it replaced tasks and roles.
“The impact of rapidly advancing artificial intelligence adoption is beginning to be felt from a jobs perspective, particularly in Media and Tech, but truly across sectors. That said, companies are not outright blaming AI for many layoff decisions,” said Challenger.
AI Job Loss Statistics:  How GenAI May Affect Sectors
By analyzing the number of skills listed in various job postings, Hiring Lab identified thematic skillsets that help define the occupations that are most and least exposed to potential change driven by AI.
So, what jobs will AI replace?

Indeed’s research shows that AI algorithm-driven tools are the most proficient in software development, IT operations, helpdesk support, and mathematics. In contrast, they perform poorly in various manual and interpersonal tasks.
Source: Indeed
AI proficiency scores poorly in these skills — so job security may be safe for a while yet:

Driving
Beauty and wellness
Personal care and home health
Nursing
Childcare
Food preparation and service
Veterinary
Construction

Similarly, McKinsey predicts that by 2030 the adoption of automation enabled by the acceleration of generative AI will see growth in labor demand for health professionals, aides, and technicians, as well as Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) professionals.
However, as the global labor market continues to adjust to the rise of remote working, the more likely a job can be done remotely, the higher the chance for a job loss due to AI.
Office support, customer service and sales, and food services roles could decline.
An LLM Cannot Drive a Truck or Build a House
Among the 25 most common jobs posted on Indeed, 20 face a lower potential exposure than the average job posting. Truck driving roles face the least potential exposure to generative AI, only rated as “good” or “excellent” at 15% of truck driver skills.
The study concluded:
“Jobs with the least potential exposure to genAI (including driving, cleaning & sanitation, and beauty & wellness) are also those with the lowest ability to be done remotely.
 
“The higher the odds are that a job can be done remotely, the greater its potential exposure is to genAI-driven change.”
“Historically, these are not the kinds of jobs that have been subject to disruption through automation, more evidence that this round of technological evolution will affect different workers in different ways than in the past.
The study showed that while GenAI is relatively good at technical skills (and jobs), it is pretty bad at skills (and jobs) that require intuition, reasoning, and/or in-person, manual work.
This distinction may be somewhat obvious — given how generative AI works. For drivers, a large language model (LLM) of the type that powers many generative AI tools can plan a route on a map but not turn a steering wheel – although it is worth noting that other forms of AI will enable self-driving vehicles.
For software developers, however, job loss due to AI is much higher. LLMs are likely to be able to replace much of the human work that goes into writing an efficient line of code or preparing and summarizing technical documentation.
Source: Indeed
In the meantime, Cliff Jurkiewicz, vice president of global strategy at Phenom, an HR technology company, added to the perspective:
“The retail and communications industries are going through massive technology upgrades. AI is driving expansion in tech. Like disruptive technologies before it, it is creating new roles and new skill requirements for existing roles.
 
“Tech professionals have an advantage. Their skill sets are highly marketable to the tremendous opportunities for tech roles in other industries. They also have the background and ability to simplify upskilling for the new AI-based roles. And these new AI roles are just the beginning, with others not far off on the horizon.”
Luckily, Some Skills are Uniquely Human
Broadly, the careers least likely to be affected by AI are those that require human empathy or manual dexterity and precision:


Healthcare: While AI has vast potential in the healthcare sector – from drug discovery, assisting with diagnosis, remote surgery, and treatment to administrative tasks – it is unlikely to replace healthcare professionals. Doctors, nurses, therapists, and counselors rely heavily on interpersonal relationships and emotional intelligence, making many roles resilient to automation.
Skilled trades: Skilled trades, such as electricians, plumbers, and mechanics, require a combination of manual dexterity, problem-solving, and adaptability. These professions often involve working in unpredictable environments, which AI struggles to navigate. Additionally, carpenters, blacksmiths, and glassblowers are highly skilled in their crafts, often producing unique, customized items unlikely to lead to AI job loss.
Education: AI can assist in developing educational content and providing personalized learning and grading, but teachers, coaches, and other educators provide irreplaceable mentorship, guidance, and emotional support.
Social and community services: Professions in social work, community outreach, and advocacy rely heavily on human relationships, empathy, and understanding. These jobs involve complex decision-making and problem-solving based on the unique needs of individuals and communities. AI tools can provide data and support, making these roles more efficient, it cannot replace the personal connections and judgment calls made by human professionals.
Creative professions: The role of AI in generating creative content is highly controversial – fueling writers’ and actors’ strikes in Hollywood in part to limit the extent to which studios can replace them with AI-generated scripts and audio and video footage. But while AI can assist in generating content, it lacks the depth that human experience and emotional connection bring to creative output.

The job roles that fall in the middle of Hiring Labs’ analysis are the most interesting cases to study when determining the potential impact of generative AI on the future of work.
While retail jobs contain skills AI can perform well, such as developing strategies, algorithms cannot complete the person-to-person skills necessary for retail success.
Source: Indeed
The Bottom Line
AI has the potential to automate tasks across a range of industries, but some careers are more resilient to this disruption. The findings around the fields most and least exposed to potential generative AI-driven change indicate that this technological revolution will pose different challenges than earlier industrial and commercial automation stages.
Deep, expert and uniquely human knowledge will likely stay in high demand. Instead of viewing AI as a threat to employment, individuals should focus on adapting and developing these uniquely human skills that are difficult for AI to replicate.
Alex Kotran, the CEO of aiEDU, expressed his understanding regarding the common apprehensions about AI, particularly in the context of job security: “Everything is changing fast, and when your livelihood could be impacted, that causes real worry.”
However, Kotran emphasized the potential of AI to enhance job satisfaction when combined with appropriate training and preparation: “With the right training and preparation, AI can actually empower people to do more fulfilling work – it’s a tool that will help professionalize various professions.”
“The key is ensuring employees have basic proficiency to effectively collaborate with AI systems rather than be impacted by them. We want to give people the confidence, skills, and agency to see AI as a force multiplier, not a robot coming for their job.”

If you’ve been on LinkedIn for any period of time over the last 18 months, you’ll have read thought leadership on how integrating artificial intelligence into the workforce will help unlock major opportunities for companies.
Despite employer fervor over artificial intelligence — the number times “AI” has been mentioned in fourth-quarter earnings calls has increased dramatically — the average U.S. adult is mostly mixed about the broader impact they think the technology will have on jobs. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t integrating it into their roles. Many workers are using AI for work, and that exposure looks to be swaying perceptions of the technology.
Millennials and those with post-grad degrees are more likely to think AI has a positive impact in the workplace
Just over 2 in 5 employed U.S. adults (44%) said they use AI for work, with even higher shares of millennials and those with post-grad degrees saying the same (both 56%). Research has shown that exposure to AI in the workplace is directly proportional to the level of education of the worker, and our own past research shows that millennials are more likely to show high interest in all kinds of AI applications, not just those used in the workplace.
Mirroring those trends, millennials and those with post-grad degrees are also most likely to say that industries investing in the use of AI in the workplace will have a positive impact than a negative one.
Employed Adults Are More Likely to Find AI Positive Than NegativeRespondents on the impact AI will have in the workplaceMorning Consult LogoSurvey conducted Jan. 17- 20, 2024, among 6,625 U.S. adults, including 3,389 employed adults, with an unweighted margin of error of +/-1 and +/-2 percentage points, respectively.Gen Z, usually the cohort to stand in contrast with other generations, is feeling a bit more mixed, likely as lower shares of them are currently in the workforce and thus currently less exposed to AI on the job. They are also the generation a little bit more likely than others to say that AI will have no impact on work (23%).
Workers using AI are incorporating it into many aspects of their jobs
When workers who use AI were asked how they used it in their work, the majority of respondents said they often or sometimes used all the tested options, showing that AI use is not confined to certain highly specific tasks.
More Millennials Use AI Across A Range of TasksAmong AI users, respondents who often or sometimes use it to complete the following tasksMorning Consult LogoSurvey conducted Jan. 17- 20, 2024, among 6,625 U.S. adults, including 1481 workers who use AI, with unweighted margins of error of +/-1 and +/-3 percentage points, respectively.The most commonly cited uses include crafting emails, ideation and data analytics. Atop Gen Z’s AI use cases, answering customer/client questions is more highly ranked, though the cohort — newer to the workforce — in general slightly under indexes on using AI applications at work. (Gen Zers are equally as likely to say they use AI for fun.) Millennials, on the other hand, are more likely to say they use all the tested applications than the average worker. This is likely because millennials are more likely to simply report using AI, for both business and pleasure.
The variety of tasks workers are using AI for today shows the technology is broadly applicable to the workforce, not just highly technical jobs. Companies should note that positive sentiment and usage of AI doesn’t mean that Americans are entirely bullish on the technology; consumers are least interested in applications that could be used to replace humans entirely. That said, employers investing in more AI technology should think big when rolling out the technology — it’s likely they’ll find many use cases, and a wide range of workers, open to incorporating it into their existing workflows.

But that doesn’t mean they aren’t integrating it into their roles. Many workers are using AI for work, and that exposure looks to be swaying perceptions of the technology.Millennials and those with post-grad degrees are more likely to think AI has a positive impact in the workplaceJust over 2 in 5 employed U.S. adults (44%) said they use AI for work, with even higher shares of millennials and those with post-grad degrees saying the same (both 56%). Research has shown that exposure to AI in the workplace is directly proportional to the level of education of the worker, and our own past research shows that millennials are more likely to show high interest in all kinds of AI applications, not just those used in the workplace.Mirroring those trends, millennials and those with post-grad degrees are also most likely to say that industries investing in the use of AI in the workplace will have a positive impact than a negative one.Gen Z, usually the cohort to stand in contrast with other generations, is feeling a bit more mixed, likely as lower shares of them are currently in the workforce and thus currently less exposed to AI on the job. They are also the generation a little bit more likely than others to say that AI will have no impact on work (23%).Workers using AI are incorporating it into many aspects of their jobsWhen workers who use AI were asked how they used it in their work, the majority of respondents said they often or sometimes used all the tested options, showing that AI use is not confined to certain highly specific tasks.The most commonly cited uses include crafting emails, ideation and data analytics. Atop Gen Z’s AI use cases, answering customer/client questions is more highly ranked, though the cohort — newer to the workforce — in general slightly under indexes on using AI applications at work. (Gen Zers are equally as likely to say they use AI for fun.) Millennials, on the other hand, are more likely to say they use all the tested applications than the average worker. This is likely because millennials are more likely to simply report using AI, for both business and pleasure.The variety of tasks workers are using AI for today shows the technology is broadly applicable to the workforce, not just highly technical jobs. Companies should note that positive sentiment and usage of AI doesn’t mean that Americans are entirely bullish on the technology; consumers are least interested in applications that could be used to replace humans entirely. That said, employers investing in more AI technology should think big when rolling out the technology — it’s likely they’ll find many use cases, and a wide range of workers, open to incorporating it into their existing workflows. This is excerpted from Morning Consult’s State of Workers 2024 report.

Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions for Experienced
1. What is Q-Learning?
Q-learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to find the optimal policy for an agent to follow in an environment. The goal of Q-learning is to learn a function, called the Q-function, that maps states of the environment to the expected cumulative reward of taking a specific action in that state and then following the optimal policy afterwards.
The Q-function is represented as a table, with each entry representing the expected cumulative reward of taking a specific action in a specific state. The Q-learning algorithm updates the Q-function by using the Bellman equation, which states that the value of the Q-function for a given state and action is equal to the immediate reward for taking that action in that state, plus the maximum expected cumulative reward of the next state.
2. Which Assessment is Used to Test the Intelligence of a Machine? Explain It.
This is one of the most frequently asked AI questions. There are several ways to assess the intelligence of a machine, but one of the most widely used methods is the Turing test. Essentially, the Turing test measures a machine's ability to exhibit human-like intelligence. 
The test works by having a human evaluator engage in a natural language conversation with both a human and a machine, without knowing which is which. If the evaluator is unable to consistently distinguish the machine's responses from those of the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing test and is considered to have human-like intelligence.
3. What is Reinforcement Learning, and How Does It Work?
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions in an environment by interacting with it and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. To maximize its cumulative reward over time, the agent must learn a policy that maps environmental states to actions.
4. Explain Markov's Decision Process.
A mathematical framework called the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is used to describe decision-making in circumstances where the result is partially determined by chance and partially controlled by the decision-maker. MDPs are widely used in the field of reinforcement learning as they provide a way to model an agent's decision-making problem.
An MDP is defined by a set of states, a set of actions, a transition function that defines the probability of going from one state to another, a reward function that defines the immediate reward for being in a particular state and taking a particular action, and a discount factor that determines the importance of future rewards.
5. Explain the Hidden Markov Model.
A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that is often used in machine learning and pattern recognition to model a sequence of observations that are generated by a system with unobserved (hidden) states. HMMs are particularly useful for modeling time series data, such as speech, text, and biological sequences.
The basic idea behind an HMM is that there is a sequence of hidden states that are not directly observable, but generate a sequence of observations. Each hidden state has a probability distribution over the possible observations, and the sequence of hidden states changes over time according to certain probability transition rules.
6. What is the Difference Between Parametric and Non-parametric Models?
In statistics and machine learning, a parametric model is a model that has a fixed number of parameters. These parameters have specific meanings and can be estimated from the data using a method such as maximum likelihood estimation. Once the parameters are estimated, the model can be used to make predictions or estimate the probability of certain events.
Examples of parametric models include linear regression, logistic regression, and Gaussian mixture models. These models have a fixed number of parameters, and the estimation process involves finding the best set of parameter values that fit the data.
On the other hand, non-parametric models do not have a fixed number of parameters. They are often more flexible than parametric models and can adapt to a wide range of underlying data distributions.
Examples of non-parametric models include decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. These models do not have a fixed number of parameters, and the estimation process usually involves a direct estimation of the underlying probability density function or the conditional probability density function of the data.
7. What is Overfitting?
This is one of the next important AI questions. Overfitting in AI occurs when a machine learning model becomes too complex and starts to fit the training data too closely, to the point where it memorizes the training data rather than learning the underlying patterns and relationships. This means that the model performs very well on the training data, but poorly on new, unseen data.
Overfitting can occur in any machine learning algorithm, and it can happen when the model is too complex relative to the amount and quality of training data available. In some cases, the model may even start to fit the noise in the data, rather than the underlying patterns. This can result in poor performance and accuracy when the model is used for prediction or classification tasks on new data.
To prevent overfitting, it is important to use techniques like regularization, cross-validation, and early stopping during the training process. These techniques can help to prevent the model from becoming too complex and help to ensure that it generalizes well to new, unseen data.
8. What are the Techniques Used to Avoid Overfitting?
Cross-validation: This is a technique where the data is split into multiple subsets, and the model is trained and tested on different subsets. This helps to prevent the model from memorizing the training data and generalizing poorly to new data.
Regularization: This is a technique where a penalty term is added to the model's objective function, which discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any single feature. This helps to prevent the model from fitting to noise in the training data.
Early stopping: This is a technique where the training process is stopped before the model's performance on the training data starts to decrease, this is useful when the model is trained with multiple iterations.
Ensemble methods: This is a technique where multiple models are trained, and their predictions are combined to create a final prediction. This helps to reduce the variance and increase the robustness of the model.
Pruning: This is a technique where the complexity of the model is reduced by removing unimportant features or nodes.
Dropout: This is a technique where a random subset of the neurons is dropped out of the network during training, this prevents the network from relying too much on any one neuron.
Bayesian approaches: This is a technique where prior information is incorporated into the model's parameters.
9. What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence and computer science that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans in natural language. NLP involves using techniques from computer science, linguistics, and mathematics to process and analyze human language.
10. What is the Difference Between Natural Language Processing and Text Mining?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining are related fields that focus on the analysis and understanding of human language, but they have some key differences.
NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans in natural language. It involves using techniques from computer science, linguistics, and mathematics to process and analyze human language. NLP tasks include speech recognition, natural language understanding, natural language generation, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.
Text Mining, on the other hand, is a broader field that involves the use of NLP techniques to extract valuable information from unstructured text data. Text Mining often used in business, social science, and information science. It includes tasks such as information retrieval, text classification, text clustering, text summarization, and entity recognition.
In summary, NLP is a field of AI that deals with the interactions of computers and human languages, while Text Mining is a broader field that deals with the extraction of insights and knowledge from unstructured text data using NLP techniques.
11. What is Fuzzy Logic?
You canno skip fuzzy logic once it comes to AI questions. Fuzzy logic is a type of logic that allows reasoning with imprecise or uncertain information. It is an extension of classical logic and allows for partial truth, rather than the traditional binary true or false. This means that propositions in fuzzy logic can have a truth value between 0 and 1, representing the degree of truth.
12. What is the Difference Between Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors?
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are related mathematical concepts that are used in linear algebra and have applications in many fields, such as physics, engineering, and computer science.
An eigenvalue is a scalar value that represents the amount of stretching or shrinking that occurs when a linear transformation is applied to a vector. In other words, it is a scalar that is multiplied to a non-zero vector by a linear operator (often represented by a square matrix) to give the same vector but scaled.
An eigenvector, on the other hand, is a non-zero vector that, when multiplied by a linear operator, results in a scaled version of itself. In other words, it is a non-zero vector that when multiplied by a square matrix, gives the same vector but scaled by a scalar, that scalar is the eigenvalue.
13. What are Some Differences Between Classification and Regression?
Classification and regression are two types of supervised machine learning tasks that are used to make predictions based on input data.
Classification is a type of supervised learning in which the goal is to predict a categorical label or class for a given input. The output is discrete and finite, such as ""spam"" or ""not spam"" in an email classification problem. The input data is labeled with a class, and the model learns to predict the class based on the input features.
Regression, on the other hand, is a type of supervised learning in which the goal is to predict a continuous value for a given input. The output is a real value, such as the price of a house or the temperature. The input data is labeled with a continuous value, and the model learns to predict the value based on the input features.
14. What is an Artificial Neural Network? What are Some Commonly Used Artificial Neural Networks?
Artificial neural networks are developed to simulate the human brain digitally. These networks may be used to create the next generation of computers. They are now employed for complicated studies in a variety of disciplines, from engineering to medical.
15. What is a Rational Agent, and What is Rationality?
A rational agent is a system that makes decisions based on maximizing a specific objective. The concept of rationality refers to the idea that the agent's decisions and actions are consistent with its objectives and beliefs. In other words, a rational agent is one that makes the best decisions possible based on the information it has available. This is often formalized through the use of decision theory and game theory.

Following the launch of the AI center of excellence in Riyadh, Microsoft and PwC Middle East will train cohorts of local engineers in batches every two months.Competition for places in the bi-monthly cohorts is stiff, with the bulk of participants expected to be drawn from leading universities in the country.Rather than focusing only on AI training, the AI center will explore other emerging technologies, including cloud capabilities, to support Saudi’s global push toward digitization.“Skilling the workforce to take advantage of cloud and AI technologies is crucial to unlocking the full potential of these transformative technologies, and we are proud to play a role in this important endeavour,” noted Microsoft Arabia President Turki Badhris.The center will involve collaborative learning, featuring inputs from the public and private sectors, to produce well-rounded professionals to fill the ranks of AI companies.The new AI experts from the excellence center will provide manpower for Saudi Arabia’s growing AI ecosystem. Already, a handful of local firms have begun operations in the Gulf nation, with global players seeking to set up shop in the Middle East.“By investing in local talent, PwC is set to pioneer a new era of technological excellence that will not only serve the Kingdom but also the wider region,” said PwC Middle East CTO Ali Hosseini. “In partnership with Microsoft, we are proud to launch a platform that nurtures and develops next-generation AI talent, carefully selected from the Kingdom’s premier universities.”Building on a solid foundationMicrosoft and PwC’s foray into Saudi Arabia’s AI ecosystem is expected to build on existing foundations put in place by the country. The Gulf nation is currently eyeing a $40 billion AI investment fund via its Public Investment Fund to power in-house chip manufacturing and support the growing local AI firms.A high-profile purchase of Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NV) latest range of chips is a strong indicator of Saudi Arabia’s intent to play the long AI game in the Middle East. With a massive AI education initiative underway, Saudi firms are bracing themselves with advanced AI integration strategies, but fears of government repression continue to trail the plans.In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

Generative artificial intelligence — the technology upending many industries with its ability to produce and crunch new data — has landed on Wall Street. And investment banks, long inured to cultural change, are rapidly turning into Exhibit A on how the new technology could not only supplement but supplant entire ranks of workers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe jobs most immediately at risk are those performed by analysts at the bottom rung of the investment banking business, who put in endless hours to learn the building blocks of corporate finance, including the intricacies of mergers, public offerings and bond deals. Now, A.I. can do much of that work speedily and with considerably less whining.“The structure of these jobs has remained largely unchanged at least for a decade,” said Julia Dhar, head of BCG’s Behavioral Science Lab and a consultant to major banks experimenting with A.I. The inevitable question, as she put it, is “do you need fewer analysts?”ImageThe inevitable question, according to Julia Dhar, head of BCG’s Behavioral Science Lab, is “do you need fewer analysts?”Credit...John Lamparski/Getty Images for Concordia SummitSome of Wall Street’s major banks are asking the same question, as they test A.I. tools that can largely replace their armies of analysts by performing in seconds the work that now takes hours, or a whole weekend. The software, being deployed inside banks under code names such as “Socrates,” is likely not only to change the arc of a Wall Street career, but also to essentially nullify the need to hire thousands of new college graduates.Top executives at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other banks are debating how deep they can cut their incoming analyst classes, according to several people involved in the ongoing discussions. Some inside those banks and others have suggested they could cut back on their hiring of junior investment banking analysts by as much as two-thirds, and slash the pay of those they do hire, on the grounds that the jobs won’t be as taxing as before.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The easy idea,” said Christoph Rabenseifner, Deutsche Bank’s chief strategy officer for technology, data and innovation, “is you just replace juniors with an A.I. tool,” although he added that human involvement will remain necessary.Representatives for Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and others said it was too early to comment on specific job changes. But the consulting giant Accenture estimated that A.I. could replace or supplement nearly three-quarters of bank employees’ working hours across the industry.Goldman is “experimenting with the technology,” said Nick Carcaterra, a bank spokesman. “In the near term, we anticipate no changes to our incoming analyst classes.”This week, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, wrote in his annual shareholder letter that A.I. “may reduce certain job categories or roles,” and labeled the technology top among the most important issues facing the nation’s largest bank. Mr. Dimon compared the consequences to those of “the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the internet, among others.”ImageJamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, compared the consequences of A.I. to those of “the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the internet, among others.”Credit...Carly Zavala for The New York TimesInvestment banking is a hierarchical industry, and banks typically hire young talent through two-year analyst contracts. Tens of thousands of 20-somethings (both from undergraduate and M.B.A. programs) apply for some 200 spots in each major bank’s program. Pay starts at more than $100,000, not including year-end bonuses.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIf they persevere, they move up the ranks to associate, then director and managing director; a handful end up running divisions. Although grueling, the life of a senior banker can be glamorous, involving traveling around the globe to pitch clients and working on big-money corporate merger deals. Many who get through the two-year analyst program have gone on to become business titans — the billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Stephen Schwarzman began their careers in investment banking — but a majority will leave before or after their two years are up, bank representatives said.There are jokes among junior bankers that the most common tasks of the job involve dragging icons from one side of a document to another, only to be asked to replace the icon over and again.

Behind the JournalismOur business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Here’s more on our standards and practices.“One hundred percent drudgery and boring,” said Gabriel Stengel, a former banking analyst who left the industry two years ago. Val Srinivas, a senior researcher for banking at Deloitte, said a lot of the work involved “gathering material, poring through it and putting it through a different format.”Gregory Larkin, another former banking analyst, said the new technology would start “a civil war” inside Wall Street’s biggest firms by tilting the balance of power to technologists who program A.I. tools, as opposed to the bankers who use them — to say nothing of technology giants like Microsoft and Google, which license much of the A.I. technology to banks for hefty fees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“A.I. will enable us to do tasks that take 10 hours in 10 seconds,” said Jay Horine, co-head of investment banking at JPMorgan, describing analyst jobs. “My hope and belief is it will allow the job to be more interesting.”A.I.’s impact on finance is simply one facet of how the technology will reshape the workplace for all. Artificial intelligence systems, which include large language models and question-and-answer bots like ChatGPT, can quickly synthesize information and automate tasks. Virtually all industries are beginning to grapple with it to some degree.Deutsche Bank is uploading reams of financial data into proprietary A.I. tools that can instantaneously answer questions about publicly traded companies and create summary documents on complementary financial moves that might benefit a client — and earn the bank a profit.Mr. Horine said he could use A.I. to identify clients that might be ripe for a bond offering, the sort of bread-and-butter transaction for which investment bankers charge clients millions of dollars.Goldman Sachs has assigned 1,000 developers to test A.I., including software that can turn what it terms “corpus” information — or enormous amounts of text and data collected from thousands of sources — into page presentations that mimic the bank’s typeface, logo, styles and charts. One firm executive privately called it a “Kitty Hawk moment,” or one that would change the course of the firm’s future.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThat isn’t limited to investment banking; BNY Mellon’s chief executive said on a recent earnings call that his research analysts could now wake up two hours later than usual, because A.I. can read overnight economic data and create a written draft of analysis to work from.Morgan Stanley’s head of technology, Michael Pizzi, told employees in a January private meeting, a video of which was viewed by The New York Times, that he would “get A.I. into every area of what we do,” including wealth management, where the bank employs thousands of people to determine the proper mix of investments for well-off savers.Many of those tools are still in the testing phase, and will need to be run past regulators before they can be deployed at scale on live work. Bank of America’s chief executive said last year that the technology was already enabling the firm to hire less.Among Goldman Sachs’s sprawling A.I. efforts is a tool under development that can transfigure a lengthy PowerPoint document into a formal “S-1,” the legalese-packed document for initial public offerings required for all listed companies.The software takes less than a second to complete the job.Read by Rob CopelandAudio produced by Patricia Sulbarán.Rob Copeland is a finance reporter, writing about Wall Street and the banking industry.

			Artificial Intelligence May Not Disrupt The Legal Profession For A While		

			The work of artificial intelligence definitely still needs to be reviewed by a lawyer.

Ever since ChatGPT roared onto the scene over a year ago, everyone has been talking about how the world will change due to advances in artificial intelligence. Many commentators have singled out the legal industry as a sector that will be particularly impacted by artificial intelligence, since much of the rote work performed by associates can presumably be handled by artificial intelligence in the coming years. Initially, I also believed that artificial intelligence would have a huge impact on the legal profession in the short term, but it now seems that the legal profession will not be materially affected for at least several years, if not longer.
In recent months, a number of vendors have released artificial intelligence tools directed at legal professionals. I have had the chance to try a few of these artificial intelligence applications myself. In some very specific contexts, the applications can be helpful. These tools can suggest revisions that might be made to documents and provide feedback that is useful when reviewing a long document.

However, in many contexts, artificial intelligence is not that helpful with document review and other automated legal tasks. I frequently face a situation in which artificial intelligence suggests deal terms that clearly would be rejected by the other side, and the tool has no sense of what would be acceptable and what would be rejected by an adversary. At other points, the artificial intelligence suggests silly edits that do not make sense when considering the larger picture involved in a given transaction.
Sometimes, I actually waste time reviewing the feedback provided by artificial intelligence tools and rejecting the edits! At best, most artificial intelligence applications are tools and not replacements for most of the work lawyers do. The work of artificial intelligence definitely needs to be reviewed by a lawyer since the artificial intelligence tends to make mistakes and because the artificial intelligence and the lawyer together can possibly create a better work product than can be produced independently by either.
Another reason why I do not believe that artificial intelligence will be disruptive to the legal profession in the short term is due to the versatile nature of the legal sector. In my own career, I have seen swaths of lawyers become obsolete due to technology, and I have seen how the legal profession shifted to absorb many of the lawyers who no longer had jobs.




For instance, earlier in my career, it was common to have numerous attorneys perform document review projects for law firms. Sometimes, in-house staff attorneys performed the work, and other times, law firms hired outsourced attorneys to perform document review tasks. In many instances, lawyers would review numerous documents to determine if they were responsive to document demands made in litigation. If the documents were responsive, lawyers might see if a privilege or protection could prevent disclosure of materials and help write a privilege log for materials that were withheld.
Around a decade ago (or a little longer), much of that work dried up because of predictive coding and other technologies that ensured law firms did not need to hire the same amount of document review attorneys. These days, it is rare to see a job posting for document review attorneys, even though this had been extremely common not that long ago. Indeed, this website had a column written by a document-review attorney dedicated to the happenings of similar professionals. However, the legal profession has seemingly adapted to this shift, and I assume that many of the people who formerly worked as document-review attorneys now work in other parts of the legal profession.
Of course, every lawyer should keep an eye on recent developments in artificial intelligence to ensure that they use all tools that can help them effectively serve clients. However, the legal profession will likely not suffer a widescale disruption due to artificial intelligence for a while, even though many commentators seem to have a contrary view.

								Public sector short on AI skills, report shows							

								Sixty percent of government respondents in a recent survey said that the lack of relevant skills impaired their ability to apply artificial intelligence.

The cloud software firm Salesforce published a report Wednesday showing that the overwhelming issue technology professionals experience when trying to implement artificial intelligence in the public sector comes down to a shortage of skills.
In surveys of public- and private-sector professionals, 46% of respondents said lack of skills hampered their ability to implement AI in their work. That figure jumped to 60% among public-sector respondents.
“Training and skills development are critical first steps for the public sector to leverage the benefits of AI,” Casey Coleman, senior vice president of global government solutions at Salesforce, said in a press release. “By investing in new skills like prompt development, public sector leaders can empower their workforce to use AI to increase productivity, build deeper relationships with constituents and improve the quality of public services.”
Other AI roadblocks public-sector IT workers face include data quality and security issues, an increasing cost of programming and general ethical concerns. Thirty-four percent of public-sector respondents said the focus on AI is slowing down other IT projects.

Sixty-eight percent of respondents who worked in public or private media and entertainment considered themselves experts in effectively using AI – the highest of any professional category in the survey. More than half of respondents in business services, manufacturing and health care considered themselves AI experts. Only 28% of those working for the government considered themselves experts at using AI, according to the survey results.
Although the skills gap is impacting AI adoption in the public sector, IT professionals reported optimisism about how the technology may be used to improve their work. Survey respondents said that the top three benefits to implementing AI in the public sector are the ability to automate routine tasks, reduce risk and improve customer experiences.
To help public sector workers develop their AI skills, more than 500 officials from 200 state and local governments recently joined to form the GovAI Coalition, a group that shares resources on how to responsibly use AI. Since forming last fall, the group has published documents that governments can use to draft policies and is now helping agencies adopt those policies.

“Artificial intelligence holds immense potential as a transformative force, reshaping jobs and industries. For the U.S. to be globally competitive, it must develop an AI-ready workforce. Intel is committed to bringing AI everywhere and expanding digital readiness,” said Brian Gonzalez, executive director of Government Partnerships and Initiatives at Intel Corporation. “We greatly value this collaboration with UC Blue Ash to bring AI courses and an AI associate degree track to Ohio, which will be vital for helping businesses find skilled AI professionals.”
Intel is constructing two new semiconductor chip factories in Licking County, Ohio, near Columbus. The $20 billion project will develop groundbreaking technology and is expected to create approximately 3,000 new jobs when production is scheduled to begin in 2027.

Many business analysts see AI as a job creator across nearly every type of industry. Forbes notes that as the job market evolves, both employers and the employed will implement a growing number of AI solutions to give themselves a cutting-edge advantage. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there will be 11.5 million data-related job openings by 2026.
The UC Blue Ash AI degree program is designed to prepare graduates for in-demand entry level positions by teaching them about the practical applications of AI in a variety of industries, such as health care, finance and manufacturing. Students in the program could also have the opportunity to participate in internships with local companies and organizations.
“Our new Artificial Intelligence program is an important development as we continuously work to add academic degree programs that offer valuable opportunities for our students and help meet the demand among businesses in our region and beyond,” said UC Blue Ash Dean Robin Lightner, PhD. “We truly appreciate Intel’s partnership in making this program possible.”
Along with preparing students for a career in just two years, the AI program offers students a pathway to continue their education toward a bachelor’s degree in computer science, information technology, mathematics, statistics or other similar programs. The curriculum at UC Blue Ash is aligned with the UC Uptown campus, so students can make a seamless transition toward their bachelor’s degree if they choose that path.

Personally, I view AI as a tool that, when used wisely, can enhance our capabilities and improve our efficiency.AdvertisementWe are already using AI in many aspects of our daily lives, often without even realizing it. Whether it is asking Siri for directions, using Google to search for information or relying on smart home devices like Alexa to play music or set reminders, AI has become an integral part of our routine.Forbes Magazine says, “By 2025, an estimated 95% of customer interactions will be supported by AI technology.”It is important to remember that AI is a tool created by humans to serve humans. The goal is not to replace the human touch but to augment it. AI can handle repetitive tasks, analyze large data sets and even assist in complex problem-solving. Artificial intelligence can automate routine tasks, thereby reducing errors. This frees up human workers to focus on more complex and creative endeavors. But AI cannot replicate the creativity, empathy and intuition that humans bring to the table.Ginni Rometty, former CEO of IBM said, “Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence.”With its ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data, AI can uncover insights and patterns that might be missed by humans, aiding in more informed decision-making. AI can drive product development and innovation, helping businesses to stay competitive in a rapidly changing market.Artificial intelligence can also provide personalized experiences for customers, from chatbots that offer instant customer service to recommendation systems that tailor content to individual preferences.AI opens the door to new technological advancements and business models, driving innovation across various industries. The initial investment of AI technology can be significant, and not all businesses may have the resources to implement and maintain these systems effectively. However, by automating tasks, AI can help reduce labor costs and operational expenses, reducing the need for manual intervention in certain processes.Artificial intelligence, however, can be a double-edged sword. While it offers all the benefits I listed above, it also presents certain challenges that we must navigate carefully.Susan Sly, a two-time AI startup founder who was voted as one of the top 15 women in the world in real-time AI in 2024, spoke to my Roundtable group, explaining: “AI is like a toddler right now. It will grow up to be a teenager, and you know what teenagers like to do -- rebel. They do what you tell them not to do.”The impact of AI on the job market will be severe. A McKinsey report suggests that 400-800 million jobs worldwide could be displaced by 2030 due to automation and AI. Also, an overreliance on AI could lead to a loss of certain skills and a diminished ability to perform tasks without technological assistance.During her presentation, Susan listed some of the jobs that will likely be going away, such as therapist, accountant, analyst, executive assistant, translator, medical assistant, fashion designer, paralegal, radiologist, teacher, journalist, editor, architect and influencer.On the flip side, Susan said the people who work with their hands will have the most money and power in the future -- construction workers, electricians, plumbers, surgeons and pilots. Good industries to be in include food preparation, transportation, fishing and farming.This is a stark reminder that we must adapt and learn to work alongside these technologies. Those who embrace AI and improve their skills to complement machine capabilities will likely find themselves at an advantage.Artificial intelligence systems can raise ethical questions, especially regarding privacy, surveillance and the potential for bias in decision-making processes. AI systems can be vulnerable to hacking and other security breaches, which could have serious implications if they control critical infrastructure or sensitive data. I suspect that’s what frightens people the most.As we look to the future, the key is to approach AI with a mindset of collaboration rather than fear. By understanding its capabilities and limitations, we can harness its power to create a more efficient and innovative world while also safeguarding the qualities that make us uniquely human. The point is to team up with AI to multiply your own intelligence.Artificial intelligence can be your best business ally or your worst nightmare. It all depends on how you integrate it into your strategy.Mackay’s Moral: Artificial intelligence is where data meets destiny.View Comments",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.uexpress.com/life/harvey-mackay/2024/04/15'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experts expect that Apple might offer some cloud-based AI features powered by Google&#039;s Gemini or another provider.&nbsp; It is believed that Apple has reportedly held discussions with companies such as Google, OpenAI and China&#039;s Baidu about potential generative AI partnerships. However,&nbsp; iOS 18 is not expected to include Apple&#039;s own ChatGPT-like chatbot. It is believed that Gemini&nbsp; and other chatbots can be directly integrated into iOS 18. The big idea! During the question and answer section of ‘Power On’ newsletter, “As the world awaits Apple&#039;s big AI unveiling on June 10, it looks like the initial wave of features will work entirely on devices,” Mark Gurman said. “That means there&#039;s no cloud processing component to the company&#039;s large language model, the software that powers the new capabilities,” Gurman added further. What’s next? Critics argue that iOS 18 might have new generative AI features for the iPhone&#039;s Spotlight search tool, Siri, Safari, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages and&nbsp; Keynote, among others. Earlier Gurman is expected to have mentioned that generative AI has the potential to improve Siri&#039;s ability to answer more complex questions. In addition to this, AI might allow the Messages app to auto-complete sentences. Also ReadOpenAI opens its first Asia office in Japan: The next step to stay ahead in AI market?

Upon review, 62 papers were invited for presentations – 19 doctoral scholars from XLRI Jamshedpur and 43 doctoral scholars affiliated with other universities and institutions.
The inaugural event, held at XLRI Jamshedpur at 9:00 AM on 8th April 2024, was introduced by Prof. Prashant Kumar (Convener of XLRI Doctoral Colloquium and Associate Professor – Marketing), XLRI Jamshedpur.
In a welcome address at the inauguration of the event, Fr. George Sebastian S.J. (Director), XLRI Jamshedpur, stressed the need for research to have societal consequences and for academics to focus on the broader societal needs of the hour. He also drew attention to the rise of Artificial Intelligence in everyday life at one end and the roles of sustainability at the other end.
“Artificial Intelligence (AI) traces its origins back to the 1950s. Government has allocated  $480 million in the current budget to support Fifth Generation Technology Startups, encompassing AI, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, 3-D Printing, and Blockchain. Additionally, the government aims to bolster research, training, human resources, and skill development in AI, Robotics, Digital Manufacturing, Big Data Intelligence, Real-Time Data, and Quantum Communication,” XLRI Director added.
Addressing misconceptions, Father Sebastian dismissed fears of AI’s negative impact on job opportunities, emphasizing its potential to enhance human life. However, he also underscored the emerging challenges posed by AI in the near future.
Fr. Donald D’Silva S.J., (Dean – Administration & Finance), XLRI Jamshedpur, highlighted the need to balance work and self-investment to avoid stress during a doctoral programme. Dr. Sanjay Patro, (Dean – Academics), XLRI Jamshedpur, emphasized the need for meaningful research, particularly given the nascent nature of Artificial Intelligence in Research. He shared examples of various use cases of AI from the industry and the need to study the implications of their usage in academic articles.

Another invited guest, Prof. Shaphali Gupta (Mani Ayer Chair Professor of Marketing, MICA, Ahmedabad), discussed the need for having relevance and rigor in the research programmes. She explained ways to work on ideas that have good potential for research and impact on society.
Prof. Rajendra Nargundkar (Vice-Chancellor, Prestige University, Indore), emphasized the need to balance quality of research with quantity of research. He highlighted that the scholars should focus on ticking their publication requirements in the early years of their research. Prof. Rajiv Bhushan (Associate Professor, NIT Jamshedpur), spoke for the need to focus on sustainable topics in research and the present reality of the world and the need to find that voice in academic circles.
Prof. Ajith Kumar J (Associate Dean, FPM Programme and Member of the Advisory Board of the Doctoral Colloquium), XLRI Jamshedpur, brought about the salient features and the details of the FPM programme at XLRI. Prof. H K Pradhan, (Professor of Finance and Member of the Advisory Board of the Doctoral Colloquium), XLRI Jamshedpur, recounted his personal experience in doing PhD program and his inclination for teaching, that led him to this path.
