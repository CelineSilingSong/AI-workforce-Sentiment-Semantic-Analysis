<p>Globally-renowned AI expert Dr Demis Hassabis will today be confirmed as an adviser to the new Office for Artificial Intelligence as the UK looks to cement its place as a world leader in the fast-growing technology.</p>

<p>Hassabis, who is the co-founder of leading AI research company DeepMind, will provide expert industry guidance to help the country build the skills and capability it needs to capitalise on the huge social and economic potential of AI - a key part of the Government’s modern Industrial Strategy.</p>

<p>Digital Secretary Matt Hancock will also confirm Tabitha Goldstaub as the chair and spokesperson of the AI Council, a new industry body tasked with increasing growth in the AI sector and promoting its adoption in other sectors of the economy.</p>

<p>Tabitha Goldstaub is the co-founder of AI company CognitionX, an online platform which provides companies with information and access to AI experts to boost their businesses, and runs CogX, one of the largest gatherings of AI experts in the world.</p>

<p>She led the team who wrote the influential report London: the AI Growth Capital of Europe, and was the co-founder of Rightster, the largest online video distribution company outside the US. She is also the co-founder of Future Girl Corp and an adviser to Founders 4 Schools.</p>

<p>The announcements form part of the Government’s modern Industrial Strategy, and follow the Grand Challenges announced by the Prime Minister to use the county’s power in research and innovation to ensure the benefits of technology are felt by everyone. It also builds on the £1 billion joint Government and private sector investment announced earlier this year to put the nation at the forefront of the global AI industry.</p>

<p>One of the four Grand Challenges is on AI and data, which is at the centre of the Government’s plans to unlock the potential of the data-driven economy and put the UK at the forefront of AI technologies. It will be led by a Business Champion and a Skills Champion, working alongside Ministers and responsible for engaging industry voices and raising the profile of the challenge.</p>

<p>Matt Hancock will also today announce Dame Wendy Hall, who led last year’s independent review on AI, as a Skills Champion for AI, and Tabitha Goldstaub as the AI Business Champion.</p>

<p>Speaking in London, Digital Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s improving travel, making banking easier or helping people live longer, AI is already revolutionising our economy and our society.</p>

  <p>Britain is already an authority in AI, with the world’s best AI company and the leading use of AI in Government. We are determined to capitalize on this position.</p>

  <p>Cutting-edge technology is the basis of the future of our economy. Under this Government, investment in the tech sector doubled in the last year, is growing at three times the pace of the rest of the economy, unemployment is at a 40-year low, inequality is falling, and we are seeing the first sustained fall in debt in a generation. We must build on these strengths.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We want to harness the best possible AI leadership to help us seize this opportunity. Demis Hassabis, Tabitha Goldstaub, and Wendy Hall have the expertise and vision to help us make sure the huge benefits of this powerful new technology are available to everyone.</p>

AI, machine learning, deep learning and automation are no longer future technologies, they’ve already found traction in the enterprise. Whether it’s to organize data, to uncover trends or to make human’s lives easier, AI can have a positive impact on the enterprise – if we let it. 
At least, that was the message at The Future of Work in a World of AI, ML, and Automation panel, held at MIT’s CIO Symposium 2018 conference this May, a one-day event where industry thought leaders and educators gathered to discuss the impact of evolving IT trends.

“The one thing that is certain is that there is going to be a lot of disruption over the next five to 10 years as these technologies work their way through each of your companies, through each of your industries and through each of your geographies,” says Erik Brynjolfsson director of MIT’s Initiative on the Digital Economy and professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. “But if we understand better those effects and if we work to reinvent our business processes, we’re going to be able to take advantage of these technologies to create a lot of wealth, a lot of benefits for lots of different people.”











 
 
 
AI won’t wipe out entire job categories
The Department of Labor created a dataset called ONET, which includes the descriptions for 964 occupations in the US. Each job has a list that includes around 20 to 32 tasks, with a total of over 18,000 tasks that exist in the economy.

Brynjolfsson’s team took this data set and evaluated each skillset to determine which tasks could be done better by AI, and which were performed better by humans. The team found that for plenty of jobs there were always tasks that AI could do better than humans, but there were still plenty of tasks that humans excelled at over AI and machine learning.
“This was the pattern we found in occupation after occupation — that very rarely did machine learning just run the table. In most cases, machine learning was able to do some tasks but not others within a given occupation,” Brynjolfsson says. “That means that most of the jobs in your organization will be partly affected by machine learning, but there’ll also be things that the humans need to continue to do.”











 
 
 
This will require coordination to help AI and humans work together, “but very rarely will we just completely wipe out entire job categories,” Brynjolfsson says. 
Upskilling the workforce
But what about AI-assisted robots? There, the conclusion is the same. In plenty of instances, robots can help alleviate time-consuming, menial, tedious or even physically-strenuous tasks, without employees losing their jobs. In fact, the most likely scenario would see humans and robots working together, with many robots purpose-built for collaboration, also known as co-bots.
We’re still far off from “artificial general intelligence,” which is the type of automation you might see in a movie, where robots can “outwit people on every dimension,” says Brynjolfsson. But AI can make a big difference in the enterprise — especially with any task with sufficient data that has a “set of inputs that map to a set of outputs.”











 
 
 
Panelist Jason Jackson, an assistant professor in political economy and urban planning at MIT, gave the example of healthcare workers. Automating tasks such as patient transfers and lifts can help alleviate some of the physical burden on workers, Jackson says, while also protecting patients and preventing injury. It’s a task that requires strength and effort on the healthcare practitioner’s side — so in this case, automating one skill won’t replace healthcare workers, it will just help them be more effective while also delivering a safer environment for the workers and patients, he adds.

There’s a similar trend in the automotive and manufacturing industries, according to panelist Elisabeth Reynolds, executive director of MIT’s Work of the Future Task Force. She argues that co-bots are creating more upward growth and opportunities for workers now that they’re free to work on more complex tasks. And, while some industries may face displacement, Reynolds says “it is a small percentage of the growth that we see.”
Ownership of AI and machine learning data
The future of robots and AI in the enterprise isn’t without risk. As with past technologies, businesses need to look ahead at potential risks, problems or roadblocks. One key area of anticipated concern revolves around data.











 
 
 
“Many people thought that social media would usher in this wonderful future of connectedness and community, but in many ways it didn’t. It led to some very dysfunctional outcomes. So how do we manage the risk so that AI and automation won’t have those similar unintended consequences?” says Reynolds.
Toronto, for example, let Google install sensors and other equipment to gather data on a street or in a community to deliver valuable information about the city and to discover new insights into the infrastructure, she says. But who owns that data? Does the data belong to Google, or to Toronto?
“It’s obviously owned by the city as well, but does the city have the resources or capabilities to actually do good with that?” Reynolds asks. These are all important questions businesses will have to ask themselves as they commit to relying on data, especially as AI blends further into the workforce and our lives.











 
 
 
As businesses embrace AI, robots, machine learning and deep learning, they will need a clear strategy for leveraging the technology without creating fear around the displacement of jobs or crossing ethical lines. 
“The point here is to affirm and assert that there will be work in the future and our challenge is to make sure that that work is a quality work, that is meaningful work, that is accessible work,” says Reynolds.

News Branch Air Force 
This Is Not How ‘Skynet’ Begins, Air Force Says of Artificial Intelligence Efforts

A top Air Force commander has assured reporters that no, the military’s experiments with artificial intelligence are not the first step toward “Skynet,” the evil defense network in the “Terminator” movies that tried to wipe out humanity.
Google recently announced that it will not work with the Pentagon beyond its 2017 contract on Project Maven, an effort to have artificial intelligence help analyze footage from drones.
Speaking at a Defense Writers Group breakfast on Thursday morning, Air Force Gen. Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, said that the purpose of Project Maven is to determine whether “machines can learn to do the things that people are doing.” 
Holmes went on to explain that the Air Force does not have enough people to watch all of the full motion video taken from drones, so airmen are using so-called “learning algorithms” to teach machines what to look for in the endless footage. 
“The way we’ve been doing that kind of the same way I watch 3-year-olds learn things on their iPads“,” Holmes said. “Pick all the green things. Is that green? No. Is that green? Yes. So you do the same thing with a machine.” 
When machines recognize something important in the drone footage they can alert intelligence analysts, Holmes continued. Having machines do the repetitive tasks frees up people to “focus on things that people do best” and allows decision-makers to get important information quicker.
A related effort is Air Operations Center Pathfinder, in which coders and operators work together to quickly develop software that reduces the time needed to plan mission, task aircraft, and develop targets.
The Pentagon’s interest in artificial intelligence has raised concerns in Silicon Valley. Executives with Google, a subcontractor for Project Maven, said in June 7 statements that the company “would not support the use of AI for weaponized systems,” though it would continue to work with military on cybersecurity, recruitment, veterans’ healthcare and search and rescue.
Holmes said he is confident that the Air Force can continue to work with Silicon Valley to develop artificial intelligence technologies that can deter wars by making sure that enemies know that any attack against the United States is doomed to fail.
“What I would like to do is convince people that we’re all in the business of avoiding major war,” Holmes said. “That’s what we’re trying to do. We’re going to have to rely on our industrial capabilities that are on that business and AI side if we’re going to do that. So how we can work together to set a rule set so we can go forward?”
But for decades Hollywood has been warning us that artificial intelligence will inevitably go rogue. So, naturally, Task & Purpose asked Holmes directly if Project Maven is the first step toward Skynet. 
“I certainly hope not,” he replied.
To ease concerns about a possible robot insurrection, Holmes pointed to the fact that, although learning machines have beat experts at chess, Go, and other games, they are far less effective without the assistance of experienced human operators.
“We’re going to have to work through as Americans our comfort level on how technologies are used and how they are applied,” Holmes said. “I understand the views of the people there. It goes into being a member of the military: I wield some pretty impressive technologies and our job is to make sure that we use them for good and in accordance with the rules that are laid out in the Constitution.”
“These are all complex issues that we’ll have to work through, but I’m not worried yet about AOC Pathfinder taking over as Skynet,” Holmes added.

How many times in the last year have you heard the question, ""Is artificial intelligence going to take over our jobs?"" For marketers, this question is just as relevant, but I'm here to tell you that robots are our marketing friends.Related: Is Artificial Intelligence Replacing Your Intelligence?We are just at the start of tapping into artificial intelligence (AI) for marketing, but there are already a number of great ways that this  technology is improving our jobs, not killing them.



AI, in fact, has the potential to do the jobs we don't want and the jobs we can't do, and to ultimately help us do the jobs we already do, better. Here's more on each prediction:AI is doing the jobs we don't want to do.The first obvious application of artificial intelligence is to automate the tasks that we humans don't want to do -- those repetitive, low- skill tasks. AI can be easily programmed to do such work and do it faster, more cheaply and more reliably. A great example is the cataloguing of marketing data to be used for analysis.


Say, for example, that you wanted to write a unique blog article on the topic of ""video marketing."" In order to figure out a unique angle for your article, you may want to catalogue all of the existing content on the topic of ""video marketing"" and even categorize each article by website, author and share metrics. This could be a very manual process for a human  and something that would invite human error into the process.Where AI shines is that it can do such repetitive tasks -- but at scale. Imagine that, in the same time frame, a junior marketer could catalogue 100 ""video marketing"" articles while a machine could catalogue more than 1,000 articles on the same topic, along with 1,000 articles each for 100 more topics.Such AI ability becomes particularly useful for marketers who are attempting to aggregate data about what's happening outside of their company -- what's being published by their competitors, customers or industry peers. There are tens of millions of pieces of content data created every minute, and if marketers want to leverage it, we need to employ machines to help.AI is doing the jobs we can't do.Not only is AI automating jobs we don't want to do, it's also opening the doors to jobs we can't do. Since AI has the ability to process an infinitely larger dataset than a human can, it can leverage that scale to identify marketing insights that would otherwise be lost.


Say you want to take the next step in that content-marketing data-collection project: You not only want to catalogue all of the ""video marketing"" content, but to catalogue all of the content being published in your industry more broadly. Ultimately, you'll want to use this catalogue to drive market-informed content campaigns of our own.Identifying new topics emerging or types of articles that garner above-average shares can help direct new content creation to align with existing trends. A given article could have many different qualities that could lead to its success. It's AI's ability to tag and compare many data points that ultimately produce the marketing takeaway.Related: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on 2018's Top HR TrendsAI's strength in turning a mass of data into insight truly shines in the noisiest, highest-volume channels that a marketer hopes to master. Social media, content marketing, news and PR are great places to start, but even competitors' job postings and website changes can be great inputs for marketing campaigns if a business can manage to extract insight out of the noise.


Again, AI-based technologies have the ability to throw out the noise -- whether that means the same old promotional tweet or a website update to fix a typo. Those technologies can then focus on the signal -- like a tweet about an acquisition or a website change to alter a competitor's pricing. In this way, AI can see both the forest and the trees in online data to surface takeaways for marketers they would not be able to find manually -- and in real-time, at that.AI is improving the jobs we already do.By incorporating AI into our marketing, we have the opportunity to free up that expensive, intelligent, creative resource that is a marketer to do higher value work. Instead of collecting data, marketers can analyze it. Instead of sifting through data, marketers can act on it.Related: 5 Innovative Ways Artificial Intelligence Is Advancing TechnologyBy delegating work to AI-driven technologies, marketers can improve their work by creating content they know will stand out, by implementing conversion-optimization strategies observed from competitors' sites and enabling sales using the latest competitor pricing. And that's just the start of what AI can potentially do.

AI Background Checks for the Gig EconomyDo AI Background Checks Work Well?Real-time Background Checks Using AIDue Diligence Background Checks Using AIConclusion 









People are creepy, and we’re not just talking about clowns and people who drive cargo vans. We recently learned that nearly one-third of our fellow American adults, more than 70 million people, have been arrested on a felony charge at some point in their lives. We should note that arrests do not equal convictions, so don’t load up the van with the kiddos and head for the hills just yet. No doubt many of those arrests were (in the past) for smoking the sweet leaf, so you gotta figure about 90 percent of those at a Phish concert are felons. Still, most companies aren’t taking any chances when it comes to hiring employees. 
About 72 percent of employers conduct background checks of some kind, according to CareerBuilder. (This is different from “identity verification”, which is something companies like Onfido do.) Once a company knows that you are who you say you are, then they want to make sure there’s nothing in your background that might raise red flags. And for that, they’re turning to artificial intelligence (AI).
AI Background Checks for the Gig Economy
One of the faster-growing companies doing background checks using AI is a startup called Checkr. The San Francisco company hooked a $100 million Series C megaround in April that included previous investors Accel Partners and Y Combinator. The global asset management firm T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) led the round. Even Google got involved back in a $9 million Series A in October 2014. That brings total disclosed funding to $149 million since then. 
Update 09/19/2019: Checkr has raised $160 million in fresh funding to expand internationally, past the U.S. and Canada where it got its start in 2014. This brings the company’s total funding to $309 million to date.  
In those four years, Checkr has scaled to run one million background checks per month for more than 10,000 customers. We briefly profiled Checkr last year for our article on “6 Digital Identity Verification Startups to Check Out.”

The company plans to nearly double its workforce with the new infusion of cash, as well as build out its technology, including increasing the speed, data insights, and accuracy of its AI platform for background checks. Much digital ink has been spilled over how artificial intelligence has certain biases based on the data it has been trained on, such as facial recognition software that mistook pictures of black people for apes. That’s not the case with Checkr, co-founder Daniel Yanisse told Entrepreneur. In fact, he said the AI does not attempt to predict if a person will be a good fit for the job or even make recommendations. Instead, the machine automates data classification for fact-based categories, such as determining whether an offense is a driving violation or an assault.
In fact, Yanisse and team believe that by using AI for background checks, Checkr is helping take human bias out of the hiring and recruiting equation. Clients can customize the AI-powered background check to exclude certain criminal offenses that might not be relevant to the job.
Do AI Background Checks Work Well?
Good question. If you asked the victims of sexual assault or abuse in the 103 alleged cases involving Uber drivers in the United States, they’d probably give you a collective “fcuk no” for an answer. (Just to be clear, we’re talking about cases where guilt has been established in a court of law, not the kangaroo courts on Twitter.) Even then, half of all convicted sex offenses in London cabs in 2016 were committed by Uber drivers, according to Business Insider. Last year, Colorado fined Uber nearly $9 million when it was discovered that 57 drivers had criminal or motor vehicle violations that should have disqualified them from working for the ride-hailing company. On the other hand, Uber provides about 15 million rides per day around the world, most of which involve nothing more sinister than awkward silence or being subjected to the musical whims of a tone-deaf driver.
Background checks by Checkr using artificial intelligence typically screen potential Uber drivers’ records within the past seven years, according to a report by CNN. Felony convictions, violent crime or sexual offenses, or a registration on the U.S. Department of Justice National Sex Offender public website automatically disqualifies an applicant from being an Uber driver. In addition, Uber announced it would conduct annual background checks of its drivers. At an estimated $35 a pop for each driver (though we would guess Uber has negotiated some sort of discount), that’s a steady stream of revenue for Checkr. As a private company—the world’s biggest second biggest in fact—Uber doesn’t release employment numbers, but some educated guesses put its on-demand workforce at about two million drivers.

Checkr was originally founded to serve the gig (or freelance) economy, which by some estimates accounts for a third of the U.S. workforce. In that regard, they promised a turnaround of one to two days on most background checks. In addition to Uber, the company counts on-demand employers like Lyft, Grubhub, Instacart, and Postmates, as well as more traditional employers such as Allstate, as clients. If two days is too long, then our next startup might be able to help.
Real-time Background Checks Using AI
Founded in 2014, Intelligo Group offers background checks using artificial intelligence on both individuals and companies. It has raised $6.8 million, the most recent round a $5.7 million Series A last October. Intelligo’s AI platform, dubbed Clarity, collects and monitors data from thousands of sources including global news media, sanctions and blacklists, politically exposed person records (whatever that means), civil and criminal legal records, SEC filings, corporate records, social media, blogs and more. Algorithms then attack the data, likely using natural language understanding or processing to pore over volumes of structured and unstructured data, simulating the “thought process of human analysts by piecing scattered information together to extract meaningful insights.”

Intelligo markets its background check platform for more than just employment verification. One of its proposed markets is for investment funds. In that case, Clarity allows clients to monitor and conduct due diligence on executives, fund managers, investors, third-party vendors, employees, and management teams. For example, an investor may want to investigate the management team of a potential early-stage investment. It’s sort of background check meets business intelligence. Would it have caught Theranos before it walked away with $700 million in investments? This next company might have.
Due Diligence Background Checks Using AI
While we typically associate background checks with humans, there’s an equally important need to assess the worthiness of business entities. We come across this problem all the time when looking through some of the nefarious organizations that over-the-counter (OTC) companies align themselves with. That’s where our next solution comes in. The story starts with a Canadian startup called OutsideIQ which developed an AI-based automated due diligence solution that you can use to analyze potential clients, investments, transactions, third-parties, and counterparties. Says the company:

DDIQ is an automated risk analytics product that learns about its search subject by going to thousands of sources. It identifies, evaluates and rates risks presenting the data which can be immediately used to make key business decisions. All in about 5 minutes.
In 2017, they were acquired by a leading regtech firm called Exiger. The tool can now be used to monitor risk on a daily basis. You can be sure that all of this is moving more towards real-time risk assessments where companies can quickly disassociate themselves with any problematic persons or parties that may suddenly raise red flags. This underscores the importance of following the judicial process that’s been in place for decades, as opposed to “guilt by accusation”.
Conclusion
We already know that big data can be used to pull together all sorts of reports about us thanks to huge amounts of data exhaust we create online, especially through social media channels. Cambridge Analytica certainly isn’t the only company to ever engage in debatable data-mining practices. Combined with artificial intelligence, big data empowers companies to learn just about anything they might want to know about customers or competitors – whether that’s Coca Cola just trying to sell more sugary drinks that increase diabetes risk and obesity, or a startup turning online behavior into a credit score. The market potential to package each person’s digital data based on business potential—in this case, background checks on individuals and companies—can seem creepier than a circus clown. But those clowns will be laughing all the way to the bank.

Some of your articles are interesting but I’m going to remove you from my email white list. Disturbed people like you seem to think it’s fashionable to use 4 letter words in public venues. It seems to be a growing trend on the left. But it just shows a lack the skills to express yourself normally, and you have personality dis-orders. No I’m not a Victorian prude. I served in the military where I frequently used every swear word/phrase in the book, in 2 languages. The military, football fields, locker rooms, buddys having beers in a back yard, etc. are the kinds of places such language belongs. Not on a public web page where kids and grandmas will probably see it.

A beautiful space-exploration friendship between human and machine may have just begun.Early this morning (June 29), a small robot endowed with artificial intelligence (AI) launched on a two-day trip to the International Space Station aboard SpaceX's Dragon cargo capsule. No other AI-equipped machine has ever flown to space before, project team members said.The mission of the bantam astronaut assistant — known as CIMON, short for ""Crew Interactive Mobile Companion"" — is relatively short and modest. But its work off-Earth could help pave the way for some pretty big things, according to NASA officials.

""We'll have to have tools like this to have the species successfully live far away from Earth.""A smart flying sphereCIMON was developed by the European aerospace company Airbus on behalf of the German space agency, which is known by its German acronym, DLR. The robot's AI is IBM's famous Watson system.CIMON is roughly spherical and weighs 11 lbs. (5 kilograms). The robot can converse with people, and it knows whom it's talking to thanks to facial-recognition software. (CIMON has a face of its own — a simple cartoon one.) The astronaut assistant is also mobile; once aboard the ISS, CIMON will be able to fly around, by sucking air in and expelling it through special tubes.Get the Space.com NewsletterBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Though CIMON is flexible enough to interact with anyone, it's ""tailored to"" European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst, who arrived at the ISS aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft earlier this month. CIMON's mission calls for the robot to work with Gerst on three separate investigations. A close-up of CIMON, the Crew Interactive Mobile Companion, an A.I.-equipped robot that is the first of its kind to fly in space.

(Image credit: DLR/T. Bourry/ESA)""They will experiment with crystals, work together to solve the Rubik's cube and perform a complex medical experiment using CIMON as an 'intelligent' flying camera,"" Airbus representatives wrote in a mission description earlier this year.CIMON will be a very involved partner in this work, which will take a total of 3 hours.""Alexander Gerst could say something like, 'CIMON, could you please help me perform a certain experiment? Could you please help me with the procedure?'"" Philipp Schulien, a CIMON system engineer at Airbus, said during a different news conference yesterday. ""And then CIMON will fly towards Alexander Gerst, and they will already start the communication.""CIMON will be able to access lots of relevant information, including photos and videos, about the procedure in question. And the astronaut assistant is smart enough to deal with ""questions beyond the procedure"" that Gerst might have, Schulien added.A step toward the futureCIMON's mission is a technology demonstration designed to show researchers how humans and machines can interact and collaborate in the space environment. It'll be a while before intelligent robots are ready to do any really heavy lifting in the final frontier — say, helping astronauts repair damaged spacecraft systems or treating sick crewmembers. But that day is probably coming.""For us, this is a piece of the future of human spaceflight,"" Christian Karrasch, CIMON project leader at DLR, said yesterday.""If you go out to the moon or to Mars, you cannot take all mankind and engineers with you,"" Karrasch added. ""So, the astronauts, they will be on their own. But with an artificial intelligence, you have instantly all the knowledge of mankind.""Follow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

How Artificial Intelligence is Changing the Culture of Work 
In many ways, artificial intelligence is reinventing the world of business. A new white paper by culture transformation consultancy Walking the Talk delves into what exactly AI is and the impact it will have on organizational culture. Here’s the latest thinking.

 June 22, 2018 – Artificial intelligence is poised to become one of the most important business disruptors of our times. But too often people look only at the potential downsides of machines simulating human intelligence and overlook the positive impact and value that AI stands to deliver, particularly when it comes to organizational culture.
A new white paper report by Walking the Talk, a global culture transformation firm based in Amsterdam, says the changes that AI brings will be substantial, and that to take best advantage of the technology and to keep ahead of the competition, organizations must embrace a culture of innovation.
“As we move from digitalization to the full digital era, we believe that it is critical to change mindsets and move away from a focus on threats to a focus on opportunities offered by the new AI and cognitive technologies,” said the study, “Future Impact of AI on Culture,” by Jerome Parisse-Brassens, the firm’s executive director, and Humberto Branco, executive director for Latin America. “Beyond the fear of the killer robot and the loss of jobs, which will probably be the case for several industries, AI appeals to our humanity, because at its heart is the use of data to analyze patterns, and in particular patterns of behavior.”





The report asked two central questions: What exactly is AI? And what impact will it have on organizational culture? “At Walking the Talk, we define culture as ‘the patterns of behavior that are encouraged, discouraged, and tolerated by people and systems, over time,’” said Mr. Parisse-Brassens. “With this definition in mind, it is easy to see how central culture is to AI.”
AI Defined
Basically, AI is intelligence displayed by machines. “The term is applied when a machine mimics cognitive functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as learning and problem-solving,” said Mr. Parisse-Brassens. “The term encompasses many things, but at the moment it has a strong emphasis on using algorithms to do very smart things. It makes programming a lot simpler and a lot more interesting. What we are seeing in AI today is mostly pattern-matching and the capacity to look through sets of data.”
Beyond talking to humans, the technology is now moving toward machines talking to one another, which gives rise to images of machines becoming smarter than humans, potentially taking over the world and even wiping out humankind. Yet, Walking the Talk pointed to a more positive view of AI’s potential. “Research is currently being conducted about the ability of machines to stimulate empathy, where it would be able to interpret human emotions and adapt its behavior to give a specific response,” said the report. “It is easy to see through this the impact that AI can have on business: machines dealing with customer complaints, able to ask questions, solving important problems faster and more effectively than humans, showing empathy and providing the appropriate solution.”

Artificial Intelligence to Transform Workplace Sooner Than Expected
Research from McKinsey & Co. finds that between 75 million and 375 million workers globally will have to switch occupational categories and learn new skills in just the next 12 years because of automation and the transition to AI and robotics.

Many industries are already using AI. In healthcare, for example, one application helps doctors sift through hundreds of cancer drugs and choose the best one, based on a rapid analysis of papers, data and records, as well as find trends and treat potential health issues before they appear through regular diagnosis, said the report. The automotive industry is applying the technology with driverless cars. In financial services, AI is helping organize operations, maintain bookkeeping and invest in stocks. It is also being used to detect behavioral patterns for abnormal changes to reduce fraud and financial crime.
Organizational Culture
“What is clear to everyone is that AI is not about eliminating jobs, but about eliminating tasks of jobs, and about creating jobs that are more human – in other words, jobs that machines can’t do – or can’t yet do,” said Mr. Branco.
Walking the Talk said it foresees two main angles in which AI will impact organizational culture. The first one is that AI will help to manage culture. It can help, for example, to conduct a current culture assessment. “The purpose of AI is to analyze vast amounts of data to extract patterns,” said Mr. Branco. “By analyzing behavioral data sets, organizations will develop a good picture of their culture. We can picture a world where data is fed from many sources such as HR data, exit interviews, induction processes, performance management, business processes, leadership forums, and discussion threads to extract real-time behavior patterns to build an almost daily picture of the culture.”

It can also identify the target culture. “AI may be able to predict the best target culture based on hundreds of thousands of external and internal information sources,” he added. “To do this, it could simulate various scenarios of behavior change and measure the resulting business outcomes.”
Mindsets and Behaviors
AI can also serve to develop a culture plan. Beyond behaviors, AI will be able to identify systemic issues and their consequences, avoiding many of the current risks and facilitating the development of a culture plan. “It will help focus on the right culture change levers, better predict impact on culture and on the bottom line,” said Mr. Parisse-Brassens. “AI will also help identify culture influencers in the business as well as those resisting new sets of behavioral and management standards.”
And it can measure culture itself. “Whether it is to measure business outcomes or behavioral shifts, AI will play a significant role,” said Mr. Parisse-Brassens. “AI’s power and intelligence comes from the data at its disposal to analyze patterns, so having tools to collect behavioral shift will still be necessary.”

How Predictive Analytics Promotes Better Decision Making 
CHROs are vital in helping to place the right people in leadership roles at their companies, but these days they also serve a critical strategic function. Those responsibilities seldom play out on a bigger corporate stage than at Johnson & Johnson, where Peter Fasolo serves as CHRO. 

The second angle is that AI will directly influence the mindsets and behaviors of people at work through the systems that will be implemented, he said. Among the “culture archetypes,” that the study identified, innovation is cited as the one that AI will impact the most. “The mindset that sits behind innovation is curiosity,” said the report. “Asking questions, challenging, testing, trialing things and failing fast are all behaviors underpinning innovation, and they are the essence of AI and cognitive technologies.”
A Mindset of Innovation
To make the most of AI, organizations must shift toward a mindset of innovation, bringing the curiosity to look beyond what they can now see and interpret. “They will need to ask the right questions of the machines, they will need to be ready to test the solutions provided, and move quickly,” said Mr. Parisse-Brassens. “AI will innovate, see patterns that the human brain can’t detect, and offer new ways forward.”
In practical terms, AI is already influencing the way businesses are managed, said Messrs. Parisse-Brassens and Branco in an interview with Hunt Scanlon Media. “With an increasingly challenging external environment, there is a critical need for senior executives to be supported in exploring new business boundaries, continuously challenging their traditional business-models, fast-prototyping products and services, being sufficiently humble in accepting high-accurate learning-machine inputs to decisions, to deal with errors, losses and lack of complete answers to new questions that are arising with increasing speed, range, complexity and associated risks,” the authors said. “Openness to learn, to innovate and to foster the courage required to move fast even when uncertain are concrete requirements in embracing AI.”

The type of people organizations need to recruit will change, moving away from highly technical roles to jobs that place more importance on cultural fit and adaptability. “People who are adaptable, responsive and agile will be favored,” said Mr. Branco. “This will impact the culture of the organization towards one of innovation.”
Enhancing Diversity
To build the next generation of technology and AI tools, organizations will need as many diverse points of view as possible, the authors said in the interview. “We need the ability to think differently about data, tools and uses of technology,” they said. “We need people whose logic is different. We need different ways of thinking. This means that contrary to what many of us think, robotization and AI will not remove diversity but enhance it. Talent management will therefore be directly influenced. Through the analysis that AI will provide, it will be able help to maximize the value from the workforce, but also fully engage them, use their strengths and increase their commitment and engagement.”
Related: Attracting Top Talent in the Age of AI
As such, recruitment of talent will need to evolve and in some cases, to be completely transformed or even become unnecessary. “People who are adaptable, responsive and agile will be highly favored, because they will be able to not only work with AI but allow the business to thrive and grow through AI,” the authors said. “A growth mindset will be one of the key attributes of new talent, moving away from static, linear, short-term thinking towards sustainability, incremental, open ways of looking at the world.”
The road to realizing the full cultural impact of artificial intelligence is long, concluded the report. Walking the Talk said it predicts the changes that are coming will be considerable. And as it is so often with culture, leadership will be the central issue. “Will leaders adapt to a new workforce, new ways of thinking and acting?” asked the authors. “Will leaders make the most of a new technology that will help them to empower the workforce? Will they use AI to create the culture they need to effectively implement their strategy, being able to manage their businesses transition to an AI environment? This challenge requires major cross-functional attention, effort and collaboration.”

According to research done by Glassdoor, data scientists have the No. 1 job in the United States. The survey looked at salary, job satisfaction and the number of job openings. If you have recent experience looking for AI specialists to join your team, it’s quite clear that we’re facing an AI skills crisis. In order to move AI projects from ideation into implementation, companies will need to determine how to close the AI skills gap so they have experts on their team to get the job done.

Factors that contribute to the AI talent shortage
One report suggested there about 300,000 AI professionals worldwide, but millions of roles available. While these are speculative figures, the competitive salaries and benefits packages and the aggressive recruiting tactics rolled out by firms to recruit AI talent would suggest the supply of AI talent is nowhere near matching up to the demand.
As the democratization of AI and deep learning applications expands—possible not just for tech giants but now viable for small- and medium-sized businesses—the demand for AI professionals to do the work has ballooned as well. The C-suite and corporate management’s excitement for AI’s various applications is building and then once they have bought into the concept (which is happening much more rapidly), they want to make it real right away.
PROMOTED





The 2018 “How Companies Are Putting AI to Work Through Deep Learning” survey from O’Reilly reveals the AI skills gap is the largest barrier to AI adoption, although data challenges, company culture, hardware and other company resources are also impediments. These results parallel a recent Ernst & Young poll that confirmed 56% of senior AI professionals believed the lack of qualified AI professionals was the single biggest barrier to AI implementation across business operations.

Another reason for the AI skills crisis is that our academic and training programs just can’t keep up with the pace of innovation and new discoveries with AI. Not only do AI professionals need official training, they need on-the-job experience. Therefore, there aren’t enough experienced AI professionals to step into the leadership roles required by organizations who are just beginning to adopt AI strategies into their operations.
How to close the AI skills gap
One of the ways to address the AI skills gap is to increase resources for digital, math and technical education such as the UK Government announced in its 2017 Industrial Strategy whitepaper. While skills acquisition for younger generations will help in the future, a singular focus on just driving more students into computer science will not solve the issue—the number of computer science graduates in the UK would need to increase 10X to meet the demand.

Many of the tech giants such as Google and Amazon are investing internationally to expand their talent pool. Google Brain Toronto is a facility dedicated to AI and Amazon has an AI-focused lab near the University of Cambridge in England and plans to build a similar facility in Barcelona.
Until there are new graduates to step into AI roles, many companies can focus now on retraining and upskilling current employees. According to a Forbes survey, 63% of companies are now providing in-house data analytics training. The future of work will require employees to be agile and change their skills over time.
It’s challenging to find a person who has the appropriate hard skills and technical know-how as well as the soft skills such as being “highly collaborative” that would make them successful in a high-level AI position that can take their tech skills and apply them to business problems. Recent grads typically don’t have the business acumen and leadership experience that is required to manage AI implementation throughout an organization. As AI matures in organizations, it will be imperative that diverse personnel and thinking is integrated.
Some AI positions could be filled by those with mathematics or physics degree who get trained on AI specialties. Deeplearning.ai, launched in collaboration with Coursera, is hoping to bring AI to a mass audience and help people build their careers in AI.
Could the solution for the AI skills gap be solved by AI? Possibly.  Google is developing AutoML, AI that can actually create other AI systems. If this initiative is successful it could be very powerful for mid-sized businesses that are unable to compete with tech giants for top-tier talent.
Technology has a long history of embracing collaboration across borders and gaining advantage from insights allowed due to using open-source software. Another way to improve the AI skills crisis is to tap into this decentralized network of data professionals.
There’s clearly not one way to solve the AI skills crisis. It will require a multipronged approach over a period of time and the approach will evolve over time. While there is no easy solution, all companies who plan to use AI today or in the future must consider how they will attack the AI talent gap.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,The AI Skills Crisis And How To Close The Gap,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/06/25/the-ai-skills-crisis-and-how-to-close-the-gap/,,,Enterprise & Cloud,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the major contributors here. At its core, IoT is all about connected devices equipped with sensors and microchips that help transmit data via the Internet over a centralized platform for enhanced efficiency and performance. Estimates suggest that by 2020, the number of connected devices all over the world will be nearly 50 billion.SourceAs the number of connected devices continues to escalate rapidly, there will arise the need to manage and analyze the sheer amount of data generated by these devices. This data is crucial as it holds valuable insights and patterns that can help businesses and organizations to assess potential risks, find new business opportunities, and most importantly improve the overall functioning and productivity of organizations. Now, this is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) come in. AI and ML technologies allow data scientists to delve deep into massive volumes of data and uncover meaningful insights from it. Stressing the importance of AI for IoT and machines, Prof. John McCarthy aptly stated:“The goal of AI is to develop machines that behave as though they were intelligent.”Although at a developing phase, AI has already started creating job prospects in the global market. Capgemini reports that nearly 83% of organizations leveraging AI technologies maintain that new jobs have begun to crop up in the field of AI. With more and more organizations joining the bandwagon of Big Data and AI, there’s now an enormous demand for skilled data professionals such as data scientists, data engineers, data analysts, and much more.SourceGetting your career started in AI has become much more convenient now that the internet is swarming with highly educative and informative online Artificial Intelligence courses. These courses are specially tailored to introduce aspiring students to the basic concepts of AI such as algorithms, natural language processing, etc., and gradually progress towards the more complex concepts such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning. If you’re even remotely related to the tech-scene, it’s recommended you go through these courses and improve your employability. Because, as it must be clear by now, organizations far and wide are constantly on a lookout for up-skilled data professionals. There couldn’t be a better time for you to start than now!SourceRole Of Computation In Management Of DataToday, data is exponentially increasing — nearly 2.5 quintillions of data is generated daily! In a data-driven world that we live in, this data is the source of all information. However, managing such massive volumes of data is a challenge in itself. Thanks to high-end computing processes we’re able to store, process, and analyze this data to reveal the hidden trends and insights that can enhance business operations, improve the quality of life, and most importantly, foster innovation.SourceComputers can process and analyze data much more quickly and accurately than humans and hence, are immensely helping companies leverage the data at their disposal to calculate vital statistics, monitor employee performance, power automation, boost productivity and sales, improve the efficiency of machines, and much more. It is because of this computation power that organizations today have access to an extensive range of statistical and technical insights and figures. Furthermore, technologies such as cloud computing have enhanced the functionality of AI. For instance, industrial magnates like Netflix and Amazon rely on cloud-based frameworks to process AI tasks and services that demand comprehensive analysis and computing.Data Infrastructure and Artificial IntelligenceData infrastructure is an essential aspect of data processing and analysis. Businesses and organizations cannot create value out of data without having the proper data infrastructures. By data infrastructure, we mean the entire backend computing support system required to process, store, transfer, and safeguard data.While many companies use a software-defined infrastructure (SDI) to support the dynamic IT environment, SDI has its backlogs. Not only is SDI constrained by the static source code, but its functioning also largely depends on the skills and expertise of the software developer who writes the codes for a particular environment. Thus, SDI is not ‘intelligent.’ The trend is now shifting towards Artificial Intelligence defined infrastructures (ADI).Essentially, ADI is an intelligent upgrade of SDI, fully stacked with sophisticated AI and ML algorithms that can ‘learn’ from the existing information to automatically build self-healing frameworks. ADI can:Constantly analyze the dynamic behavior of all the components of the existing infrastructure and ‘learn’ to understand their working by itself.Create an error-free environment by proactively monitoring the functioning of the components of the infrastructure and autonomously taking actions to fix issues, if any.Deploy resources according to the requirements of the workload and also de-allocate particular resources when they are no longer required.These data infrastructures help support various AI-related technologies and application, including:Support for existing frameworks: A data infrastructure should incorporate AI frameworks like TensorFlow, Caffe, Theano, and Torch to enhance and support the present framework. However, the focus should not rely solely on AI frameworks but it should be such that it can fit the requirements and interests of software developers.GPU-friendly environment: To ensure the seamless processing of AI tasks and processes, data infrastructure must support GPU environments having impressive computational power. Microsoft’s N-series GPU instances is an excellent example of thisAI-optimized management environment and tools: The lack of proper management environment and tools for supporting and running AI applications is one of the most significant drawbacks of the present data infrastructures. Hence, it is essential to integrate the right management tools and environment to deliver optimal performance.Machine Reasoning: Machine Reasoning in an integral part of AI environment. Machine reasoning algorithms allow AI environment to keep up with the dynamic trends of infrastructures and technologies, thereby providing meaningful insights into the best course of action.Importance Of Organizational Skills In The Implementation Of AIMerely investing in and leveraging AI technologies isn’t enough. Companies and businesses require a talent pool of professionals who can employ these AI tools in a way that can ensure the best possible results. As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to penetrate industries and businesses across the globe, there’s an increasing need to rethink the entire leadership and thought-process of an organization, right from product strategy and customer experience to finding ways to boost the productivity of human capital. Leaders of the business world have to encourage intelligent AI integration within their system by:Putting People FirstInvesting in AI technologies alone will reap no results. Businesses have to invest in their employees as well proportionately. According to Missy Cummings, Director of Humans & Autonomy Lab, Duke University,“The future of AI is supporting and augmenting human capabilities such that a human-AI team is stronger than either alone.”Cultivating A Work Culture Of LearningBeing a developing field, AI demands constant training and learning to keep up with the innovations and changes it is bringing about today. In the future, AI will bring in new changes in the field of technology and only by encouraging and creating a work environment of constant learning and training can organizations keep up with the innovations of AI.Foster Transparency In Business OperationsOrganizations should strive to maintain and push for transparency in all aspects of their business. Leaders and managers should engage in open communication with employees about their approaches to AI. This will not only help gain their trust and confidence but will also boost their morale and motivate them to work harder.Alain Dehaze, CEO of The Adecco Group, maintains:“Augmented intelligence, blending human input and AI, will be the critical driver to succeed in business and to form a prosperous society. We are on the cusp of technological change unlike any we have seen before in human history. Technological advancement is requiring a deeper focus on innately human skills — critical thinking, emotional intelligence and value judgments.”Having the right data infrastructure along with the proper set of organizational skills can thus, help businesses and organizations leverage artificial intelligence tools and technologies in the right way.",,The Need For Data Infrastructure For Best Utilization Of Artificial Intelligence,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-need-for-data-infrastructure-for-best-utilization-of-artificial-intelligence-72612c1026e0,,2018-06-25T12:46:58.848Z,,['Vivek Kumar'],,,,,,,72612c1026e0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although I am certain that work will change in many ways, either rapidly or slowly, I don’t think all robotization’s impacts will be entirely adverse.Pessimists predict that technological advances will benefit corporations, not workers. The way they see it, robotization in the manufacturing and service sectors will allow companies to lay off people and destroy jobs en masse. I believe artificial intelligence (AI) will create an abundance of new jobs, positions and professional roles.As robotization spreads far and wide, even the most advanced machines will still be defect prone. They will require software updates, and parts and equipment that will have to be manufactured and fitted. Therefore, sooner or later, a great number of robot specialists, who today do not make up even one percent of the workforce, will have to enter the labor market. Certain industries stand to benefit from this process sooner than others; the automotive industry, transport, logistics, electronics, robotics, and renewables. New manufacturers, engineers, maintenance experts and professionals, equipped with novel skills will join the labor force in great numbers, finding jobs in new companies. Studies show that for every robot brought into use, an average of three new jobs will be created.Chatbot Conference 2018Learn from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and More.chatbotslife.comSo, call me a realistic optimist.A modest proposal: The robot taxAs I reviewed the literature on how the labor market may be affected by automation and robotization, I came across an intriguing suggestion by the journalist Ben Tarnoff in The Guardian, “Robots won’t just take our jobs — they’ll make the rich even richer.” Despite the headline, the author is not downbeat about the future. He identifies solutions for mitigating the downsides of robotization, while allowing that new technologies, which may foster substantial societal growth, will also entail threats unless politicians and economists adopt adequate regulations. Critics of today’s technologies forget that no change — especially the kind of change that affects entire job markets — can be undertaken without putting in place proper regulatory and legislative mechanisms. That the technological revolution requires legislative support should be obvious.Without a political remedy, one dire possible future described by Tarnoff imagines the professional and social death of many groups. As technologies are perfected, and human labor accounts for an ever-lower share of the cost of capital creation, companies earn more money, but the benefits do not trickle down to the worker. Rising profits resulting from greater efficiencies are pocketed by investors and business owners without corresponding increases in wages, training, or employee growth opportunities. This process leads to the wealthy isolating themselves in luxurious guarded enclaves, leaving the jobless members of the lower and middle classes to radical resorts, including violent ones. In this bleak scenario, technology becomes a political shaper of dystopia. Is there a political instrument that could prevent this apocalyptic scenario from emerging? Tarnoff believes a robot tax could raise enough revenue to retrain displaced workers and/or supply them with basic income. This is a conclusion arrived at by EU politicians in France, as well as Bill Gates.Trending AI Articles:1. Machines Demonstrate Self-Awareness2. Visual Music & Machine Learning Workshop for Kids3. Part-of-Speech tagging tutorial with the Keras Deep Learning libraryNow, some bad newsAccording to some studies, there is a 50% chance that the devices and machines that rely on artificial intelligence will be able to perform allhuman jobs within the next 45 years, and that every job will be automated within 120 years. Oxford University Professor Michael Osbourne, who specializes in machine learning, believes that machines will replace roughly 47% of our jobs in the next two decades, leaving half the population with nothing to do. In the United States, automation will destroy an estimated 9.1 million jobs by 2025. The estimated number of jobs that potentially may be eliminated in Japan is 55%, 52% in India, 51% in China and 46% in the United States.In my view, these numbers are still too low.Picture 1: Technical automation potential of a global economy varies among countries. Source: McKinsey Global InstituteOf course, discussing the labor market demands a broader perspective to account for the nature of the work performed, worker education, and other factors. That all matters. The data below make it clear that the negative effects of robotization and automation will be felt unequally by profession. Drivers, for example, should worry, given the rapid advances in autonomous vehicle technology. On the other hand, doctors, lawyers and teachers will probably be safe. Indeed, jobs where human interactions, creativity and emotional intelligence matter should not be endangered. Technology may, in fact, offer these professionals tremendous opportunities to enhance their performance.Picture 2: 60% of all occupations have at least 30% technically automatable activities. Source: McKinsey Global InstituteThe learning machine must be taughtAs robotization advances, demand for new technical skills is bound to grow. A very interesting category of new professionals will be trainers responsible for teaching entire AI systems. These professionals will combine the competencies of programmers, psychologists and coaches. Even today, Google employs specialists whose main responsibility is to teach algorithm-based devices to work faster and more efficiently. Such trainers will work with algorithms and neural networks to ensure that they understand and mimic human behavior ever better. Chatbots, i.e. tools posed to dominate the customer service industry, must be trained to interact with humans to make communication natural. That means covering a whole range of behaviors, including human emotions. Algorithms need to be trained to respond appropriately to complications in human lives. For example, if I lose some documents in a robot-run hotel in the middle of nowhere, the first interaction I am going to have will probably be with a chatbot or a physical robot behind the front desk. Its job won’t be just to find my documents; it will be to calm me down, examine the facts, guide me, support me psychologically and refer me to whoever can solve my problem. Interactions with machines are going to be our future. Special trainers will be needed to ensure such interactions are not devoid of human emotions. These trainers will also be employed by corporations producing personal assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa who asks us about our health and how we feel. And, by the way, all this raises doubts about the claim that machines will never be able to experience human emotions and feelings. But that deserves a separate article.Ethicists of a new eraSince early last year, the European Union has been preparing regulations designed to keep consumers safe from the undesirable actions of AI. The new laws (which may take effect this year), are intended to create rules to protect people harmed by devices that rely exclusively on algorithms. The new legislation will also regulate how our personal data may be made available to machines. And, by the way, this development will create demand for new competencies and new jobs. People will be tasked with monitoring chatbot-generated content and robot performance. New ethicists will thus check applications and machines for possible legal complications. They are likely to be in high demand in telecommunications and automated customer support. Even today, ethicists are being hired by Google (a special DeepMind Ethics and Society unit has been set up in London to address a wide range of ethical issues associated with AI). Ethicists will be needed by all companies that rely on robots, bots or virtual assistants to make their products or render their services.Feeding the machinesAll artificial intelligence relies on processing massive amounts of data. Those data need to be delivered to the machines. Facial-recognition devices, for instance, rely on large collections of photographs. One future job will involve gathering data and feeding them to machines and other devices that require large and varied data sets. The demand for data feeders may give rise to a whole new industry that will create jobs in great numbers.Picture 3: Artificial Intelligence and automation will create demand for new jobs. Source: McKinsey analysisTechnology changes everythingWhile I have only offered a few examples, I am confident there is going to be no limit to the demand for new specialists.The voyage toward artificial intelligence is complex. To say that the automation of business processes will inevitably disrupt public order is to argue the obvious, but that’s only half the story. Clearly, claiming that for every job lost to a robot three will be gained ignores the fact that those three will not be suitable for all the workers displaced. What is certain, however, is that AI will create opportunities for millions of people, liberating them from rote work, motivating them to acquire new knowledge, inspiring them to take on new intellectual challenges and enabling them to learn new things. A new technology that helps advance evolution is neither good nor evil; the potential for both is always there. Which way it goes is up to us.Picture 4: Recently published reports key findings on the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on the jobs market.

Benjamin is a genius who may have created a film that’s going to be a cringe classic for years to come. Zone Out has all the makings of one – hilariously bad dialogue, an absolutely bizarre plotline, distorted characters, an ominously sappy soundtrack and, to wrap it all up, just the best demonic robot laughing you’ll ever hear. If you’ve ever wondered what the end of the world will sound like, we’re pretty sure that robotic laughter is it.But there’s something else that’s special about Zone Out that will ensure the timelessness of the film. Benjamin is not a human or a collective. Benjamin is an Artificial Intelligence programme that wrote, performed, directed, scored and edited the entire film.

Zone Out.The idea was the brainchild of Los Angeles-based director Oscar Sharp and Ross Goodwin, a creative technologist at Google. The pair had previously used Benjamin to make another short film, Sunspring  In that film, they used real actors and Benjamin carried much less of the load. This time, they decided to let Benjamin do just about everything.

Sunspring.Sharp told Wired, “What I was really trying to do is attempt to automate each part of the human creative process to see if we learn anything about what it really is to be a human person creating films.”Like the last time, the short film was created as an entry in the Sci-Fi-London 48-Hour Challenge, which demands that the film be produced in 48 hours while adhering to specific prompts. Thus, we get contorted faces, an incoherent story, incomprehensible dialogue like “There must be some business in my compass” and casual exchanges like: “Are you sure you need a problem?” “I’m not certain, I don’t remember the loss of a substance.”Sharp and Goodwin provided Benjamin entire films from the public domain – The Last Man on Earth and The Brain That Wouldn’t Die – to which the programme added faces of the human actors from Sunspring, using face-swapping technology and dialogue using voice-generation technologies. The programme also wrote the screenplay, put together the footage, and created the melancholic piano score.Here’s the behind-the-scenes film of Zone Out.

The agreement was signed on Friday. Seven other companies have already set up their units at the park and are carrying out researches in tandem with IIT-B.According to the statement issued by the institute, the unit will carry out research work on game automation using machine learning and artificial intelligence. “We look forward to its success, and we are expecting quality output from the collaboration,” said Devang Khakhar, the director of IITB.Khakhar added that the institute has started work on a new facility for the research park — a 14-storey building spread over 400,000 sqft. “We expect it to be ready over the next couple of years.”Managing director of Ubisoft India Jean-Phillipe Pieuchot said that they were hoping to forge a strategic partnership with the institute. “It will take time, but the association will reap dividends in the long run,” said Pieuchot.Elaborating on the nature of the collaboration, Pieuchot said that they will be harnessing data scientists, technology and engineering prowess of the institute.Ubisoft said that it is looking to collaborate with other institutions as well but that its relationship with IIT-B remains unique, adding that India is poised to become a global leader in video game production.“The benefits of developing this technology is not just limited to video games but will have implications in other fields as well. For example, VR (virtual reality) was first developed for video games but is used in several other industries now. The same will be applicable for AI (artificial intelligence),” said an official associated with the project.█  According to the statement issued by the institute, the unit will carry out research work on game automation using machine learning and artificial intelligence.

A large number of Americans would jump at the opportunity to do something else for a living. Going through the motions of performing the same tasks every single day of the work week for what feels like an eternity can get pretty boring. These days, we rely on frequent stimulation and tend to lose focus without it.
As businesses and industries count on our manpower to sustain profits and keep growing, human beings are indispensable to the economy. So where would the global conglomerates and multi-national brands be without the power of the common workforce? It is not as if there is an alternative, right?
Wrong. Robot workers are inevitable. If you think that your job is safe as your occupation is not considered manual labor, then you may want to read up on something called Artificial Intelligence (AI)[wiki]. The fact is that AI will almost certainly replace a wide number of roles which are currently filled by humans in the next couple of decades. Jobs such as personal assistants to cab drivers appear likely to be allocated to innovative AI software and pioneering mechanics.
So, before you quit your job and jump into a new profession for the rest of your days, consider these 7 jobs which may be a better bet in the long run.



1. Journalists
OK, so there was that Los Angeles Times article written by AI. For some out there, this passage proves that AI can one day take over the world of journalism:
  “A shallow magnitude 4.7 earthquake was reported Monday morning five miles [8km] from Westwood, California, according to the US Geological Survey. The temblor occurred at 6.25am Pacific time at a depth of 5.0 miles. According to the USGS, the epicenter was six miles from Beverly Hills, California, seven miles from Universal City, California, seven miles from Santa Monica, California, and 348 miles from Sacramento, California. In the past 10 days, there have been no earthquakes magnitude 3.0 and greater centered nearby. This information comes from the USGS Earthquake Notification Service and this post was created by an algorithm written by the author.” 
While this is impressive in any language, it is essentially a clump stats and figures compiled into reports. The act of editorializing information is not something which AI will likely be able to pull off convincingly.
More importantly, a network of information which the human race relies on to formulate opinions and to live by, generated and controlled by AI, is the stuff of nightmares. Objectivity is meant to be the foundation of news. Investigative journalism, challenging the status quo, and pushing for justice against those who have the money to buy their way out of trouble – and to provide the info which holds them in good light – would be a thing of the past.

2. Artists & Photographers
Is it a far stretch to argue that AI could not produce incredibly intricate and detailed artwork? No, it is not. Even the most basic mechanical invention could produce “artwork” deemed interesting enough to be adorned on a wall of a modern art gallery anywhere in the world.
Attach a can of paint to a broom handle, tie it with rope to an old tumble drier, place a canvas on the floor and turn the drier on: you have a piece to compete with many pieces of “art” which currently sell for thousands in hip galleries in the major cities on the globe.
When it comes to fine art and soulful human expression, things become a little more difficult. Can you imagine AI capturing the delicate beauty of photography? It would be highly unlikely for AI to find a way to create anything like the chaotic, bluesy guitar playing of a Jimi Hendrix, or the heartbreaking yet earth-shattering vocals of Chris Cornell. Although Japan is doing its best to make human musicians a thing of the past, humans will always have a place in art.

3. Judges
Once again, we come back to human emotions: empathy and compassion. There are myriad circumstances involved in complex legal matters, and to think of a robotic judge passing down a long custodial sentence in a highly publicized and polarizing civil-rights case could end up in a situation which makes the Watts Riots look like a Sunday morning softball game.
A judge is appointed to their position as a highly educated practitioner of law, and an esteemed member of society. The Judge-O-Bot 5000 is not something which any human would surely fancy their chances of coming up against, innocent or guilty.
To justify the use of AI in a courtroom would invariably lead to questions about the ability of AI software to perform duties which have historically been assigned to the most honorable among us. Being judged by a computer program for an unexplainable, impulsive, (and above all) human action or reaction is unimaginable.
4. Doctors, Psychiatrists, & Dentists
Make no mistake AI has a very important future in medicine and surgery. In an explicitly logical sense, a computer algorithm working alongside body scanners, for example, may be able to identify certain illnesses and ailments which the human brain could crucially miss.
Although this is the case, if you can envisage the robot from Rocky 4 rolling in with a stethoscope around its neck, informing you that you need a double-leg amputation and don’t feel a little weirded out, you may be on your own. Humans are highly unlikely to be pushed out of healthcare altogether.


In fact, roles like doctors and psychiatrists seem pretty safe from the threats of an all-out, AI takeover. This is due to the lack of empathy and understanding of complex human emotions which are vital parts of the role.
In the case of psychologists, it seems unlikely that there would be much demand for a computer program breaking down our complex emotional issues. It would be incredibly strange to act out on advice from an AI psychologist on relationship problems, or the deep-seated resentment of parents and siblings, given that it is essentially a computer program with no concept of human feelings.

5. Priests & Religious Leaders
Spiritual leaders being replaced by Artificial Intelligence? While pretty much every comedian active today would be able to write an hour-long special about this subject alone, there is more chance of Elvis Presley popping up in a Drake video.
The idea is ridiculous enough on paper without fantasizing about all the things which could conceivably go wrong if this were to happen. Imagine the turning up for church every week to be greeted by a mechanical priest, pastor, or imam. Conveying the message that we are all made in the image of the lord would surely lead to some awkward and suspicious glances from the pews.
There is a chance that the robotic man of God could malfunction, tossing chalices and candles into the poor unsuspecting faces of parishioners before combusting into a ball of flames as churchgoers toss holy water…
It’s not going to happen.

6. Teachers
  “A can of WS-40 a day keeps the teacher away…” 
There is scope to suggest that AI will have a massive impact on the classroom in the future. Leaning aids, teacher’s assistants, and other technology seems certain to help the kids of the future pick up their times tables and American history in a different way to millennials.
To suggest that there will be no place for teachers is another thing. Teachers, like judges, doctors, and priests, are important to society for more than their basic job description. There are a number of human qualities which make a great teacher, and, while it is conceivable for a number of AI teacher models to emerge in the coming years, parents are highly unlikely to feel comfortable allowing their offspring to be taught by a computer program. Instead of that, sites like Udemy.com are getting much more popularity for only one reason. Because a human teacher is the creator of each online courses.


That word comes to mind again, “compassion.” These human emotions and interpersonal skills are, for now, impossible to replicate with AI.
7. Athletes
If you want to see the 100 Meters run in 0.7 seconds, robot athletes may be for you. How about a UFC fight between the best AI geared machines from the USA and Japan? Or the Superbowl contested between the Arizona Androids and the Chicago Cyborgs?
It would be boring, though, wouldn’t it? After a while, the novelty would wear off and you would be left with machinery.
The reason humans over the years fell in love with the likes of Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, and Serena Williams was for the different qualities they brought to their respective sports. The pioneering movement, the grace, the determination, grit, unrelenting dedication, and ability to overcome almost impossible boundaries made them seem superhuman. Super-human.

Conclusion: AI doesn’t have all skills like human
These skills and qualities are what make the greats stand out. Factor in their charisma and stellar personalities, while you’re at it. These things are not easily broken down programmable, as if they were, we would surely already know about it.
Oh yeah, and the trash talk would be unbearable.

However, AI is advancing in new ways to help us. From predicting earthquakes to improving cancer diagnoses, here are AI’s latest futuristic advances—plus the one that can help your business right now.So what is Artificial Intelligence (AI), anyway?You already know the Hollywood examples, from HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey to the Borg in Star Trek, and Skynet in the Terminator. But real-life AI isn’t quite that advanced yet (and, fortunately, not as bad-tempered either). AI falls into two basic camps: Strong AI and Weak AI. Strong AI is programming that can mimic the way the human mind works—and it doesn’t exist yet. Weak AI are systems that can behave like humans, but they don’t operate like a human brain. However, there are weak AI systems that are approaching an “in-between” level—ones that are inspired by human reasoning even if they don’t quite work the same way—and that’s where the most exciting research is happening right now.Games and gamblingWhether it’s picking the best horse or breaking records, AI is learning to beat us at our own games:Want to try picking a winning horse at the track? Start off by seeing what everyone else has to say. A “swarm” is a real-time online tool that gathers people to make a decision together. Last May the company Unanimous A.I. created a swarm for the Kentucky Derby. It predicted the exact superfecta, something none of the official Kentucky Derby experts did. The odds? A mind-boggling 540-1.[1]Remember back in 2006 when Deep Blue beat world champion Garry Kasparov at chess? Well, chess is complicated; but the ancient Chinese game Go is way more complicated. And last year AlphaGo, a division of Google’s Deep Mind, faced off with Go world champion Lee Sedol and won. The game relies heavily on intuition, so AlphaGo used learning algorithms to practice by playing against itself.ScienceCan AI help us make scientific breakthroughs on this planet—and others:NASA has developed an AI meant for space exploration that could also save firefighters’ lives. Developed in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, AUDREY (a nickname for Assistant for Understanding Data through Reasoning, Extraction, and sYnthesis), can help firefighters find their way through smoke-filled buildings by tracking their movements. The tech stems from NASA’s work towards exploring hard-to-map space terrain, such as looking for life in the icy ocean of Jupiter’s moon Europa.The ability to accurately predict earthquakes could save countless lives. It’s the goal of a new study that’s using AI to crunch massive amounts of raw data gathered from seismic events and replicate them in a lab setting. By using unaltered data, seismologists hope that the AI can pick up predictive markers that humans haven’t noticed yet. If the research is successful, they might be able to predict quakes within a decade.[2]HealthcareCould it help medical professionals save lives? Researchers are banking on AI:At the Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas, an AI was able to review millions of mammograms at a rate 30 times faster than a person. Incredibly, it had a 99% accuracy in interpreting diagnostic information found in patient charts.[3]  And Stanford researchers are using “deep learning” AI to help spot cancerous moles and detect skin cancer in time to treat it successfully. They eventually hope to make it into an app that people can use at home.Everyone has heard of the potential accidents driverless cars can cause, but one owner used his to get himself to the hospital—and he credits his Tesla with saving his life. A man in Springfield, Missouri started feeling constrictions in his chest—so he turned on his Tesla Autopilot and directed it to take him to the nearest hospital. Turns out he had a pulmonary embolism and got medical care in time to make a full recovery.[4]BusinessEighty-five percent of customer interactions will be handled without a human by 2020.[5]  That’s why chatbots are the most important AI your company can invest in right now:Chatbots come in various forms. Many companies use them purely as a customer service tool to answer simple, common queries that don’t require nuanced interaction; if a bot gets stumped the customer is connected to a live service rep. Other industries, such as finance and travel, have developed more advanced bots that act as full-service assistants, whether it’s offering advice on how to pay off bills or booking a complete trip itinerary.If you’re developing a bot, remember to give it a little personality. (Take Bank of America’s bot, nicknamed “Erica”—a friendly name that riffs off their company’s own name.) It’s good to hire a copywriter to come up with the bot’s turns of phrase so that they sound human. Think of the process as if you were a screenwriter creating a realistic character. If your bot uses any visuals, make sure they’re consistent with your character, too. (No stock images of people wearing headsets!)So don’t fear our robot overlords… yet.

Why We Need to Fine-Tune Our Definition of Artificial Intelligence



By Thomas Hornigold
June 20, 2018 







Sophia’s uncanny-valley face, made of Hanson Robotics’ patented Frubber, is rapidly becoming an iconic image in the field of artificial intelligence. She has been interviewed on shows like 60 Minutes, made a Saudi citizen, and even appeared before the United Nations. Every media appearance sparks comments about how artificial intelligence is going to completely transform the world. This is pretty good PR for a chatbot in a robot suit.
But it’s also riding the hype around artificial intelligence, and more importantly, people’s uncertainty around what constitutes artificial intelligence, what can feasibly be done with it, and how close various milestones may be.
There are various definitions of artificial intelligence.
For example, there’s the cultural idea (from films like Ex Machina, for example) of a machine that has human-level artificial general intelligence. But human-level intelligence or performance is also seen as an important benchmark for those that develop software that aims to mimic narrow aspects of human intelligence, for example, medical diagnostics.
The latter software might be referred to as narrow AI, or weak AI. Weak it may be, but it can still disrupt society and the world of work substantially.
Then there’s the philosophical idea, championed by Ray Kurzweil, Nick Bostrom, and others, of a recursively-improving superintelligent AI that eventually compares to human intelligence in the same way as we outrank bacteria. Such a scenario would clearly change the world in ways that are difficult to imagine and harder to quantify; weighty tomes are devoted to studying how to navigate the perils, pitfalls, and possibilities of this future. The ones by Bostrom and Max Tegmark epitomize this type of thinking.
This, more often than not, is the scenario that Stephen Hawking and various Silicon Valley luminaries have warned about when they view AI as an existential risk.
Those working on superintelligence as a hypothetical future may lament for humanity when people take Sophia seriously. Yet without hype surrounding the achievements of narrow AI in industry, and the immense advances in computational power and algorithmic complexity driven by these achievements, they may not get funding to research AI safety.
Some of those who work on algorithms at the front line find the whole superintelligence debate premature, casting fear and uncertainty over work that has the potential to benefit humanity. Others even call it a dangerous distraction from the very real problems that narrow AI and automation will pose, although few actually work in the field. But even as they attempt to draw this distinction, surely some of their VC funding and share price relies on the idea that if superintelligent AI is possible, and as world-changing as everyone believes it will be, Google might get there first. These dreams may drive people to join them.
Yet the ambiguity is stark. Someone working on, say, MIT Intelligence Quest or Google Brain might be attempting to reach AGI by studying human psychology and learning or animal neuroscience, perhaps attempting to simulate the simple brain of a nematode worm. Another researcher, who we might consider to be “narrow” in focus, trains a neural network to diagnose cancer with higher accuracy than any human.
Where should something like Sophia, a chatbot that flatters to deceive as a general intelligence, sit? Its creator says: “As a hard-core transhumanist I see these as somewhat peripheral transitional questions, which will seem interesting only during a relatively short period of time before AGIs become massively superhuman in intelligence and capability. I am more interested in the use of Sophia as a platform for general intelligence R&D.” This illustrates a further source of confusion: people working in the field disagree about the end goal of their work, how close an AGI might be, and even what artificial intelligence is.
Stanford’s Jerry Kaplan is one of those who lays some of the blame at the feet of AI researchers themselves. “Public discourse about AI has become untethered from reality in part because the field doesn’t have a coherent theory. Without such a theory, people can’t gauge progress in the field, and characterizing advances becomes anyone’s guess.” He would prefer a less mysticism-loaded term like “anthropic computing.” Defining intelligence is difficult enough, but efforts like Stanford’s AI index go some way towards establishing a framework for tracking progress in different fields.
The ambiguity and confusion surrounding AI is part of a broader trend. A combination of marketing hype and the truly impressive pace of technology can cause us to overestimate our own technological capabilities or achievements. In artificial intelligence, which requires highly valued expertise and expensive hardware, the future remains unevenly distributed. For all the hype over renewables in the last 30 years, fossil fuels have declined from providing 88 percent of our energy to 85 percent.
We can underestimate the vulnerabilities. How many people have seen videos of Sophia or Atlas or heard hype about AlphaGo? Okay, now how many know that some neural networks can be fooled by adversarial examples that could be printed out as stickers? Overestimating what technology can do can leave you dangerously dependent on it, or blind to the risks you’re running.
At the same time, there is a very real risk that technological capacities and impacts are underestimated, or missed entirely. Take the recent controversy over social media engineering in the US election: no one can agree over the impact that automated “bots” have had. Refer to these algorithms as “artificial intelligence,” and people will think you’re a conspiracy theorist. Yet they can still have a societal impact.
Those who work on superintelligence argue that development could accelerate rapidly, that we could be in the knee of an exponential curve. Given that the problem they seek to solve (“What should an artificial superintelligence optimize?”) is dangerously close to “What should the mind of God look like?”, they might need all the time they can get.
We urgently need to move away from an artificial dichotomy between techno-hype and techno-fear; oscillating from one to the other is no way to ensure safe advances in technology. We need to communicate with those at the forefront of AI research in an honest, nuanced way and listen to their opinions and arguments, preferably without using a picture of the Terminator in the article.
Those who work with AI and robotics should ensure they don’t mislead the public. We need to ensure that policymakers have the best information possible. Luckily, groups like OpenAI are helping with this.
Algorithms are already reshaping our society; regardless of where you think artificial intelligence is going, a confused response to its promises and perils is no good thing.

The AI Effect on Corporate Economists
⬑ Better business decisions and reimagined roles

Illustration by Thomas HedgerWhen Andrew Chamberlain was hired as the chief economist at the jobs website Glassdoor four years ago, the expectation was that he’d produce reports on the labor market using data from sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as he’d done previously as an academic at the University of California, San Diego.

But in a short period of time, his role at the company—and both the labor market insights he gleans from data and how he does so—has been completely transformed, thanks to the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and techniques.

“Now my job is a combination of data scientist and research economist,” Chamberlain said. “I suddenly had to learn to program, to write Python and SQL code to get data from our databases, and teach myself to think differently about really big, really messy data sets.”

During the past few years, AI has enabled economists to build models using data sets that are more disparate, diverse, and exponentially larger than ever before, vastly increasing their predictive power. As recently as four years ago, Chamberlain said, he published a paper built on 400 survey results—but today, he never uses less than 100,000 and sometimes incorporates as many as a million.

As a result, chief economists at many technology companies and financial services firms have seen their roles reimagined, with new data science skills transforming them into chief analytics officers. The shift has been rewarding not only for economists but also for the companies they work for, leading to increased revenues and better products and services.

“We can make use of tools and capabilities that never existed in the past,” said Martin Fleming, IBM’s chief economist and chief analytics officer—the latter title was added a few years ago. A decade ago, he said, an economist trying to predict retail trends at a specific location would have analyzed data from weather forecasts, the global economic outlook, and socioeconomic statistics from the local census. The resulting predictions would be a “very unsatisfying” 30 to 40 percent accurate.
“We’re using information that was sitting in our database for years; it just took a bit of a push from economists to argue that we should open it up and connect it with the conversation about the labor market.”Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor

But now economists can analyze huge quantities of unstructured data scraped from the web—taking into account minute details like recent tweets and the fact that a hit movie is playing across the street from a retail location—to yield predictions with up to 90 percent accuracy.

Figuring out how to clean and model that data isn’t easy. “This information doesn’t exist in one site—you have to bring it together and create tools to understand it,” Fleming said. “And the complexity is further increased by the large volumes of data that are involved.”

Using constantly improving natural-language processing tools, analysts can convert unstructured data to structured data that can be fed into models created by economists like Fleming. Wesley Phoa, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Capital Group, an asset management firm, said that his company has used machine learning to analyze meeting minutes from the Federal Reserve.

In the past, Phoa and his team would simply read the minutes—they still do—but now they also assign three quantitative scores to each topic covered in a meeting (amount of attention paid to the topic, level of sentiment, and level of uncertainty)—such as banking, inflation, nonfinancial services, and so on—and use that data to compare Federal Reserve meeting minutes going back months and years, providing context and insights.

“You always get a qualitative impression from reading, but it’s helpful to have this quantitative measure as well,” Phoa said. “You get a better understanding of whether they will be inclined to react to something and what’s going to drive the Fed’s decision-making more: incoming information about inflation or wages? Then we can correlate that with information we’re getting from the companies we cover.”

This leap would not have been possible without cloud computing, which provides economists with access to huge quantities of data. “It’s not only the natural-language processing tools but the computing infrastructure in the cloud environment that has made this shift possible,” Fleming said.

The potential for productive innovation is great. At Glassdoor, Chamberlain launched monthly regional pay estimates for 10 metro regions. Called Local Pay Reports, they are generated from a machine-learning model paired with data—such as salary information—that users provide to Glassdoor anonymously. This year he plans to tie that data to job availability so that someone using the site would, for example, be able to get a comprehensive picture of the open jobs and their accompanying salary range across different industries in Seattle.
“Today, because economists are becoming more like data scientists, they are on staff at nearly every technology company.”Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor

“We’re using information that was sitting in our database for years; it just took a bit of a push from economists to argue that we should open it up and connect it with the conversation about the labor market,” Chamberlain said. “Now we see what it can tell us about the job market—things that you don’t get from the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Census.”

Of course, such tools require a talented data scientist who can make sure they’re producing the right conclusions.

“One of the challenges with machine learning is that training can be very fiddly,” Phoa said. “You can come up with lots of spurious relationships.” A general lesson he’s learned is that “it’s hard to find algorithms that are, by themselves, good at predicting things. But if you expand it to, ‘What are good ways of getting insights from the data?,’ there’s a lot more you can do with machine learning.”

The changes are beneficial not only for clients and businesses but also for economists, who are encouraged to constantly reinvest in and improve their skills. As Chamberlain pointed out, AI has vastly expanded economists’ career opportunities.

“Previously, the only places that would hire economists would be banks or consulting companies,” he said. “Today, because economists are becoming more like data scientists, they are on staff at nearly every technology company.”

If anything, Phoa said, AI has made traditional economics training even more important. AI doesn’t overshadow the skills economists learned in school; instead, it augments them.

“There are now much more sophisticated ways to identify and tease out relationships in the data, but you still need the subject-matter foundation,” Phoa said. “It’s important to have folks with a strong economic background making the judgments, asking, ‘When does it make sense?’ ‘What pathways should I follow?’”

As Fleming noted, the transformation has been rapid—and fascinating. “I now find myself spending a great deal of time thinking about the future of work and all its implications,” he said. “It’s more challenging—and more rewarding.”

A. Sue Weisler
 Dhireesha Kudithipudi works with former doctoral student Cory Merkel ’15 (microsystems engineering) in her lab.  


Dhireesha Kudithipudi and Christopher Kanan are professors with different kinds of students. Their classrooms are labs, and the students are high-tech computers they are “teaching to think.”
Kudithipudi, a professor of computer engineering, and Kanan, an assistant professor of imaging science, are part of a growing group of  RIT researchers working in a field broadly known as artificial intelligence, or AI. It’s essentially about building increasingly complex algorithms—the rules that govern their operating systems—so that the machines can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, including making decisions.
Both professors and their colleagues in RIT’s Center for Human-Aware Intelligence believe their research, with multimillions in funding from the National Science Foundation, National Security Administration, Air Force Research Labs and other prominent organizations, could lead to breakthroughs in everything from health care to energy management to cybersecurity.
“There is an exuberance in this field,” said Kudithipudi. “And the work and research we are doing today is to improve human lives tomorrow.”
A new center for AI research
AI at RIT got its start a year ago when more than 200 faculty, students and staff participated in the Move 78 Retreat—a combination conference and strategy meeting. The retreat brought together for the first time individuals teaching and researching AI in classrooms and labs across campus. Move 78 leaders asked the group to focus on three areas:
How RIT will further distinguish itself in new AI discoveries;
A plan to prepare students for the future where some of the skills learned today may be done by a machine tomorrow; and
What RIT will do to augment technology on campus to better fulfill its mission.
The Move78 initiative flourished. Faculty from engineering, computing, business, science and liberal arts developed the Center for Human-Aware Artificial Intelligence to consolidate resources and foster a culture of AI research among faculty and students. There are now more than 40 separate AI-focused courses and numerous faculty-researchers in different tracts: Deep Learning for Vision, Machine Intelligence, Brain-inspired Computing and Big Data Analytics. Work being done at the center builds on national priorities for AI where the economic impact is projected to increase global GDP by nearly $16 trillion by 2030, according to a 2017 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
“It will come as no surprise to those familiar with RIT that we already have quite a robust portfolio regarding AI research and development. Our AI activities have been growing quite rapidly, and that is a trend I am sure will continue for the foreseeable future,” said Ryne Raffaelle, RIT’s vice president of research who helped to establish the new center. “AI is somewhat a natural for us as it brings together a number of our well-established strengths in computing and cyber technology, with things like visual perception, speech recognition, language translation, and decision-making and automation.”   
The center has four focus areas: Brain-Inspired Computing (Kudithipudi’s specialty), Machine Learning and Perception (Kanan’s area of expertise), Automation and Human-Centered AI. Projects will address society’s challenges in the areas of manufacturing, cybersecurity, sustainable systems and energy development, and improved medical care and technology.
 “There is a huge opportunity for researchers in this domain – but the tricky part is that researchers working in this area need to be truly interdisciplinary,” said Kudithipudi, director of the center. Kanan, who teaches in RIT’s Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science, will serve as associate director.
That interdisciplinary work is happening:
Ray Ptucha and Andreas Savakis, assistant professor and professor, respectively, from the computer engineering department in the Kate Gleason College of Engineering, are training computer network systems to recognize images and information toward improving autonomous vehicle technology, and are advancing high tech sensors and imaging technology used in drones, medical devices, security and “smart” facilities, respectively.
Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm, associate professor and computational linguist in RIT’s College of Liberal Arts, is leading the Language Science @RIT initiative. One key area is its spoken language processing which can be used for applications such as speech recognition and speech synthesis. She and Reynold Bailey, associate professor of computer science in the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences, are working together on an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program grant in computational sensing.
A variety of applications of artificial intelligence topics are investigated by professors across the Golisano College, including Reynold Bailey, Matt Huenerfauth, Richard Zanibbi, and Linwei Wang. In collaboration with researchers from RIT’s National Technical Institute for the Deaf, Huenerfauth’s lab is also investigating how automatic speech recognition technology could be used to produce captions automatically for one-on-one or small-group meetings between deaf and hearing participants.
Ferat Sahin and Eli Saber, both professors of electrical engineering, are developing real-time street and traffic sign detection using deep learning, and vehicle detection using LiDAR and RGB imagery, the latter refers to colors used for computer displays. Sahin and his Ph.D. students are working on better human-robot collaboration approaches for industrial robots through intelligent sensing, machine learning techniques and visual feedback.
“There is so much happening that even as a professor it has been insanely hard to keep up. I see this becoming much more interdisciplinary. It’s not just a computing thing anymore. New algorithms can recognize faces better than people can, and these same technologies can be applied to video gaming and robotics. This technology is really moving fast. It has led to a flood of people in the field, including students, and a huge demand in industry,” said Kanan, who is working with Kudithipudi on training neural networks to continually learn and adapt over time once new data and images are integrated.
Building a skilled AI workforce
The research at RIT is also focused on building a workforce skilled in AI.
Kudithipudi’s Neuromorphic AI Laboratory has nearly 20 undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students involved in research she is conducting through grants from DARPA, the National Science Foundation and Air Force Research Labs. Over the past decade, her teams have designed energy efficient, intelligent platforms specific to image perception, pattern recognition and predictive analysis.
“Our lab has a unique strength in this area because we not only design algorithms that are inspired by the brain, but we also build the hardware prototypes that emulate these processes inspired by the brain,” she said. “Brain-inspired computing, also referred to as neuromorphic computing, has been a very important sub-field within AI. Most of the AI algorithms today are designed with performance or accuracy as a target, but neuromorphic computing is part of a unique dimension, and we are trying to deploy these AI algorithms in the most energy efficient ways.”
Recently, Kudithpudi, whose students have gone on to receive doctoral degrees and find careers in companies such as Intel, NASA and Google, was honored with the Digital Rochester Technology Woman of the Year Award. The award was in recognition of her important research in AI and neuromorphic computing, but also for her approach to mentoring students, helping them explore and learn so that they become individuals who can make a difference.
One of those students was James Mnatzaganian, who worked in her lab in the Kate Gleason College of Engineering developing a mathematical framework for hierarchical temporal memory’s spatial pooler—essentially brain-inspired architectures for computing systems. His master’s thesis in this area received top honors at RIT and by the Northeastern Association of Graduate Schools.
“Dr. K encourages her students to think for themselves. She does not assign research topics, but instead requires that students seek out topics, within the relevant domain, to research,” said Mnatzaganian. “I joined the team with the intent of having a strict hardware focus. I left focusing not on hardware, but on algorithms with software implementations. This was a turning point for my career. I realized that I instead wanted to focus on software. She helped direct me to the field that I have since chosen to make my own.”
Today, Mnatzaganian is a senior software engineer with Carbon Black Inc., a big data cyber security firm, where he uses the data science skills he learned to improve the company’s security efficacy.
The center also wants to extend its reach beyond the university.
RIT is training technology managers, scientists and researchers about machine and deep learning during programs led by faculty-researchers from the center. Participants will participate in hands-on exercises to build AI models.
Work with national and international organizations will also expand through the center, and the possibility of new degree programs in each of the research areas is a possibility—and a necessity. With countries investing millions in developing different AI technology, it is important to keep up and surpass competitors. But to Kudithipudi, Kanan and the researchers in the center, new discoveries would be shaped not only by potential economic impact, but by taking into account ethical implications. They are asking the important questions of—what is AI being used for and what can it be used for?
“If you look at where AI stands today, we have a lot of algorithms that are very powerful in a narrow set of tasks,” said Kudithipudi. “People say, ‘If you give me a big enough computer, lots of data and a deep enough network, then you can have super intelligence at your hands.’ The reality is far from it, but there is so much potential. The benefits and future successes of AI will come from several aspects as multiple disciplines—and people—come together to develop new application domains. The success in this field has to be measured by how it can improve human lives, rather than any one, single metric.”

Robotics
Soft robots: The superheroes of tomorrow


Microscopic like a bacterium or soft like a jellyfish, the robots of the future will no longer be stiff emotionless metal monsters. This new generation of machines, biodegradable and capable of interacting with the human body, will help us conquer planets, repair the environment, or cure illnesses.






The above is the tip of the automated iceberg; in the coming years artificial intelligence and robotics are expected to create a wave of displacement right across the job market, from truck drivers and supermarket cashiers to journalists and even CEOs. It’s estimated that 45% of the current workload humans are currently paid to do could be automated by technologies that exist right now. By 2020, 5 million jobs will be lost to artificial intelligence and robotics alone, according to the World Economic Forum. Two-thirds of those losses will land in the office and administrative sectors staffed by the global middle class.
So, are we on the brink of a mass global unemployment? A sift through the historical evidence says no: census data studies show that, over the last 140 years, technology actually created more jobs than it destroyed. During the industrial revolution, mechanization may have displaced laborers – but it also produced new opportunity in an abundance of sectors, from care and creative to technology and business services.
That was because the technology created greater productivity, freeing humans to take up new tasks. In the same way, it is expected artificial intelligence will lead to further waves of innovation, unlocking new job roles and creating resources that allow firms to hire more people into existing positions. An obvious example; we’ll always need people, like BBVA Foundation award winner Geoffrey Hinton, to develop each new machine we use.






Artificial Intelligence
Geoff Hinton: “I’m more concerned about autonomous weapons than about intelligent machines”


Geoffrey Hinton, who just received the BBVA Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Information and Communications Technologies, teaches machines to think like people. His work at University of Toronto and then Google, has been instrumental in the development of a number of applications, including automatic translation system, personal assistants like Siri, driverless systems or medical diagnosis.






Within the financial sector, it is expected AI will help with everything from product definition and customer segmentation to risk management and fraud detection, allowing organisations to make the most of big data, better anticipate change, and evolve as required. Already we’re beginning to see how these algorithms can go beyond human capability to help financial entities extract meaningful patterns from data about markets, partners, employees and customers. The idea is to supplement rather than supplant human capital – these machines are designed to work in tandem with finance professionals, improving their decision-making and helping them get more done.
While hard skills like engineering, coding and social media are all important, the workers who will never fail to remain relevant in the age of the machine are those who can master a set of abilities that are rather more intangible.

















 



Curiosity






Artificial Intelligence
Are robots a threat to jobs?


This question, which has been asked about machines since the age of industrialization and the appearance of assembly lines, was in the headlines again at the latest Davos World Economic Forum. With robot sales growing steadily over the last three years, 2015 was a record year, exceeding 2014 sales by 15%, according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR)






Technology is evolving at breakneck speed. In less than a decade we’ve gone from playing Snake on chunky polyphonic cell phones to streaming 4k movies on iPhones millions of times more powerful than the entirety of NASA’s supercomputers at the time of the first moon landing in 1969.
This pace of change presents a challenge to workers who want to upskill for the new economy. Skills in fashion today might be worthless tomorrow. The key, then, is to always be ready to adapt your talents to each new skill. This requires a high Curiosity Quotient (CQ) – an insatiable appetite for discovery. One cannot simply ‘hop’ from a typical 20th century job into data science or machine learning, but one can learn the principles of both and understand how their talents could be applied in those fields.
For high CQ individuals, learning is the primary constant. Immune to the waves of innovation disrupting their industry, these adaptable and agile survivors love getting their heads around new ideas, ask questions often, and surround themselves with diverse and interesting people. They are not the only ones responsible for their development, however. If you want to survive in the coming employment revolution, getting the right training and education under your belt is critical. The employers of the robot age, therefore, will be hubs for talent development – rather than centers of specialized efficiency – and BBVA is already taking the lead on this front.
We want our people to work at the leading edge. That means driving a powerful learning and development strategy comprised of on-the-job learning, continuous education programmes, and radically decentralized learning and mentoring practices. In doing so, we are helping our workforce re-skill with the times – empowering them to stay one step ahead of the robots in this dynamic 21st-century job market.

In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future.” Eric Hoffer

Creativity
If the creative economy were a country, it would be the fourth largest economic power in the world, with a GDP of $4.3bn (2.5 times the planet’s military expenditure) and a population of 144 million people.






Big Data
The Orange Economy: creativity is a great business


If the economy surrounding creativity were a product, it would have the fifth greatest volume of business in the world. We will explore the potential of the goods and services related to creativity – the so-called Orange Economy.






The ‘Orange Economy,’ as it is also known, is growing rapidly: the UN report that exports of creative goods and services rose 134% between 2002 and 2011. Creativity, it turns out, is something that an algorithm still can’t do. Robots and smart software are best suited to repeatable tasks in stable, calculable environments. The Orange Economy couldn’t be more different. It is the quantum mechanics of industry, a realm where strange things happen and the only constant is unpredictability. Crucially, innovation and creativity are no longer confined to the Orange Economy. Employers in an increasing number of sectors, from banking and finance to healthcare and sports, are parachuting creative individuals into their workforces. Whether as an inspirational jolt in R&D teams or a visionary force in product design, creative-thinking is in high demand: it provides the ingenious problem-solving, knowledge-leaps and technological breakthroughs that businesses need to survive in today’s highly disruptive marketplace.
Don’t worry if that doesn’t sound like you. Everyone has the aptitude to be creative. It is actually a very simple process; the combining of ideas and principles from different fields to create something new. Take Airbnb. At its core, the business is essentially a collision of the hotel and the smartphone. The founders’ key innovation was not product, or magic; it was to be the first to apply the principle of the sharing economy to the hospitality industry. Think about your own workplace; how could you use technology to do what you already do, better? Already, you have begun thinking creatively. Today, and increasingly in the coming years, employers will be thankful you developed the aptitude to do so.
Emotional intelligence
Surrounded by so much technology, spending our days moving from screen to screen, it is easy to overlook the power of the human touch.
But the more predominant machines become, the more people will crave personal, real-world experiences and connections. In 2013, Lisa Messenger launched Collective Hub as a print magazine, going against everything that was happening in the publishing space at the time.

""My journey” she says, “is actually a good example of how to behave when everything is becoming robotic: bring it back to that human element. That's the way you'll really get to break through and get the point of difference and, eventually, success.""
The reality is humans will always be better than robots at being human. Robot hotels might sound cool, but the novelty wears off quick. So, developing your emotional quotient (EQ) is just as important as bolstering the quotients of the two C’s – creativity and curiosity. EQ is the power to discriminate between different feelings, to label them appropriately, and to use the emotional information you gather to guide your thinking and behavior. Ultimately, building the capability to recognize and adapt to other people’s emotions – as well as your own – will put you far ahead of any robot that could be built in the next 200 years.

Singapore bank DBS is using artificial intelligence (AI) to screen applicants for wealth management jobs, with the aim of saving 40 man-hours a month.







The bank is currently hiring managers for its growing wealth planning business and is using a platform to automate pre-screening.
The platform, known as Jim (Jobs Intelligence Maestro), has been in pilot since April. It supports staff in reviewing CVs, collecting responses to pre-screening questions and conducting psychometric tests.
The platform gives recruiters more time to find candidates and interview them, as well as freeing up time to allow them to do more valuable work. Candidate can get real-time interaction with the recruitment platform 24 hours a day.
“Previously manual processes, such as posting screening questions, conducting psychometric assessments and tests, have now been fully automated.,” said James Loo, head of talent acquisition group at DBS. “This frees up our recruiters’ time so they can take on higher-value work.”  The system also overcomes the problem of scheduling interactions with busy candidates. “Our candidates are often busy during the day, and many of our recruiters end up working long hours to cater to their schedules,” said Loo.
The Jim platform, which was created by Singapore startup Impress.AI alongside DBS’s talent acquisition team, will learn to make better assessments of candidates as it goes on.

One job applicant praised the bank’s use of technology to automate parts of its recruitment process. “DBS’s recruitment process demonstrates that it is serious about investing in technology to attract new talent, and will have the tools and resources necessary to help me serve my clients better,” said job applicant Brandon Goon. “This is very impressive, and it has made me more excited to join the bank.”  DBS will now roll out the system for recruiting wealth planning managers in its main markets of Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and India. It will also be used for other high-volume roles, such as the bank’s management associate and graduate associate programmes, where more than 7,000 candidates can apply for 20 just roles.

June 20, 2018

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, New America and the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Initiative (AI Initiative), a project of MIT’s Media Lab and Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center, formed a new partnership to strengthen international understanding of Chinese artificial intelligence policies and developments.The AI Initiative will contribute $250,000 to support the work of New America’s DigiChina project, a collaborative effort to translate, analyze, and contextualize Chinese digital policy developments.New America President and CEO Anne-Marie Slaughter said:“Understanding dramatic developments in artificial intelligence and other technologies is essential to New America's mission to renew America for the 21st century. Not all of that new technology will be created in the United States, so understanding China’s technology policy and development efforts will be critical. Yet the language barrier and unique characteristics of China’s system make it difficult for the international community to take important developments into account. Along with Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center and the MIT Media Lab, New America's DigiChina team will have an opportunity to build on its early success in broadening discussions and understanding of Chinese AI and digital policy.”DigiChina, which published its first work in July 2017, emerged organically from a group of scholars and analysts on technology in China and has so far published translations and analysis by 12 scholars from 10 different organizations. AI Initiative Executive Director Tim Hwang said:“Translation is powerful. DigiChina has been doing crucial work to open China’s AI and machine learning policy discourse to an international readership. We believe an accurate understanding of trends in China is critical for productive conversations on the international development of AI, and we are excited to be taking this forward in partnership with New America.”In 2017, DigiChina published the first complete English-language translation of China’s New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, which lays out ambitions for AI development and policy stretching to 2030. See below for links to other work so far on AI-related issues.DigiChina Coordinating Editor Graham Webster said:“With China home to so much of the world’s development and deployment of AI technologies, global efforts to address ethics and policies surrounding AI have to reckon with what’s going on in China’s policy world. The choices Chinese regulators and companies make on AI-related policies, from personal privacy to national security, will have effects in tech and policy communities worldwide.”Links to DigiChina’s AI-focused work so far:China’s Plan to ‘Lead’ in AI: Purpose, Prospects, and Problems (including a full translation of China’s “New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan”)Translation: Chinese government outlines AI ambitions through 2020From Riding a Wave to Full Steam Ahead: As China’s Government Mobilizes for AI Leadership, Some Challenges Will Be Tougher Than OthersChinese Interests Take a Big Seat at the AI Governance Table: Government and Industry Team to Shape Emerging AI Standards-Setting ProcessTranslation: Excerpts from China’s ‘White Paper on Artificial Intelligence Standardization’About the AI Initiative:  The Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative is a hybrid research effort and philanthropic fund that seeks to ensure that technologies of automation and machine learning are researched, developed, and deployed in a way which vindicate social values of fairness, human autonomy, and justice. The Initiative is a joint project of the MIT Media Lab and the Harvard Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. It incubates a range of research, prototyping, and advocacy activities within these two anchor institutions and across the broader ecosystem of civil society.

How the Chinese state and society deploy and use digital technologies is increasingly consequential for governance, markets, and security around the world. From laws and regulations to published commentaries from policymakers and corporate strategies, China’s public sphere provides a great deal of insight into what’s happening and why. DigiChina contributors, working collaboratively with industry and policy experts around the globe, work innovatively to bring that insight to an international audience and better inform important debates and decisions.

Artificial Intelligence is a hot topics among leaders in most companies these days. There seems to be a fierce race towards getting ahead of the game without many people asking why? Some of the most common arguments for using artificial intelligence is that it reduces or eliminates human errors. But have we thought about the side effects? Why are we humans so eager to make ourselves redundant? Is it really the only thing we live for - being effective? In Gugin we have seen an increasing number of requests from clients around the world, who are concerned about how their organisations are responding to the introduction of artificial intelligence in various areas. These concerns make a lot of sense to us as corporate culture consultants because there are a number of unresolved issues.



A lot of people fear that artificial intelligence will make them redundant. We know that a lot of entry-level jobs in law firms and auditing companies have already disappeared. How will it affect the company culture, when the hero is no longer a person but a computer? It might sound irrelevant, but we need heroes in all cultures - also in corporate cultures. How do we tackle situations where highly esteemed senior employees are overruled by a computer. How does artificial intelligence influence people's level of motivation? We know from some preliminary research we have conducted in Gugin Research Unit that it has a negative effect. ""Why should I work hard to become better when I - in the end will lose to a computer""? Artificial intelligence elevates the stress level in the organisation. That leads to de-motivated employees, more sick leave and lower productivity. The Artificial Intelligence area is developing very fast. We know very little about the impact it has on us humans, the groups and cultures we belong to. And there are all the ethical questions I won't touch in this article despite they take the most time when I am doing speeches on this topicDoes it really matter that we destroy the old company culture?Yes it does! A culture - any culture - has some very unique functions. It gives us a reason for being. Having something together with other people is crucial for our well-being. We trust people from the same culture more than people from other cultures. We define ourselves by the cultures we belong to. If you ask a person at an even what he or she is doing it is very likely he or she will tell you what he or she does professionally. That is because the job mean a lot to him or her. We respect the hierarchy in the cultures we are members of, because they are perceived fair in that particular cultural setting.Artificial will most likely change thatPeople who are very excited about artificial intelligence often use the word ""disruption"". But what might happen is actually destruction from which there is no way back.Reason for being, which comes from the French ""raison d'être"" is defined as ""the sole or ultimate purpose of something or someone"". If we lose that and we give up we will give all the power to the robots, augmented reality and artificial intelligence. And at that time it has become really intelligent. So intelligent that it may conclude that we, the human are no more than a liability and must be eradicated.If we don't want that to happen we have the become far more critical than we are today and don't leave the decisions with the people who only see the technological possibilities.In Gugin we already see the first signs among some of our clients that it has already gone too far too fast.

Microsoft employees posted an open letter on Tuesday protesting the software maker’s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Credit...Stuart Isett for The New York TimesBy Sheera FrenkelJune 19, 2018SAN FRANCISCO — In an open letter posted to Microsoft’s internal message board on Tuesday, more than 100 employees protested the software maker’s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and asked the company to stop working with the agency, which has been separating migrant parents and their children at the border with Mexico.“We believe that Microsoft must take an ethical stand, and put children and families above profits,” said the letter, which was addressed to the chief executive, Satya Nadella. The letter pointed to a $19.4 million contract that Microsoft has with ICE for processing data and artificial intelligence capabilities.Calling the separation of families “inhumane,” the employees added: “As the people who build the technologies that Microsoft profits from, we refuse to be complicit. We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.”The letter is part of a wave of tech workers mobilizing this week against the Trump administration’s new “zero tolerance” policy that refers for criminal prosecution all immigrants apprehended crossing the border without authorization. The policy has resulted in about 2,000 children being separated from their migrant parents, raising a bipartisan outcry.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt Silicon Valley companies including Google, Apple and Facebook, employees have in recent days circulated internal emails asking for donations to nonprofit groups that support immigrants. Many have shared information about protests in San Francisco and Washington. And some of the workers have spoken to their managers about the issue or called on internal message boards for their chief executives to respond.The activity has had an effect. Late on Tuesday, after Microsoft’s employee letter went up, the company released a memo from Mr. Nadella in which he called the immigration policy “cruel and abusive” and said Microsoft was not working with the federal government on any projects to separate families. Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, also published a blog post titled, “The Country Needs to Get Immigration Right.”Their comments came after other tech chief executives spoke up on Tuesday. Apple’s chief, Timothy D. Cook, in an interview with The Irish Times, called the immigration policy “heartbreaking.” Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, tweeted that he was a “top donor” to the American Civil Liberties Union and said that “if there is some way for me to help these kids I will do so.” Sundar Pichai of Google, Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber and Chuck Robbins of Cisco also tweeted their opposition to the policy.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImagePresident Trump with Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, center, and Amazon’s chief, Jeff Bezos, last year.Credit...Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesOn Facebook, two former employees of the social network started a fund-raiser on Saturday to collect $1,500 for migrants who needed legal assistance because of the new policy. By Tuesday afternoon, the effort had garnered more than $5 million from donors who included numerous tech workers, according to a spokeswoman for the fund-raising drive.Among the donors were Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, a Facebook spokesman said. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg called for more donations and said the policy of splitting up immigrant children from their families needed to be stopped. Ms. Sandberg, in her own Facebook post, called the cries of the children taken from their parents “unbearable” and added that the practice “needs to end now.”The activity by tech workers is reminiscent of  protests in January 2017 when many Silicon Valley employees were up in arms over an executive order from President Trump that suspended immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries. At the time, Google employees held rallies to object; Amazon and Expedia were among the companies that filed in court to stop the order. (Many tech companies comprise workers who are first-generation immigrants or who grew up in immigrant families.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSince then, tech workers have watched their companies increasingly come under scrutiny for their moral and ethical behavior. Many tech employees have begun organizing against actions by their own companies — in April, for example, thousands of Google employees signed a letter protesting the company’s involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence in weaponry.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/3:03-0:00transcriptWhere Trump’s ‘Zero Tolerance’ Immigration Policy BeganPresidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both increased enforcement on the U.S.-Mexico border. Here is how their approaches differed from the Trump administration.This image has become a powerful representation of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration: a 2-year old girl sobbing, as U.S. border patrol agents searched her mother. “If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you as required by law.” The Trump White House’s tactic of systematically separating migrant families is a dramatic shift. There have been cases of families being separated under the previous two administrations. But it’s always been the exception, not the rule. That said, Trump’s crackdowns are happening against the backdrop of more than a decade of stepped-up enforcement at the Southern border. In 2005, President George W. Bush launched “Operation Streamline” along the Texas border. He was responding to a spike in apprehensions there. The program called for criminally prosecuting all migrants. “We’re going to get control of our borders. We’re making this country safer for all our citizens.” The idea of zero tolerance took root under Bush, and it’s what Trump has used to model his policy after. The Bush-era program meant that migrants who were caught in certain border states were put through the criminal system, not civil immigration courts. It made exceptions for adults traveling with children, but others were ushered through mass trials aimed at deporting them quickly. It’s a practice that’s still around today. “One of the things we committed to do was end ‘catch and release’ by the end of fiscal year 2006.” Under this policy, migrants were held until their deportation hearing. And that meant an increase in beds at private detention centers. In 2014, President Barack Obama declared a crisis at the Southwest border after a surge of unaccompanied minors, mostly from Central America. “We now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the border that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all.” During that child migrant crisis, the Obama administration also focused on deporting people quickly and put some through criminal proceedings. But it chose to hold families together in administrative, not criminal detention. The Obama administration also set up makeshift overflow facilities. And we saw similar images back then, of adults and children behind chain-link fences draped in thermal blankets. Now, Trump is reportedly taking it a step further and considering makeshift tent cities to detain minors caught at the border. The Trump administration says it’s now merely enforcing the letter of the law. But images of children in detention have made it hard to sell it in political terms, and humanitarian ones, too.

Where Trump’s ‘Zero Tolerance’ Immigration Policy Began3:04Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both increased enforcement on the U.S.-Mexico border. Here is how their approaches differed from the Trump administration.CreditCredit...Mike Blake/ReutersOn Monday, the A.C.L.U. also demanded that Amazon stop selling a facial recognition software tool, called Rekognition, to police and other government entities because it feared it could be used to unfairly target immigrants. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., publicly promoted its work with ICE in January in a blog post, citing it as an example of the success of its technology.At the same time, Microsoft has been positioning itself as tech’s moral leader. Mr. Nadella and Mr. Smith have publicly said they want to protect user privacy and establish ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,” Mr. Nadella said at Microsoft’s developer conference last month.ImageTech employees have circulated calls for protests of the immigration policy. The policy has spurred rallies, including in Los Angeles.Credit...Mario Tama/Getty ImagesSome Microsoft executives earlier objected to the Trump administration’s new immigration policy. On Sunday, Mr. Smith penned a LinkedIn post, saying the news of migrant children being taken from their families was “especially poignant.”Yet criticism of Microsoft’s work with ICE began to grow. One Microsoft engineer, Larry Osterman, tweeted on Monday to ask how working with ICE matched with the company’s “ethical stances.”Mat Marquis, an independent developer who works with Microsoft, also said in a tweet on Monday that he no longer planned to work with the company because of its ICE contract. When he receives his last payment from Microsoft, he said, he plans to donate the money to a group providing support to families that had been separated at the border.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLate Monday, Microsoft issued a statement saying that it was not working with federal agencies to separate children from their families at the border and that it was not aware of its services or products being used for that purpose. It also said it was “dismayed” by the immigration policy and urged that it be changed.But for many Microsoft employees, that was not satisfactory. A group of about a dozen employees began working together to draft the protest letter, in which they said the company’s statement “does not go far enough.”The employees continued, “We are providing the technical undergirding in support of an agency that is actively enforcing this inhumane policy.”The letter added that Microsoft should not only cancel its contract with ICE but be open to a review of its contracts with government agencies domestically and internationally, and that it should create a policy stating it would not work with those “who violate international human rights law.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMicrosoft declined to comment on the employee letter, which was posted internally on Tuesday afternoon. Within hours, it had received more than 100 signatures.It was only later that the messages from Mr. Nadella and Mr. Smith decrying the immigration policy were released. “We will always stand for immigration policies that preserve every person’s dignity and human rights,” Mr. Nadella said.Follow Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @sheeraf.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.

If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you as required by law.” The Trump White House’s tactic of systematically separating migrant families is a dramatic shift. There have been cases of families being separated under the previous two administrations. But it’s always been the exception, not the rule. That said, Trump’s crackdowns are happening against the backdrop of more than a decade of stepped-up enforcement at the Southern border. In 2005, President George W. Bush launched “Operation Streamline” along the Texas border. He was responding to a spike in apprehensions there. The program called for criminally prosecuting all migrants. “We’re going to get control of our borders. We’re making this country safer for all our citizens.” The idea of zero tolerance took root under Bush, and it’s what Trump has used to model his policy after. The Bush-era program meant that migrants who were caught in certain border states were put through the criminal system, not civil immigration courts. It made exceptions for adults traveling with children, but others were ushered through mass trials aimed at deporting them quickly. It’s a practice that’s still around today. “One of the things we committed to do was end ‘catch and release’ by the end of fiscal year 2006.” Under this policy, migrants were held until their deportation hearing. And that meant an increase in beds at private detention centers. In 2014, President Barack Obama declared a crisis at the Southwest border after a surge of unaccompanied minors, mostly from Central America. “We now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the border that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all.” During that child migrant crisis, the Obama administration also focused on deporting people quickly and put some through criminal proceedings. But it chose to hold families together in administrative, not criminal detention. The Obama administration also set up makeshift overflow facilities. And we saw similar images back then, of adults and children behind chain-link fences draped in thermal blankets. Now, Trump is reportedly taking it a step further and considering makeshift tent cities to detain minors caught at the border. The Trump administration says it’s now merely enforcing the letter of the law. But images of children in detention have made it hard to sell it in political terms, and humanitarian ones, too.",PT3M3.917S,,,,,,,,

Getting robots to do things isn’t easy: Usually, scientists have to either explicitly program them or get them to understand how humans communicate via language.
But what if we could control robots more intuitively, using just hand gestures and brainwaves?
A new system spearheaded by researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) aims to do exactly that, allowing users to instantly correct robot mistakes with nothing more than brain signals and the flick of a finger.
Building off the team’s past work focused on simple binary-choice activities, the new work expands the scope to multiple-choice tasks, opening up new possibilities for how human workers could manage teams of robots.
By monitoring brain activity, the system can detect in real-time if a person notices an error as a robot does a task. Using an interface that measures muscle activity, the person can then make hand gestures to scroll through and select the correct option for the robot to execute.

The team demonstrated the system on a task in which a robot moves a power drill to one of three possible targets on the body of a mock plane. Importantly, they showed that the system works on people it’s never seen before, meaning that organizations could deploy it in real-world settings without needing to train it on users.
“This work combining EEG and EMG feedback enables natural human-robot interactions for a broader set of applications than we've been able to do before using only EEG feedback,” says CSAIL Director Daniela Rus, who supervised the work. “By including muscle feedback, we can use gestures to command the robot spatially, with much more nuance and specificity.”
PhD candidate Joseph DelPreto was lead author on a paper about the project alongside Rus, former CSAIL postdoc Andres F. Salazar-Gomez, former CSAIL research scientist Stephanie Gil, research scholar Ramin M. Hasani, and Boston University Professor Frank H. Guenther. The paper will be presented at the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference taking place in Pittsburgh next week.In most previous work, systems could generally only recognize brain signals when people trained themselves to “think” in very specific but arbitrary ways and when the system was trained on such signals. For instance, a human operator might have to look at different light displays that correspond to different robot tasks during a training session.
Not surprisingly, such approaches are difficult for people to handle reliably, especially if they work in fields like construction or navigation that already require intense concentration.
Meanwhile, Rus’ team harnessed the power of brain signals called “error-related potentials” (ErrPs), which researchers have found to naturally occur when people notice mistakes. If there’s an ErrP, the system stops so the user can correct it; if not, it carries on.
“What’s great about this approach is that there’s no need to train users to think in a prescribed way,” says DelPreto. “The machine adapts to you, and not the other way around.”
For the project the team used “Baxter,” a humanoid robot from Rethink Robotics. With human supervision, the robot went from choosing the correct target 70 percent of the time to more than 97 percent of the time.
To create the system the team harnessed the power of electroencephalography (EEG) for brain activity and electromyography (EMG) for muscle activity, putting a series of electrodes on the users’ scalp and forearm.
Both metrics have some individual shortcomings: EEG signals are not always reliably detectable, while EMG signals can sometimes be difficult to map to motions that are any more specific than “move left or right.” Merging the two, however, allows for more robust bio-sensing and makes it possible for the system to work on new users without training.
“By looking at both muscle and brain signals, we can start to pick up on a person's natural gestures along with their snap decisions about whether something is going wrong,” says DelPreto. “This helps make communicating with a robot more like communicating with another person.”
The team says that they could imagine the system one day being useful for the elderly, or workers with language disorders or limited mobility.
“We’d like to move away from a world where people have to adapt to the constraints of machines,” says Rus. “Approaches like this show that it’s very much possible to develop robotic systems that are a more natural and intuitive extension of us.”

The idea is to create an interface that acts like an extension of a person’s will, without any training or learning any mental commands. CSAIL director and project supervisor Daniella Rus says in a statement that the goal is to “move away from a world where people have to adapt to the constraints of machines . . . to develop robotic systems that are a more natural and intuitive extension of us.”

This isn’t the first time scientists have tried to control robots with brainwaves, but older systems failed when it came to accuracy. For example, past research required the person to learn and practice each new command–for example, you’d have to mentally associate a graphic pattern with a robotic command like “go to the left” or “go to the right.” It was the equivalent of asking a person to learn a new language. And even when you did, you would have to think really hard on that graphic pattern to get the robot to execute the command based on the EEG patterns generated by your brain, recorded via electrodes placed on your scalp. All that mental effort still had a low effectivity rate, with only 70% accuracy. “Such approaches are difficult for people to handle reliably, especially if they work in fields like construction or navigation that already require intense concentration,” the authors point out.The new work avoids those pitfalls by combining the EEG with something called electromyography, or EMG. It’s a technique that monitors the electrical activity of your skeletal muscles–in this case, on your arm. This hybrid method lets the person communicate with the robot both by thinking and gesturing, making it much more efficient to control. According to co-lead author Joseph DelPreto, who developed the work alongside Rus, former CSAIL postdoctoral associate Andres F. Salazar-Gomez, former CSAIL research scientist Stephanie Gil, research scholar Ramin M. Hasani, and Boston University professor Frank H. Guenther, it’s “more like communicating with another person.”[Photo: MIT CSAIL]The team demonstrated using a humanoid robot called Baxter manufactured by Boston-based Rethink Robotics. The person–the robot’s director–was connected to a computer controlling Baxter with scalp electrodes to monitor EEG activity and electrodes on their forearm to monitor EMG activity.Baxter was equipped with a power drill and given a task–to reach three drilling targets on a mock-up of a plane fuselage. Baxter, without any training, would select a target and go for it. If the person noticed that it had selected the wrong drilling location, they would simply think about it in order to stop Baxter, and then gesture, gently, to the correct hole. In the process, Baxter learns what kind of brain and muscle electrical activity correspond to that target. In other words, as DelPreto explains, it’s the robot that learns from the way the user thinks rather than the user having to learn the robot’s language.The system also monitors something called error-related potentials–a type of brain signal that occurs naturally when we detect a mistake. If such a signal occurs, Baxter stops so its human pilot can correct the mistake with a quick gesture.The difference between the success rates of the old EEG-based system and the new hybrid method was more than significant. The accuracy went from 70% to 97%, almost perfect and without training. That’s a huge success differential, and a giant step toward a future in which the user interface disappears in favor of simply thinking. The MIT team imagines that one day this type of technology could be “useful for the elderly, or workers with language disorders or limited mobility.” Also, giant manga robots.Recognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards!

Artificial Intelligence Labs Opened by Tencent
In 2016, Tencent opened an AI lab in Shenzhen with a vision to “Make AI Everywhere.” Its focus is on research in machine learning, speech recognition, natural language processing and computer vision and to develop practical AI applications for business in the areas of content, online games, social and cloud services. The AI team behind the scenes is composed of 50 research scientists and more than 200 engineers in China and the United States.
PROMOTED
Tencent’s YouTu Lab is a leader in the field of machine learning. It’s credited with dozens of leading technologies in image, face and audio analysis. The innovative output from the YouTu Lab is integrating AI technology into cloud services, intelligent hardware and more to improve the surfing experience of the internet.






Tencent has opened up a new lab in Bellevue, Wash. and Dr. Dong Yu, a former Microsoft employee who is well-known for his work with speech recognition technologies leads the lab. The lab leverages the talented Seattle-area workforce who are primarily focused on natural language processing and speech recognition systems. The company has the finances to compete for top AI talent and the data acquisition to help train AI algorithms.
Tencent’s Artificial Intelligence Priorities
As part of the quad of companies that were identified by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology to develop the next generation of AI technologies, Tencent is forging ahead with new tech investments, research and development.

Tencent is a top investor (reported to be $120 million) in robotics start-up UBTech, a firm that focuses on humanoid robots. Quite possibly UBTech’s most famous contribution is Walker, a bipedal robot unveiled at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show that can walk downstairs. Of the Chinese tech firms known collectively as BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent), Tencent participated in the greatest number of AI equity deals and made the most AI investments in the United States.
In partnership with several industry players including the Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC), Tencent is invested in developing AI technologies to be used in autonomous-driving vehicles.
Healthcare AI is a main priority for Tencent, based on the company’s investments and AI partnerships. China would like to be a world leader in personalized medicine using AI. More than 38,000 medical institutions have a WeChat account and 60% of those institutions allow patients to book appointments online. Additionally, there are 2,000 hospitals that accept WeChat payment. These services allow Tencent to collect valuable consumer data that helps train AI algorithms. In a recent partnership with Babylon Health, WeChat users will have access to a virtual healthcare assistant. Pushing the envelope even further, Tencent invested in iCarbonX, a company that aims to develop a digital representation of individuals to help perfect personalized medicine.
Tencent’s internal R&D efforts resulted in the development of the Miying healthcare AI platform that launched in 2017. This platform helps healthcare professionals diagnose various types of cancers and analyze and manage healthcare records. The company also has some recent investments in pharmaceutical projects.
Tencent is a critical player in China’s ambition to be a world-leader for artificial intelligence. Since AI is expected to transform all kinds of industries, we can also expect the footprint and AI investment by Tencent will only increase as well.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & PermissionsThe video player is currently playing an ad.

Many of the company’s top A.I. researchers, in particular, worried that the contract was the first step toward using the nascent technology in advanced weapons.But it is not unusual for Silicon Valley’s big companies to have deep military ties. And the internal dissent over Maven stands in contrast to Google’s biggest competitors for selling cloud-computing services — Amazon.com and Microsoft — which have aggressively pursued Pentagon contracts without pushback from their employees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle’s self-image is different — it once had a motto of “don’t be evil.” A number of its top technical talent said the internet company was betraying its idealistic principles, even as its business-minded officials worried that the protests would damage its chances to secure more business from the Defense Department.About 4,000 Google employees signed a petition demanding “a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.” A handful of employees also resigned in protest, while some were openly advocating the company to cancel the Maven contract.Months before it became public, senior Google officials were worried about how the Maven contract would be perceived inside and outside the company, The New York Times reported this week. By courting business with the Pentagon, they risked angering a number of the company’s highly regarded A.I. researchers, who had vowed that their work would not become militarized.Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, had reached out to tech companies and sought their support and cooperation as the Pentagon makes artificial intelligence a centerpiece of its weapons strategy. The decision made by Google on Friday is a setback to that outreach.But if Google drops out of some or all of the competition to sell the software that will guide future weaponry, the Pentagon is likely to find plenty of other companies happy to take the lucrative business. A Defense Department spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment on Friday.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. Greene’s comments were reported earlier by Gizmodo.The money for Google in the Project Maven contract was never large by the standards of a company with revenue of $110 billion last year — $9 million, one official told employees, or a possible $15 million over 18 months, according to an internal email.But some company officials saw it as an opening to much greater revenue down the road. In an email last September, a Google official in Washington told colleagues she expected Maven to grow into a $250 million-a-year project, and eventually it could have helped open the door to contracts worth far more; notably a multiyear, multibillion-dollar cloud computing project called JEDI, or Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure.Whether Google’s Maven decision is a short-term reaction to employee protests and adverse news coverage or reflects a more sweeping strategy not to pursue military work is unclear. The question of whether a particular contract contributes to warfare does not always have a simple answer.When the Maven work came under fire inside Google, company officials asserted that it was not “offensive” in nature. But Maven is using the company’s artificial intelligence software to improve the sorting and analysis of imagery from drones, and some drones rely on such analysis to identify human targets for lethal missile shots.Google management had told employees that it would produce a set of principles to guide its choices in the use of artificial intelligence for defense and intelligence contracting. At Friday’s meeting, Ms. Greene said the company was expected to announce those guidelines next week.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle has already said that the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of A.I. in weaponry. But it was unclear how such a prohibition would be applied in practice and whether it would affect Google’s pursuit of the JEDI contract.Defense Department officials are themselves wrestling with the complexity of their move into cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Critics have questioned the proposal to give the entire JEDI contract, which could extend for 10 years, to a single vendor. This week, officials announced they were slowing the contracting process down.Dana White, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said this week that the JEDI contract had drawn “incredible interest” and more than 1,000 responses to a draft request for proposals. But she said officials wanted to take their time.”So, we are working on it, but it’s important that we don’t rush toward failure,” Ms. White said. “This is different for us. We have a lot more players in it. This is something different from some of our other acquisition programs because we do have a great deal of commercial interest.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. Greene said the company probably would not have sought the Maven work if company officials had anticipated the criticism, according to notes on Ms. Greene’s remarks taken by a Google employee and shared with The Times.Another person who watched the meeting added that Ms. Greene said Maven had been “terrible for Google” and that the decision to pursue the contract was done when Google was more aggressively going after military work.Google does other, more innocuous business with the Pentagon, including military advertising on Google properties and Google’s ad platform, as well as providing web apps like email.Meredith Whittaker, a Google A.I. researcher who was openly critical of the Maven work, wrote on Twitter  that she was “incredibly happy about this decision, and have a deep respect for the many people who worked and risked to make it happen. Google should not be in the business of war.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEven though the internal protest has carried on for months, there was no indication that employee criticism of the deal was dying down.Earlier this week, one Google engineer — on the company’s internal message boards — proposed the idea of employees protesting Google Cloud’s conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco in July with a campaign called “Occupy Moscone Center,” fashioned after the Occupy Wall Street protests.That engineer resigned from the company this week in protest of Maven and planned for Friday to be his last day. But he said he was told on Friday morning to leave immediately, according to an email viewed by The Times.Peter W. Singer, who studies war and technology at New America, a Washington research group, said many of the tools the Pentagon was seeking were “neither inherently military nor inherently civilian.” He added, “This is not cannons and ballistic missiles.” The same software that speeds through video shot with armed drones can be used to study customers in fast-food restaurants or movements on a factory floor.Mr. Singer also said he thought Google employees who denounced Maven were somewhat naïve, because Google’s search engine and the video platform of its YouTube division have been used for years by warriors of many countries, as well as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.“They may want to act like they’re not in the business of war, but the business of war long ago came to them,” said Mr. Singer, author of a book examining such issues called “LikeWar,” scheduled for publication in the fall.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka.

Artificial Intelligence Can Identify Wildlife as Accurately as Humans


Motion-sensor cameras are increasingly being used to track wildlife across the globe, from tigers in India to aardvarks in Africa. But combing through the millions of images captured by these systems is a time-consuming task. Now, scientists have discovered that artificial intelligence is as effective as human volunteers — and much faster — at identifying species in these largely untapped photo repositories.
  
In a new study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of researchers, led by computer scientist Mohammad Sadegh Norouzzadeh at the University of Wyoming, tested whether a type of artificial intelligence called deep neural networks could correctly identify and count species, determine animals’ ages, and classify their behaviors. They analyzed AI’s capabilities using 3.2 million images from the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, which contains photos from 225 camera traps in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park since 2011.
While it takes thousands of citizen science volunteers two to three months to label a six-month batch of images from the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, it took the scientists’ AI system just a few hours. And it did it with 96.6 percent accuracy — the same as human volunteers. The system could save more than 17,000 hours of volunteer work, the scientists estimated.
“Automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collecting such data could help catalyze the transformation of many fields of ecology, wildlife biology, zoology, conservation biology, and animal behavior into ‘big data’ sciences,” the scientists write.

According to UPS’ Chief Technology Officer Juan Perez, “Our business drives technology at UPS.” Here are just a few of the ways UPS uses big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to prepare for the 4th Industrial Revolution.

Technology catapults UPS operations
UPS was founded in 1907 and has a history of embracing change and evolving as new technologies arise. It’s the use of big data and artificial intelligence that allows the company to operate its global logistics network in more than 220 countries and territories. On an average day, there are typically 96,000 UPS vehicles on the road handling 19 million packages. UPS invests $1 billion annually in technology to enhance efficiency, improve customer service and support the ever increasing consumer demand to have as close to immediate delivery of packages as humanly possible.
UPS Bot
UPS developed its chatbot, UPS Bot, in house and released it for use just three months after the idea was born. This AI-enabled tool mimics human conversation and can respond to customer queries such as “Where is the nearest UPS location?” and can track packages and give out shipping rates. Customers can ask the bot questions either through text or voice commands through mobile devices, social media channels and virtual assistants such as Alexa and Google Assistant. The UPS Bot is able to recognize these requests and then takes the appropriate steps to complete them. The more “conversations” the bot has, the more learning it experiences to take the appropriate action in the future.
PROMOTED
UPS My Choice
During its peak period, UPS provided more than 137 million UPS My Choice alerts—the free system that lets residential customers decide “how, where and when home deliveries occur.” The chatbot is integrated with the UPS My Choice system, so customers are able to obtain information about their incoming packages and deliveries without providing a tracking number.

ORION, optimizing delivery routes
Another proprietary tool UPS uses to manage its fleet system is ORION (On-road Integrated Optimization and Navigation). Its advanced algorithms create optimal routes for delivery drivers from the data supplied by customers, drivers and the vehicles and can alter the routes on the fly based on changing weather conditions or accidents. Ultimately, it will look at the deliveries that still need to be completed and continue to optimize the routes. The cost and time savings and emission reduction based on this optimization alone is extraordinary—UPS expects to reduce delivery miles by 100 million.
EDGE, optimizing internal operations
What ORION is doing for delivery routes, Enhanced Dynamic Global Execution (EDGE) is doing for UPS internal operations. Technology that’s informed by real-time data helps employees make decisions, reduce costs (expected to be hundreds of millions of dollars in savings once fully deployed in 2020), optimize operations and make the UPS logistics network smarter.

Network Planning Tools
The goal of Network Planning Tools (NPT) is to optimize the flow of packages in the UPS network from loading docks to sorting to the final destination (around 60 million packages in U.S. alone). Fueled by real-time data, artificial intelligence and analytics, NPT helps UPS employees make decisions and improve efficiencies. NPT is expected to be fully deployed by 2020, and the company hopes to realize $100-200 million in savings and cost avoidance with the intel this system will provide.
Autonomous deliveries and drones
UPS execs insist that the UPS driver is a core element to its success and the face of the company, but they have tested the use of drone deliveries for some applications including dropping essential supplies in Rwanda and demonstrating how medicine could be delivered to islands. In rural areas, where drones have open air to execute deliveries and the distance between stops makes it challenging for the drivers to be efficient, drones launched from the roofs of UPS trucks offer a solid solution to cut costs and improve service. Drones could also be deployed in UPS sorting facilities and warehouses to get items on high shelves or in remote areas.
The technology used by UPS generates a cache of data that opens up even more opportunities to become more efficient, improve the customer experience, innovate delivery solutions, and more. From optimizing the UPS network to driving operational improvements, big data and artificial intelligence are at the core of UPS’s business performance.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & PermissionsThe video player is currently playing an ad.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to change the job market as we know it. But should it be viewed as a threat to workers or an opportunity to seize on? France Stratégie looks at how it will impact the French workforce and what actions can be taken to ensure all workers benefit from it.The field of AI traces its roots to a 1956 summer workshop held at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, USA. The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence brought together a small group of mathematicians and scientists over a two-month period to study how machines can simulate human intelligence.
While the field is relatively new, the idea of mimicking human cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving has captured the imagination of people in all corners of the globe for millennia.
But underlying this quest to create “thinking machines” has run a longstanding fear of being outdone by them – and today is no different.
This is particularly true when it comes to the workplace. As AI has made progress in leaps and bounds in recent years, there is growing concern about the impact it will have on the working population.
With the aim of informing the debate surrounding AI and work, Muriel Pénicaud, the French minister of labour, and Mounir Mahjoubi, the secretary of state for digital affairs, asked France Stratégie to look at its impact on work in France.
Adapting to automata
For the moment, AI has only a limited presence in the workplace. But this is set to change, with the development of techniques such as deep learning, where machines can learn from data representations as opposed to relying on algorithms for specific tasks. This technology can be used for things such as recognizing images or carrying out quality translations of basic texts and is already in use in smartphones.
Low-skilled jobs that require manual and repetitive tasks and can be automated relatively easily by robots are certainly at risk of falling victim to AI. There is a fear this could exacerbate inequality by reinforcing a two-tier society of on the one hand an elite high-skilled group, relatively unscathed by AI, and on the other a low-skilled group at risk of seeing their jobs automated and with limited prospects of improving their skills.
But the report shows this is only part of the picture. The technology has progressed to a point where it is impacting all jobs, skilled and unskilled alike. A recent example of this is a US company that has developed algorithms that detect and classify lung nodules more efficiently than radiologists.
The report’s authors, economists Salima Benhamou and Lionel Janin, stress this transformation is not much different from that which took place with the advent of the internet and the digital revolution. Three sectors the report looks at in detail – retail banking, transport and healthcare – have all adapted to digitisation by changing job descriptions, training workers and developing new businesses.
It points to the German automobile industry, one of the most robotised in the world, as an example of honing worker skills to successfully adapt to automation: in 2016, it employed more than 800 000 workers, 100 000 more than two decades ago.
A matter of time
Even if workers adapting takes some time, for the moment the relative cost and productivity of robots has not yet reached a point where it is evident companies should turn to artificially intelligent machines. Regulatory measures also play a major role in this process. But at a certain point, this will inevitably change as robots become cheaper over the coming decades.
Benhamou and Janin highlight that what is new is that AI has reached a tipping point of sorts: machines can now draw on massive amounts of combed data to learn continuously. This virtuous circle will, at some point down the road, lead to a veritable technological breakthrough.
Self-driving vehicles are exemplary of this trend. Sooner or later, professional drivers will start being made redundant by AI. Examples they detail in banking and healthcare include chatbots that advise bank clients and robotised medical assistants that monitor patient health and well-being, pre-diagnosing and proposing therapeutic care.
But new opportunities are certain to spring up. Whether it’s maintaining and managing fleets and accompanying passengers in transport, for example, new jobs will be created. This has always been the case when the labour market undergoes a profound mutation.
The report lays out three ways France can rise to the challenges that AI poses for the 21st century workplace: carry out research on AI’s potential to provide employees, employers and other stakeholders with the information necessary to anticipate changes; train workers in AI, raising awareness of related technical, legal, economic and ethical issues; and reinforce job security for the sectors at risk of being particularly affected by AI.
Though the impact of AI is likely to spare none in the workforce – be they unqualified or highly qualified – it will almost certainly place a premium on social skills and human creativity, a trend already underway in advanced knowledge-based economies. And it will inevitably lead to productivity gains, which if shared can benefit all workers.
Ultimately, a thinking machine’s value lies in the knowledge we humans provide it with and how we interact with it, not in the machine itself. As long as workers remain agile and trained, AI has the potential to be a boon for the job market. But governments, business and academia must all work to prepare the current and future workforce for the massive changes in store.

Imperial academics will look ahead to 2038 to see how technological breakthroughs could change the very fundamentals of how we engage with the world.
At this year’s Tech Foresight conference researchers will be discussing how we can adapt to the shifting realities brought on by new technologies and discover how others are responding to radical technological change.
More than 150 scientists, engineers and executives from industry will come together to talk about technologies that are likely to hit home in the next 20 years.
Professor David Gann, Imperial’s Vice-President (Innovation), said: “Everyone has a particular view of the future and it’s extremely difficult to decommission that mental map. By bringing people together we can challenge each other’s mental maps, and that helps shake up people’s thinking, guided by some expertise about where the current science is.”
Imperial’s Tech Foresight team has also produced the Table of Disruptive Technologies. Modelled on the periodic table, this sets out 100 technologies capable of producing significant social, economic or political upheaval, from low-cost space travel, invisibility shields and smart nappies to a digital footprint eraser and male pregnancy.
Talks will include:
Dr Isabel Garcia-Perez, Lecturer in Precision and Systems Medicine, and Dr Weston Baxter, a lecturer at the Dyson School of Engineering, will be looking at what our dinner plates could look like in 2038 as food becomes smarter, more precise and more adapted to our bodies. 
To address the persistent problem of the difference between what people say they eat and what they really eat, Dr Garcia-Perez is developing a system that can tell what someone has been eating based on chemicals in their urine.
Some of these markers relate to metabolism, some to microbial interactions in the gut, and others indicate specific foods or food groups in the diet. Dr Garcia-Perez said: “I want to empower clinicians, dieticians and policy makers by giving them the objective information they need to access the full potential of precision medicine.”
Dr Mark Kennedy, Associate Professor in the Imperial College Business School, will be looking at just how disruptive technologies can be. He has been working on a model to help organisations assess the impact of artificial intelligence on their workforce.
Using company data such as job descriptions, Dr Kennedy and his team link the tasks involved with existing jobs to tools based on different forms of artificial intelligence. “Rather than predicting jobs that will be lost to robots, we take a tools-for-tasks approach to anticipating workforce changes,” he explains.
Professor Mark Girolami, chair in statistics and Director of the Alan Turing Institute, will be exploring the current hype around data and discussing how we might unlock the power of data through the use of computational statistics.
Professor Mimi Hii and Dr Mark Kennedy will discuss how AI could revolutionise scientific discovery and Dr Connor Myant, a lecturer at the Dyson School of Design Engineering, will explore 4D printing and its potential to herald new opportunities for industries and consumers.

The latter might be a tall order. But AI, it appears, just took one small step for robotkind.New research published June 14 in Science reports that for the first time scientists have developed a machine-learning system that can observe a particular scene from multiple angles and predict what it will look like from a new, never-before-observed angle. With further development the technology could lead to more autonomous robots in industrial and manufacturing settings.Much in the way we can scan a friend’s apartment from one side of the living room and have a pretty good sense of what it looks like from the other, the new technology can do just that for a scene within a three-dimensional computer image.Devised by researchers at artificial intelligence company DeepMind—acquired by Google in 2014—the new system can “learn” the three-dimensional layout of a space without any human supervision. This Generative Query Network, or GQN—as its developers call it, is first trained by observing simple computer-generated scenes containing different lighting and object arrangements. It can then be exposed to multiple images of a new environment and accurately predict what it looks like from any angle within it. Unlike the hyperconnected perceptual regions of the human brain, the system learns and processes properties like shape, size and color separately and then assimilates the data into a cohesive “view” of a space. “Humans and other animals have a rich understanding of the visual world in terms of objects, geometry, lighting, etcetera,” says Ali Eslami, lead author on the new paper and a research scientist at DeepMind. “This capability is developed through a combination of innate knowledge and unsupervised learning. Our motivation behind this research is to understand how we can build computer systems that learn to interpret the visual world in a similar manner.”Machine learning as a field has barreled forward in recent years. And GQN technology builds on many past systems, including the numerous “deep-learning” models based on neural networks inspired by the human brain. Deep learning is a form of machine learning in which a computer “learns” from exposure to an image or other data to, say, detect the various features that make an object a cat or a spoon. It does so after observing many images of scenes labeled to identify these objects. GQN utilizes deep learning to build a form of computerized “vision” that enables navigation through complex scenes. What’s unique about it compared with many other systems is its ability to learn on its own purely from observation and without human supervision. It analyzes unlabeled objects and the space in which they fit in a scene and then apply its learnings to another image. “This gives GQN increased flexibility and frees us from having to create a large collection of models for every object in the world,” Eslami says. In other words it can recognize a novel object based on prior exposure to a different object using characteristics like shape and color.For now the new system has only been designed to work with computer-generated scenes, not to control a robot’s actions in the real world. But Eslami and his colleagues plan to continue developing the GQN with more complex geometry and situations, hoping that one day the fully autonomous robotic understanding of a scene could lend itself to any number of industrial applications. Robots could theoretically be trained on one task and redeployed on another without extensive reprogramming. GQN could bring down manufacturing costs, increase production speed and streamline assembly of just about anything cobbled together by robots. “This work is interesting and exciting,” says Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor of cognitive science and computation, Joshua Tenenbaum, who also says the technology has a way to go before it sees any practical uses. “In my view, this research is still rather far from direct applications,” he notes. “From a strictly practical engineering point of view, the problems it solves can currently be solved as well or better by other means, which are less dependent on pure learning-based methods.”Tenenbaum, who was not involved with the project, adds, “In the long term this work could help advance the state of robotic perception and control, leading to systems that are more adaptive and autonomous than today's AI technologies.”As AI advances to the point where machines take on qualities previously exclusive to humans, there are of course dystopian concerns: namely that we will cultivate our own demise at the hands of a smarter, more powerful population of cyber beings, whatever form they may take. And as German philosopher Thomas Metzinger has cautioned for years, creating certain mental states in machines could result in those machines experiencing pain and suffering.Tenenbaum is not worried. “Any fear of developing computers that are ‘smarter’ than us, in the practically accessible future, are unfounded,” he says. “The system presented here is a noteworthy advance over previous inverse-graphics systems, but it is far from capturing the perception abilities that even young children possess. It also requires vast quantities of training data, which children do not, suggesting that its learning abilities are not nearly as powerful as those of human beings.”Computer science founding father Alan Turing once said a computer could only be called intelligent if it could deceive a person into believing it was human. Any true success on Turing’s test would require a machine that exhibits general intelligence—one that can do calculus, tie shoes and cook supper, all the things that humans do—a goal that is still nothing more than a futurist fantasy for now.Rights & PermissionsBret Stetka was a writer based in New York City and editorial director of Medscape Neurology (a subsidiary of WebMD).

A new voice was created for him by Scottish technology company CereProc.CereProc trained a neural network to predict how Mr Dupree would talk, using samples from his old voice recordings.""This has saved my job and saved my family from a terrible financial unknown,"" Mr Dupree told the BBC. ""There is not much of a market for radio reporters who can't talk.""AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTTypically, in order to create a voice for someone, the individual needs to read out a script for 30 hours in order to gather enough data.Then artificial intelligence is applied to either chop up words from the audio file and stick them back together on demand, or the technology is used to predict and imitate the person's speech patterns.Both of these methods can cost tens of thousands of pounds, and take a month to produce just one voice.Neural networks To speed up the process and make it more affordable, CereProc started developing its own neural networks in 2006.Today, its artificial intelligence system can generate a voice in just a few days for £500, once a user has recorded themselves reading the script on its website. CereProcUsers record themselves reading out a sequence of sentences, which can be then turned into a voiceThe neural networks, which contain between six to 10 layers each, work by slicing audio recordings of words down to phonetics.The artificial intelligence system slices each word read out by an individual into 100 tiny pieces, and does this with lots of common words until eventually it understands how basic phonetics work in that person's voice and has an ordered sequence for all the pieces in each word.Then, the neural network can create its own sounds and predict what the person would sound like if they were to say a series of words in conversation.Many computer scientists around the world are trying to replicate the human brain by training neural networks to perform image recognition, but CereProc says that it is much easier to apply artificial intelligence to sound.""AI techniques work quite well on small constrained problems, and learning to model speech is something deep neural nets can do really well,"" Chris Pidcock, CereProc's chief technical officer and co-founder, told the BBC.""It's a much more solvable problem than machine intelligence.""Silenced by illnessMr Dupree has been covering political news from Congress in Washington DC for the past 35 years. And as a journalist producing content for six radio stations, his voice is essential to his work. He began losing his voice in 2016, but there was nothing wrong with his vocal cords, throat or larynx. After baffling doctors from several large US university hospitals, eventually Mr Dupree was diagnosed with tongue protrusion dystonia - a rare neurological condition where the tongue pushes forward out of his mouth and his throat tightens whenever he wants to speak, making it impossible for him to say more than two or three words at a time.Rather than give up his work, Mr Dupree continued to do interviews with policymakers in Congress using an eWriter tablet to scribble questions during one-to-one interviews, or by recording the answers given to groups of journalists in the Senate building's hallways between hearings.Jamie DupreeJamie Dupree at work in a radio studioAlthough he was still writing and producing stories, he had essentially gone off the air completely, because he could not present the stories he had written.Then, in December, a member of the US Congress spoke out on his behalf on the floor of the House of Representatives.The resulting media attention spurred his employer to try to find a way for Mr Dupree to return to the air, since it had almost 30 years' worth of his radio broadcasts on file. A new voice Thanks to the computer-generated voice produced by CereProc, from Monday, 25 June, onwards Mr Dupree will once again be heard by WSB Atlanta listeners, as well as audiences of Cox Media-owned stations in Orlando, Jacksonville, Dayton and Tulsa. With his new voice, Mr Dupree can now write a script and then use a free text-to-speech software program called Balabolka on his laptop to turn it into an audio recording. If a word or turn of phrase doesn't sound quite right in the recording, he can slow certain consonants or vowels down, or swap a word to one that does work, or change the pitch, and he can have a full radio story ready to go live in just seven minutes. ""It is me, there is no doubt about that,"" said Mr Dupree.""Yes, it is slightly robotic, but no-one was promising me that it was going to be perfect.""In person, when talking to family and colleagues, Mr Dupree still has to rely on the eWriter tablet, or saying a couple of words slowly, but the new voice has made a big difference to his life.""This is awesome,"" he said. ""Writing for my blog, sending out tweets and doing Facebook is great - but there is nothing like cranking out a 20-second story jammed with a couple of sound bites to make the top of the hour newscast.""JFK's lost speech brought to life'Siri, will talking ever top typing?'",,AI gives silenced radio journalist his voice back,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44481510,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10C40/production/_102027686_lost-voice2.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The robot’s inventor is a native of the town and hopes that with more people shopping online, such robots will take off, reducing traffic and pollution.Credit...Natalie Behring/Getty ImagesLots of smart technologists and futurists are convinced that we are on the cusp of a world in which artificial intelligence, robotics and other technologies will make a large portion of today’s jobs obsolete.They might be wrong, of course, but the consequences if they’re right would be huge — potentially a defining challenge of the decades ahead, and one that would demand political attention.Some of the potential answers are big, bold ideas that have gained traction in particular ideological circles. A universal basic income — the idea that the government simply give each citizen enough money every month to support basic needs — has fans among both free-market libertarians and socialists.But other ideas starting to percolate in economic policy circles may have advantages in terms of cost and political viability.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOne interesting entry in this discussion is a paper published Tuesday by the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank, called “Don’t Fear the Robots.” The economist Mark Paul writes that a series of policy steps that are, in isolation, not all that radical would go a long way toward ensuring that the benefits of technological advancement would be widely enjoyed.As an example, he says the Federal Reserve and other policymakers should commit more energetically to pursuing a “maximum employment” goal set in federal law, even if it means being willing to tolerate a bit more risk of inflation.Mr. Paul argues for overhauling intellectual property law so that the companies that develop valuable patents and trademarks don’t have such a lengthy monopoly on their innovations. Over time this would probably mean that more of the benefits of technology would accrue to labor rather than capital. And he sees promise in work-sharing programs like those that have been used to help keep unemployment low in Germany even during economic downturns. The idea is that if a company needs to cut 20 percent of its work force because of new innovations, it is better for society if it cuts each worker’s hours by 20 percent rather than laying off 20 percent of its staff.Mr. Paul argues that rapid shifts in the skills and technologies demanded by the modern economy strengthen the case for publicly funded higher education and training to help workers adapt.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThis set of proposals is based on the idea that the emerging wave of digital disruption won’t result in a permanent loss of demand for workers, but rather shifts in what types of work the economy needs. It’s not unlike early 20th-century America’s shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial one, or its shift from an industrial to an information economy over the last half-century.In this context, the goal is not to stymie that evolution, but to try to tilt the balance toward workers as the transition takes place. “We want a growing, robust economy,” Mr. Paul said. “We just need proper policies in place to ensure that workers don’t bear the burden of that transition.”While these ideas are coming from a decidedly left-of-center place, it’s striking how some of them overlap with the goals of centrist business interests and even some conservative thinkers.The McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting giant that has produced extensive analysis suggesting that advances in information technology and robotics will endanger millions of jobs in the coming decade, often emphasizes the role of subsidized education and training.Susan Lund, a partner in the firm, says it is increasingly crucial that people continually upgrade their skills to keep up with changing technology, whether through community colleges, traditional universities or narrowly targeted online training.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Lifelong learning accounts would be interesting,” Ms. Lund said, “and they could be federally funded or they could be funded by employers, but what you want is for people to be able to avail themselves of a two-month leave to take courses so that they can keep up with change.”Ms. Lund and her McKinsey colleagues also recommend new approaches to making job benefits like health insurance and retirement funds more “portable,” so that people who work as independent contractors or who change jobs frequently can have more stability.To the degree that many of these ideas imply a more activist government role, conservatives tend to be more leery. But Michael Strain, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says the risks of disruption are high enough that some flexibility may be needed.In particular, we could be headed toward a bifurcated labor market, where people with advanced skills earn higher wages but where workers without those skills see technology drive down demand for their services, depressing their pay.“I tend to think that conservatives should be open to new policies for a new economic reality,” Mr. Strain said. “So if we end up in a world where the market wages for large groups of workers really are well below the wages they would be willing to work for, one way to combat that if you’re serious about the importance of work would be significantly larger earnings subsidies than conservatives have been comfortable with.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBy expanding the earned-income tax credit or creating similar programs, for example, the government could increase the effective pay of jobs that otherwise would pay so little that Americans might choose to sit at home rather than take them.(Mr. Strain says liberals have blind spots on these issues as well: Raising the minimum wage, as many on the left have advocated, could well be counterproductive if technology causes market wages to fall for certain workers, for example.)The unemployment rate is currently at its lowest level in 18 years, and the bigger challenge for the economy now is that productivity is too low, not that technology is causing productivity to be so high as to drive people out of jobs.So this discussion over potential policy responses to a future that may or may not arrive remains speculative — all the more so in an era of congressional dysfunction.But there’s a recent lesson worth learning from. Globalization and automation caused upheaval in the manufacturing industry from the 1980s through the early 2000s, and millions of factory workers lost their jobs. The disruption to communities is still being felt, and is arguably at the root of a lot of the biggest social and economic problems of this era. If a similar technological wave is about to wash over millions of service workers, we would all do well to try to keep history from repeating itself.Neil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot.

This is the first article in a weeklong series about artificial intelligence.
We are at the brink of fundamental technological breakthroughs that have been predicted for decades. The most striking innovations—such as autonomous driving, fully automated manufacturing, and home care delivered by robots—combine robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. These technologies are not separable anymore, but integrated. AI, for example, has a role as a standalone technology, but it is more often just a piece of a more complex digital strategy. 
Significant changes in design and implementation will be needed if technology is to realize its full potential. My recent research, in collaboration with Oliver Wyman and Mercer, has identified how to better manage the digital-transformation process. In the past, a sequential approach has dominated: Vendors develop products, sell them to CTOs or CIOs through what are often prolonged negotiations (neither side fully understanding the other), and then managers struggle to integrate the new technology with their workforce to achieve business objectives. 
Now, we propose a new integrated model that links the design of a digital strategy with the design of new workforce practices right from the beginning. We feel this new model gives companies a better shot at successful transformation and improving productivity. 
In the new integrative model, collaborative design—engaging vendors, workers, and managers—merges technical and business knowledge and applies it directly to business operations. Design considerations include how technology can augment human inputs or fully replace it to allow for higher-order human inputs.
Figure 1. Two Models for Digital Transformation

Where Does AI Work?
Consider the use cases in which artificial intelligence can substitute for human decisions. AI serves as a successful substitute in domains with frequent, structured, and specific tasks. Because using AI requires training, it works better in areas where there are a greater number of events or data points. Events with more structure and specificity also provide for an easier learning process.
Figure 2. Where Does AI Work?
Within the realm of insurance, for example, AI is suitable for evaluating health claims in countries with standard codes, because those claims are both frequent and structured. Conversely, AI is less suitable for making decisions on claims for serious bodily injuries, which require more human judgment. In these situations, however, AI might help provide data and information to support human judgment and thereby augment work.
In banking operations, there are a number of repetitive tasks involving data entry and re-entry, particularly for compliance, reconciliation, and accounting purposes. Robotic process automation (RPA), a form of AI, uses software bots for repetitive, rote tasks. The bots function like humans, as virtual users interacting with screens and applications. They primarily perform repetitive, manual, and simple cognitive tasks.
As data volumes increase, it can become prohibitively time-consuming for humans to process it. Thus, RPA is increasingly deployed to free up human capacity from standard tasks and processes and direct it toward more complex and analytical tasks. And, of course, humans can manage the technology to mitigate the risk of error and intervene in the event of an RPA system breakdown.
Cautionary Tales: GM and Tesla

As vendors and internal IT developers recognize the importance of using collaborative design to create complementary technologies, they will produce more targeted, useful solutions. Consider the use of AI as a piece of a more integrated process with machine learning and robotics. Too often, firms have sought to automate their way out of productivity and labor problems. In the 1980s, for example, General Motors spent more than $50 billion on robotics in an effort to catch up with more efficient Japanese producers. At the end of the decade, GM remained the high-cost producer because it failed to upgrade its workforce and change its work practices in ways needed to make the new technologies pay off. Toyota, by contrast, achieved world-class levels of productivity by taking an integrated approach—introducing new technologies gradually, while simultaneously investing in team-based work systems and high levels of workforce training. 
Ironically, in the same plant in Fremont, California, where Toyota achieved high levels of productivity, Tesla is now following a total automation strategy but failing to meet its production goals, falling prey to the same mistake GM made 30-plus years ago. Not surprisingly, workers at the Tesla factory are trying to organize a union in protest of what they see as persistent safety problems, overwork, and low wages. Investors are worried the company’s cash reserves are running low.

Collaborative Technology Design
Conversely, when technology developers and designers proactively consider and engage the workforce as part of a collaborative-design process, the resultant solution is more likely to fit the needs of the business and the specifications of the user.
Cisco, for example, applied the principles of user-led design in a 24-hour “breakathon” intended to break down and rebuild its HR program. Over 800 employees, 65 percent from HR and the rest from services and engineering, took part in the event, with offices around the globe participating in a “follow-the-sun” manner. Taking inspiration from hackathons, employees split up into small teams to identify problems they had experienced while doing their job and pitch ideas for solutions.
The hackathon resulted in several solutions across talent acquisition, onboarding, development, and leadership. One such idea resulted in the creation of YouBelong@Cisco, a mobile app that guides new employees and their managers during their initial weeks of work.
Unilever also applied the technology-integration mindset to its recruiting and onboarding process. Unilever posts targeted job advertisements on social-media sites. Potential applicants who click the job description are brought to a site where they can apply for the job with information sourced from their LinkedIn profile. From there, skill assessment is conducted through a series of online games. Applicants who pass that stage submit prerecorded video interviews through a website or app. At each phase, AI algorithms screen the applicants and narrow down the pool of potential hires who qualify for an in-person interview. Once hired, candidates can sign their offers digitally, access Unilever’s onboarding system, and connect digitally with other recent hires.
From start to finish, Unilever uses digital tools and advanced analytics for recruitment and onboarding. Unilever’s digital approach has streamlined the recruiting process from four months to two weeks and reduced recruiter screening time by 75 percent. Candidates benefit from a quicker process and also less human bias, as AI has proven to be more objective.
The guiding principle is not to throw technology at a problem. That’s highly likely to create even larger, unforeseen problems. The guiding principle should be to look for elegant solutions to problems and ask how technology can help workers achieve the end goal faster and cheaper. It’s a mistake to perceive technology as unmalleable. It is malleable, and, when shaped collaboratively to augment human inputs, it is much more effective—as are the humans who are relieved of tedious, repetitive work.
General-purpose vendors often lack knowledge of industry-specific work processes. This gap in understanding can create resistance and bottlenecks when developing technology solutions. The solution lies in partnerships: between technology vendors and business managers, between humans and machines, and between developers and the frontline workers, who will be the ultimate end users.

Police searching for a long-lost person or fugitive sometimes have little more to go on than an old photograph. Artists or computer programs can attempt to predict what these individuals look like today, but both approaches have flaws. Now, scientists have harnessed advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to render artificial aging that's more realistic (and depressing) than ever. The system uses a two-part AI algorithm called a generative adversarial network (GAN). The first part takes a face and produces another face of the same individual at a target age. During training, a second part compares this image with a real image of someone at that age and with the original image and provides feedback, encouraging the first part to improve its abilities. Other artificial aging systems have used GANs, but this one differs by focusing not just on getting the age right, but also on maintaining the individual's identity. Unlike others, it also renders foreheads and (lack of) hair, as seen in the photos of Justin Timberlake and Kirsten Dunst above. The researchers trained their AI on more than 100,000 images from two databases, including mugshots and celebrities at different ages. A separate computer program then judged how the AI performed on a novel set of images. When the AI aged photos of people more than 20 years, so that people under 30 were meant to look between 50 and 60, for example, the computer program saw them (on average) as a 60-year-old (for mugshots) or a 52-year-old (for celebs). This analysis was not performed on prior work, but human participants deciding whether the new results or images from prior attempts to age people looked most like a younger source image chose the new images 70% to 9%, the researchers report in a paper to be presented this month at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in Salt Lake City.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are already prompting calls for teaching to be automated, learner-driven and ‘teacher-proof’. While these technologies might still require non-specialised&amp;nbsp;classroom&amp;nbsp;facilitators and&amp;nbsp;technicians, the&amp;nbsp;role&amp;nbsp;of the highly trained expert teacher is coming under increasing threat.&amp;nbsp;There&#039;s&amp;nbsp;a growing sense that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/the-deconstruction-of-the-k-12-teacher/388631/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we don’t really need teachers in the same way any more&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Put bluntly, the entire premise of ‘the teaching profession’ faces an impending challenge. In a future where&amp;nbsp;education&amp;nbsp;can be reliably provided by machines, why&amp;nbsp;continue to&amp;nbsp;invest millions of dollars in&amp;nbsp;training human experts&amp;nbsp;to do the job?&amp;nbsp;Given the likely trajectory of technological developments over the next few decades, is there anything&amp;nbsp;that an expert teacher does&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;machines&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;be able to do?&amp;nbsp;As an education researcher and teacher, I&#039;d like to think that there is!&amp;nbsp;Here, then, are&amp;nbsp;six&amp;nbsp;aspects of expert human teaching that are getting overlooked in the current rush toward automating the classroom:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers have learned&amp;nbsp;what they know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is clear benefit from being with someone who can pass on knowledge, especially someone who&#039;s&amp;nbsp;previously&amp;nbsp;been in the&amp;nbsp;position of having to learn&amp;nbsp;that knowledge.&amp;nbsp;This latter qualification is a uniquely human characteristic. When a learner learns with an expert teacher, they&#039;re not simply gaining access to the teachers’ knowledge, but also benefiting from the teachers’ memories of&amp;nbsp;learning it themselves. Technology can be pre-loaded with content of what is to be learned. Yet, no AI technology is going to ‘learn’ something exactly the way a human learns it, and then help another human learn accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;make cognitive connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A human is uniquely placed to sense&amp;nbsp;what another human is cognitively&amp;nbsp;experiencing&amp;nbsp;at any moment, and respond accordingly.&amp;nbsp;In this sense, face-to-face&amp;nbsp;contact with a teacher offers learners a valuable opportunity to engage in the process of thinking&amp;nbsp;with another human brain. On one hand, there is something thrilling about witnessing&amp;nbsp;an expert&amp;nbsp;who&#039;s modelling the process of&amp;nbsp;thinking things through. Conversely, a human teacher is also able to make a personal ‘cognitive connection’ with another individual who is attempting to learn.&amp;nbsp;As David Cohen&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674051102&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;, teachers are uniquely able to “put themselves into learners’ mental shoes”. Despite the best efforts of computer science, many aspects of&amp;nbsp;thinking cannot be detected and modelled by machines in this way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; data-caption=&quot;&quot; data-guid=&quot;159fb126-a4c7-4364-9a39-87b26363fe15&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/cognitives/image/upload/v1529022213/zbemnz0tb8gyblleqr16.jpg&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100% !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;make social connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teaching is a mutual obligation between teachers and learners. No teacher can stimulate the learning process without the cooperation of those who are learning.&amp;nbsp;Good teachers make personal connections with their students, helping them gauge what might work best at any particular time. Before attempting to intellectually engage with a group,&amp;nbsp;teachers&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leseprobe.buch.de/images-adb/65/5b/655b3cd2-0fa7-4600-8948-276ca758c857.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will&amp;nbsp;“take a mental pulse of students’ demeanours”&lt;/a&gt;. Teachers work hard to establish this&amp;nbsp;mutual commitment to learning, as well as sustaining engagement through motivating, cajoling and enthusing individuals. All of these are interpersonal skills that come naturally to people rather than machines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;talk out loud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is something transformative about being in the presence of an expert teacher talking about their subject of expertise. Listening to an expert talk can provide a real-time, unfolding connection with knowledge. A good speaker doesn&#039;t stick rigidly to a written text, but refines, augments and alters their argument according to the audience&amp;nbsp;reactions.&amp;nbsp;A teacher speaking to a group&amp;nbsp;of learners therefore engages&amp;nbsp;in a form of spontaneous revelation. Key to this is the teacher’s role in leading and supporting learners to engage in active listening. As&amp;nbsp;Gert&amp;nbsp;Biesta&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00131857.2015.1041442&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt;, being addressed by another person interrupts&amp;nbsp;one’s&amp;nbsp;ego-centricism&amp;nbsp;– drawing&amp;nbsp;an individual out of themselves&amp;nbsp;and forcing them into sense-making.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good teachers make personal connections with their students, helping them gauge what might work best at any particular time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers perform with their bodies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bodies of human teachers are an invaluable resource when engaging learners in abstract thought.&amp;nbsp;Teachers use their bodies to energise, orchestrate and anchor the performance of teaching.&amp;nbsp;Many subtleties of teaching take place through movement – pacing around a room, pointing and gesturing.&amp;nbsp;Teachers make use of their ‘expressive body’&amp;nbsp;– &amp;nbsp;lowering&amp;nbsp;their voice, raising an eyebrow or directing their gaze. Crucially, a human will respond to the&amp;nbsp;living biological&amp;nbsp;body of another human in a completely different&amp;nbsp;way to even the most realistic simulation. Being&amp;nbsp;looked in the eye&amp;nbsp;by another person is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;qualitatively different&amp;nbsp;experience&amp;nbsp;than being&amp;nbsp;looked&amp;nbsp;at by&amp;nbsp;a 3D humanoid robot,&amp;nbsp;let alone a 2D cartoon agent on a screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;Human teachers&amp;nbsp;improvise and ‘make do’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A key part of good teaching is the human capacity to improvise. Rather than sticking tightly to a pre-planned script,&amp;nbsp;teachers&amp;nbsp;will adjust what they do according to the circumstances. Like most&amp;nbsp;performative&amp;nbsp;events, teachers approach a session with a rough plan or structure. However, thereafter they improvise their way around these aims and objectives. Teaching requires acts of creativity, innovation and spontaneity – akin&amp;nbsp;to dancing or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may07/vol64/num08/Teaching-as-Jazz.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;playing jazz&lt;/a&gt;. Teachers and learners feel each other out, find common ground and build upon it.&amp;nbsp;Teaching also demands a tolerance for imprecision, messiness and not knowing. Most human actions involve a degree of guesswork, bluff and willingness to ‘make do’.&amp;nbsp;These are processes of which computer systems are largely incapable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As these examples illustrate, an&amp;nbsp;expert human teacher is able to support learning in ways that can&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;be fully replicated through technology.&amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, these qualities remain largely unrecognised, even by teachers themselves. Many educators consider teaching to be an&amp;nbsp;‘unconscious’ act that is&amp;nbsp;difficult to pin down and articulate. Yet such coyness does little to dispel the technology-driven arguments currently being made&amp;nbsp;against&amp;nbsp;the teaching profession. Teachers need to speak up&amp;nbsp;and make an irrefutable case for the continued presence of expert professionals at the forefront of classrooms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An&amp;nbsp;expert human teacher is able to support learning in ways that can&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;be fully replicated through technology.&amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, these qualities remain largely unrecognised, even by teachers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how can we&amp;nbsp;rehabilitate&amp;nbsp;human teachers in the minds of their detractors?&amp;nbsp;The uphill battle in countries such as Australia is to revitalise schools and classrooms to allow teachers to work in the ways just outlined. These are all characteristics that a good teacher&amp;nbsp;should&amp;nbsp;have, but are considerably restricted in an era of ‘teaching out-of-field’,&amp;nbsp;templated&amp;nbsp;lesson plans and rigid standardised testing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A first step in this direction might be to alter the ways that people think and talk about teaching. Teachers need to&amp;nbsp;speak&amp;nbsp;forcibly&amp;nbsp;about these qualities – among&amp;nbsp;themselves, within their professional associations, with parents, politicians, pundits&amp;nbsp;and anyone else with&amp;nbsp;influence.&amp;nbsp;Teachers also need to&amp;nbsp;argue directly against the tech industry and&amp;nbsp;corporate reformers looking to replace them with machines. There is obvious value in the human expert teacher. Yet unless teachers are able to make a convincing case, they may well lose the argument before they even realise that there was one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on EduResearch Matters.

Elizabeth Holm, a professor of materials science and engineering at the College of Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and a computational materials scientist at Sandia National Laboratories says we're in the midst of an artificial intelligence (AI) culture shift.

She also says that machines won't replace human experts.
""Machines are great at handling things, like large amounts of data, but machines still need an expert, a human, to analyze the data, set parameters and guide decisions,” said Holm.
""Engineering and science decisions are based on understanding how things work. How does a bridge support its load? How does an engine convert fuel into motion? In contrast, AI transforms data into decisions without understanding any underlying principles,"" said Holm. ""Applying AI to engineering and science will require a culture shift: either we will learn to trust decisions that we do not understand, or AIs will evolve to base their decisions on principles that humans can interpret and control.""
PROMOTED
Holm says that currently, society is exploring how to balance those alternatives.
""AI software that drives autonomous vehicles is based on data, not pre-programmed principals of driving,"" said Holm. ""Because we trust the AI to have learned the right things from the data, we give it access to our roads. However, when a pedestrian is struck and killed by a self-driving car, we pull the cars off the roads and ask the AI to explain itself – to formulate its decisions in terms of rules we can control.""

Holm says the AI culture shift is a work in progress, but that there are four primary reasons why machines and humans will continue to work together.
Intelligent machines are great at handling lots of data.
Holm believes that processes like manufacturing that collect a lot of data, like 3D printing, will benefit from the principles of AI like computer vision, which can sort through all that data.

“AI is an important area for additive manufacturing,"" adds Holm. ""It’s different from most manufacturing processes in that it really can collect the data on the fly, so there’s a lot of room for data science.”
Holm points out that AI applications being used at Facebook and Amazon, like facial recognition and targeted advertising, have made all of us aware of the power of integrating vast amounts of social data. 
""3D printing generates copious visual, audio, and instrument data at every individual step of the process. Our goal is to use the same AI concepts to optimize the additive manufacturing process concerning quality and cost,"" said Holm.
Machines augment human capabilities.
""When we use computers to find flaws, it's very much like when we use computers to read radiographs, x-rays, and CAT scans in medical imaging,"" said Holm. ""The idea is that the computer does the first look to find the areas of interest, but we're in no way replacing the expert who looks at that flaw and says, ‘No, it's nothing to worry about,’ or, ‘Oh yeah, that's what happens when the oil gets old, and it’s problematic.’”
Holm says we're already becoming aware of this from the medical imaging we're exposed to.
""These days, for many routine radiological tests like mammograms, the first entity to examine the results is a computer. AI software locates normal and abnormal areas and passes the results to a human radiologist for further examination and recommendations,"" said Holm.
Machines save humans time by performing tedious tasks in much less time.
 
Tedious and repetitive tasks could be a thing of the past.
""The first thing a graduate student wants to do is stop having to outline segmentation drawings, which can take multiple hours and cause a lot of angst; they vow when they graduate, they're never going to do that again, and it's going to be some other graduate student's problem,"" said Holm. ""The computer doesn't have that; the computer might do it forever without getting bored because there’s no boredom in a computer.”
""One example of this is a company [..] that performs quality control by microscopically scanning samples of each batch of its product. The vast majority of each sample is entirely normal and uninteresting, only the rare anomalies are important,"" added Holm. ""So this process makes the human expert spend a lot of time not using his or her expertise and an AI system can patiently scan samples and weed out normal results so that the human expert can focus more time and attention on the relevant and challenging findings.""
Intelligent machines are human-made.
 
“Each step of a convolutional neural network is just signal processing that we learned as undergraduates in engineering school,"" said Holm. ""Of course, there's a feedback loop, a learning loop of how you develop the filters and the architecture of your signal processor. But it's not magic, it's just a set of simple things that all engineers already know.”
""I think it’s important not to attribute special powers to deep learning algorithms – at least no more special power than the human brain,"" added Holm.
Carnegie Mellon University has been a pioneer in AI since the 1950s. Herbert Simon and Alan Newell created the Logic Theorist in 1955 which is considered the first AI program while they were both on the faculty at the University.  Simon went on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978, and he and Newell won the Turing Award in 1975.
In May 2018, the University’s School of Computer Science (SCS) added an undergraduate degree in AI in Fall 2018, which is considered the first degree of its kind offered by a US University.
Reid Simmons, research professor of robotics and computer science, at CMU SCS says courses like these will have an impact on developing the technology of the future.
""With the proliferation of data in society, it is becoming increasingly necessary to find ways to analyze and make sense of all that data, that is where AI can help,"" said Simmons. ""Whether it's by better understanding the financial markets, by improving the safety and efficiency of transportation, or by making our lives more productive and enjoyable..""
""Students graduating with an AI major will not only understand how to employ AI to improve society, but they will have the skills and insight to help develop the next, more powerful, generation of AI tools,"" added Simmons.Follow me on Twitter. Jennifer Kite-PowellFollowingFollowI'm a writer who looks at innovation and how technology and science intersect with industry, environment, arts, agriculture, mobility, health.

And the way we use them in job adverts can dictate whether or not people bother to apply. This is a big problem if you're a business trying to recruit more women and ethnic minorities into your workforce. So can tech help remove these unconscious biases?A job description that uses the phrase ""We're looking for someone to manage a team"" may seem innocuous enough.But research, based on an analysis of hundreds of millions of job ads, has shown that the word ""manage"" encourages more men than women to apply for the role.Changing the word to ""develop"" would make it more female-friendly, says Kieran Snyder, chief executive of Seattle-based Textio, an ""augmented writing software"" company.Textio uses artificial intelligence to pore over job descriptions in real time, highlighting any terms that could come across as particularly masculine or feminine. The software then suggests alternatives. ""We don't explain why this or that phrase excludes women,"" says Ms Snyder. ""We just provide the data and the company in question can come up with their own theory on why that sentence doesn't work.""TextioTextio's Kieran Snyder (right) with co-founder Jensen HarrisWhen Australian software giant Atlassian used Textio's software for its job-ad copy, the results were striking. It saw an 80% increase in the hiring of women in technical roles globally over a two-year period.""We wanted to create a work culture where diverse ideas get shared,"" says Aubrey Blanche, Atlassian's global head of diversity and belonging. She says Textio taught her company to avoid terms such as ""coding ninja"" - a common phrase in Silicon Valley job ads. ""These words send a message to women that these are hostile work environments for female staffers,"" says Ms Blanche.Getty ImagesJob ads that use the phrase ""coding ninja"" are not female friendly, says Aubrey BlancheAnd the word stakeholder apparently ""serves as a signal to people of colour that their contributions may not be valued"", adds Ms Blanche. ""We don't know why, but this is what the data shows.""Back in 2011, researchers from Canada and the US found that job posts using more masculine wording ""led women to have a lower sense that they would belong in the position or company than the same ads using more feminine wording,"" the report stated. The researchers also found that gender preferences can be conveyed subtly through words such as ""competitive,"" or ""leader"", usually associated with male stereotypes, while words such as ""support"" and ""interpersonal"" are associated with female stereotypes.Building on this kind of research, another recruitment tech company, TalVista, assesses job descriptions and highlights ""discouraging"" terms in red and ""inviting"" terms in green, assigning an overall thumb up or thumb down score to the text.TalVistaTalVista boss Elaine Orler says recruitment is prone to ""unconscious bias""For example, replacing a word such as ""build"" with ""create"" achieves a better overall score, the company says.   ""Diversity and inclusion are always critical for talent acquisition,"" TalVista chief executive Elaine Orler says. ""But when a job post uses words like 'strong' or 'dynamic' many candidates are repelled but they don't know why; it's in their unconscious bias but they can't pinpoint why.""Tech firm Applied also offers gender-balancing advice for job ads and a tool that scores the overall reading age of the ad.""It's remarkable the number of job descriptions that are written with the same density and complexity as a Harvard Law Review article when you definitely don't need a PhD to do the job itself,"" says Applied chief executive and co-founder Kate Glazebrook.APpiedApplied boss Kate Glazebrook wants to rid job ads of dense management speakApplied numbers the UK government, Transport for London, Hilton Hotels and Penguin Random House among clients who've benefited from more inclusionary language in their job ads.Even the format of a job ad can make a difference. Textio's analysis reveals that ads with lengthy bullet points detailing the role's responsibilities will face a drop-off in women applying for the job. All this matters because a more diverse workforce has been shown to foster a wider variety of ideas and improve a company's profitability, recent research has shown.Companies boasting the most ethnically diverse executive teams are 33% more likely to outperform their peers, according to McKinsey & Company. More Technology of BusinessMagnum Photos'It feels like the hand of God thrusting you up the road'Could a text message save thousands of fishermen's lives?'I bought my mum a flat just by renting out my camera kit'Why are so many firms so bad at handling social media?Who is to blame for 'self-driving car' deaths?And those with the most gender-diverse boardrooms are 15% more likely to enjoy above-average profitability than companies with a more homogenous make-up, it found.One report by US economists found that moving from an all-male or all-female office to one split evenly along gender lines could boost revenue by roughly 41%.Dr Wendy Hirsh, principal associate at the Institute for Employment Studies in Sussex, remarks: ""There is a growing awareness in the UK to be inclusive. Employers realise, with the rise of a skill shortage here, that if you skew a job ad to only one group of applicants, you could be missing out on some very talented workers.""Data analytics and machine learning have certainly enabled far greater scrutiny of the language we use in recruitment, with decisions based on hard evidence rather than hunches.But as helpful as these writing services may be, some human resources (HR) experts caution against their overuse.Heather BussingWilliam Tincup worries that an over-reliance on software analysis could make job ads boringWilliam Tincup, an HR tech consultant and president of recruitment news outlet RecruitingDaily.com, says editing these job ads so thoroughly ""could water them down and make them so vanilla no one feels emotionally attached to them.""You don't want applicants to get bored by the text.""Dr Hirsh points out that where a job post is listed can also make a big difference to who applies. For example, if the post is announced on social media, those who aren't on those networks, most likely older candidates, may not even see it, she says. ""Going to a specialist recruitment agency to post the job will also rule out those who don't know about that agency,"" she adds.But despite his reservations, Mr Tincup welcomes services such as Textio and Applied. ""They're trying to solve a problem that hasn't exactly been solved, because these days so many people just cut-and-paste job descriptions, from one to the next.""Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and FacebookClick here for more Technology of Business features",,Why do some job adverts put women off applying?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44399028,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FD27/production/_101970846_aubreyblanche.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-Working Space is emerging as the core of Indian Startup’s economy where new ideas and innovation are taking concrete shape. Role of modern technology in shaping the office space ecosystem has been established beyond any doubt whether it is about simply taking the print command or analyzing humongous data for a Law firm with the help of Big Data Analysis or sorting and managing files for a chartered accountant firm.

Now the emergence of Artificial Intelligence is set to revolutionize the office space especially the co-working spaces where the most ignited and most tech-savvy brain works. Let’s imagine a Co-Working Space with the artificial intelligence facility where Saina (Imaginary Name) works for her own startup.













When Saina reached the office, the necessity of entering her details at the reception desk is being replaced by one click just after entering her log-in details.  She liked flexible office timing thereby she also not like to feel intimidated by the eye of any lady at the reception desk when she reached office little date. The moment she reached to her desk the lights get switched on as the switches are enabled with artificial intelligence simulation for effective use of the energy and to reduce unnecessary wastage. She was all set to start her work just after switching on her laptop because the work schedule has already been planned according to the client priority by the Software in her laptop which means there is no need of wasting time in scooping into the dairy pages and planning the day. Her AI enabled computer connected her with the other team members who were working from other cities because here work requires a lot of communication among the team members.
Now she needs a printout but she doesn’t want to move as it could break her continuity then suddenly She thought about TODO. Todo is the robot which makes a life of people working in the office easy by doing the office work without getting tired. She passed smiled to TODO when he brought her printouts but when TODO doesn’t react, she realized that TODO is a machine. Thank God, it’s not like the office boy in her previous workspace who use to give her irritated look when she asked for printout twice or thrice in a day. Works in offices are on the peak at around 2 pm and workers started getting stressed and same goes with Saina but she is in the workspace where artificially intelligent stress meter keep a check on her stress level and order coffee and juices regularly for her which is then Served by TODO. Thank god there is someone who understands and concern for you without even saying a single word. Now its 6.30 PM and the moment she clicked done on the last item in to-do list her laptop send her cheering smileys and suggested to stop the work and reminded her about the Stand-Up Comedy Event that is scheduled for the late evening.
As soon as she wrapped her things and moved from her desk all the lights, ACs were automatically switched off. But when she moved towards the exit gate she realized that light of corridor is malfunctioning, so she thought to raise the problem but Geny of other team has told her not to worry because there is an artificially intelligent mechanism which checks on all the devices and raise the issue as soon as any malfunctioning occurs and then there is technically equipped Robot which fixes all these problems. Saina was about to leave when she saw TODO is still working tirelessly because unlike the nagging office guy in her last office TODO is never in hurry to close the office.
Now let’s come out from this imaginary office of Saina to understand the real-life scenario of Artificial Intelligence applicability and application in the co-working space. The application of artificial intelligence is still at a nascent stage not because that co-working spaces are reluctant to the application of this sophisticated technology but since the potential of AI is humongous its application at the current level is way below its potential. But according to Mckinsey report the Artificial Intelligence and IOT are going to occupy numerous position in the workplace to make the working condition further smooth and enable for more effective use of human resources.

Here in ABL Workspaces we always eager to adopt the modern technology to achieve the greater efficiency and effective use of the resources. We are now looking forward to integrating the AI, Virtual /Augmented Reality in our co-working space to provide a better office ecosystem to the budding entrepreneurs working in our co-working space because who knows a new Facebook or Microsoft might be taking shape to lead the world in coming future in these co-working spaces.

For example, in HR, onboarding – the process of hiring new members of staff and putting them to work following recruitment– generally takes around one month, according to recent research by CareerBuilder. The various processes – taking up references, verifying identities, carrying out health and safety assessments and ensuring hires have an understanding of company practices, policies and culture – requires a complex set of actions and toolsets which are not easy to automate.
However, there’s a lot to gain – as well as driving efficiency by cutting down time spent on mundane but vital processes and compliance, automating tasks like this will free up skilled workers to apply themselves more creatively.
PROMOTED
In fact, the potential up-sides mean that automation of support functions is an inevitability, as market forces drive businesses to strive for ever greater efficiency efficiency. CareerBuilder’s survey bears this out – with 72% of employers predicting that certain recruitment and HR roles will be completely automated by 2028.

An important point I am making in many of my articles and my book Data-Driven HR is that this doesn’t mean we will replace HR departments with robots but that automation will severely augment the jobs people will be doing in support functions like HR. Parts of the workload – dealing with interpersonal or disciplinary issues – still require a human touch.
These skills are likely to become increasingly important to the HR support professional – as well as the ability to work with the automated tools taking care of the mundane aspects of the job.

This month PeopleDoc launched their solution to the problem automating the disparate toolsets used across business support functions. Their Robotic Process Automation platform uses “PeopleBots” which run alongside existing systems to “listen” for events and processes which can be automated.
The idea is that they will use analytic technologies including machine learning algorithms to learn to automatically execute repetitive tasks and follow-on actions, leading to more accurate results and reducing the need for humans to carry out tedious repetitive actions.
COO and co-founder Clément Buyse told me that they focus on HR infrastructure because core business functions, as well as sales and marketing, are already well-served with automation.
“HR is not as sexy but its very people-centric, and it all starts with the user experience,” he said.
“Now our customers are reaching a point where they would like to go further in terms of automation … they want to take a hybrid approach, mixing processes with people and machines, injecting some machine learning.”
The nature of HR and administrative tasks is that often they vary little from one business or use case to another. This means what a machine learning algorithm could learn about driving efficiency within one organization’s HR activities will carry over very well to the next operation where it is deployed.
Within an admin or HR environment, automated bots can be used to offer assistance when a user appears to be having difficulty at a particular point during a process, and therefore go on to “learn” where obstacles are likely to be encountered.
They can also be used to keep disparate records synchronized between different departments or users, and the different systems that might be in use.
For example, in the case of onboarding, an automated process could be triggered by a manager changing the status of an applicant’s file to “hired”. This would trigger documents such as application forms and resumes to be routed to the correct departments for archiving, a job offer letter being dispatched by post, user accounts created on internal IT systems and an ID card generated.
For support functions, moving towards automation is likely to present certain challenges, which will be different for each of them. IT departments, for example, may more readily take to the changing nature of the technology they are asked to work with. Legal departments may be less enthusiastic about “handing over” processes of compliance to an automated colleague. And from the top, there may be pressure from the c-suite to focus tech-driven change on sexier, customer-facing activities.
But from studying businesses which have already experienced success at implementing their own slice of the “fourth industrial revolution” it’s clear that digital transformation is most effective when it is implemented throughout an organization at all levels and functions.
This is going to involve innovative thinking as well as reassurances that technology is implemented to assist, rather than replace. But for organizations which are able to pull it all together, the rewards are there for the taking.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

She needed emergency surgery to reduce the pressure on her brain. Her surgeon, Chris Mansi, remembers the operation going well. But she died, and Mr Mansi wanted to know why. He discovered that the problem had been a four-hour delay in getting her from the accident and emergency unit of the hospital where she was first brought, to the operating theatre in his own hospital. That, in turn, was the result of a delay in identifying, from medical scans of her head, that she had a large blood clot in her brain and was in need of immediate treatment. It is to try to avoid repetitions of this sort of delay that Mr Mansi has helped set up a firm called Viz.ai. The firm’s purpose is to use machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), to tell those patients who need urgent attention from those who may safely wait, by analysing scans of their brains made on admission.That idea is one among myriad projects now under way with the aim of using machine learning to transform how doctors deal with patients. Though diverse in detail, these projects have a common aim. This is to get the right patient to the right doctor at the right time.In Viz.ai’s case that is now happening. In February the firm received approval from regulators in the United States to sell its software for the detection, from brain scans, of strokes caused by a blockage in a large blood vessel. The technology is being introduced into hospitals in America’s “stroke belt”—the south-eastern part, in which strokes are unusually common. Erlanger Health System, in Tennessee, will turn on its Viz.ai system next week.Already have an account?Log inContinue with a free trialExplore all our independent journalism for free for one month.

Today Google released a new set of AI ethics principles, which were prompted, at least in part, by the controversy over the company's work on the US military's Project Maven. This post contains some quick preliminary analysis on the strengths and weaknesses of those principles.
On many fronts, the principles are well thought-out and promising. With some caveats, and recognizing that the proof will be in their application by Google, we recommend that other tech companies consider adopting similar guidelines for their AI work. But we do also have some concerns that we recommend Google and other tech companies address:

One concern is that Google hasn't committed to the type of independent, informed and transparent review which would be ideal for ensuring the principles are always applied and applied well. Without that, the public will have to rely on the company's internal, secret processes to ensure that these guidelines are followed. That's a common (and generally unfortunate) pattern in corporate governance and social accountability, but there's an argument that AI ethics is so important and the stakes can be so high, that there should be independent review as well, with at least some public accountability.
Another concern is that by relying on “widely accepted principles of international law and human rights” for the purposes that Google will not pursue, the company is potentially sidestepping some harder questions.  It is not at all settled — at least in terms of international agreements and similar law —  how many key international law and human rights principles should be applied to various AI technologies and applications.  This lack of clarity is one of the key reasons that we and others have called on companies like Google to think so hard about their role in developing and deploying AI technologies, especially in military contexts.  Google and other companies developing and deploying AI need not only to follow “widely accepted principles” but to take the lead in articulating where, how and why their work is consistent with principles of international law and human rights.  

On surveillance, however, we do have some specifics for Google and other companies to follow. Google has so far constrained itself to only assisting AI surveillance projects that don't violate internationally accepted norms. We want to hear clearly that those include the Necessary and Proportionate Principles, and not merely the prevailing practice of many countries spying on the citizens of almost every other country. In fact, in the light of this practice, it would be better if Google tried to avoid building AI-assisted surveillance systems altogether.


We hope Google will consider addressing these issues with their principles. There may be other issues that come to light with further analysis. But beyond that, we think this is a good first step by the company, and with some improvements on these fronts, could become an excellent model for AI ethics guidelines across the tech industry.  And we're ready to hear from the rest of that industry that they too are stepping up.

On Thursday he laid out objectives for the company’s use of A.I. technology.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesBy Daisuke Wakabayashi and Cade MetzJune 7, 2018SAN FRANCISCO — Google, reeling from an employee protest over the use of artificial intelligence for military purposes, said Thursday that it would not use A.I. for weapons or for surveillance that violates human rights. But it will continue to work with governments and the military.The new rules were part of a set of principles Google unveiled relating to the use of artificial intelligence. In a company blog post, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, laid out seven objectives for its A.I. technology, including “avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias” and “be socially beneficial.”Google also detailed applications of the technology that the company will not pursue, including A.I. for “weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people” and “technologies that gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms of human rights.”But Google said it would continue to work with governments and military using A.I. in areas including cybersecurity, training and military recruitment.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We recognize that such powerful technology raises equally powerful questions about its use. How A.I. is developed and used will have a significant impact on society for many years to come,” Mr. Pichai wrote.Concern over the potential uses of artificial intelligence bubbled over at Google when the company secured a contract to work on the Pentagon’s Project Maven program, which uses A.I. to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes.More than 4,000 Google employees signed a petition protesting the contract, and a handful of employees resigned. In response, Google said it would not seek to renew the Maven contract when it expired next year and pledged to draft a set of guidelines for appropriates uses of A.I.Mr. Pichai did not address the Maven program or the pressure from employees. It’s not clear whether these guidelines would have precluded Google from pursuing the Maven contract, since the company has insisted repeatedly that its work for the Pentagon was not for “offensive purposes.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle has bet its future on artificial intelligence, and company executives believe the technology could have an impact comparable to the development of the internet.Google promotes the benefits of artificial intelligence for tasks like early diagnosis of diseases and the reduction of spam in email. But it has also experienced some of the perils associated with A.I., including YouTube recommendations pushing users to extremist videos or Google Photos image-recognition software categorizing black people as gorillas.While most of Google’s A.I. guidelines are unsurprising for a company that prides itself on altruistic goals, it also included a noteworthy rule about how its technology could be shared outside the company.“We will reserve the right to prevent or stop uses of our technology if we become aware of uses that are inconsistent with these principles,” the company said.Like most of the top corporate A.I. labs, which are laden with former and current academics, Google openly publishes much of its A.I. research. That means others can recreate and reuse many of its methods and ideas. But Google is joining other labs in saying it may hold back certain research if it believes others will misuse it.DeepMind, a top A.I. lab owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is considering whether it should refrain from publishing certain research because it may be dangerous. OpenAI, a lab founded by the Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and others, recently released a new charter indicating it could do much the same — even though it was founded on the principle that it would openly share all its research.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka.

Why Artificial Intelligence Won't Be as Bad—or as Good—as Everyone Thinks
Past technological waves have created the same hopes and the same worries over job loss.

by Milton Ezrati



 


Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) have fed two kinds of dreams, the first of the hopeful pleasant sort, and the other a nightmare. The first tells of great abundance, convenience and wealth. The other warns of job loss and widespread unemployment, among both workers and the managerial class. Both have some validity, but only up to a point. AI, like most technological advances before it, will offer society great advances in prosperity and productivity, though they will emerge at a slower pace than the enthusiasts predict. It will also take some jobs, but contrary to much commentary on the subject, it will not lead to mass unemployment. It will instead likely create more new jobs than it destroys and will create occupations that didn't exist before.

Popular commentary in the United States on this matter has given both dreams lavish attention. Describing AI and modern robotics as different from any previous technological waves, much analysis gushes about the prospects for immense convenience and great wealth. Some pieces describe a future of aristocratic-like lifestyles, except with robot instead of human servants. At the same time, commentary worries about the tendency for the new technology to eliminate jobs. A January 2018 Gallup poll concluded: ""Economists agree"" AI is the ""single biggest threat to future job growth."" Such thinking, especially within the tech community, goes on to envision the rise of a large class of permanently unemployed. It almost always concludes that the nation must care for these people and protect social cohesion by providing a universal basic income (UBI) to all, financing it with a tax on the vast wealth created by AI. Depending on who is speaking, the tax would fall either on robots themselves, their users, or their producers (but seldom the person calling for the tax.) 

Before framing policy around such thinking, all should note that America has heard this song before. Past technological waves have created the same hopes and the same worries over job loss. They have all also included calls for society to provide for a universal basic income or something much like it. In the 1930s, a group called the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) published a report blaming the widespread unemployment of the time on the use of machinery in production. Its analysis noted how in the prior twenty years the introduction of machinery into factories had cut the labor hours needed to produce an automobile by three quarters and the labor required to create a ton of steel by more than eighty-five percent. It further noted how in the prior seventy-five years, the labor needed to produce the wheat crop of the United States had fallen to a mere hundredth of what it had been. IWW thinkers concluded that those who had benefited from these surges in productivity should provide incomes to the workers displaced in the process.
If the IWW looks ridiculous today, it is only because the Great Depression gave way to a great prosperity that employed millions more. However, new calls of this kind arose again, this time amid great prosperity. In the opening years of the 1960s a large group of U.S. academics, including several economists and scientific Nobel laureates issued a report that identified the ""new kinds of automation"" as having ""broken"" the once-secure ""link between jobs and incomes."" Concerns along with these lines were in fact widespread. At about the same time as this public-spirited report appeared, American President John F. Kennedy warned how automation, among other things, pointed to a future haunted by the ""dark menace of industrial dislocation, increasing unemployment, and deepening poverty."" With this in mind, he created an Office of Automation and Manpower in the Labor Department. It would address ""the major domestic challenge of the Sixties: to maintain full employment at a time when automation, of course, is replacing man."" He followed up by recommending that Congress fund ""readjustment allowances"" for ""workers displaced by technological change."" Later in that decade, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, also worried over the employment effects of technology, brought together a panel of experts. They concluded that the government should create ""a guaranteed minimum income for each family.""





Apart from the changes political correctness has imposed on language, such concerns and conclusions sound precisely like those uttered today. And no doubt they seemed just as compelling at the time. Yet, the widespread unemployment forecast at each technological wave failed to become a lasting part of America's social landscape. To be sure, each period of innovation destroyed jobs. The railroads cost canal builders and workers their occupations. The rise of the automobile not only killed the work of buggy makers but also millions of jobs and acres of land dedicated to the breeding, training, shipping, selling, and stabling the millions of horses then needed in the economy. The invention of shipping containers in the 1950s put millions of longshoremen out of work. But at the same time, new jobs emerged from these new technologies themselves and the tremendous wealth fostered by them.

Despite the presence of concerns at each stage, jobs and wealth creation has typified each wave of technological innovation, probably going back to the invention of the wheel and the breeding of animals for draft and transportation. The statistics, sadly, do not go back as far as the wheel, but the ones we do have by economic historians verify the benefits of each advancement. For all the technological advancement over the centuries, economies, except for brief interludes, have always reliably provided work for some ninety-five percent of the population that wants to work. If technology indeed destroyed jobs, that number would have fallen over time.
Instead, often the new technology itself creates additional employment. The application of the spinning jenny and machine loom in eighteenth and early nineteenth century Britain put hand weavers and others out of work. But by creating a much more profitable trade on textiles, the inventions brought about such an expansion in the industry that it ultimately employed more people than previously, including a more significant part of the nation's workforce as well. More recently, the advancement of automatic teller machines (ATM) made everyday banking so much more efficient, the industry employed higher numbers of men and women, including the tellers that people feared would wind up on the unemployment line.

Of greater significance than the employment question is how much wealth created by each technological advance. To be sure, each wave creates a class of super-wealthy from those lucky or smart enough to have made themselves a part of it. The great American railroad barons of the nineteenth century stand as examples, as do today's computer-based tech barons. No doubt AI will create its own class of this sort. But the technology also drives the general economy, creating new demands for products and services of all kinds that in turn create new jobs. This job-producing leverage is evident in a simple thought experiment. Imagine if AI could bring the growth rate of labor productivity in America from the present pace of about one percent a year up to the two to three percent pace averaged in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. If that were to happen, the overall U.S. economy would expand at something close to 3.5 percent a year instead of the recent two percent pace. Over the next ten years, that difference would produce $3.6 trillion additional annual national product than otherwise, a huge cumulative addition.
Of course, each U.S. generation, though it has access to this history, worries that its technology is somehow different. The response is understandable. People can see the jobs the new technology will destroy a lot clearer than the jobs it will create, especially since some of the new jobs have yet to be even imagined. For instance, when containers put American longshoremen out of work in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it would have taken a bold forecaster indeed to predict that containers would be a good thing. In fact, those containers would foster a 2,000 percent increase in world trade in just five years and create more jobs for higher-paid, better-trained workers in the industry and beyond it. Furthermore, in the 1980s when widespread use of word processing drove out U.S. typists, who were mostly women, the number of women in the workforce still increased, as did the proportion of women in paid employment. The natural inability to see the sources of growth shows clearly, if rather comically, in how the 1975 report of the American Council of Economic Advisors (incidentally authored by Alan Greenspan) did not once use the word ""computer.""
There is no doubt that robotics and AI will cause dislocation and hardship for some. In this case, the nature of the new technology will extend the pain to occupations once thought immune (which may be why the fears have become unusually intense among U.S. journalists and bureaucrats.) There is every reason to seek programs and funds that can retrain and retool such people for other work. Though, as always, it is difficult to identify what that future work will involve (and a fool's game to try to identify it). The good thing is that the evidence of history, a small part of which this article reviews, and the logic of economic growth suggests that a jobless future is the least likely of outcomes and that the argument for a UBI misses that point.

The dissenting employees asked Google to swear off all military work. Pichai’s response? We hear you, but you can trust us to do this responsibly. “We will continue our work with governments and the military in many other areas,” Pichai’s post says. “These collaborations are important and we’ll actively look for more ways to augment the critical work of these organizations and keep service members and civilians safe.”
That could be read as allowing continued work on Project Maven. But Google told employees last week that it would not renew the Maven contract when it expires next year. And a spokesperson said Thursday that if Maven came up again today the company likely wouldn’t participate, because the project doesn’t follow the spirit of the new guidelines.
Although prompted by the protest over Maven, the guidelines posted Thursday address a much broader range of concerns. Google pledges to avoid creating systems that reinforce societal biases on gender, race, or sexual orientation, for example. They say privacy safeguards should be incorporated into AI technologies, which often gain their power from training on vast data sets like those Google holds from its billions of customers.
“How AI is developed and used will have a significant impact on society for many years to come,” Pichai writes in an introduction to the guidelines. “As a leader in AI, we feel a special responsibility to get this right.” Google also released a set of “recommended practices” on topics such as fairness and testing AI systems to help other companies use and develop AI responsibly.
Project Maven is a broad effort at the Department of Defense to inject more artificial intelligence into operations. The first project involved using AI to track objects such as buildings, vehicles, and people in drone video. Google’s precise role in the project is not clear, but the company has maintained that it was limited to “non-offensive purposes.”
Google’s new guidelines build on that line, saying it won’t apply AI to weapons or “other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.” The document also states that Google won’t work on surveillance technology “violating internationally accepted norms of human rights.”
One Google employee reached Thursday before the guidelines were released said that any such rules would be hard to trust if only interpreted and enforced internally. External oversight would be needed to reduce the risk of business concerns skewing decision making, the person argued. Google is bidding for a multibillion-dollar Pentagon cloud computing contract called JEDI.
Peter Eckersley, chief computer scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, agrees that Google should get outside help. “If any tech company is going to wade into a morally complex area like AI defense contracting, we'd recommend they form an independent ethics board to help guide their work,” he says. “Google has a real opportunity to be a leader on AI ethics here, and they shouldn't waste it.”
In a letter to Google cofounder Sergey Brin released Thursday, Faisal ali bin Jaber, who says his brother-in-law Salem was killed by a US drone strike in Yemen, offered himself as an external ethics adviser to Google on future defense work. “Google can protect people like Salem rather than making it easier to kill them,” he wrote. “Let us discuss how Google can set ethical standards in this area for other companies to follow, rather than be co-opted by government.”

Google’s precise role in the project is not clear, but the company has maintained that it was limited to “non-offensive purposes.”Google’s new guidelines build on that line, saying it won’t apply AI to weapons or “other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.” The document also states that Google won’t work on surveillance technology “violating internationally accepted norms of human rights.”One Google employee reached Thursday before the guidelines were released said that any such rules would be hard to trust if only interpreted and enforced internally. External oversight would be needed to reduce the risk of business concerns skewing decision making, the person argued. Google is bidding for a multibillion-dollar Pentagon cloud computing contract called JEDI.Peter Eckersley, chief computer scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, agrees that Google should get outside help. “If any tech company is going to wade into a morally complex area like AI defense contracting, we'd recommend they form an independent ethics board to help guide their work,” he says. “Google has a real opportunity to be a leader on AI ethics here, and they shouldn't waste it.”In a letter to Google cofounder Sergey Brin released Thursday, Faisal ali bin Jaber, who says his brother-in-law Salem was killed by a US drone strike in Yemen, offered himself as an external ethics adviser to Google on future defense work. “Google can protect people like Salem rather than making it easier to kill them,” he wrote. “Let us discuss how Google can set ethical standards in this area for other companies to follow, rather than be co-opted by government.”Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

Google has faced significant scrutiny over its use of AI after its work for the Department of Defense was revealed in a report by Gizmodo earlier this year. Thousands of employees signed an open letter urging Google to cut ties with the program, named Project Maven, and at least a dozen or so employees even resigned over the company’s continued involvement. 

Google says it plans to honor its contract with the Pentagon, but will end its involvement with Project Maven when that expires in 2019. A blog post by Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene described the work as simply “low-res object identification using AI.” However, it was reported that the work was, in part, a try out for Google to win a lucrative contract with the Pentagon estimated to be worth $10 billion. IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon are all thought to be competing, and a Google representative confirmed to The Verge that it would continue to pursue parts of the contract — if the work in question fit these new principles. 

Google’s decision to outline its ethical stance on AI development comes after years of worry over the impending threat posed by automated systems, as well as more sensational warnings about the development of artificial general intelligence — or AI with human-level intelligence. Just last month, a coalition of human rights and technology groups came together to put out a document titled The Toronto Declaration that calls for governments and tech companies to ensure AI respects basic principles of equality and nondiscrimination.

Over the years, criticism and commentary regarding AI development has come from a wide-ranging group, from pessimists on the subject like Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk to more reasonable voices in the industry like Facebook scientist Yann LeCun. Now, Silicon Valley companies are beginning to put more significant resources toward AI safety research, with help from ethics-focused organizations like the nonprofit Open AI and other research groups around the world.

However, as Google’s new ethical principles demonstrate, it’s difficult to make rules that are broad enough to encompass a wide range of scenarios, but flexible enough to not exclude potentially useful work. As ever, public scrutiny and debate are necessary to ensure that AI is deployed fairly and in a socially beneficial manner. Google will have to get used to talking about it.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai yesterday published his company’s new rules governing the development of AI. Over the course of seven principles he lays out a broad (and useless) policy leaving more wiggle room than a pair of clown pants.
If you tell the story of Google’s involvement in building AI for the US military backwards it makes perfect sense. In such a case, the tale would begin with the Mountain View company creating a policy for developing AI, and then it would use those principles to guide its actions.
Unfortunately the reality is the company has been developing AI for as long as it’s been around. It’s hard to gloss over the fact that only now, after the company’s ethics are being called into question over a military contract, is the CEO concerned about having these guidelines.
Of course, this isn’t to suggest that it’s a company that’s been developing AI technology with no oversight. In fact it’s clear that Google engineers, researchers, and scientists are among the world’s finest and many of those employees are of the highest ethical character. But at the company level, it feels like the lawyers are running the show.
No, my point is to suggest that Pichai’s blog post is nothing more than thinly-veiled trifle aimed at technology journalists and other pundits in hopes we’ll fawn over the declarative statements like “Google won’t make weapons.” Unfortunately there’s no substance to any of it.The The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

It starts with the first principle of Google’s new AI policy: be socially beneficial. This part lays out lip service saying it will strive to develop AI that benefits society, but doesn’t discuss what that means or how it’ll accomplish such an abstract principle.
Oddly, the final sentence under principle one is “And we will continue to thoughtfully evaluate when to make our technologies available on a non-commercial basis.” That’s just a word salad with no more depth than saying “Google is a business that will keep doing business stuff.”
Instead of “be socially beneficial,” I would have much preferred to see something more like “refuse to develop AI for any entity that doesn’t have a clear set of ethical guidelines for its use.”
Unfortunately, as leaked emails show, Google’s higher-ups were more concerned with government certifications than ethical considerations when they entered into a contract with the US government – an entity with no formal ethical guidelines on the use of AI.
In appearance, each of the seven principles laid out by Pichai are general bullet points that read like cover-your-own-ass statements. And, each corresponds with a very legitimate concern that the company seems to be avoiding discussing. After the aforementioned first principle, it just gets more vapid:

“Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.” This, instead of a commitment to developing methods to fight bias.
“Be built and tested for safety.” Pichai says “We will continue to develop and apply strong safety and security practices to avoid unintended results that create risks of harm.” It’s interesting that Pichai’s people don’t seem to think there’s any risk of unintended consequences for teaching the military how to develop image processing AI for drones.
“Be accountable to people.” Rather than “develop AI with transparency,” which would be great, this just says Google will ultimately hold a human responsible for creating its AI.
“Incorporate privacy design principles.” Apple just unveiled technology designed to keep big data companies from gathering your data. Google just said it cares about privacy. Actions speak louder than words.
“Uphold high standards of scientific excellence.” Google’s research happens inside of an internal scientific echo chamber. Numbers 4, 5, and 6 should be replaced with “be transparent.”
“Be made available for uses that accord with these principles.” In this same document Pichai points out that Google makes a large amount of its work in AI available as open-source code. It’s easy to say you’ll only develop AI with the best of intentions and use it for only good, as long as you take no responsibility for how it’s used once your company’s geniuses finish inventing it.

Pichai’s post on Google’s AI principles serve little more purpose than to, perhaps, eventually end up as a hyperlinked reference in a future apology.
If Google wants to fix its recently-tarnished reputation, it should take the issue of developing AI serious enough to come up with a realistic set of principles to guide future development– one that addresses the ethical concerns head on. It’s current attempt is nothing more than seven shades of gray area, and that doesn’t help anyone.

Facebook’s translations are now generated exclusively by AI, with approximately 4.5 billion automatic translations being made on the social network every day, Microsoft has created a universal translator, which uses AI to translate face-to-face conversations in real time, and Google Translate has generated its own neural network, allowing it to take into account entire sentences and phrases, rather than individual words — thus providing more accurate translations.Although some translators are worried about advancements in AI, others are delighted. Improvements in AI will allow translators to translate documents faster and more efficiently than before, giving them the opportunity to make more money from their craft by increasing productivity levels.Machine translation in an AI eraSince IBM exhibited the first demonstration of machine translation (MT) in 1954, MT technology has improved immensely, but it isn’t quite there yet. You’ve probably noticed that, although MT is a wonderful tool, it still has some flaws. Luckily, the exponential rate in which AI is developing is set to vastly improve the performance of MT systems.The growing popularity in MT use is evident, but it does not exclude the need for highly-skilled human translators. Improvements in MT have exacerbated the need for accurate post-editing, as the volume of texts to be translated is increasing as we witness continuing progression in MT. Accurate post-editing is especially important where publishable quality is sought, and the changing nature in the translation profession has meant that translators are becoming “revisers” as opposed to text producers.The usage of correct terminology in MT is especially important. In fact, the majority of expert discussions on using MT systems for better performance discuss the understanding that greater output begins with translation work which concentrates on ensuring terminological accuracy and reliability. For accurate results, MT systems have to be able to use resources which contain up-to-date terminology.MT users can do a lot to optimize MT quality, using term extraction methods, which can help to develop mass from scratch without prior databases. After a terminology database has been created, it should be used in conjunction with authoring and Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tools to generate high-quality texts with consistent terminology. Another way of improving MT translations is by continually feeding back post-edits of MT translations into the MT system.Source: Boston Consulting Group, Time to Double Down on AI and Robotics (2017)Google’s remarkable breakthrough in machine translationGoogle spent the best part of 2016, developing its translation app to be solely powered by AI, with remarkable results. Google Translate, which was once known for producing wooden but passable translations, is now able to generate highly accurate prose, which, to the untrained eye, could be mistaken for the work of a human translator. The New York Times has hailed this, “The Great A.I Awakening”.Source: The New York Times, The Great A.I Awakening (2016)Google’s old system was powered using a narrow form of AI, which adhered to this set of rules:· The app breaks up the sentence into sections· It translates the sections using a dictionary of statistically-derived terms· It then uses a set of rules to rearrange the translates terms into a sentence in the target languageWhile these rules make it possible to provide simple translations, they don’t take into account the complexity of language. For example, the same word being used in different contexts. The tech geniuses at Google realised this, and created a new system which has rapidly changed MT.Google now uses a Neural Machine Translation System (NMTS). This system is able to work with a multitude of languages, while learning from the language examples that it experiences. This is done using deep learning, an element of AI which involves building artificial neural networks, which are designed to mimic the way living brains sort and process information.Deep learning has transformed the machine translation landscape, by allowing Google Translate to learn from the languages it uses. For example, if the machine can translate between English and Italian, and English and French, it would be able to translate between French and Italian without being programmed to do so.Furthering its ambitious AI agenda, at its Pixel 2 launch, Google claimed that it was creating wireless headphones that will be able to translate 40 languages in real-time.Say hello to your new co-workerAlthough many professionals view AI with a large amount of scepticism, the threat of superintelligence completely replacing humans in the translation industry is virtually non-existent. No matter how complex the code is, machines simply cannot understand cultural differences or the feeling behind language.Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bristol, Nello Christiani, says, “Both neural translation and statistical translation are based on the same idea: by training a learning algorithm on a vast bilingual corpus, we can teach computers to translate new text.”Adding, “The performance is increasing, and for simple factual texts it is possible that machines will make some translation jobs redundant, such as instruction manuals for machinery. But in the areas where tone and mood need to be conveyed, when cultural references need to be kept in consideration, even cultural sensitivities, as well as artistic aspects such as the sound of a text and voice of an author, there is currently no replacement for a good human.”In contrast to the scepticism surrounding AI, technological developments have already given interpreters and translators unprecedented liberties, and translation remains listed as one of the top career paths.Piero Toto, a Senior Lecturer in Languages (Translation) at London Metropolitan University, said: “As both an academic and a practitioner, I find that technological advancements in the translation industry are occurring at such a rate that — while indeed fascinating — it has become more and more challenging to keep up.“I personally embrace the advent of AI in the translation market and in my own workflow. I can see how it’s partially shifting the role of translators and creating the need for new skills which will need to be acquired by or taught to (old and new) translators, but it’s also an opportunity for professional growth.“That’s why I advocate a closer relationship between academia and the industry to foster talents and address the needs of our ever-changing and fast-paced environment.”As AI continues to improve translation systems, translators can be optimistic about the opportunities that these developments will bring to the translation environment and to the profession in general.SourcesOng, T.

And now they're about to get way better, thanks to some new tools powered by artificial intelligence.Instead of just moving a source video’s lips and face, an artificial intelligence-powered system can create photorealistic videos in which people can sway, turn their heads, blink their eyes, and emote. Basically, everything that an actor does and says in an input video will be translated into the video being altered. According to the research, which will be presented at the VR filmmaking conference SIGGRAPH in August, the team ran a number of tests comparing its new algorithm to existing means of manipulating lifelike videos and images, many of which have been at least partially developed by Facebook and Google. Their system outperformed all the others, and participants in an experiment struggled to determine whether or not the resulting videos were real.The researchers, who received some funding from Google, hope that their work will be used to improve virtual reality technology. And because the AI system only needs to train on a few minutes of source video to work, the team feels that its new tools will help make high-end video editing software more accessible.The researchers also know their work might, uh, worry some folks.“I’m aware of the ethical implications of those reenactment projects,"" researcher Justus Thies told The Register. ""That is also a reason why we published our results. I think it is important that the people get to know the possibilities of manipulation techniques.”But at what point do we get tired of people “raising awareness” by further developing the problem? In the paper itself, there is just one sentence dedicated to ethical concerns — the researchers suggest that someone ought to look into better watermarking technologies or other ways to spot fake videos.Not them, though. They’re too busy making it easier than ever to create flawless manipulated videos.Share This ArticleRead This NextPleading the FifthWashington Post Launches AI to Answer Climate Questions, But It Won't Say Whether AI Is Bad for the ClimatePress GenerateLeak Reveals the New York Times Experimented With Using AI to Write HeadlinesWhat in the BioshockIn Fresh Hell, American Vending Machines Are Selling Bullets Using Facial RecognitionFake LoveResearcher Studying Married Men With AI GirlfriendsVirus PanicChatGPT-4o Is Sending Users to a Scammy Website That Floods Your Screen With Fake Virus Warnings",,AI Can Now Manipulate People’s Movements In Fake Videos,https://futurism.com/ai-can-now-manipulate-peoples-movements-in-fake-videos,https://wordpress-assets.futurism.com/2018/06/deep-fakes.png,,Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'https://futurism.com#organization', 'url': 'https://futurism.com', 'description': 'Science and Technology News and Videos', 'foundingDate': '2015-11-25', 'masthead': 'https://futurism.com/masthead', 'name': 'Futurism', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': '60', 'width': '191', 'url': 'https://futurism.com/schema/OrgFuturism.png'}}",,2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysing medical images is a natural fit for “deep learning”, an artificial-intelligence (AI) technique which first attracted attention for its ability to teach computers to recognise objects in pictures. A variety of companies hope that bringing AI into the clinic will make diagnosis faster and cheaper. The machines may even be able to see nuances that humans cannot, assessing how risky a patient’s cancer is simply by looking at a scan.Some AI researchers think that human beings can be dispensed with entirely. “It’s quite obvious that we should stop training radiologists,” said Geoffrey Hinton, an AI luminary, in 2016. In November Andrew Ng, another superstar researcher, when discussing AI’s ability to diagnose pneumonia from chest X-rays, wondered whether “radiologists should be worried about their jobs”. Given how widely applicable machine learning seems to be, such pronouncements are bound to alarm white-collar workers, from engineers to lawyers.Already have an account?Log inContinue with a free trialExplore all our independent journalism for free for one month.

While AI's impact is clearly top-of-mind for most organizations, governments and policymakers of different countries have also embarked on strategies to integrate AI across industries in order to stay ahead in the competitive race. Below is a global analysis of strategies adopted in different parts of the world with planned investments ahead..France.Earlier this year, Cedric Villani, a renowned and slightly unconventional French mathematician, presented a long paper on &quot;For a meaningful Artificial Intelligence&quot;. The paper touched upon various ideas on AI for humanity. French President Emmanuel Macron has shown a very acute interest towards France's AI strategy and how the disrupting technology should be embraced in the light of day..Villani, who is also a member of the French Parliament, believes that Europe has everything it needs to become a leading player in AI. Macron and Villani believe that it is not purely about economic policies but also about ethics &amp; how AI must not become a new way of excluding parts of the population. Ethics could be a core part of the European AI strategy and we can all see the measures set up by Macron unravel in the forthcoming months..President Macron also announced a $1.6 billion investment in AI including new research centers and data-sharing initiatives. When most people are concerned with the job layoffs due to the emergence of AI tech, Macron echoes a view held by many experts –  AI technology has the ability to boost overall economic productivity, wage growth and employment opportunities..China.When the world is finding ways to eliminate bias in AI tech, China is more focused to move as fast as possible. The Chinese government laid out a plan for global AI dominance in July 2017 and its goal is to lead the world in AI by 2030. With such statements in sight, no wonder other economies are bringing in their best players to this Global AI tech game..Baidu, China's dominant search engine, is betting its future on Artificial Intelligence in Asia and beyond. Robin Li, co-founder of Baidu, missed being on the forefront of the last tech revolution – a shift from browser to mobile. So Li does not want to repeat the same mistake. Baidu hopes to deliver AI tech that infuses everything &amp; every system – be it from medicine, entertainment or cars – with artificial intelligence..Tencent, another multinational internet-services company in China, aspires to add AI in all. YouTu Lab by Tencent is focused on machine learning and is credited with work in multiple technologies under audio, video and image analysis..United States.Speaking of Global AI strategy, how can we not talk about the US' multi-billion dollar hand in it. As per reports, US leads over every other country in dealing with AI hardware whereas China is ahead in mobile, data and building commercial AI companies..The Obama government was clear that AI should be a key focus of government strategy. But the Trump administration has renounced this vision – They believe that there is no need for government intervention in AI tech or even to create an AI plan. Still, whenever there is a technological disruption, leadership does matter..Core AI breakthroughs have their origins in academia, and experts suggesting that the US government must focus on funding opportunities. The US has been at the top of their AI game since the beginning of time. But the government needs to help imply existing laws &amp; regulations when it comes to certain AI tech. There have been several cases of accidents involving self-driving vehicles. Federal investigations are being taken place to check if any rules were broken..United Arab Emirates.In 2017, the UAE appointed a Minister for artificial intelligence to spearhead the country's AI strategy game. The UAE aims to build AI to speed up the government's productivity and improve overall departmental performance..The UAE has also imposed a government law on the safe use of AI. And the AI strategy issued by them in 2017 includes various sectors – transport (to reduce accidents, cut operational costs), health (alleviate chronic diseases), renewable energy (to manage facilities), education (cut costs &amp; enhance a desire for education) – are amongst the many sectors that the strategy involves..As per a report by Accenture, AI will boost UAE's economic growth by 1.6% adding a potential $182 billion to the national economy by 2035..Germany.France, Britain and Germany are fighting to attain the top position in AI in Europe. Earlier the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel announced her plans for establishing a national AI strategy. The investment is likely to be over 1 billion pounds. Merkel along with French President Macron has repeatedly called for investments in AI for Europe..McKinsey has predicted that with the right investments and the way AI is moving in Germany, by 2030 AI could dramatically boost Germany's economy by 10 billion euros..Germany also has a tech hub for stimulating an AI ecosystem – Cyber Valley. This hub is attempting to create new ways of collaboration between academics and businesses. The agenda of Cyber Valley is to attract the best brains in the area of AI to advance the R&amp;D of intelligent systems..No Country For Old Tech .Michael Chui, a McKinsey partner stated, &quot;If you look globally, it's a two-horse race in AI.&quot; China and USA are the clear leaders when it comes to AI – With their billions of dollars of investments and relentless innovative tech creations on-the-go..However, it is clear how other economies don't want to be left behind. AI is flourishing and most countries have their money and best minds working on it..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not a new concept, especially to the readers of science fiction. In recent times however, it is becoming more science and less fiction. The world of technology is changing rapidly, and Artificial Intelligence systems have been gaining widespread momentum. With sophisticated technologies being incorporated in the same, it is only a matter of time these systems start to produce marvellous inventions without human intervention of any kind. AI, simply put, is the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent behaviour. It is an umbrella term that refers to information systems inspired by biological systems, and encompasses multiple technologies including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing (NLP) machine reasoning, and strong AI.[1]
Most definitions of Artificial Intelligence in the standard texts are overly complex for a general survey of the field, so here is a simple one that will suffice instead: Artificial Intelligence is the science of mimicking human mental faculties in a computer.
Modern definitions:
Artificial Intelligence refers to the ability of a computer or a computer-enabled robotic system to process information and produce outcomes in a manner similar to the thought process of humans in learning, decision-making and solving problems.

Artificial Intelligence and IP law
The intellectual property (IP) industry is the most noteworthy market where AI could have a profound effect. With the clear visibility of remarkable extent of creativity and knowledge exhibited by AI, concerns pertaining to IP protection ought to be there in the minds of those enforcing the rights associated with the intellectual property. On this it is required to go on to the more deliberative end of the copyright debate in connection with AI solutions and the relation of patent laws with AI systems.
A draft report of the European Parliament to the Commission on Civil Law Rules on Robotics[3] mentions that in the future, AI will leave no stratum of the society untouched and also calls on the Commission to elaborate criteria for an “own intellectual creation” for copyrightable works produced through AI. Now, there are machines which automatically create works which would qualify for a copyright protection, if it were produced by a human. There have been several high degree computational creative innovations until now and this has sparked debates all over the world for the re-examination of copyright standards for AIs. Recently, a San Francisco Court denied a copyright to a macaque monkey who clicked selfies which went viral. With copyrights for animals out of the picture now, a similar situation has arisen for AIs. Recently, many copyright offices across the world have already mentioned that they would not register machine produced works. Similarly, under patent law, if novel inventions are made by AI machines, issues may arise regarding the ownership of such inventions. Without any human intervention, who will own the patents on novel inventions filed by AI machines? Will the machine/robot be the owner of future inventions? When ownership rights are distributed amongst different entities, who will be able to enforce such rights. And if an AI plagiarises a creation or reproduces an invention, how will damages be determined? These are a few basic but puzzling questions which patent laws now face.[4] With the monumental growth of AIs in every industry of the market, it is incumbent upon IP theorists and lawmakers to design laws which can be adopted in a world with AIs.[5]
Position in India
There is a wide variety of intellectual property legislations which would impact/affect the functioning of AI in India. Such legislations are discussed in detail below.
A. Copyright
Indian Copyright law requires that in order for a “work” to qualify for copyright protection, it would firstly have to meet the “modicum of creativity” standard laid down in Eastern Book Co. v. D.B. Modak[6]. From a reading of the test laid down in the aforementioned judgment however, there is no definitive conclusion that may have arrived at wherein it may be stated that an AI cannot meet the “modicum of creativity” as required.
In addition to the above, the second requirement to be satisfied by an AI when it comes to the ownership of copyrighted works is the requirement to fall under the aegis of an “author” as is defined under the Copyright Act, 1957. This would be problematic as an AI has generally been regarded to not have a legal personality. Under Section 2(d) of the Copyright Act, 1957:
2.(d) “author” means,—
(vi) in relation to any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work which is computer-generated, the person who causes the work to be created;”
The first issue under the above mentioned definition is its usage of the terms “the person who causes the work to be created”. Determining who “causes” a work to be created is a question of the proximity of a natural or legal person to the creation of the “expression” in the content in question — the more closely or directly a person is involved in creating the “expression”, the more he or she contributes to it, and the more likely he or she is to qualify as a person “who causes the work to be created”. As a result of the above, the current legal framework under the Copyright Act, 1957 may not effectively deal with/prescribe for creation of works where the actual creator or a contributor of the “expression” is not a human or a legal person. Thus, when it comes to works that are created by AI, their authorship would be contentious under Indian copyright laws.[7]
B. Patents
Section 6 of the Patents Act, 1970 states that an application for a patent for any invention can be made only by the true and first inventor of the invention or the persons provided upon request only assigned by such person. Whereas, Section 2(y) of the Act confines the definition of “true and first inventor” to the extent of excluding the first importer of an invention into India, or a person to whom an invention is first communicated outside India, and nothing further. These provisions do not expressly impose the requirement of an inventor to be a natural person. Therefore, from a bare reading of these provisions, it may be interpreted that an AI may fall under the definition of an inventor as provided in Section 2(y) of the Patents Act, 1970. However, in practice the “true and first inventor” is always assumed to be a natural person. Thus, it will be interesting to track the jurisprudence on this front especially the stand taken by the patent office when the “true and first inventor” on the patent application form is not a natural person. However, AI will certainly play an important role in the evolution of patent law itself. Sophisticated use of natural language processing has been adopted in generating variants of existing patent claims so as to enlarge the invention’s scope. The publication of these patent claims using such technology would help preclude obvious and easily derived ideas from being patented as they will form the corpus of the prior art that is available in public domain. If the trend of using such services gains a foothold in the industry, it will substantially increase the uncertainty associated with the enforceability of a patent as the risk of not discovering prior art that invalidates the patent would increase. As a result, it could be anticipated that AI would be developed to assist in discovery of prior art and correspondingly this would certainly increase the demand of AI (from a patent law perspective) in this sector.[8]
AI and IP law: A way frontward
With decades of R&D, IBM’s AI engine Watson, is now capable of detecting a type of cancer in just 10 minutes and this once helped save a person’s life. It was said that the same would have gone undetected under conventional diagnosis methods. From autocorrecting our text messages to saving people’s lives, AI has only begun influencing our lives in a great way. But IP laws are far from matching the progress being made in AIs. Currently IP law focusses only on human actors as IP creators/infringers. It is time now, for policymakers to come up with standards and liability criteria when it comes to IP surrounding AIs. It will also be interesting to see how IP sharing works in the AI realm. It is also believed that the future of many industries depend on AIs and therefore, IP sharing will be a crucial aspect of the overall development agenda and sustainability. The AIs will slowly become a part of every imaginable industry and even though the European Commission has taken baby steps in raising questions over IP laws for AIs, the future is full of intriguing prospects for innovators and businessmen, alike.
Conclusion
The penetration of self-driven cars, robots and fully-automated machines, which are currently being used in various economies around the world, is only expected to increase with the passage of time. As a result, the dependency of entities and individuals on AI systems is also expected to increase proportionately. Whilst addressing the position of Artificial Intelligence, it would be imperative that the regulators undertake a reasonable and balanced approach. A positive step towards the recognition of AIs could be that, all member countries of multilateral trading forums begin to recognise the same, for instance, in the form of an amendment to Trips.  The AIs today perform human like functions in every sphere. It would not be amusing if, tomorrow they can perform functions better than humans and take their decisions themselves. To keep a track of the same, a legislation governing AIs should be drafted, to provide for guidance/clarity as to the rights and obligations of programmers or creators of AI systems, in order to crystallise the broad ethical standards to which they are required to abide to whilst programming/creating AI and robotics systems. Due to the lack of legal jurisprudence on this subject, it is hoped that in the near future legal and tax principles are established which will not only foster the development of AI but also ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place.
