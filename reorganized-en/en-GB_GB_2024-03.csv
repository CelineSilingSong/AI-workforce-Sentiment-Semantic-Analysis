Background to the report 
AI has the potential to transform public services, but also presents risks and concerns.Jump to downloads
In 2023 the Cabinet Office’s Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) began work with the Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) and HM Treasury to develop a strategy for AI adoption in the public sector. The draft strategy has four aims:

The UK public sector will be world-leading in safe, responsible and transparent use of AI to improve public services and outcomes.
The public will benefit from services that have been transformed by AI and will have confidence that the government’s use of AI is responsible.
Public and civil servants will have the tools, information and skills they need to use AI to deliver better outcomes.  
All public organisations will be more efficient and productive through AI adoption and have the foundations in place to innovate with the next wave of technologies.

Scope of the report 
This report considers how effectively the government has set itself up to maximise the opportunities and mitigate the risks of AI in providing public services.
Our primary focus for this report is the role of the Cabinet Office and DSIT in supporting the adoption of AI in the public sector. Specifically, the report looks at:

the government’s strategy and governance for AI use in public services (Part One).
how government bodies are using AI and how government understands the opportunities (Part Two).
central government’s plans for supporting the testing, piloting and scaling of AI; and progress in addressing barriers to AI adoption (Part Three).

Video summary


Report Director, Ruth Kelly, outlines our findings on the use of AI in government.
Conclusions 
AI presents the government with opportunities to transform public services. The centre of government has identified the potential for large-scale productivity gains from the adoption of AI across the public sector.
Responsibility for AI rests with DSIT and the Cabinet Office and, while the government is working on a draft strategy for AI adoption in the public sector, it has not yet finalised it or published an implementation plan.
Our survey of government bodies found that AI was not yet widely used across government, but 70% of respondents were piloting and planning AI use cases.
Government departments are required to create AI adoption plans by June 2024.
There are risks to value for money if the government does not establish which department has overall ownership and accountability for delivery of the strategy for AI adoption in the public sector and set out appropriate roles and responsibilities for those who need to contribute.
Achieving large-scale benefits is likely to require not just adoption of new technology but significant changes in business processes and corresponding workforce changes.
To deliver the transformational benefits of AI, the government needs to ensure its overall programme for AI adoption is ambitious and supported by a realistic plan for the skills, funding and wider enablers needed.
The government must also maintain focus on addressing other fundamental barriers to AI adoption, such as legacy systems, and data access and sharing, which will otherwise limit the extent to which it can exploit the future potential of AI.

The rise of artificial intelligence can mean both progress and peril to societies and humanityEven with milestones like the Artificial Intelligence Act, recently approved by the European Parliament, global governance efforts for AI technology remain insufficientThe world must urgently come together, as the stakes are too high for inactionThe growing presence of artificial intelligence (AI) in consumers’ lives has put our societies at a crossroads, said UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan, marking World Consumer Rights Day on 15 March.The secretary-general was addressing an event in Geneva on consumer experience and generative AI, gathering international organizations, businesses and consumer rights groups.Advancing at breakneck speeds, data-driven AI holds vast promise for consumer welfare, through personalizing products and services, optimizing customer support, and addressing disputes online.But at the same time, there are growing concerns over the fair, responsible and ethical use of AI, as efforts to govern the technology continue to play catch-up worldwide.Currently, a handful of global tech giants control most of the data flows and revenues from digital services.Such concentration further centralizes the direction and benefits of AI, posing a threat to fair competition, and aggravates already existing technology divides based on geography, gender, income, and race.  “Rapid changes require rapid reactions,” the UNCTAD chief urged.UNCTAD, the UN’s lead agency on consumer protection, is intensifying calls for more awareness raising and robust global regulatory frameworks – including a new generation of consumer protection policies – to ensure AI benefits all.Red flagsMs Grynspan spotlighted not only the upside of AI, but also the red flags if the technology goes unchecked.Globally, billions of people risk being left behind in the AI revolution, with two thirds of the population in least developed countries offline and women still trailing men in internet access.There’s also looming risks of abuse, given how deepfakes could massively mislead consumers, spread misinformation and destabilize societies.Transparency, accountability, inclusivityMore broadly, UNCTAD contributes to ongoing efforts driven by the UN Secretary-General’s AI Advisory Body, tasked with analyzing and advancing recommendations on the ethical development and use of the transformative technology.It advocates for a global framework to guide fair and responsible AI, underscoring the need for transparency, accountability, and inclusivity.This entails making AI algorithms more transparent and data collection practices more responsible, as opposed to tech companies closing off their systems from public scrutiny.On accountability, developers need to ensure that AI technologies positively impact societies on the whole.Additionally, AI systems should be as diverse and inclusive as the world they’re designed to serve.Public policies need to guide innovation and the design of AI to mitigate, instead of perpetuating, human biases rooted in longstanding socioeconomic inequalities.They must also ensure that AI-powered goods and services reach vulnerable and marginalized populations.Collective action is the way forwardReining in AI for the common good requires joint efforts.For consumers and policymakers, UNCTAD highlights more empowerment through AI literacy, in terms of understanding how AI systems learn, make decisions, and potentially influence users’ choices.International cooperation will remain crucial to helping develop national strategies aligned with global principles, fostering an environment where responsible AI can flourish and consumer rights are protected.UNCTAD also calls on tech companies to adopt ethical AI development practices, prioritizing consumer well-being and societal benefit over short-term profits.“Just as previous generations tackled their technological revolutions, let us work tirelessly to ensure that the AI revolution benefits every human being,” Secretary-General Grynspan concluded, “Let this be our legacy.”

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are changing everything about the way we carry out knowledge-based work. This means that lawyers and other legal professionals stand to benefit by boosting their productivity and reducing the amount of time spent on routine, repetitive tasks.


In fact, one recent survey by LexisNexis found that half of all lawyers think generative AI will significantly transform their business, and 92 percent think it will have at least some impact.

Of course, these professions also face unique challenges around the use of this technology. In the legal world, confidentiality is often paramount, and small errors on the part of AI tools could have serious consequences on people’s lives.

PROMOTED
So should legal professionals be embracing the opportunities? In this article I’ll take a dive into the transformative impact that generative AI will have on law jobs, as well as explore how the roles of lawyers, attorneys, solicitors, clerks, judges, barristers in society could change as the technology becomes commonplace.

Exploration, Fact-Finding And Research
One of the tasks where generative AI excels is reading huge stacks of documents and working out what they mean. Most lawyers will be only too familiar with this type of work, and probably willing to let a machine do it!

It’s real value, though, lies in what can be done with the time that’s saved. Spending time with clients getting to really understand their problems is a more valuable use of expert human time and something AI won't be able to beat us at for a while.

In this area of legal work, generative AI can be used to find relevant laws and rulings amongst pages of regulations, search through databases of case law and precedents, and review evidence.
It can then very quickly translate what it’s learned into whatever format it will be useful in for whoever is going to use it – whether that’s a junior lawyer, an experienced judge or just a layman who needs to understand how the law affects them.

It can also be used to generate documents, contracts and letters. These are jobs that all need doing but eat into the time of lawyers. Soon, finding a lawyer that doesn’t use generative AI to automate these everyday tasks might be as hard as finding an accountant who doesn’t use a calculator!
Last year I wrote about work being done by the California Innocence Project. Generative AI has reduced time spent by humans drafting letters and summarizing complex documents, freeing up their time to fight miscarriages of justice.
According to the LexisNexis study, lawyers themselves believe that the top use case will be research (65 percent), followed by drafting documents (56 percent), document analysis (44 percent) and writing emails (35 percent).
Risk Assessment and Due Diligence
Another thing that generative AI is great at is predictive analytics. This means it makes it easier for lawyers to make data-driven decisions. It’s often a lawyer’s task to weigh up the chances of a successful litigation against the cost of making a settlement.
While traditional AI has been used for this kind of legal forecasting for a while, adding generative AI to the mix democratizes the technology, making it usable by professionals with little knowledge of data science.
There are ethical and business concerns here, though. Lawyers will need to be transparent with clients about what decisions they’re making with the help of AI. On top of that, this type of predictive analytics requires huge volumes of data, and it’s crucial that the data is accurate and free of bias.
Of course, generative AI can also create risks, as well as predict risks. Lawyers often have access to very sensitive information about their clients, or others involved in cases they’re working on. Putting this sort of information into public AI tools could clearly lead to serious problems.
Luckily, private AI systems, including those that can be deployed securely on-premises or in private clouds, are increasingly common. As with other professions where privacy is of paramount importance, lawyers are likely to be keen adopters of these solutions.
Access to The Law and Justice
Generative AI also has the potential to improve access to law and justice by helping lawyers communicate with clients or anyone needing help. Chatbots can help answer many basic questions that people have when legal issues arise, often without needing personal data. They can easily identify questions that require an expert human response, directing the user to the most suitable professionals.
They can enhance lawyers' ability to communicate information quickly and efficiently to their clients, keeping them updated about the latest developments in their cases. For example, one complex court judgment can quickly be summarized and explained for different groups of people.
However, its critical that oversight is applied at all times, to ensure that responses are appropriate and there are no breaches of confidentiality.
What Tools Are Available?
As well as the likes of ChatGPT, Microsoft Co-Pilot and Bard – all capable of many of the routine tasks we’ve discussed here, a swathe of specialist tools are already available. A few examples include:
Harvey, a law-focussed AI chatbot.
ExParte - a platform that uses natural language processing on top of machine learning to predict the outcome of litigation.
Casetext - an AI legal assistant that uses generative AI to review and prepare documents and conduct legal research.
Deepjudge - an AI-powered legal search engine.
The Changing Role Of Lawyers
For researching, writing, legislating, interpreting and arguing law, people will always be an essential part of the process. That doesn't mean generative AI won’t change the role, though, just as previous waves of breakthrough technologies such as the printing press, computers and the internet have radically changed it in the past.
Lawyers who manage this transition well should find that their roles become more people-focused. Their priority will be understanding clients and their legal issues in a human-to-human way. This helps to build professional relationships and trust in ways that machines may never be able to replace.
With less time spent on routine and essentially repetitive tasks, there will also be more time for educating and upskilling. Lawyers have always had to keep their knowledge up-to-date, but this could mean honing technology skills in order to best take advantage of the tools becoming available. Others might choose to hone the “soft” human skills like communication and creativity instead.
Pretty much everyone, though – and this goes for professionals in general, not just lawyers – will be expected become familiar with regulatory and compliance issues around the use of data and AI. Specifically, they will need to understand all of the regulatory requirements around the use of personal data in their field of work, as well as the importance of being open and transparent about how data and AI is used.
One thing that is certain is that the successful lawyers and legal professionals of the next decade will not be those who choose to bury their heads in the sand as this wave of transformative technology sweeps over them.
Those that are able to strike a balance between harnessing the potential for driving efficiency and growth, and navigating the (many) challenges, will be on their way to future-proofing their careers.

Innovations in the field of artificial intelligence continue to shape the future of humanity across nearly every industry. AI is already the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT, and generative AI has further expanded the possibilities and popularity of AI. 
According to a 2023 IBM survey, 42 percent of enterprise-scale businesses integrated AI into their operations, and 40 percent are considering AI for their organizations. In addition, 38 percent of organizations have implemented generative AI into their workflows while 42 percent are considering doing so.
With so many changes coming at such a rapid pace, here’s what shifts in AI could mean for various industries and society at large.
More on the Future of AICan AI Make Art More Human?
 
The Evolution of AI
AI has come a long way since 1951, when the first documented success of an AI computer program was written by Christopher Strachey, whose checkers program completed a whole game on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester. Thanks to developments in machine learning and deep learning, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and the company’s IBM Watson won Jeopardy! in 2011.  
Since then, generative AI has spearheaded the latest chapter in AI’s evolution, with OpenAI releasing its first GPT models in 2018. This has culminated in OpenAI developing its GPT-4 model and ChatGPT, leading to a proliferation of AI generators that can process queries to produce relevant text, audio, images and other types of content.   
AI has also been used to help sequence RNA for vaccines and model human speech, technologies that rely on model- and algorithm-based machine learning and increasingly focus on perception, reasoning and generalization. 
 
How AI Will Impact the Future
Improved Business Automation 
About 55 percent of organizations have adopted AI to varying degrees, suggesting increased automation for many businesses in the near future. With the rise of chatbots and digital assistants, companies can rely on AI to handle simple conversations with customers and answer basic queries from employees.
AI’s ability to analyze massive amounts of data and convert its findings into convenient visual formats can also accelerate the decision-making process. Company leaders don’t have to spend time parsing through the data themselves, instead using instant insights to make informed decisions.
“If [developers] understand what the technology is capable of and they understand the domain very well, they start to make connections and say, ‘Maybe this is an AI problem, maybe that’s an AI problem,’” said Mike Mendelson, a learner experience designer for NVIDIA. “That’s more often the case than, ‘I have a specific problem I want to solve.’”
More on AI75 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies to Know
 
Job Disruption
Business automation has naturally led to fears over job losses. In fact, employees believe almost one-third of their tasks could be performed by AI. Although AI has made gains in the workplace, it’s had an unequal impact on different industries and professions. For example, manual jobs like secretaries are at risk of being automated, but the demand for other jobs like machine learning specialists and information security analysts has risen.
Workers in more skilled or creative positions are more likely to have their jobs augmented by AI, rather than be replaced. Whether forcing employees to learn new tools or taking over their roles, AI is set to spur upskilling efforts at both the individual and company level.     
“One of the absolute prerequisites for AI to be successful in many [areas] is that we invest tremendously in education to retrain people for new jobs,” said Klara Nahrstedt, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and director of the school’s Coordinated Science Laboratory.
 
Data Privacy Issues
Companies require large volumes of data to train the models that power generative AI tools, and this process has come under intense scrutiny. Concerns over companies collecting consumers’ personal data have led the FTC to open an investigation into whether OpenAI has negatively impacted consumers through its data collection methods after the company potentially violated European data protection laws. 
In response, the Biden-Harris administration developed an AI Bill of Rights that lists data privacy as one of its core principles. Although this legislation doesn’t carry much legal weight, it reflects the growing push to prioritize data privacy and compel AI companies to be more transparent and cautious about how they compile training data.      
 
Increased Regulation
AI could shift the perspective on certain legal questions, depending on how generative AI lawsuits unfold in 2024. For example, the issue of intellectual property has come to the forefront in light of copyright lawsuits filed against OpenAI by writers, musicians and companies like The New York Times. These lawsuits affect how the U.S. legal system interprets what is private and public property, and a loss could spell major setbacks for OpenAI and its competitors. 
Ethical issues that have surfaced in connection to generative AI have placed more pressure on the U.S. government to take a stronger stance. The Biden-Harris administration has maintained its moderate position with its latest executive order, creating rough guidelines around data privacy, civil liberties, responsible AI and other aspects of AI. However, the government could lean toward stricter regulations, depending on changes in the political climate.  
 
Climate Change Concerns
On a far grander scale, AI is poised to have a major effect on sustainability, climate change and environmental issues. Optimists can view AI as a way to make supply chains more efficient, carrying out predictive maintenance and other procedures to reduce carbon emissions. 
At the same time, AI could be seen as a key culprit in climate change. The energy and resources required to create and maintain AI models could raise carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent, dealing a devastating blow to any sustainability efforts within tech. Even if AI is applied to climate-conscious technology, the costs of building and training models could leave society in a worse environmental situation than before.   
 
What Industries Will AI Impact the Most? 
There’s virtually no major industry that modern AI hasn’t already affected. Here are a few of the industries undergoing the greatest changes as a result of AI.
 
AI in Manufacturing
Manufacturing has been benefiting from AI for years. With AI-enabled robotic arms and other manufacturing bots dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, the industry has adapted well to the powers of AI. These industrial robots typically work alongside humans to perform a limited range of tasks like assembly and stacking, and predictive analysis sensors keep equipment running smoothly. 
 
AI in Healthcare
It may seem unlikely, but AI healthcare is already changing the way humans interact with medical providers. Thanks to its big data analysis capabilities, AI helps identify diseases more quickly and accurately, speed up and streamline drug discovery and even monitor patients through virtual nursing assistants. 
 
AI in Finance
Banks, insurers and financial institutions leverage AI for a range of applications like detecting fraud, conducting audits and evaluating customers for loans. Traders have also used machine learning’s ability to assess millions of data points at once, so they can quickly gauge risk and make smart investing decisions. 
 
AI in Education
AI in education will change the way humans of all ages learn. AI’s use of machine learning, natural language processing and facial recognition help digitize textbooks, detect plagiarism and gauge the emotions of students to help determine who’s struggling or bored. Both presently and in the future, AI tailors the experience of learning to student’s individual needs.
 
AI in Media
Journalism is harnessing AI too, and will continue to benefit from it. One example can be seen in The Associated Press’ use of Automated Insights, which produces thousands of earning reports stories per year. But as generative AI writing tools, such as ChatGPT, enter the market, questions about their use in journalism abound.
 
AI in Customer Service
Most people dread getting a robocall, but AI in customer service can provide the industry with data-driven tools that bring meaningful insights to both the customer and the provider. AI tools powering the customer service industry come in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants.
 
AI in Transportation
Transportation is one industry that is certainly teed up to be drastically changed by AI. Self-driving cars and AI travel planners are just a couple of facets of how we get from point A to point B that will be influenced by AI. Even though autonomous vehicles are far from perfect, they will one day ferry us from place to place.

Risks and Dangers of AI
Despite reshaping numerous industries in positive ways, AI still has flaws that leave room for concern. Here are a few potential risks of artificial intelligence.
 
Job Losses 
Between 2023 and 2028, 44 percent of workers’ skills will be disrupted. Not all workers will be affected equally — women are more likely than men to be exposed to AI in their jobs. Combine this with the fact that there is a gaping AI skills gap between men and women, and women seem much more susceptible to losing their jobs. If companies don’t have steps in place to upskill their workforces, the proliferation of AI could result in higher unemployment and decreased opportunities for those of marginalized backgrounds to break into tech.
 
Human Biases 
The reputation of AI has been tainted with a habit of reflecting the biases of the people who train the algorithmic models. For example, facial recognition technology has been known to favor lighter-skinned individuals, discriminating against people of color with darker complexions. If researchers aren’t careful in rooting out these biases early on, AI tools could reinforce these biases in the minds of users and perpetuate social inequalities.
 
Deepfakes and Misinformation
The spread of deepfakes threatens to blur the lines between fiction and reality, leading the general public to question what’s real and what isn’t. And if people are unable to identify deepfakes, the impact of misinformation could be dangerous to individuals and entire countries alike. Deepfakes have been used to promote political propaganda, commit financial fraud and place students in compromising positions, among other use cases. 
 
Data Privacy
Training AI models on public data increases the chances of data security breaches that could expose consumers’ personal information. Companies contribute to these risks by adding their own data as well. A 2024 Cisco survey found that 48 percent of businesses have entered non-public company information into generative AI tools and 69 percent are worried these tools could damage their intellectual property and legal rights. A single breach could expose the information of millions of consumers and leave organizations vulnerable as a result.  
 
Automated Weapons
The use of AI in automated weapons poses a major threat to countries and their general populations. While automated weapons systems are already deadly, they also fail to discriminate between soldiers and civilians. Letting artificial intelligence fall into the wrong hands could lead to irresponsible use and the deployment of weapons that put larger groups of people at risk.  
 
Superior Intelligence
Nightmare scenarios depict what’s known as the technological singularity, where superintelligent machines take over and permanently alter human existence through enslavement or eradication. Even if AI systems never reach this level, they can become more complex to the point where it’s difficult to determine how AI makes decisions at times. This can lead to a lack of transparency around how to fix algorithms when mistakes or unintended behaviors occur. 
“I don’t think the methods we use currently in these areas will lead to machines that decide to kill us,” said Marc Gyongyosi, founder of Onetrack.AI. “I think that maybe five or 10 years from now, I’ll have to reevaluate that statement because we’ll have different methods available and different ways to go about these things.”
Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat does the future of AI look like?AI is expected to improve industries like healthcare, manufacturing and customer service, leading to higher-quality experiences for both workers and customers. However, it does face challenges like increased regulation, data privacy concerns and worries over job losses.


What will AI look like in 10 years?AI is on pace to become a more integral part of people’s everyday lives. The technology could be used to provide elderly care and help out in the home. In addition, workers could collaborate with AI in different settings to enhance the efficiency and safety of workplaces.


Is AI a threat to humanity?It depends on how people in control of AI decide to use the technology. If it falls into the wrong hands, AI could be used to expose people’s personal information, spread misinformation and perpetuate social inequalities, among other malicious use cases.

Inflection AI
Best for conversational AI technology

Headquarters: Palo Alto, CA, USA
Founded: 2022
Company Size: Less than 100 employees
Key Products: Pi, Conversational API, Inflection-2.5
Market Cap: Private company valued at $4 billion

Inflection AI earned a formidable reputation long before it released any products simply due to the pedigree of its founders: Mustafa Suleyman, a co-founder of DeepMind and former VP of AI products and AI policy at Google; REid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn and former EVP at PayPal; and Karén Simonyan, former principal scientist at DeepMind. Unlike many of the other players in this list, Inflection AI is more focused on narrow, purpose-built generative AI solutions rather than AGI. This is evident through Pi, its “personal AI” that focuses on empathetic, conversational AI with humans.
Though Pi is still more focused on conversational AI and personal usage, the recent release of Inflection-2.5 has increased its capabilities for more technical queries and can now provide results based on real-time web searches.
While testing out these new features, I received comprehensive and accurate responses for the most part. However, when I asked Pi how its performance compares against Google’s Gemini, it told me it didn’t know of a Google product by that name. Expect to see more improvements as this new addition to the tool was only released very recently.

Company and Group Works Council agree guard rails for use of artificial intelligence (AI) 
""At TUI, we are convinced that AI does not replace jobs, but rather certain tasks. That is why we are focusing on training our employees for higher-value tasks,” says Sybille Reiss, Chief People Officer of TUI Group 
""We are utilising the potential of artificial intelligence for TUI – responsibly and with a focus on opportunities,” explains Frank Jakobi, Chairman of the Group Works Council of TUI AG. 

The TUI Executive Board and the Group Works Council have adopted a joint ""Policy Paper"" on the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The paper focuses on the potential of AI and its impact on employees. For the first time, the paper formulates guard rails for the introduction and use of AI at TUI. With this paper, the Executive Board and the Group Works Council are sending out a signal in favour of an open, opportunity-driven approach to AI technologies at TUI, which will benefit both the company and its employees. 
One focus of the paper is on training employees to make them fit for a working world driven by AI. In particular, applications based on generative AI will lead to increases in productivity and efficiency. TUI will offer extensive training programmes to enable employees to get to grips with the potential of generative AI at an early stage and to test and introduce these technologies in their own area of work. There is already high interest in such programmes, as demonstrated by the introduction of two initial e-learning courses on the topic of ""Generative Artificial Intelligence"". They were accessed by almost 7,000 employees within three weeks. 
""TUI will make extensive use of artificial intelligence in its own systems and in daily work processes. It is important to us that employees can keep pace with those technological innovations. At TUI, we are convinced that AI does not replace jobs, but rather certain tasks. That is why we are focusing on training our employees for higher-value tasks. We are embracing an important topic for the future and shaping it – openly and without fear,"" says Sybille Reiss, Chief People Officer at TUI Group. 
""We are utilising the potential of artificial intelligence for TUI – responsibly and with a focus on opportunities. That is why employees are at the centre of the Policy Paper: employment and working conditions at TUI will not deteriorate as a result of the introduction and use of AI. AI should contribute to a diverse, fair and non-discriminatory working environment. With regard to applicants and employees, the following applies at TUI: the final decision is made by a human being,"" explains Frank Jakobi, Chairman of the Group Works Council of TUI AG. 
In the paper, comprehensive and regular information and involvement of employee representatives in the introduction of new AI applications is agreed. This is already standard practice for numerous other strategic issues at TUI. In future, an AI advisory team with equal representation from the company and the employee side will monitor technical progress as well as the associated ethical issues. The committee is also tasked with ensuring health protection, particularly regarding potential psychological stress. 
At TUI, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in HR is guided by a clear maxim: The final decision-making power always lies with humans. This applies to all processes that affect employees and applicants – from application and recruitment to personal career planning, qualification options, development opportunities and salary developments. AI serves as a supporting tool, but employees are responsible for every final decision. Both employees and applicants are informed when they encounter AI applications during their interaction with TUI.

Tools such as Open AI’s DALL.E 2, SORA and Chat GPT, Google’s Bard (now Gemini), and Microsoft’s Copilot, now make it possible for anyone to create images, text and even music from a single prompt. The sector has quickly come to assert its dominance in the tech industry, with Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh estimating that the generative AI market could grow by 42% to reach $1.3tn by 2032.







There has been huge hype around the potential of these tools for fuelling creativity, with many creative industry leaders celebrating the potential of generative AI (GenAI). But what does this mean for those whose creativity is their livelihood?
Laurence Bouvard is an actress and voiceover artist, who has worked in TV, film, theatre, videogames and audiobooks. A member of Equity, she is also chair of its Screen and New Media industrial committee.
While Bouvard recognises that GenAI is not solely responsible for the insecurity of creative work, she says it has made earning a living even more challenging. “People are beginning to lose work, sometimes finding themselves in the odd position of competing with their synthetic avatars for jobs, and with very little power to do anything about it,” she says.
In the TV and film sector, Bouvard has noticed that some industry giants are already weaponising generative AI to their advantage, suppressing workers’ rights and risking their livelihoods in the process.
“There are some companies that will not employ performers unless we sign away all our claims and rights to our work, which means the companies can then sell on our work to AI companies wanting training data. There is a serious power imbalance in this way, and it has been the case for many years,” she says.
And Bouvard is not alone in her concerns. In 2022, performing arts and entertainment trade union Equity published a report titled Stop AI stealing the show, revealing that 65% of their members felt that AI posed a threat to their employment opportunities, a number that rose to 93% for audio artists.

Digital enclosure
In their book Data grab: The new colonialism of big tech and how to fight back, authors Ulises A. Mejias and Nick Couldry outline how the extractivist business model on which generative AI is built exploits creative workers by scraping content from the internet, including their copyrighted works.
They argue that the hype around generative AI hype has served as a distraction from the processes of theft and enclosure that the makers of these tools depend on, and that this enclosure has largely happened under our noses.
“Our collective cultural and social products now serve as the extracted raw material on which AI relies,” they wrote, giving the example of how Google has used 280,000 hours of music to train its MusicLM software.
“If the generated music were to sound too much like the source material from which it derived, this would open the door to potential lawsuits. But eventually Google released the programme free of charge, like most of its products. In its final form, the AI will not comply with requests to copy specific artists or vocals, allowing Google to avoid potential charges of copyright infringement.
“But there is still a corporation expropriating our cultural production as source material to train a machine to do the work of humans, because machines will be able to do the work more quickly and cheaply.”
Given the controversy around its use of copyrighted material in its training corpus, Google said in October 2023 that it would shoulder any potential legal liabilities for users of its generative AI services arising from copyright claims about the use intellectual property in its training data.


Devaluing human creativity
Outside the threat GenAI poses to workers’ livelihoods, others are concerned that the rise of the technology could devalue original art. Chris Barker, a graphic artist and art director for Campaign magazine, for example, says that people have responded to his recent artwork – a take on the Willy Wonka experience scandal that went viral on Twitter – by asking if it was generated by AI.
“I used to do cover illustrations for The New European,” he says. “It was a very fulfilling job, brainstorming ideas with the editor about the week’s political developments and then staying up late at night photoshopping a load of little Boris Johnson ninjas protecting Dominic Cummings or Donald Trump with an arse for a face. I was really pleased with the covers and they got a load of attention, but now I would imagine people would just assume it was all AI generated, which is a shame.”
Ela Lee, whose debut novel Jaded was published earlier this year, also believes that generative AI cannot replicate the labour of love that human creativity requires.
“When I wrote my novel, I thought about every word, revisited every paragraph, scrutinised how each punctuation mark affected the prose,” she says. “Whilst AI might be able to ‘write’ something that is concise and convenient in its grammatical accuracy, I worry that it veers us towards a standard that is uniform, stripped of nuance and, ultimately, lacking the human voice that makes people connect to art.”
Some creatives, however, have a more optimistic outlook of how emerging technologies might shape the future of their work.
Serenda is a music producer and artist. She believes that creatives have always been innovative in their use of technology, and generative AI will be no different: “If anything, I hope AI inspires people to take more risks and push boundaries with the art they make. If you’re constantly pushing boundaries and creating interesting and experimental art, I think you’re always one step ahead and you have nothing to worry about.”


Government inaction
Despite the concerns from workers, creators tell Computer Weekly that the UK government has been slow to introduce new protections or update existing legislation in the context of emerging technologies – such as the Copyright, Design and Patent Act or General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – and is instead prioritising tech companies self-regulation and profits over the rights of workers.
“The government cannot take a laissez-faire approach to AI in the arts and entertainment industry. The UK is an attractive place to invest in the arts and entertainment because we have a strong copyright and intellectual property framework which protects performers,” says Tom Peters, Policy Officer at Equity.
“We want to see the government adopt the Beijing Treaty to give performers more say over how their work is used. This would build a proper protection regime that would encourage inward investment and ensure performers are able to consent to the use of their work and receive fair remuneration.” 
According to advice from The Society of Authors, which represents more than 12,000 writers, authors and translators across the UK, authors ought to be required to give consent before their work is used by an AI system, in accordance with UK copyright law.
Despite government inaction, there is already growing pushback against the practices of generative AI firms, even from within the industry itself.
Ed Newton Rex was former head of studio at Stability AI, and has worked in AI and music for 13 years. At the end of last year, he resigned from the company over the ethics of using creative work and copyright content to develop AI without consent – an issue which it is facing legal action for.
In the digital world, artists are also staging protests and fighting back with tools that prevent their work from being stolen. Offline, the US Writers Guild of America strike is undeniably the most public case of worker resistance against the exploitative use of generative AI.
Following one of the longest labour strikes in Hollywood history, they saw the introduction of an agreement over the terms of use of artificial intelligence. The new terms prevent studios from using AI to write scripts or editing scripts that have been written by a writer.
Joy Buolamwini, author of Unmasking AI and founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, proposes that creative rights can be asserted using the 4 Cs; consent, compensation, control and credit.
Undeniably, creative workers have a pivotal part to play in asserting the terms of use of AI in relation to their work, as recognised by Bouvard.
“Hopefully, between collectively bargained agreements and eventual changes to legislation, this situation will change, but it may not happen soon enough to prevent serious damage occurring to the industry,” she tells Computer Weekly.

Befоre delving intо the future оf АI, it's imроrtаnt tо first grаsр whаt Аrtifiсiаl Intelligenсe is аnd where it's сurrently аt. ""AI is the аbility оf mасhines оr соmрuter-соntrоlled rоbоts tо exeсute tаsks thаt аre аssосiаted with intelligenсe.” Аs а result, АI is а brаnсh оf соmрuter sсienсe whоse gоаl is tо сreаte intelligent mасhines thаt саn reрliсаte humаn behаviоur.

Evolution of AI
The founder of computer science, Alan Turing, stated in 1947 that before the end of the century, the usage of words and general informed opinion would have shifted so much that one could speak about machines thinking without expecting to be disputed. It wouldn't be far-fetched to claim that he was correct. Because of the nature of discovery, where previously unthinkable things become commonplace, and the old gives way to the new, it is nearly incomprehensible.
The phrase ""artificial intelligence"" was first used in the 1950s, even though the idea of thinking machines is centuries old, if only in mythology and legends. Since then, artificial intelligence technology has advanced and changed in several ways, much like its applications.
The study of neural networks dominated the history of artificial intelligence from the 1950s to the 1970s; machine learning applications began to emerge in the next three decades, from the 1980s to the 2010s. Machine learning has given birth to the more nuanced idea of Deep Learning due to constant study, increased interest, and broad application. Additionally, with new chapters opening up every year, the initial research into AI's leap into the unknown has evolved into more of a leap of faith.
Future of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) has a bright future, but it also faces several difficulties. AI is predicted to grow increasingly pervasive as technology develops, revolutionising sectors including healthcare, banking, and transportation. The work market will change as a result of AI-driven automation, necessitating new positions and skills.
АI hаs аррliсаtiоns in рrасtiсаlly every field, аnd we'll tаlk аbоut the future оf АI in eасh оf the key fields.

Heаlth Саre Industries

Indiа accounts for 17.7% оf the world's рорulаtiоn, mаking it the seсоnd-lаrgest соuntry аfter Сhinа in terms оf рорulаtiоn. Аll сitizens оf the соuntry dо nоt hаve ассess tо heаlth-саre fасilities. It is due tо а shоrtаge оf quаlified dосtоrs, inаdequаte infrаstruсture, аnd оther fасtоrs. Sоme рeорle аre unаble tо ассess dосtоrs оr hоsрitаls. 
Even if yоu dоn't gо tо the dосtоr, АI саn diаgnоse diseases based on symptoms by reаding dаtа frоm а fitness bаnd оr а рersоn's mediсаl histоry, analyzing the раttern, аnd suggesting аррrорriаte mediсаtiоn, whiсh саn be ordered easily through сell рhоnes.
Adopters stand to gain a lot from adopting Artificial Intelligence in the future in the healthcare industry. The primary focus of the healthcare industry as a whole has been gathering precise and pertinent data about patients and those who enter treatment. As a result, AI is an excellent fit for the healthcare industry's wealth of data. Additionally, there are several applications for AI in the healthcare industry.
AI is easily expandable, adaptable, and applied to many business processes. We may start to understand the possible use of the technology when we remember that AI is only a computer program. Due to its ability to provide intelligence to jobs that previously lacked it, AI is being used on a huge scale.

АI in Eduсаtiоn

The level оf eduсаtiоn reсeived by yоungsters determines а соuntry's рrоgress. We саn see thаt there аre а lоt оf соurses ассessible оn АI right nоw. Hоwever, АI will сhаnge trаditiоnаl sсhооling in the future. Mаnufасturing industries nо lоnger require skilled lаbоurers, аs rоbоts аnd teсhnоlоgy hаve mоstly reрlасed them. 
The eduсаtiоnаl system hаs the роtentiаl tо be very effeсtive аnd tаilоred tо an individuаl's рersоnаlity аnd аbilities. It wоuld рrоvide орроrtunities fоr brighter рuрils tо shine, аs well аs а better орроrtunity fоr struggling students tо сорe uр. Оn the оne hаnd, рrорer eduсаtiоn mаy strengthen individuаls аnd nаtiоns and imрrорer eduсаtiоn саn hаve disаstrоus соnsequenсes.

АI in Finаnсe

Аny соuntry's eсоnоmiс аnd finаnсiаl situаtiоn is direсtly tied tо its grоwth quаntifiсаtiоn. Beсаuse АI hаs sо muсh роtentiаl in рrасtiсаlly every industry, it hаs а lоt оf роtentiаl tо imрrоve рeорle's eсоnоmiс heаlth аnd the eсоnоmiс heаlth оf а соuntry. The АI аlgоrithm is nоw being emрlоyed in the mаnаgement оf equity funds.
When determining the орtimаl аррrоасh tо hаndle funds, аn АI system соuld соnsider а lаrge number оf vаriаbles. It wоuld оutрerfоrm а humаn suрervisоr. In the wоrld оf finаnсe, АI-driven tасtiсs аre set tо disruрt trаditiоnаl trаding аnd investing рrасtises. It соuld be disаstrоus fоr fund mаnаgement organizations thаt саnnоt аffоrd suсh fасilities, аnd it соuld hаve а lаrge-sсаle imрасt оn business beсаuse the сhоiсes wоuld be mаde quiсkly аnd аbruрtly. The соmрetitiоn wоuld be fierсe аnd tense аt аll times.
Future Robo-advisors driven by AI may be expected to be more prevalent in the financial sector. For instance, new research from Wealthramp indicates that Millennials have a more purpose-driven and technologically-centered vision of the future of financial guidance. A third of high-net-worth investors, according to Wealthramp, ""use Robo-advisors and digital tools to execute investments."" Bionic advice is another growing industry that blends computer calculations with human intuition to improve client connections more effectively than either can do on their own.

АI in Militаry and Сyberseсurity

АI-аssisted militаry teсhnоlоgies hаve сreаted аutоnоmоus weароn systems thаt dо nоt require рeорle, resulting in the sаfest wаy tо imрrоve а nаtiоn's seсurity. In the neаr future, we mаy witness rоbоt militаry thаt is аs intelligent аs а sоldier/соmmаndо аnd сараble оf dоing vаriоus tаsks.
АI-аssisted methоds wоuld imрrоve missiоn effiсасy while аlsо ensuring the sаfest exeсutiоn. The element аbоut АI-аssisted systems thаt is of a little соnсern is thаt the аlgоrithm it соnduсts is nоt соmрletely exрlаinаble. The key issue here wоuld be exрlаinаble АI, аs deeр neurаl netwоrks grоw fаster аnd соntinue tо develор. When teсhnоlоgy fаlls intо the wrоng hаnds оr mаkes рооr deсisiоns оn its оwn, it might hаve disаstrоus соnsequenсes.

Transportation

If you believe self-driving vehicles are a thing of the future, think again. Smart cars have already entered the market. Just 8% of automobiles and other vehicles had AI-driven technologies installed in them in 2015, but by 2025, that percentage is predicted to rise to 109%. At the moment, connected cars are all the rage in the automotive business. These vehicles have predictive systems that reliably inform drivers of potential spare component failures, route and driving instructions, emergency, and disaster preventive procedures, and more. By 2020, connected automobiles with inbuilt wireless connections and networks will be the industry standard. The introduction of autonomous vehicle prototypes is also gradually becoming a reality.

Advertising

AI-powered systems would effectively replicate the campaign with access to historical data and provide accurate results rather than investing thousands of dollars on a campaign to see if it would benefit a certain pool of target audiences. This would revolutionize marketing by giving companies and brands a safe location to invest their funds. Smart sentiment analysis tools and approaches might make reaching out to potential consumers simpler, generating leads and converting them to sales, determining the market share of a new product before launching, and conducting competitive research.

Impact of AI
The productivity of artificial intelligence may boost our workplaces, which will benefit people by enabling them to do more work. As the future of AI replaces tedious or dangerous tasks, the human workforce is liberated to focus on tasks for which they are more equipped, such as those requiring creativity and empathy. People employed in more rewarding jobs may be happier and more satisfied.
With better monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, artificial intelligence has the potential to drastically alter the healthcare sector. AI may help medical institutions and healthcare facilities function better, reducing operating costs and saving money. Potential for personalized medication regimens and treatment plans, as well as increased provider access to data from several medical institutions, are just a few life-changing possibilities.
Privacy Risks
When seen through a privacy-by-design lens, artificial intelligence has not differed from other technologies because privacy has not been prioritized in creating AI technology. In contrast to the risk created by data breaches, the processing of personal data by AI carries a substantial risk to individuals' rights and freedoms while simultaneously carrying very little ""fallout"" for the firms involved. AI poses several privacy problems, such as:
Data persistence - Due to affordable data storage, data persists longer than the people who produced it.
Data repurposing - Data repurposing refers to using data for purposes other than originally intended.
Data leaks—information gathered about individuals who are not the subject of the data collection
Data acquired also poses privacy concerns in ai and the future of work, such as freely giving informed permission, the ability to opt-out, restricting data collection, outlining the purpose of AI processing, and even the ability to have data deleted upon request. But how would the individuals whose data was gathered, potentially due to a spillover effect, even be aware that their information had been taken to contact companies about their data or ask for it to be deleted?

Myths About Advanced Artificial Intelligence
Deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are all the same.
All AI systems are ""black boxes,"" whereas non-AI systems are much easier to understand.
The data AI systems use to learn determines how good they are.
AI systems are intrinsically unjust; 
AI will replace human work; AI is becoming more human-like.

AI and the Future of Work
If you are wondering about how will artificial intelligence change the future, then do know that robots are probably not coming for your employment, at least not yet, so you can put some of your worries to rest?
Given how artificial intelligence has been presented in the media, particularly in some of our favorite science fiction films, it is obvious that the development of this technology has raised concerns about the possibility that humans could one day become redundant in the workplace. After all, many jobs formerly carried out by human hands have been mechanized as technology has improved.

With the momentous first year of ChatGPT in the rear-view mirror, it’s clear that Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are remarkable innovations. However, we have yet to reach a point where these models are sufficiently dependable for broad enterprise adoption for anything beyond limited applications. For one, there is the problem of AI hallucinations. While it has many diverse applications, GenAI is ultimately a sophisticated autocomplete tool, like a texting or word processing tool. It has been trained to generate impressive answers from many millions of documents, so it has no problem creating answers for users. That generative aspect is useful for creative work. It can perhaps also be useful for public, low-criticality applications of AI, for example, getting help with your term paper or blog post. But for an organization’s proprietary data or curated third-party dataset, the LLM needs to exhibit high thresholds of accuracy and correctness.In technical terms, its “temperature” needs to be low. Unfortunately a GenAI with too low a temperature lacks creative spark rendering it useless. Too high a temperature and it will strongly hallucinate. The question is how to secure the middle ground between these two extremes where creative AIs can be grounded in reality to make them inspiring and correct. An increasingly standard practice involves treating the LLM as a closed box and interacting with it through modern frameworks like LangChain. The reason why this is delivering great results and removing many of the challenges mentioned is that it introduces a fact-checking layer into the LLM. The layer blocks the production of poor answers. By establishing this architecture, we can build practical business applications on top of the AI without requiring expertise in the details of owning and fine-tuning our own LLMs. This approach is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG. RAG grounds large language models on the most accurate, up-to-date information available in the underlying knowledge graph. This enhancement improves the model’s responses. RAG applications typically retrieve supplementary text to provide context to a model. Metadata, such as timestamp, geolocation, reference, and product ID, can be used to enrich a prompt or enrich a response to some degree.In the field, we’re seeing interesting applications for this trend of using advanced technology to help the fact-checker filter work better. Microsoft, for example, has created a ‘GraphRAG’. In parallel, is the rapid adoption of vector search. Vector search was until recently, the purview of a very small set of specialized databases but is now in various data platforms, from Postgres to Neo4j.Vectors are emerging as the bedrock of GenAI. They allow the arrangement of complex documents into a “vector space” and allow users to search for “nearby” content in that space. Vectors can also be mapped into other data stores using vector search. For example, with a graph database, you can resolve a vector from ChatGPT in your graph and then search the nearby neighborhood to find curated facts from your data with which to enrich or correct the response. Vectors, RAG, and knowledge graphs: the magic trio? But RAG and vector search are proving most useful where they combine to query an entire knowledge graph containing hard facts to ground the AI. Knowledge graphs enhance RAG models by providing more context and structure than metadata alone. Knowledge graphs blend vector-based and graph-based semantic searches, which can lead to more precise and informative results. So what’s emerging as the best way of enabling effective governance of LLMs through better fact-checking and answer explanations is the widespread adoption of knowledge graphs. These knowledge graphs act as a means to easily codify the facts and model the world within which the LLM operates. By using a combination of vector search, RAG, and knowledge graph interfaces, we can synthesise the human, rich, contextual understanding of a concept with the more foundational “understanding” a computer (LLM) can achieve.At the University of Washington in the US, an AI researcher named Professor Yejin Choi is exploring an application of knowledge graphs to aid AI. Choi, who was recently interviewed by Bill Gates, is working with her team to build a machine-authored knowledge base that helps a target LLM better distinguish between good and bad insights. This centres on an AI ‘critic’ program which probes the logical reasoning of an LLM to build a knowledge graph consisting of only good reasoning and facts. For example, when asked how long it would take to dry five shirts if one shirt takes an hour, common sense tells us the time should still be one hour regardless of quantity. However, an LLM may attempt a convoluted mathematical formula instead.To address this, Choi's critic contains 6.5 million distillations of symbolic knowledge that encode common sense rules and understanding. By filtering the LLM's outputs through this large knowledge base of common sense, the critic can construct a new knowledge graph containing only high-quality, logically sound information. With such results, we can get closer to getting AI to relate things and concepts in the same way that the human brain does. And we could really benefit from that approach. We have a myriad of technologies in the world of data that can summarise numbers, calculate aggregates—perform maths, essentially. What graphs are skilled at is answering the big questions: what's important in all my data? What's unusual? And importantly, given the patterns of the data, they can forecast what’s going to happen next. It is crucial to recognize that organizations globally are already harnessing the power of knowledge graphs to unlock value from their data assets. A prime example is Basecamp Research, a UK-based biotechnology company dedicated to ethically translating nature's solutions into commercial applications. To do so, it has built a knowledge graph of the Earth’s natural biodiversity, which has over 4 billion relationships. Basecamp is using this knowledge graph to train LLMs to design proteins, using a ChatGPT-style model for enzyme sequence generation.  I might not be an AI or an LLM expert, but based on Choi’s inspirational work and such use cases, I can venture a prediction about what’s going to happen next. As we move into 2024, we will see more software and database developments like the fusion of LLM, knowledge graph, vector search and RAG to make the second year of GenAI much more useful to business than the first.See also: PDFs, RAG, and LlamaParse: Generative AI's ""Swiss Army Knife"" adds a welcome new toolkit

The roles of professionals in society are shifting thanks to the development of truly useful and powerful generative artificial intelligence. Every industry will be impacted, but we have already seen that healthcare, with its heavy use of data and technology, will be disrupted more than most.


Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat disease, develop new medicines and personalize treatments to fit individual patients. It will also fundamentally change both the day-to-day working lives of doctors, nurses and other clinical health professionals and even the way they are seen by society. As a result, they will find they are more reliant than ever on the human qualities like compassion, communication and the instinct that many who fill these jobs have for providing care.

So here’s my overview of some of the most dramatic and meaningful transformations we can expect to see in the near future, as well as some of the practical and ethical challenges that will have to be overcome.

PROMOTED
AI As A Diagnostic Assistant
Generative AI helps with diagnosing conditions by interpreting data and providing clear, in-depth insights into what is known about the patient. It can be used to examine hundreds of X-ray, MRI and CT scans and quickly give a statistical summary of its findings. This will lead to more accurate, data-driven diagnosis of many common or not-so-common conditions.

This communication can then be fine-tuned depending on the role of the healthcare professional who is using it, whether a doctor, nurse, consultant or specialist. Communicating only the insights relevant to them means there will be less noise between the professional and the specific information they need.

The World Economic Forum has also predicted that generative AI will lead to improved outcomes as it becomes able to efficiently extract data from the many disparate and siloed sources that have traditionally existed across healthcare.

It will also increasingly be used to create synthetic data, which is artificially generated to resemble real-world information. This is particularly useful for situations with limited training data, such as with rare conditions and diseases. It can also reduce the security and data protection measures that healthcare professionals must take when working with real patients’ personal data. Synthetic data can also be used to simulate healthcare scenarios like pandemics or the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms that could cause a global healthcare crisis.

Automating Routine And Administrative Tasks
It will become increasingly common for medical professionals to use generative AI to automate many of the repetitive and routine administrative tasks they carry out every day. This will free up their time to focus on directly providing care, as well as continuing their training and learning.
From managing and updating patient records to scheduling appointments, healthcare professionals engage in many time-consuming tasks that can be streamlined or even entirely taken over by AI. According to one study, doctors spend half of their working day on tasks involving maintaining electronic health records.
Generative AI can drive more efficient EHR management by intelligently organizing doctors’ notes, test results and medical imaging. It can then provide quick summaries of individual patients, highlighting aspects of their health that are a concern and generating reports for other professionals. Automating many of these tasks is likely to also have the effect of reducing errors that could impact quality of care and patient outcomes.
Generative AI In Drug Discovery
The same capabilities that allow generative AI to create text and writing can also be used to develop new candidate medicines and vaccines for clinical trials. This means that researchers can speed up the lengthy process of shortlisting potential candidates.
Last year, Oxford-based biotech firm Etcembly produced the first immunotherapy drug created with the help of generative AI.
The process promises to speed the transition of potentially lifesaving new treatments from lab to patient, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. This indicates that just like doctors and nurses, healthcare researchers and scientists will also have powerful generative AI tools to enable them to work more quickly and efficiently.
Ethical Consideration: The Human Touch
Clearly, however, integrating generative AI into healthcare in this way creates a long list of ethical challenges that can’t be ignored. This is because most use cases revolve around the use of personal data. This means that safeguarding against data leaks, losses and breaches is of paramount importance.
It’s also essential that AI algorithms make decisions that are transparent and explainable—this will be crucial for building the public trust essential for these systems’ potential to be realized.
The damage that can be caused by bias in data is also more pronounced than in nearly any other field. Its been shown that generative AI models can amplify bias present in training data. We know that women and people from minority ethnic backgrounds are more frequently diagnosed due to their underrepresentation in medical studies, and this issue could scale as AI becomes more widely used.
Data, models and outcomes must all be continually monitored and updated in order to mitigate these biases, which could otherwise further perpetuate inequalities.
Like many other professionals, those in healthcare will find themselves required to learn the skillset of the AI ethicist. This means developing the capability to evaluate potential use cases in order to determine whether applying AI is likely to cause damage, risk or danger, and ensuring adequate guardrails are in place at all times.
The Future Of Doctors And Healthcare Workers
Doctors, nurses and other clinical healthcare professionals are probably more insulated than many from the risks of being replaced by AI. Their jobs require them to function at an advanced level across many human skills that machines will not replicate any time soon. Intuition and experience all play a role, and that isn’t going to change.
AI does, however, offer the opportunity for these professionals to redefine the way they work and even their role in wider society. Shifting to models of work that allow them to spend more time with patients will also mean more time to continue their ongoing education and develop their own medical expertise.
This is likely to lead to new specializations as the need grows for clinical staff focused on AI-enhanced diagnoses, data-driven medicine and ethical AI, as well as helping patients navigate the range of new AI-assisted treatment options that will become available.
With AI handling routine analysis, record keeping and interpretation of scans, imaging and other data, doctors and nurses will spend more time getting to the bottom of more complex and nuanced patient issues.
Ultimately, the essence of providing healthcare will continue to revolve around empathy, compassion and the human touch. Generative AI creates the opportunity to augment these qualities in ways that will make professionals in this field even more essential to society. Those who are able to embrace this paradigm shift will find they are able to use their skills and training to cure sickness and improve patient lives in ever more rewarding ways.

[+] capabilities and assess how it might affect your job.Adobe Stock
Almost 40% of all global employment may be affected by AI, and in advanced economies, the figure could be as high as 60%, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund. But don’t be alarmed. That doesn’t mean 40% to 60% of jobs will disappear altogether. Instead, it means that AI automation is likely to take away, streamline or enhance some of the tasks associated with those jobs. For the most part, then, we're talking about the augmentation of human jobs. We’re talking about humans working alongside AI tools, not being replaced by them.


But still, with the many headlines about the transformative nature of generative AI, it’s no wonder people are concerned about their jobs or just concerned about being left behind by this rapidly advancing technology. In this article, we’ll explore my top tips for staying relevant in the age of generative AI.

Educate Yourself
My first tip is to get to grips with generative AI. Learn what it can do. Have a play with tools like ChatGPT to see what they’re capable of. (If your employer doesn’t allow the use of ChatGPT and other tools at work, use it in your free time.) Experiment. Have fun with it. It’s also really important to grasp that generative AI is much bigger than ChatGPT and that generative AI tools can do more than simply generate text. Generative AI can be used to create audio, voices, music, images and video. It can analyze data and extract insights. And it can write computer code.

PROMOTED
I strongly recommend you go on a learning journey. There are tons of free (and paid) courses out there that cover the whole gamut of generative AI education—from beginner and general courses to focused courses related to specific industries. There are also tech podcasts and YouTube channels that can help you get up to speed.

Assess The Potential Impact On Your Job
Once you have a good idea of what generative AI can do, compare that to your job. How might the work you do change because of generative AI? Some jobs are more exposed than others. But for most, it’s unlikely that generative AI will replace your job altogether. However, it can probably take on some of your daily tasks. In other words, generative AI (probably) won’t take your job away, but it will very likely change how you work.

I suggest you break your job down into its component tasks and core skills. Which of those component skills and tasks can be done by generative AI, now or in the near future? Which tasks will continue to require the human touch?

If your job is highly exposed to the risk of AI automation, will you potentially be looking for a new job in the next couple of years? If so, what kind of work would you like to move into, and how can you start preparing for that transition now?

Even if your exposure is moderate or low, you might still want to augment your work with generative AI. Can you, for example, adapt your job so that mundane, easily repeatable tasks are done by generative AI—thereby freeing up your time for more complex tasks? Which brings us to…
Position Yourself As Someone Who Can Harness Generative AI In Your Work
Speaking at the 2023 World Economic Forum’s Growth Summit, economist Richard Baldwin said, ""AI won't take your job. It's somebody using AI that will take your job."" This means that if you don't know how to work with AI, you're in a much riskier position—certainly compared to someone who embraces AI and knows how to use it to do their job more effectively.
So, consider how you could start integrating generative AI into your everyday work. Can you use it to polish an email, for example? (Note that many organizations have policies prohibiting using AI to create content as opposed to assist in content refinement.) Can you use it as a productivity tool? To brainstorm ideas? To summarize a lengthy report into a neat paragraph?
Grow Your Skills In More Human-Centric Areas
Knowing how to work effectively with AI is important. But it’s also important to position yourself in the organization in line with the things that AIs can’t do. For example, a generative AI tool can write decent marketing copy, but human creativity and strategic thinking are vital for planning a marketing strategy.
Basically, consider how you can take on more responsibilities in the areas where human skills are still needed and will always be needed—areas like creativity, complex decision making, strategic thinking, leadership, empathy, interpersonal relationships and so on. These are the areas where humans will continue to have the edge over machines. These are the skills that I’d advise anyone to cultivate for future workplace success.
And Above All, Learn To Embrace Change
I get it; change is uncomfortable. But today's workplaces are grappling with rapid and near-constant change. So, if change is something you struggle with, now is a good time to address that.
Working on your adaptability and flexibility will help you cope with change more easily. So, how can you find ways to boost your adaptability and flexibility? Try learning a new skill, for example, or finding small ways to step beyond your comfort zone. Volunteer for different projects at work. Or find ways to flex your creative muscles (because flexible thinking and creativity go hand in hand).
Most importantly, remember that generative AI (probably) won’t take your job. But it could improve your performance and make your work more enjoyable.

Architects and civil engineers are the shapers of our urban landscape. Their work involves balancing meticulous research and design with the ability to innovate and create.

Today, AI, and in particular language-based generative AI, is set to revolutionize these fields, just as it is changing the day-to-day role of doctors, lawyers and all professionals.


The basic idea is that generative AI tools will empower them to streamline workflows and automate repetitive elements of their work. This will leave them free to focus their limited human attention on tasks that require real ingenuity and creativity.

AI can rapidly create design ideas, using generative design algorithms to create candidates using available resources and materials. It can deploy simulations and digital twins, generate project management and budgeting plans and even help to make the construction of buildings and urban structures more sustainable.

PROMOTED
So let’s dive in and take a look at the opportunities being created now, as well as think about how AI could fundamentally change the roles of professionals in those fields.

How Generative AI is Transforming Architecture and Civil Engineering Today
Generative AI functionality is now a feature of many standard CAD tools, meaning architects and engineers can quickly explore and iterate new design concepts. These designs can then be evaluated against metrics such as structural integrity, efficiency and sustainability.
Designers can simply give the AI tool details about the project goals, location, environment, structural requirements and materials, and it will start to generate ideas for consideration.
The architectural firm Zaha Hadid Architects, responsible for projects including the sand-dune-inspired Bee’ah headquarters in the Arabian desert, uses AI image generation to conceptualize cutting-edge structures. This allows different ideas around sustainability, material choices and aesthetics to be quickly visualized and assessed.

Generative AI can also be used to create digital twins – virtual representations of buildings or structures that behave exactly like their real-world counterparts. This allows them to be stress-tested to find out how they will stand up to footfall, weather or earthquakes before a single brick has been put in place. It can also model the use of energy and water as well as the movement of people and vehicles around buildings or public spaces.

It also creates opportunities in project management, where routine tasks like scheduling meetings, collating reports and filing regulatory and compliance documents can be automated.
Language models can analyze complex building and zoning regulations, and generate predictive insights into issues that could cause delays or bottlenecks during construction. These can be communicated in natural language, meaning that potential problems are more likely to be picked up at an early stage, reducing the risk of costly errors and delays further down the line.
It has been reported that architects in China used generative design tools to design a 500-room hotel complex, which was then built from the ground up in four and a half months.
Critically, it can also be used to improve the sustainability and energy efficiency of construction projects and buildings. These requirements can be factored in at the design stage, and AI can be used to identify design features and materials that minimize ecological impact and emissions.
Compared to many other industries, toolsets are already relatively mature; industry-standard CAD platform Autodesk has offered generative functionality for several years. And Alphabet subsidiary Sidewalk Labs creates tools designed to help planners create more sustainable and environmentally-friendly urban spaces, with the assistance of AI.
The Future of Architecture and Civil Engineering
I predict that professionals in these fields who are able to augment their own skill sets through generative AI will find that they can greatly boost their productivity. They will spend less time on mundane, day-to-day aspects of their work, such as creating compliance reports or communicating complex concepts to clients through visualizations.
This will free them up to spend more face-to-face time with those clients, in order to better understand their needs. And they will find themselves more able to take a broader, strategic view of project design and execution.
Human communication skills, conflict resolution, creativity and innovation – things AI won’t be able to do for a while - will become increasingly valued and sought-after in all professions, and here it will be no different.
Inevitably it also means that architects and engineers will need at least a basic understanding of these emerging technologies. While they won’t have to become experts in technical AI, they will need to understand the role of data and in automated decision making, as well as the dangers of AI mistakes, data inaccuracy and bias.
Of course, when it comes to designing buildings, roads, bridges and structures that humans will use, we can’t delegate all of the responsibilities to machines. Humans will still have to be ultimately accountable for safety. So it’s critical that we develop the skills needed to supervise the work of machines and make sure they’re acting in a safe way.
Understanding where it is safe to let them make decisions and where human oversight has to be maintained is ultimately a question of ethics. Just as is true of almost all other professionals, architects and engineers will need a grounding in the ethical implications of AI use.
Ultimately, the dawn of the generative AI era marks a turning point for anyone involved with architecture, engineering and construction of buildings and public spaces. By understanding how AI can augment and enhance human creativity rather than replace it, it will be possible to drive transformation while increasing productivity, efficiency and sustainability. All while breaking new ground in terms of what we can create in the built environment.

Oracle advances generative AI and HR into the unknown


Oracle's new generative AI tools for HR aim to reduce costs and help candidates self-select. But some users may remain hesitant to adopt the new tech.

Published: 14 Mar 2024


 
Oracle's push to automate HR is receiving a boost from its latest release of generative AI tools.
Automation is targeting HR, and tools like generative AI might help deliver results. This week, The Hackett Group released new research that found generative AI has the potential to yield a 40% reduction in costs. The study was based on client businesses, with more than half coming from companies with at least 10,000 employees.







However, Tony DiRomualdo, senior research director at the management consultancy, said the firm has not observed any impact on HR jobs and staffing yet.
""Most HR organizations are either taking a wait-and-see approach to generative AI or conducting limited pilots,"" DiRomualdo stated.
Even Oracle acknowledges that some users need to be more confident about adoption. Oracle's first release of generative AI tools came in the fourth quarter of last year, and now it's releasing another set in the first quarter of this year.
Recruiters have long been utilizing AI to assist in sifting through resumes. But Oracle is taking this a step further by helping candidates discover suitability for a role.
""We're putting that power into the hands of the candidates to better self-select,"" said Yvette Cameron, senior vice president of global product strategy at Oracle Cloud HCM. Cameron explained that as candidates explore job opportunities, AI helps them to understand whether they are a match for a particular role.
Oracle also provides customers with an explainable AI feedback feature to reveal why specific recommendations were made. ""We don't want our AI to be a black box,"" she said.
However, Cameron acknowledged that some organizations might choose to delay using the technology for now, like how some companies still do not utilize traditional AI-based ranking assistance in recruiting despite it being available for years. She emphasized that it comes down to each customer's comfort level and interpretation of state and federal laws.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has repeatedly stated that it is watching for signs of discrimination by automated decision-making systems.

Dealing with apprehension
Evelyn McMullen, an analyst at Nucleus Research, said, ""There could absolutely be user apprehension around EEOC noncompliance or inaccuracies,"" especially concerning systems that are externally facing or interacting with candidates.
""Guardrails need to be put in place to ease hesitation and drive adoption,"" McMullen suggested. For example, candidates could appeal their results to the employer or choose to opt into or out of the automated assessment, explicitly acknowledging that AI is being used.



We don't want our AI to be a black box.

Some of the other generative AI-based tools include a candidate assistant that helps applicants get answers to common questions and understand job-specific requirements in a conversational experience.
There are also new tools for managers, including a survey generation tool for quickly obtaining employee feedback.
It's too early for productivity results, as Oracle only started incorporating generative AI into its applications in the fourth quarter of last year. However, the vendor said it expects significant productivity gains for customers.
DiRomualdo said the idea that generative AI will help HR organizations do more work with fewer people is only one possible benefit. ""There is also the question of what types of new work HR will be doing in the future,"" he said.
HR can expand its services, which could include providing advice to employees and management as well as bolstering workforce engagement, productivity and well-being programs, he said.
However, HR management might be resigned to try generative AI tools if, as Hackett predicted, HR headcounts and budgets decrease slightly while workloads increase.

IBM has informed employees that it intends to cut jobs in its marketing and communications department in a major shift towards artificial intelligence.
In December 2023, the company announced a plan to replace approximately 8,000 jobs with AI, continuing the downsizing trend around the tech sector.

International Business Machines Corp (IBM) has announced layoffs in its marketing and communications division. Chief communications officer Jonathan Adashek made the announcement in an internal meeting. The development comes on the heels of an announcement in December that the company intended to replace approximately 8,000 job posts using artificial intelligence. IBM had previously cut 3,900 jobs in January 2023.
IBM has disclosed a significant pivot towards the inclusion of artificial intelligence capabilities with upskilling programs in AI as a part of its workforce rebalancing plan. While IBM has not released information about the exact number of job cuts, it is expected to account for approximately a single-digit percentage of the company’s global strength. However, the company also expects the overall number of jobs to remain the same by the end of 2024 through select hiring.

These cuts follow the global trend of downsizing in the technology sector. Until now, over 200 companies have cut approximately 50,000 jobs, including tech giants such as Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. The cuts have been driven significantly by frequent developments in generative AI ever since ChatGPT was released in 2022.
IBM itself has invested heavily in generative AI with its Watson program, with related products doubling in number since the latter half of 2023. The pivot towards AI is critical for the company to catch up to industry leaders like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Consequently, several posts, not only in IBM but especially in backend operations, could be expected to be replaced by AI in the upcoming years.

As AI-powered tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard become workplace staples and businesses are forced to be more mindful of their bottom lines, automating labor has become a logical course of action for many.Whether CEOs decide to boast about their decision on social media (we’re looking at you Duukan) or mask the changes under layoffs and company restructures, we highlight the companies that have already ditched workers for AI, as well as some that are planning to follow suit in coming years.Read on to find out which companies are swapping humans for AI in 2024, and to learn more about one of the biggest labor market disruptions to date. For Some Workers, The AI Takeover Is Already HereWhile CEOs have been utilizing AI for some time, the dawn of tools like ChatGPT has made it easier than ever for companies to speed up manual processes, and even automate certain types of knowledge work. In fact, a recent study found that half of CEOs believe they may replace jobs with AI, with the figure rising for C-suite executives.🔎 Want to browse the web privately? 🌎 Or appear as if you're in another country?Get a huge 86% off Surfshark with this special tech.co offer. For many companies, utilizing AI is a no-brainer. Not only can it be a major cost saver at a time when rising inflation rates put further pressure on bottom lines, but it can also significantly boost productivity. This is demonstrated in our annual workplace report, which found the most productive companies are those that use artificial intelligence extensively.The result of this adoption? Widespread job insecurity. While it is true most companies are planning to augment human tasks rather than replace them altogether, the actions some companies are taking are confirming commonly held fears about the direction of the employment landscape.Understandably, most companies don’t want to gain a reputation for replacing workers with AI. So if you’re curious about which businesses are automating labor, read our summary below: 8 Companies That Have (or Probably Have) Replaced Workers With AIWhile many companies have vowed to safeguard their human workforce, lots have other ideas. Here are seven companies that have already replaced workers for AI in 2024.1. MSNUS web portal and creators of the Frutiger Aero messaging platform, MSN, decided to ditch workers for AI earlier than lots of other companies on this list. In 2020, MSN sacked dozens of journalists responsible for writing news stories displayed on the company’s homepage and has since been using AI software to create the content. According to the media company that employed the staff, PA Media, these actions were in response to financial difficulties the firm was facing, but weren’t a result of the pandemic.2. GoogleGoogle has rung in the new year by announcing not one, but two rounds of layoffs, with a potential third round on the horizon. Google CEO Sundar Pichai hasn’t explicitly announced these jobs will be replaced with AI technology outright. However, the job-cutting spree, which largely affects workers from the company ad division, coincides with a heavy deployment of AI across customer care and ad sales processes, as well as a company-wide effort to use the tech to improve “operational efficiency”.3. DukaanUnlike Google, Bangalore-based ecommerce company Dukaan took a less subtle approach to AI job replacements. Last July, company CEO Summit Shah replaced 90% of customer support staff with a chatbot that was developed in-house, before bragging about the decision on social media platform X. In the post, Shah defended the actions as “tough but necessary”, as the chatbot helped the company cut the cost of its customer support function by 85%, and drastically reduce customer wait times.4. IkeaLast June, the beloved Swedish furniture retailer Ikea announced that it would be phasing out call center work and using an AI bot called Billie to answer queries instead. However, unlike most companies on this list, Ikea is planning to upskill affected employees and has already begun training thousands of call center workers to become interior design advisors.Instead of using AI to the detriment of workers, global people manager at Ingka Group Ulrika Biesert believes its use will actually lead to the creation of new jobs at Ikea, while opening up development opportunities for existing workers.5. BlueFocusLast April, Chinese marketing agency BlueFocus decided to end the contracts of its human content writers and designers “fully and indefinitely”, in favor of generative AI. While BlueFocus didn’t state publically that it would be using AI to replace staff, the action was taken just two days after the company was granted Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI service license, and just a month after they partnered with Baidu ERNIE Bot to build a full-scale AI marketing service system, leading many spectators to put two and two together.6. SalesforceEarlier this year, US software company Salesforce fired 700 workers – equivalent to approximately 1% of its global workforce. This is in addition to similar cuts that saw the company reduce its personnel by 10% last year. Similarly to Google, Salesforce hasn’t announced that these job losses are directly linked to AI. But with Salesforce’s hiring budget decreasing as it pumps more money into artificial intelligence, some argue that it’s likely that many of these vacancies will be filled by automated labor.7. DuolingoIn January gamified language learning app Duolingo announced it will be offboarding off 10% of its contractor workforce, as the company pivots to AI to translate content. Since these workers weren’t permanent employees, no worker was officially laid off as part of this process. However, a spokesperson from Duolingo explained that part of their decision to terminate these contracts could be “attributed to AI”, sending a very clear signal that the company is happy to switch out human labor for AI.8. TurnitinTurnitin is an AI detection platform, so if you thought working with AI might be a safe career prospect, think again. Last year, Turnitin CEO, Chris Caren, stated that the company would be looking to reduce headcount, during a discussion about AI in the workplace. Caren’s vision was that future employees could be hired out of high school rather than needing multiple years experience, and that the increase in AI efficiency would also reduce the total headcount needed. At the end of 2023, Turnitin laid off 15 people.It’s a small impact on a company with 900 employees, but Caren’s original vision was that in 18 months he would be able to reduce the company’s headcount by 20%, meaning those larger redundancies could still be happening in the summer.Companies That Are Planning to Replace Workers With AIFor many companies, automating labor is a long game. Here are some businesses that are planning to replace workers with AI in the future, but are yet to hand out any pink slips.IBMTech giant IBM plans to gradually replace around 30% of its back-office roles with artificial intelligence within the next five years, equating to around 7,800 positions overall. The firm has already slowed or stopped hiring for certain clerical positions, like those working in human resources.But clerical positions aren’t the only roles at risk. IMBs CEO Arvind Krishna explained that he’s also interested in replacing roles that require more complex functions like evaluating workforce composition and productivity within the next 10 years.BTBritish telecommunications company BT plans to cut around 55,000 jobs by the end of the decade and replace around 10,000 of these roles with artificial intelligence. Chief executive Philip Jansen explains that the company is set to be a huge beneficiary of AI going forward, as it gears up to streamline its customer service operations with the technology. Not all customer service roles will become automated, however, with Jansen reassuring customers BT won’t be in a situation “where people feel like they’re dealing with robots.”    Share this postfacebooklinkedinflipboardtwitter-xwhatsapp   Did you find this article helpful?

 Clearing out the latest batch of spam emails in your inbox or creating calendar events can be exhausting. With the right AI productivity tools, you can leave those hassles behind and free up extra time in your day. Here are some of the best AI tools for work. 






1  Schedule Your Day With Reclaim.ai  
    

 Reclaim.ai is a smart calendar that automatically adjusts your schedule based on the tasks, projects, and events on your to-do list. If you need to fit some studying in between a few classes, no worries: Reclaim.ai will find the perfect time, and it will schedule time for you to enjoy lunch, too. If you aren't happy with the AI-generated schedule, you can manually rearrange tasks. 

 You should consider using Reclaim.ai if you struggle to schedule your day around appointments, meetings, and other time-sensitive tasks. If you have a predictable or linear work day, you might find that an AI to-do list app is more helpful for managing your busy work days. 





 Sign Up: Reclaim.ai (free with premium plans between $8 and $12 per month; browser app) 



2  Take Notes Effectively With NotebookLM  
    

 NotebookLM makes it easy to aggregate your information, whether they're rough meeting notes or PowerPoints. This AI tool can examine, summarize, and even answer questions about the material you add to your personal notebook. 

 NotebookLM is ideal if you need to manage a personal quick-reference guide but lack the time to edit or maintain your notes. Creating a notebook is as simple as adding sources (like Google Docs, plain text, or PDFs) and entering a few smart AI prompts. 

 Sign Up: NotebookLM (free; browser app) 








3  Transcribe Team Meetings With Krisp.ai  
    

 Gathering those pesky meeting notes for your new AI notebook is easier with an automatic transcription tool like Krisp.ai. You can transcribe meetings in Zoom, Team, Google Meet, and other apps without adding any AI ""bots"" to your meeting. 

 With Krisp.ai, you can also enjoy incredible AI-powered noise cancelation. Krisp.ai is capable of removing noisy keyboards, loud voices, and yapping dogs from the background with ease. It ensures that a subpar microphone or loud environment won't prevent you from speaking audibly, clearly, and professionally. 

 Sign up: Krisp.ai (free with premium plan at $8 per month; browser app) 








4  Perform In-Depth Research With Perplexity.ai  
    

 You might need notes if you're watching a presentation, but if you're creating your own presentation or proposal, a powerful AI research assistant can help. Perplexity.ai is an ideal option, as it seamlessly combines the convenience of tools like ChatGPT with accurate, cited answers. 

 Perplexity.ai isn't suitable as a standalone research tool, but it can be a valuable asset in your toolbox if you need to streamline your research process. 

 Sign Up: Perplexity.ai (free with premium plan at $20 per month; browser app) 



5  Generate Easy-to-Read Summaries With PDF.ai  
    





 Whether you're continuing your research or catching up on lengthy new documentation, you'll find that the easy-to-read summaries generated by PDF.ai are equally helpful. Beyond its powerful ability to condense long documents, PDF.ai also lets you instantly extract sources from a document and can answer questions about the contents of a PDF. 

 PDF.ai only lets you ask 500 questions about one document per month for free, but its affordably-priced plans are worth the cost if you need to skim lengthy documents. 

 Sign Up: PDF.ai (free with premium plans between $10 and $30 per month; browser app) 



6  Create Incredible Presentations With Slidesgo  
    






 It's difficult to master programs like PowerPoint and achieve truly professional results, but with AI tools for work like Slidesgo, there's no need to limit your presentations to your Office Suite skills. Slidesgo allows you to create a presentation with the help of AI, adapting various templates to your presentation needs. 

 Each presentation template includes a variety of graphics and icons, so making your presentation cohesive is simple. The tool's AI power means it can tweak your presentations and make them masterful within seconds. 

 Sign Up: Slidesgo (free with premium plans between $3 and $6 per month; browser app) 



7  Improve Your Communication With GrammarlyGO  
    






 While AI writing tools for work might lack some sophistication, GrammarlyGO allows you to seamlessly blend your human writing with AI-guided editing. Beyond its assistance with brainstorming and paraphrasing, GrammarlyGO offers tailored suggestions to help you elevate your writing to an intended voice and tone. 

 GrammarlyGO has a few premium subscription tiers, but all Grammarly users receive 100 free GrammarlyGO prompts each month. This is more than enough to refine your emails and improve your communication at no cost. 

 Sign Up: GrammarlyGO (free with premium plans between $12 and $15 per month; browser app) 



8  Develop Ideas and Get Feedback With ChatGPT  
    






 You can't forge the perfect AI productivity toolbox without a 'jack of all trades' like ChatGPT. This versatile AI model is capable of excelling at nearly any text-related task, but it's best used for concept development. To leverage ChatGPT effectively, you need to trust it to imagine, refine, and critique your work. 

 When you pair ChatGPT's suggestions with your own judgment, you can elevate a manuscript, email, or any other work imaginable to a masterpiece. To start, all you need is a free account and a few creative ChatGPT prompts. 

 Sign Up: ChatGPT (free with premium plans between $20 and $25 per month; browser app) 



9  Keep Your Email Clean With Spark Mail  
    






 Last but not least of the best AI productivity tools is Spark Mail. This powerful email management tool lets you proactively filter which emails reach your inbox. You can view and adjust your delivery settings for each sender and, if you're tired of receiving emails from a particular sender, you can block them entirely. 

 Spark Mail also offers features like priority email filtering, grouping emails by sender, and the ability to mute email threads you no longer wish to receive. It lacks the sophistication of truly AI-powered solutions like Sanebox, but you can manage your email for free with minimal hassle by using Spark Mail proactively. 

 Sign Up: Spark Mail (free with premium plan at $8 per month; desktop application) 

 No AI tool is powerful enough to complete every task, but streamlining your workflow by building the right ensemble of AI tools is a simple feat. Ultimately, the best AI tools for productivity for you will be the ones that you can take to their maximum potential.

LinkedIn's chief economist Karin Kimbrough says AI will create more jobs than it replaces.(ABC News)2,000 per cent surge in AI jobsShe observed that the number of English-language job ads globally looking for applicants with ChatGPT or generative AI skills has risen exponentially (from quite a small number).In 2023, the number of AI-related job listings was 21 times (or 2,000 per cent) higher than the year before.""It just speaks to the employers' desire to start bringing in talent that can help them figure out how to integrate generative AI, whether it's ChatGPT or Copilot, into their own processes and systems,"" Ms Kimbrough said.""So if last year was the year where businesses were trying to build awareness around the potential of this tool, this is the year where they're trying to build towards adoption of it.""The San Francisco-based economist says certain occupations will be ""insulated"" (or protected) from AI advancements, including locksmiths, physical therapists, construction workers, doctors and nurses.As for the workers who'll benefit the most, she listed occupations in the tech sector like web designers, software engineers and user experience (UX) technicians.Ms Kimbrough said: ""These are occupations that rely on both human skills and skills that AI can replicate, which is the 'sweet spot'.""Will advanced AI lead to wage cuts? The number of job ads requiring AI skills have risen sharply in the past year.(Reuters/Dado Ruvic/Illustration)Highly skilled jobs in advanced economies (like Australia) are more likely to face ""disruptions"" from AI, according to research from the International Monetary Fund – though it didn't stipulate a time frame.""In advanced economies, about 60 per cent of jobs may be impacted by AI,"" IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva wrote in a blog post in January.""Roughly half the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity.""For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labour demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring.""In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.""Ms Georgieva also believes that AI is likely to worsen inequality across the world economy in most scenarios, ""further stoking social tensions"" unless there is political intervention. The IMF expects AI to affect 60pc of jobs in advanced economies.(International Monetary Fund)LinkedIn's chief economist agrees that the rise of super-intelligent computers could lead to a fall in salaries for some workers — with an important caveat.""If you don't evolve, then it could push down your wages,"" Ms Kimbrough said.""But what's more likely to happen is that you're going to become more productive if you do evolve, learn to develop an AI fluency [and] get used to using tools like Copilot or ChatGPT.""""Productivity generally tends to result in higher wages, so actually, I would say it's the opposite,"" she said, in relation to most workers.She predicts it will take five to seven years before most workers are expected to know how to use AI (just like they're expected to know how to use the internet now).The problem with AI biasIt's no secret that employers generally loathe the incredibly time-intensive recruitment process.Musk sues ChatGPT maker OpenAIMr Musk, who is one of the world's wealthiest people, says the AI firm he helped create is putting money ahead of benefiting humanity. Read moreFrom sifting through hundreds or thousands of CVs to interrogating the shortlisted applicants (often through several rounds of interviews), making the candidates sit an exam (for some jobs), running background checks, and rejecting the unsuccessful jobseekers.In recent years, more companies are using AI to screen candidates (including their CVs and social media profiles), predict their likelihood of success and schedule interviews.Some of the big names include IBM, Google, Amazon and Facebook.While it's a huge time saver, there are concerns that AI may not necessarily find the best candidates at this early stage of development.For instance, Amazon developed an AI tool — which it scrapped in 2018 — to recruit top talent. But its technology reportedly discriminated against women.Amazon's AI recruitment system was reportedly trained to screen applicants by observing patterns in CVs over 10-years. However, most of the applicants were men, reflecting the male dominance of the tech sector.So Amazon's computer models formed the conclusion that men were better candidates and penalised CVs that included the word ""women"" (for example, ""women's basketball captain"").More recently, Google attracted controversy with its Gemini AI bot — which can generate images based on a user's text prompt.For example, users have typed: ""Create an image of the US founding fathers"" and ""German soldiers from the 1940s"".The results were historically inaccurate, as Gemini generated images of African-American men and Asian women wearing Nazi uniforms – and 18th-century American politicians who were non-white.It appeared the app had a bias towards racial and gender diversity, and was criticised by users for being ""woke"".In February, Google apologised for what it called ""inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions"".""We're working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately,"" Google said in a statement.""Gemini's AI image generation does generate a wide range of people. And that's generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But it's missing the mark here.""Opportunities 'we can't imagine'LinkedIn's chief economist acknowledges that AI bias is a ""valid"" risk for some companies, but ultimately believes it will lead to more diverse hiring.While a human recruiter may focus more on subjective factors (such as where the candidate went to university) and their previous job title, Ms Kimbrough said AI is better at focusing on the actual skills that a candidate could offer.""It's not a tool to weed people out. It's a tool to let recruiters spend more time finding the exact perfect fit.""The idea behind these tools is to help the recruiters, for example, actually widen the net of potential applicants.""Typically what happens is you actually pull in more women than men, and often sometimes more under-represented candidates than you had before.""Could a robot do your job?Search our database of every Australian occupation to find out how difficult it will be for artificial intelligence to do your job.Read moreShe added that it's still important to have a human decision-maker be actively involved in the recruitment process as it is ""the best failsafe"".In other words, don't rely too much on one or the other.Ms Kimbrough believes the opportunities from AI will far eclipse the human cost.""If I use history as a guide, I would say it's going to create more jobs, [but] it doesn't mean that there won't be any jobs lost,"" she said.""An economist like me would tell you, it's really important to think about those who might be bearing the cost disproportionately of a transition because of technology.""But she concludes overall it will ""create more jobs"" and ""create jobs we can't even imagine"" at this stage.Cost of living: Ask us a question or share your storyAll fields are required unless marked optional.EmailCheck this box to confirm that you are aged 15 or over. requiredUnfortunately, you cannot participate in this project if you are aged 14 or younger.SubmitThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.If you're unable to load the form, click here.Posted 12 Mar 202412 Mar 2024Tue 12 Mar 2024 at 2:48pm, updated 12 Mar 202412 Mar 2024Tue 12 Mar 2024 at 7:32pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)More on:Artificial IntelligenceAustraliaCareersInformation Technology IndustryUnemployment (Community and Society)Top Stories'The cartel scouts are watching us': Driving the dangerous road to Trump's border wallAnalysis by Annabel CrabbTwo iconic images changed the US election in a way that's unfathomable in AustraliaAustralia to take command of Red Sea task force as trade route threats in Middle East persistUS Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle resigns after conceding agency failed to prevent assassination attempt on Donald TrumpFive kids, two bedrooms: Inside the battle for a better childhood educationThese American Israeli families lost loved ones on October 7.

								With generative AI, GSA encouraged its workforce to ‘explore this space’							

								General Services Administration CIO Dave Shive said agency IT leaders had “fulsome visibility” into workers’ experimental gen AI phase, setting the stage for internal policy on the technology’s usage.

When generative AI tools exploded into the public consciousness, technology leaders at the General Services Administration made the decision to let agency workers “explore this space.” 
For longtime GSA CIO Dave Shive, that decision led to some eye-opening — and head-scratching — observations of the GSA workforce. But it also provided a foundation for what would inform the agency’s generative AI policy.
“It was that transparency and visibility into what people were doing and how they were doing it and increasingly why they were doing it, in connection [with] the internal compute assets that exist in GSA that allows us to have a very broad exploration for things like generative AI across the agency now,” Shive said of the GSA’s experimental gen AI phase. 
Speaking Wednesday at the FedScoop-produced Elastic Public Sector Summit, Shive recalled the “fulsome visibility” that he and other GSA IT leaders had in the early days of the agency’s generative AI test phase. Thanks to GSA’s zero trust architecture, Shive said agency leaders were able to observe “every single action” taken by those workers who wanted to look into the tech’s capabilities.

Some workers simply explored beta sites to test how various gen AI tools functioned, Shive said, while others were “writing term papers using generative AI” and others connected those gen AI tools to “external public-facing data, which was perfectly fine.”
But there was a downside to GSA’s gen AI testing approach. 
“You also saw people trying to connect those tool sets to internal private datasets, and we needed to cut everything off,” Shive said. “We realized that we had to remind people of their data use obligations [and] their privacy obligations in this space.” 
To prevent any similar data-related miscues with gen AI, Shive and his team created a “lightweight compliance framework” for GSA workers who wanted to continue dipping their toes into the generative AI waters. Creating that ask-and-approval process seemed to fix the issue, Shive said.
“Unsurprisingly, people aren’t doing stupid things anymore, [like] trying to connect to private internal databases and things like that,” Shive said.

For an agency that historically has had more data needs and requests than it can handle, “AI has been a force multiplier in allowing us to extract value out of our data stores in ways that were just never previously possible,” Shive said, citing AI’s automation and augmentative capabilities that enable GSA to “do deep inspection.”  
Ultimately, Shive said the GSA approach to generative AI aligns with its mission as a service provider to the federal government operating in a “data-rich environment” in which “nothing is trusted — no person, no device, no piece of data, and no application.” With those assumptions baked into GSA’s mission, a curious-yet-cautious approach to AI has formed. 
“We built an ecosystem of not just the monitoring and inspection, but proofing and authentication,” Shive said, “that every day a piece of data, every device, every human, or every artificial intelligence component is fully monitored, and we can act against that.”

New York and New Jersey Legislatures Introduce Bills That Seek to Regulate Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Tools in Employment


By Hannah Morris & Joseph O’Keefe on March 13, 2024




Employers who rely on artificial intelligence driven tools for their recruiting and hiring processes may face new regulations in New York and New Jersey.  In the past few weeks, three bills have been proposed (two in New Jersey and one in New York) that follow New York City’s Local Law 144 (“Local Law 144”), a law that sets rules for certain automated employment decision tools used by employers in New York City, which became effective last July.  Similar bills were introduced in both states during the 2023 legislative session.

A bill (A. 9314) proposed in the New York Assembly on February 28, 2024, would impose requirements on employers who use artificial employment decision tools (“AEDTs”) in hiring processes.  This bill is similar to Local Law 144, which we reported on here and here.  However, the new Assembly bill only targets tools used for screening and hiring applicants, while Local Law 144 also included tools used for assessing employees for advancement.  The bill would add a new section to the New York Labor Law, which would make it an unlawful employment practice for employers to screen applicants with an AEDT for jobs “within the state,” unless the AEDT was subject to a disparate impact analysis in the past year.  The bill defines AEDT as “any system used to filter employment candidates or prospective candidates for hire in a way that establishes a preferred candidate or candidates without relying on candidate-specific assessment by individual decision-makers.”  While the bill explicitly states that the disparate impact analysis would not need to be publicly filed and would be “subject to all applicable privileges,” it does require that prior to the implementation of an AEDT, employers would need to post a “summary of the most recent disparate impact analysis” and “the distribution date of the tool” on its website.  The employer would also be required to provide the state’s Department of Labor with this summary on an annual basis.  Unlike Local Law 144, New York’s proposed law does not provide for civil monetary penalties for employer violations.  Rather, the state’s Attorney General or Department of Labor Commissioner would be able to initiate investigation into possible violations and could bring actions in court to correct alleged violations.  If enacted, the bill would go into immediate effect.
Similarly, the New Jersey legislature introduced two bills (A. 3854 and A. 3911) which also aim to regulate employers’ use of AI tools in hiring.  A. 3854, like New York’s proposed bill, generally mirrors Local Law 144 and seeks to regulate AEDTs in hiring.  The stated goal of the bill is to “minimize employment discrimination that may result from the use of the tools.”  A. 3854 first defines an AEDT as “any system the function of which is governed by statistical theory, or systems the parameters of which are defined by systems…which automatically filter candidates or prospective candidates for hire or for any term, condition, or privilege of employment in a way that establishes a preferred candidate or candidates.”  Unlike the New York bill, A. 3854 would make it unlawful to sell, or offer to sell, an AEDT in the state unless (i) the AEDT has been the subject of a bias audit conducted in the past year prior to its sale; (ii) the sale of the AEDT includes, at no additional cost, an annual bias audit service that provides the results of such audit to the buyer; and (iii) the AEDT is sold, or offered for sale, with a notice stating that the AEDT is subject to the provisions of the proposed law.  Moreover, any “person” who uses an AEDT to screen a prospective job candidate would have to provide a summary on its website of the most recent bias audit, and notify each job candidate within 30 days of the AEDT’s use that an AEDT was used in connection with their candidacy, identifies the job qualifications or characteristics that the AEDT used to assess the candidate and, upon the candidate’s request, identifies the source of the data collected and the employer’s data retention policy.  Penalties for violations would range from $500 for a first offense (and each violation occurring on the same day as the first one) and a $500 to $1500 penalty for each subsequent offense.  Finally, the bill specifies that violations accrue on a daily basis for each AEDT that is sold or offered for sale in violation of the proposed law, and that “each instance” in which notice is not provided to a job candidate within 30 days constitutes a single violation, while each 30-day period thereafter constitutes a separate violation.  If the bill is enacted, it would take effect on the “first day of the third month next following enactment.”
The second New Jersey bill, A. 3911, concerns the use of AI-enabled video interviews during the hiring process.  The bill provides that “an employer in the State” that requests job candidates to record video interviews, and uses AI analysis of the videos submitted, would be required do the following: (i) “notify the applicant before the interview that [AI] may be used to analyze the applicant’s video interview and consider the applicant’s fitness for the position;” (2) “provide an applicant with information before the interview explaining how the [AI] works and what general types of characteristics it uses to evaluate applicants;” and (3) “obtain, before the interview, written consent, which may be electronic, from the applicant to be evaluated by the [AI] program.”  The proposed law would prohibit employers from using AI analysis to evaluate applicants who have not consented to its use.  Further, within 30 days of receiving a request from an applicant, an employer would have to delete the applicant’s interviews and instruct any other persons who received copies to delete the videos.  The proposed law would also direct employers who use AI analysis of video interviews to “collect and report” the race and ethnicity of applicants who are and are not offered opportunities for in-person interviews, or who are and are not offered positions.  This information would need to be reported on an annual basis to the state’s Department of Labor and Workforce Development (the “Department”).  The Department would then report to the Governor and State Legislature whether the data discloses racial bias in the use of AI.  Penalties for violations would include a $500 fine for a first offense and a $1,000 fine for subsequent offenses.  If enacted, the proposed law would take effect immediately.
We expect that we will see AI related legislative and regulatory activity this year in multiple jurisdictions.  We will keep monitoring further developments.

After that, electricity got invented, the second industrial revolution, and people said, oh, all the manual processes are going to be now automated and jobs will go away. Then came computers, the internet, and people said, oh, now computers will take away all the jobs.

The good part of AI is that it reduces the learning curve a lot so people can learn faster. You know the difference between the previous era and this era is in the previous era we used computers and automation to bring information at your fingertips. That&#039;s what people try to do. They try to digitise places, they try to digitise people, they try to digitise data. In this era it is about expertise at your fingertips. So even a common person by using a lot of these AI-generated models can produce better results. So skilling will be very very important and redeployment.&amp;quot;Echoing similar sentiments, Vyshak Venugopalan from Adobe highlighted the potential of AI to democratize creativity while simultaneously raising the standards of professional work: “We also believe the same which is AI and the powerful child of AI which is generative AI will lower the floor so that more people can enter. It will democratize creativity to a large extent. At the same time, it will also elevate the ceiling so that we all will be driven with the help of enablement and education.

Large language models (LLMs) are a paradigm-changing innovation in data science. They extend the capabilities of machine learning models to generating relevant text and images in response to a wide array of qualitative prompts. While these tools are expensive and difficult to build, multitudes of users can use them quickly and cheaply to perform some of the language-based tasks that only humans could do before.
This raises the possibility that many human jobs — particularly knowledge-intensive jobs that primarily involve working with text or code — could be replaced or significantly undercut by widespread adoption of this technology. But in reality, LLMs are much more complicated to use effectively in an organizational context than is typically acknowledged, and they have yet to demonstrate that they can satisfactorily perform all of the tasks that knowledge workers execute in any given job.

LLMs in Organizations
Most of the potential areas of use for LLMs center on manipulating existing information, much of it specific to an individual organization. This includes summarizing content and producing reports (which represents 35% of use cases, according to one survey) and extracting information from documents, such as PDFs containing financial information, and creating tables from them (33% of use cases).1 Other popular and effective uses of LLMs include creating images with tools like Dall-E 2 or generating synthetic data for applications when real data is difficult to obtain, such as data to train voice recognition tools like Amazon’s Alexa.2
Most organizations using LLMs are still in the exploration phase. Customer interactions, knowledge management, and software engineering are three areas of extensive organizational experiments with generative AI. For example, Audi recruited a vendor to build and deploy a customized LLM-based chatbot that would answer employees’ questions about available documentation, customer details, and risk evaluations. The chatbot retrieves relevant information from a variety of proprietary databases in real time and is supposed to avoid answering questions if the available data is insufficient. The company used prompt engineering tools developed by Amazon Web Services for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a common customization procedure that uses organization-specific data without requiring changes to the underlying foundation model.

Generative AI has emerged as a transformational force in computing, but it’s not always clear how to utilize it when designing new products. At Microsoft, our teams are learning how to incorporate Microsoft Copilot and other new AI technology into their everyday work.
Our UX designers and managers in Microsoft Digital (MSD), the company’s IT organization, are on the cutting edge of the shift that AI is bringing to modern engineering. And we’re now able to share their in-the-trenches observations on how generative AI is and will change the way they work.
Immediate impact
One of the first dramatic changes we’ve seen since incorporating generative AI into our workflows, is that our product designers no longer need to create mockups of every screen in a product—now there’s a better way.
Now it’s like creating a book where the pages are always changing. At the critical junction in the UX, where humans interact with Copilot, the AI transforms into the conductor of the user experience. This shift is enabling our designers to move away from defining fixed flows to embracing a non-deterministic design style orchestrated by the AI.
—Yannis Paniaras, principal designer, Microsoft Digital Studio

“Now it’s like creating a book where the pages are always changing,” says Yannis Paniaras, a principal designer in the Microsoft Digital Studio. “At the critical junction in the UX, where humans interact with Copilot, the AI transforms into the conductor of the user experience. This shift is enabling our designers to move away from defining fixed flows to embracing a non-deterministic design style orchestrated by the AI.”
Microsoft Digital Studio is our team of designers and researchers in MSD. The MSD Studio team is committed to using their expertise in design, research, content strategy, accessibility, and product planning to create experiences that empower Microsoft employees to achieve more in their lives.
Paniaras has observed that designing an AI-enabled product is very different from designing a traditional desktop or mobile app. In conversations with designers, program managers, and developers, he frequently encounters questions about how various product-making disciplines should coordinate their work in this new context.
“We have Copilot, powered by a large language model (LLM), and we use Fluent AI design language for experiences that rely on lean graphical user interfaces with dynamic prompts and dynamically generated, contextual cards,” Paniaras says. “These provide just-in-time user interface elements that map to the generative flow. Consequently, designers are shifting their focus from standard UI towards the vocabulary of prompts, dynamically designed adaptive cards, and on finding consistency withing the UX context. These elements are becoming the new building blocks of AI-based UX design.”
The MSD Studio team’s designers still work in Figma, the popular design and prototyping tool, but their designs need to remain open-ended and sometimes more abstract, rather than a set of fixed linear designs.
With all the power of generative AI, user experience and design are still responsible for the quality of the experience and the outcome, so we’re finding ways to scale working with engineering and data science.
—Laura Bergstrom, principal UX manager, Unified Employee Experience team

“The design becomes a set of probabilities,” Paniaras says. “While this poses a challenge for designers, it also encourages us to collaborate more closely with everyone else.”
Laura Bergstrom, a principal UX manager for the Unified Employee Experience team, adds that content designers and designers on her team developed guidance for engineers to scale Copilot responses creating consistent, reliable responses with the right tone of voice at the right time.
“With all the power of generative AI, user experience and design are still responsible for the quality of the experience and the outcome, so we’re finding ways to scale working with engineering and data science,” Bergstrom says.
Spurring collaboration with AI
Using AI to quickly align plans and goals is causing a shift in the way the entire product-making crew works together. “All the different disciplines are working together to get things in place,” Paniaras says.
He tells a story of a designer who worked concurrently with PMs and engineers to design prompts, comparing it with the previous way of doing things.
“It used to be different: you had research, based on that you would have ideas, prototype certain things, build them, then engineers would test them,” Paniaras says. “It was more linear.”
I need to figure out what the user wants. When we build an application, I need to know where they are coming from, what they want to do, and where the experience that we’re building for them will break down.
—Victor Albahadly, senior UX designer in MSD Studio

Modern engineering with AI requires a shift to a more collaborative culture on product teams, where there aren’t clear lines of ownership and people can work flexibly together. It’s similar to the shift that engineering went through from the waterfall approach to agile, when instead of owning specific pieces, engineers swarmed over one part of the product for a sprint, then swarmed on another part in the next sprint.
 
We’re shifting from a fixed, traditional UX approach to AI-influenced UX. With traditional UX, the UI is central and static, mapping out all possible user interactions. The surrounding UX context has a minor role, not influencing the UI dynamically. In AI UX, the UI is minimized, signifying a responsive and adaptive approach that relies on AI for real-time user interaction. Here, the UX context is amplified, reflecting the system’s capacity to accommodate various user environments, thereby shaping a more tailored experience.




Streamlining design with AI
AI is helping us test our designs more fully and to ship them more quickly. Here are some of our top tips for doing the same at your company.
 

Personalized Recommendations: AI can analyze user behavior and preferences, providing designers with insights to create personalized user experiences tailored to individual needs.
Efficient Prototyping: AI-powered tools can automate prototyping processes, speeding up design iterations and allowing designers to explore multiple concepts more efficiently.
Data-Driven Decision Making: By leveraging AI analytics, designers can make informed decisions based on user data, ensuring that design choices are backed by insights into user interactions and preferences.
User Behavior Prediction: AI algorithms can predict user behavior patterns, helping designers anticipate user actions and design interfaces that align with user expectations, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction.
Accessibility Integration: AI can assist designers in creating more accessible designs by identifying potential accessibility issues and suggesting improvements, ensuring that digital products are inclusive and user-friendly for all.




Victor Albahadly, a senior UX designer in MSD Studio, says AI has potential to transform the way he does his core job, which is to test to find out where the designs he and his team build breakdown and fail to meet the needs of the people who will use them.
“I need to figure out what the user wants,” Albahadly says. “When we build an application, I need to know where they are coming from, what they want to do, and where the experience that we’re building for them will break down.”
The challenge is that he has to sample the experiences users have with his designs and extrapolate what he learns to the rest of the design. And importantly, he does this at scale—not for just one person, but for all the people who use the application.
“I need to test how the experience will work for many people,” he says. “That’s an intense process.”
AI has the potential to change that because it will be able to see everything—something a human will never be able to do on their own.
“With AI’s help, someday in the near future, I’ll be able to test the entire application,” Albahadly says. “There will be a lot of power in that.”
AI can help designers get this kind of scale at every step in the process, which not only makes the results far more accurate, but also much faster.
The future of ideation




Boosting user flow and telemetry with AI
AI is helping us figure out where our designs breakdown much more quickly. Here’s what we’ve learned along the way.
 

Behavioral Analytics: AI can continuously analyze user interactions within the app or website, providing insights into user behavior, preferences, and patterns.
Predictive Modeling: By employing machine learning algorithms, AI can predict user actions, allowing designers to anticipate potential pain points and optimize the user flow proactively.
A/B Testing Automation: AI can automate the A/B testing process, experimenting with different user flows and suggesting improvements based on real-time user feedback and performance metrics.
Personalization Algorithms: Utilizing AI-driven personalization, the system can adapt user flows based on individual preferences, creating a more tailored and engaging experience for each user.
Dynamic User Journey Mapping: AI can dynamically map user journeys, identifying bottlenecks or areas of improvement in the current flow and proposing adjustments for a smoother and more intuitive user experience.




 
Albahadly also envisions AI enhancing parts of the design process. Today, ideation is done by talking to experts and customers, holding brainstorming sessions, and doing workshops. In the future, he suggests he could do similar ideation with his teammates and AI.
“In your app, say there’s a huge drop-off of traffic coming from Japan,” he says. “Now we need to do a workshop to find out why this is happening. The AI could point to specific stuff like a language barrier or culture barrier, or a time issue like a holiday. Instead of taking a week to ideate, it could become a step in the process the same day.”
In addition to changes in design processes, generative AI is changing the user experience.
“We’ve had a linear way of pumping out experiences—an OS, products on top of it, and apps,” Bergstrom says. “Now there are different copilots, different extensibility, ways of doing things on surfaces. This all has to make sense to a user end-to-end.”
 
Human designers can only sample the experience users have with experiences they build—they can’t test every scenario because that takes far too long. AI is going to change that because, after it’s fully deployed in the UX space, it will be able to test every use case.
It requires a lot of design thinking to produce that experience.
Data quality is also crucial to producing an experience that makes sense. “Generative AI is a wildcard, which requires data to be more pristine,” Bergstrom says.
For example, the LLM for Microsoft 365 can go through all your emails and SharePoint sites. If you type in “benefits,” it should identify the authoritative source and display that information—not go through your email to find every benefits-related message you’ve ever gotten.
Transforming work with AI
What about the potential of AI to do routine, repetitive work and give people the time to do higher value work? Bergstrom sees a wide range of opportunities.
“We can use generative AI to help employees with everyday tasks, from finding the best place to park to managing the immigration process to identifying the best selections for employee benefits,” Bergstrom says. “And for large enterprises, we can use generative AI to help manage facilities by identifying cost-to-benefit ratios, building usage, and for finding the best locations to have offices.”
Both Bergstrom and Albahadly see an opportunity for AI to help employees write their performance reviews. Bergstrom notes that it could help managers combine review feedback from multiple sources and tie it to OKRs.
And Albahadly says that for employees, AI can help with writing their own performance reviews.
“That’s been a challenge for most Microsoft employees, because at the end of the year, you have to sit and remember everything you worked on,” he says.
Because AI will be exposed to your meetings, your calendar, your projects, it will be easy for it to co-write your review with you.
“In the future, it will be less writing and more selecting stuff, and AI will generate a whole year for you,” Albahadly says.
With all this transformation happening, some people worry about the future of work.
Paniaras is optimistic.
“Everything around us, including our roles, work, processes, and definitions of values, has been created by us humans” he says. “Whenever any of these dimensions change, we inevitably end up redefining them or filling the void. But you need to have that thinking attitude, and the recognition that everything around us is a result of our own making.”
Bergstrom agrees.
“Durable problems don’t change,” she says. “But now we have infinitesimally more ways to solve for those problems with an intelligent assistant that can anticipate needs and predicts possibilities—we’re just trying to figure out how to harness all the capability in our designs.”

Candidates are trying to beat the systemAlaina Demopoulos in New YorkWed 6 Mar 2024 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 6 Mar 2024 21.31 ESTShareWhen Ty landed an introductory phone interview with a finance and banking company last month, they assumed it would be a quick chat with a recruiter. And when they got on the phone, Ty assumed the recruiter, who introduced herself as Jaime, was human. But things got robotic.“The voice sounded similar to Siri,” said Ty, who is 29 and lives in the DC metro area. “It was creepy.”Ty realized they weren’t speaking to a living, breathing person. Their interviewer was an AI system, and one with a rather rude habit. Jaime asked Ty all the right questions – what’s your management style? are you a good fit for this role? – but she wouldn’t let Ty fully answer them.“After cutting me off, the AI would respond, ‘Great! Sounds good! Perfect!’ and move on to the next question,” Ty said. “After the third or fourth question, the AI just stopped after a short pause and told me that the interview was completed and someone from the team would reach out later.” (Ty asked that their last name not be used because their current employer doesn’t know they’re looking for a job.)A survey from Resume Builder released last summer found that by 2024, four in 10 companies would use AI to “talk with” candidates in interviews. Of those companies, 15% said hiring decisions would be made with no input from a human at all.In person, you get more social prompts. In this case, I was just talking to myselfAdele WaltonAs Laura Michelle Davis wrote for CNET: “Today, it’s not uncommon for applicants to be rejected by a robot before they’re connected with an actual human in human resources.” To make the grueling process of getting hired even more demoralizing, many people are afraid generative AI – which uses data sets to create text, video, audio, images and yes, robo-recruiters – will take our jobs altogether. But could AI help us find a new gig in the meantime?The human element is lostAsk an employer who uses AI in their hiring process about the choice, and they’ll share a common refrain: these systems are used to cross quotidian tasks off a recruiter’s daily schedule; AI helps weed through the top 1,000 applicants, but once you get to the top 10, it’s a strictly human process.In 2019, ZipRecruiter noted that AI systems could streamline boring tasks – like writing job descriptions or scanning résumés – and give hiring professionals “back time to spend on more strategic tasks”. (Imagine how it feels to be on the other side, applying to dozens of jobs a day.) A survey conducted in 2020, sponsored by the AI interview system Sapia.ai, found that 55% of companies were increasing investment in automated recruiting measures.“I do not use AI to write job descriptions, but I know many employers who do,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. Pollak said that a manager might also ask an AI program to give them a list of reasons why they should, or should not, hire a final-round candidate. “Employers use it as a coach, as a guide, as a friend to bounce ideas off,” she added.View image in fullscreenAdele Walton was recently interviewed by AI. Photograph: Courtesy Adele WaltonBut, as applicants like Ty now know, employers’ use of AI goes beyond it being a sounding board.Experts advise applicants to act as though they’re speaking to a human during AI-led interviews, although that’s easier said than done. Adele Walton, a 24-year-old journalist and content creator from Brighton, England, recently sat through an AI interview that felt extremely unnatural. “I expected a person or a panel,” she said. “When I clicked on the call, I was surprised to enter a chat room with just myself.”Questions flashed on a screen that also showed her own face. Walton had 60 seconds to answer. “I was looking at how my face was moving, looking at how I looked on screen,” she said. “As someone who’s struggled with body dysmorphia, I found that my face was an unnecessary distraction in the interview process. I know I would have done better if there was another person there.”Walton did not get another interview. “In an in-person meeting, you get more social prompts from the other person,” she said. “In this case, I was just talking to myself – or an AI system – with no measure of how well I was doing. I couldn’t read anyone’s face, body language, or see them nod yes. That small type of human reassurance that you get in a real interview is completely lost when companies outsource interviews to AI.”Applicants are gaming the systemIf employers use AI to make their hiring process easier, why shouldn’t applicants? That’s Fanta-Marie Touré’s mindset. The 24-year-old, who lives in Atlanta and works in cybersecurity, has used AI tools to tailor her résumé, write cover letters and even auto-apply to jobs. She does this through a program called Massive.“It’s very expensive to hire someone to help you with your résumé,” Touré said. “A lot of people charge $150 an hour to do résumé reviews. That’s a lot, so why not use a tool that costs me maybe $30 a month?”Touré maintains that it’s still important to “personalize” application materials – adding relevant anecdotes, for example. “Otherwise, everybody who uses AI is getting the same result,” she said. “You have to tweak.”Sometimes, supposed hacks on how to game the AI recruitment process hit social media. A few years ago, Touré heard one trick: a TikTok creator advised applicants to copy and paste a job description on to their résumés, and then change the font of that description to a tiny size that matched the résumé’s white background. A human wouldn’t be able to see it, but AI would scan it, recognize the text verbatim and send it to the front of the pack. Or so the theory went.View image in fullscreenA 2019 survey found that by 2024, four in 10 companies would use AI to ‘talk with’ candidates in interviews. Photograph: AsiaVision/Getty Images“I never got any hits from that,” Touré said. “That was a couple of years ago, and I bet the systems are smarter now.”It’s a move that’s familiar to Pollak, the ZipRecruiter economist. “That tactic has been used so widely that most job site algorithms now know to penalize it. Don’t try to be too smart with your résumé: if a match is too close, it will be kicked out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to TechScapeFree weekly newsletterAlex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.after newsletter promotionAccording to Pollak, employers are more suspicious of AI-generated résumés and cover letters these days. “I’m hearing that employers are now discounting a lot of the information they receive that’s in written form, and want to get to a face-to-face conversation as quickly as possible with the candidates so they can properly vet them,” she explained.Even on video interviews – with humans or robots – applicants can still call on AI programs to assist. Michael G is the founder of Final Round AI, an “interview co-pilot” that listens to recruiters’ questions and prompts personalized answers in real time, based on the résumé and cover letter uploaded by the interviewee. (Michael asked that his last name not be used because Final Round AI is still in “stealth mode”, a startup’s temporary state of secretiveness to quell competition.)“Users can quickly glance through the AI’s response, and then develop their own response to the question,” Michael said. “It’s not like they need to read the text verbatim off the screen. It’s natural: you have celebrities, TV hosts looking at teleprompters all the time. Why can’t ordinary people use a teleprompter?”According to Michael, Final Round AI has over half a million users, some of whom send him job offers they credit in part to the service. (That’s tough to factcheck – Final Round AI has less than 2,000 followers across its social platforms.) Michael added that about 40% of users come from the tech industry, and 30% work in the banking or finance fields. The cost to use it can range from $0 to $100 a month. Michael says all personal data is deleted at the end of the call, but generally, AI systems learn from the data they are fed over time.Is it cheating? “I believe that because of AI, there are new boundaries and it’s hard to define whether someone is cheating or not,” Michael said, somewhat terrifyingly. “And, if I were an employer, I would prefer candidates who know how to use AI, because they bring value and a productivity boost to the company.”Michael said he used Final Round AI at points while answering questions for this interview; yes, you could tell.Who’s hit the hardest by AI hiring?AI systems encode bias. You don’t need to be a wildly imaginative person to consider how that might affect job-seekers – Amazon reportedly scrapped an in-house hiring algorithm, trained on data submitted by applicants, that favored men and penalized résumés that included the word “women”. Will automated hiring processes also reject people who are not white, male and able-bodied?AI won’t pick a CEORory Mir of the Electronic Frontier Foundation“The current wave of AI uses algorithms that are probabilistic models, which means they simply rely on patterns in past data to make likely predictions,” said Rory Mir, associate director of community organizing at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “The problem is, patterns in past data include the patterns which emerge from systemic bias.”Racial bias is present when humans do the hiring: studies have found that hiring managers are likely to pass over names that are perceived as Black while reviewing résumés. Pollak said that to avoid such bias, ZipRecruiter strips “any kind of identifiable information” like names and zip codes from résumés before putting them through an AI system. But if a résumé still includes education, AI systems could theoretically learn to favor applicants who went to Ivy League schools. Pollak defended the practice of retaining education because “employers do want to know something like [that]”.‘Disinformation on steroids’: is the US prepared for AI’s influence on the election?Read moreHigher-ups in the corporate world rarely apply for jobs – at a certain pay grade, you network instead. Mir believes that early-stage or low-level applicants will “bear the brunt” of AI hiring: “AI won’t pick a CEO. It might filter applicants for management, and it may have the final say on hiring a gig worker,” they said. “Automated hiring will have an outsized impact on marginalized folks who rely on more precarious lines of work.”Case in point: 404 Media recently reported on a company called Paradox.ai, used by FedEx, McDonald’s and the company that operates Olive Garden, which recruited people in customer and food service jobs with a “long and bizarre personality quiz” illustrated with “blue humanoid aliens”. The goal was to discover how candidates “rank in terms of ‘agreeableness’ and ‘emotional stability’”.Ty never heard back from anyone at the company after speaking with its AI recruiter; they assume they won’t. They aren’t surprised that the interview process is becoming more artificial.“I’ve been in interviews where human recruiters ask me directly how I feel about using apps like ChatGPT for creative work, and if I would feel comfortable doing that at my job,” they said. “So I guess it was only a matter of time before I got straight-up interviewed by a robot.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Job huntingfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedSunday was world’s hottest ever recorded day, data suggestsWhen a bad Trump joke becomes an affair of state, Germany has lost more than its sense of humourFatma Aydemir‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysWho might Kamala Harris pick for VP?

Since its release in November 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT has been used to write cover letters, create a children's book, and even help students cheat on their essays. The chatbot may be more powerful than we ever imagined. Google found that, in theory, the search engine would hire the bot as an entry-level coder if it interviewed at the company.Amazon employees who tested ChatGPT said it does a ""very good job"" of answering customer support questions, is ""great"" at making training documents, and is ""very strong"" at answering queries around corporate strategy.

Companies are taking notice. Both IBM and British telecommunications giant BT Group cited AI when announcing job cuts last year — and said that many wouldn't come back.

A Goldman Sachs study from last year found that generative AI tools could, in fact, impact 300 million full-time jobs worldwide, which could lead to a ""significant disruption"" in the job market.By 2030, nearly 12 million Americans in occupations with shrinking demand may need to switch jobs, a McKinsey analysis published last July. AI was deemed a key reason — McKinsey estimated that 30% of hours worked in the US could be automated by 2030.Human judgment needs to be applied to these technologies to avoid error and bias, Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, previously told Business Insider. Users of ChatGPT have found that the bot can generate misinformation, incorrectly answer coding problems, and produce errors in basic math.""We have to think about these things as productivity-enhancing tools, as opposed to complete replacements,"" Madgavkar said.

Business Insider talked to experts and conducted research to compile a list of jobs that are at the highest risk for replacement by AI.

Tech jobs (Coders, computer programmers, software engineers, data analysts)











Coders, software developers, and data analysts could be displaced by AI, an expert says.
 
                                            Jens Schlueter/Getty Images
                                          




Coding and computer programming are in-demand skills, but it's possible that ChatGPT and similar AI tools may fill in some of the gaps in the near future. Tech jobs such as software developers, web developers, computer programmers, coders, and data scientists are ""pretty amenable"" to AI technologies ""displacing more of their work,"" Madgavkar said.That's because AI like ChatGPT is good at crunching numbers with relative accuracy.In fact, advanced technologies like ChatGPT could produce code faster than humans, which means that work can be completed with fewer employees, Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who has researched AI's impact on the American workforce, told Business Insider.""What took a team of software developers might only take some of them,"" he added.Tech companies like ChatGPT maker's OpenAI have already considered replacing software engineers with AI.Still, Oded Netzer, a Columbia Business School professor, said he thinks that AI will help coders rather than replace them. ""In terms of jobs, I think it's primarily an enhancer than full replacement of jobs,"" Netzer told CBS MoneyWatch last year. ""Coding and programming is a good example of that. It actually can write code quite well.""

Media jobs (advertising, content creation, technical writing, journalism)











Experts say AI like ChatGPT is good at producing written content and can do so ""more efficiently than humans.""
 
                                            Westend61/Getty Images
                                          




Media jobs across the board — including those in advertising, technical writing, journalism, and any role that involves content creation — could be affected by ChatGPT and similar forms of AI, Madgavkar said. That's because AI is able to read, write, and understand text-based data well, she added.""Analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of language based data and information is a skill that you'd expect generative AI technologies to ramp up on,"" Madgavkar said. Economist Paul Krugman said in a New York Times op-ed published in December 2022 that ChatGPT may be able to do tasks like reporting and writing ""more efficiently than humans.""The media industry has already begun experimenting with AI-generated content. Tech news site CNET used an AI tool similar to ChatGPT to write dozens of articles — though the publisher had to issue a number of corrections — and BuzzFeed has used tech from the ChatGPT maker to generate new forms of content like quizzes and travel guides.But Madgavkar said that the majority of work done by content creators is not automatable.""There's a ton of human judgment that goes into each of these occupations,"" she said.

Legal industry jobs (paralegals, legal assistants)











AI can replicate some of the work that paralegals and legal assistants do, though they aren't entirely replaceable, experts say.
 
                                            Worawee Meepian/Shutterstock
                                          




Generative AI could impact legal workers in the US, a March Goldman Sachs report found.That's because legal services jobs had already been highly exposed to AI automation before the advent of new AI tools, Manav Raj, an author of the Goldman study, told Business Insider. Like media roles, jobs in the legal industry such as paralegals and legal assistants are responsible for consuming large amounts of information, synthesizing what they learned, then making it digestible through a legal brief or opinion. Language-oriented roles like these are susceptible to automation, Madgavkar said.""The data is actually quite structured, very language-oriented, and therefore quite amenable to generative AI,"" she added.But again, AI won't fully be able to automate these jobs since it requires a degree of human judgement to understand what a client or employer wants.""It's almost like a bit of a productivity boost that some of these occupations might get, because you can use tools that actually do this better,"" Madgavkar said.

Market research analysts











Market research analysts are susceptible to AI-driven change, says an expert.
 
                                            Laurence Dutton/Getty Images
                                          




AI is good at analyzing data and predicting outcomes, Muro said. That is why market research analysts may be susceptible to AI-driven change. Market research analysts are responsible for collecting data, identifying trends within that data, and then using what they found to design an effective marketing campaign or decide where to place advertising. ""Those are things that we're now seeing that AI could handle,"" Muro said.

Teachers











Even teachers are susceptible to job disruptions from AI.
 
                                            Getty Images
                                          




Teachers across the country are worried about students using ChatGPT to cheat on their homework, but according to Pengcheng Shi, an associate dean in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology, they should also be thinking about their job security. ChatGPT ""can easily teach classes already,"" Shi told the New York Post.""Although it has bugs and inaccuracies in terms of knowledge, this can be easily improved,"" he said. ""Basically, you just need to train the ChatGPT.""But Shannon Ahern, a high school math and science teacher who said she used ChatGPT to do things like lesson planning, told Business Insider last year that she's not worried she'll be replaced by the tech.""There will always be a need for us and the human connection that comes with in-person instruction,"" she said.

Finance jobs (Financial analysts, personal financial advisors)











Workers in the finance industry could be at risk for AI replacement, expert says.
 
                                            Getty Images
                                          




Like market research analysts, financial analysts, personal financial advisors, and other jobs in personal finance that require manipulating significant amounts of numerical data can be affected by AI, Muro, the researcher at The Brookings Institution, said.""AI can identify trends in the market, highlight what investments in a portfolio are doing better and worse, communicate all that, and then use various other forms of data by, say, a financial company to forecast a better investment mix,"" Muro said. These analysts make a lot of money, he said, but parts of their jobs are automatable.

Traders

Experts say ChatGPT could upend jobs across a range of Wall Street industries, from trading to investment banking. ""It's going to automate select tasks that knowledge workers are engaged in today so that they can focus on higher-value tasks,"" Dylan Roberts, a partner at KPMG, told Business Insider.Pengcheng Shi, a dean at the Rochester Institute of Technology's computer science department, agreed that certain Wall Street roles could be in jeopardy.""At an investment bank, people are hired out of college, and spend two, three years to work like robots and do Excel modeling — you can get AI to do that,"" Shi told the New York Post.

Graphic designers











AI has many graphic design abilities.

In a Harvard Business Review post published in December 2022, three professors pointed to DALL-E, an AI tool that can generate images in seconds, as a potential disruptor of the graphic design industry.""Upskilling millions of people in their ability to create and manipulate images will have a profound impact on the economy,"" they wrote, adding that ""these recent advances in AI will surely usher in a period of hardship and economic pain for some whose jobs are directly impacted and who find it hard to adapt.""But Dr. Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford University, told Business Insider that AI tools like ChatGPT may actually help workers in ""creative"" industries like art and graphic design produce higher quality work. Frey said he was more concerned about how the tech will impact wages.""In my view, it's less about automation,"" he said. ""It's more about democratization and competition, potentially leading to lower wages for people in some of these professions.""

Accountants











Accountants may see their jobs at risk because of ChatGPT, experts say.
 
                                            seb_ra/Getty Images
                                          




Accounting is generally viewed as a stable profession, but even employees in this industry could be at risk.""Technology hasn't put everybody out of a job yet, but it does put some people out of a job,"" Brett Caraway, associate professor with the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology at the University of Toronto, said on Global News Radio 640 Toronto in January 2023.Caraway added that ""intellectual labor"" in particular could be threatened.""This could be lawyers, accountants,"" he said. ""It is something new, and it will be interesting to see just how disruptive and painful it is to employment and politics.""

Customer service agents











Customer support specialists may lose their jobs to AI, experts say.

You've probably already experienced calling or chatting with a company's customer service department and having a robot answer. ChatGPT and related technologies could continue this trend.A 2022 study from the tech research company Gartner predicted that chatbots will be the main customer service channel for roughly 25% of companies by 2027.

Generative AI is an utterly transformative technology that is already impacting how organizations and individuals work. But what does the future have in store for this incredible technology? Read on for my top predictions.


Multi-Modal Generative AIs
We now have generative AI tools that can see, hear, speak, read, write, or create. Increasingly, generative AIs will be able to do many of these things at once – such as being able to create text and images together. As an example, the third iteration of the text-to-image tool Dall-E is reportedly able to generate high-quality text embedded in its images, putting it ahead of rival image-generator tools. Then there was the 2023 announcement that ChatGPT can now see, hear, and speak, as well as write.

So, one of my predictions is that generative AIs will continue this move towards multi-modal AIs that can create in multiple ways – and in real-time, just like the human brain.

“Interactive AI”
PROMOTED
According to DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, the next step beyond generative AI is “interactive AI"" – by which he means bots that don't just chat but can carry out all sorts of tasks by delegating to other software (and even people) to get stuff done for you.

Take software development as an example. Generative AI can already write and test computer code, meaning you could use it to build, say, a new recipe app designed around healthy eating. As AI becomes more interactive, you could, in theory, task an AI with the entire app-creation project – from writing and testing the code to hiring nutritionists, food photographers and recipe developers (some of whom may be bots), to liaising with beta testers, releasing the app, and organizing the marketing campaign. In a simpler example, you could ask a bot like ChatGPT to book a night away for you and your partner – including finding and booking the hotel, choosing a restaurant for you, booking a table (and informing the restaurant of your partner’s egg allergy), and booking a walking tour of the city. You could delegate the entire task to a bot.

Generative AI-Equipped Robots
In the not-too-distant future, I believe we’ll see robots being routinely equipped with generative AI capabilities – thereby vastly increasing the range of tasks that both robots and AIs can take on for us.

So far, generative AI enables us to automate and augment cognitive and creative tasks, including some of the tasks done by doctors, designers, musicians, marketers, and more. Physical jobs such as building, assembly line work, cleaning, and so on are (by and large) unaffected by the wave of generative AI transformation. But combine generative AI with robots, and that may change. We could see AIs working in all sorts of sectors. On factory floors, for example, or construction sites, retail stores and hotels.

Generative AI For A Better World
I firmly believe that, as one of the most transformative technologies we’ve ever seen, generative AI may become a force for enormous good in this world. Yes, a tool like ChatGPT can be used to draft a funny speech for your friend's wedding or come up with an idea for tonight's supper. But it can also be used to address issues like climate change, massive inequality, hunger, access to healthcare, and more. It can help us find new treatments for diseases. It can democratize access to mental health support. It can predict how infectious diseases will progress. It can address food security through crop yield optimization. When you think about it, it's rather like giving humans superpowers.
Generative AI Regulation And Oversight
Of course, we can’t deny that generative AI can also be used to spread misinformation, create new biological weapons, or even build autonomous weapons that can identify and neutralize threats without any human oversight. This is why we will need regulation to protect us and ensure generative AI is used for positive transformation – and not to create more polarization, meddle in elections, deliberately spread false information, and the like. We will need transparency around how these systems are used. We will need ethical guidelines and frameworks in place. As such, generative AI will become a top priority for regulators.
To some extent, oversight is beginning to happen. Meta, for example, has announced that political ads running on Facebook and Instagram will be required to disclose if they contain AI-generated content and images. Other tech companies are following suit, which is good, but we also need formal regulations in place rather than just relying on tech companies to do the ethical thing.
AI Delegation And Making Work Better
Making the world a better place is one thing. But perhaps a humbler prediction is that generative AI will make work better. Yes, some jobs will be lost to AI automation. But more jobs will be augmented – enhanced – by generative AI. Because generative AI allows us to hand over the more mundane and repetitive tasks to machines, human workers will have more time for value-adding tasks like problem-solving, creativity, and relationship-building. But finding that balance between human expertise and machine intelligence will be crucial. As such, I expect AI delegation – or the art of working out which tasks are best left to machines and which should be done by humans – to become a vital future skill.

Does permitting the use of AI in employment call the works council into action? Not necessarily, says the German Labour Court
By Anna-Maria Hesse on March 5, 2024 Posted in Artificial Intelligence, Consultation, Data Protection, Monitoring, Privacy



The use of ChatGPT and its peers to make work easier and faster – whether permitted, tolerated or prohibited – is already part of everyday working life in many companies. However, the spread of that technology has raced far ahead of the law so the legal consequences of that use (employment rights and obligations, data protection, employee inventions, etc.) are in many cases still far from clear.
In one of the first judicial decisions in this area, the Hamburg Labour Court has recently addressed one particular question remaining unresolved around the use of AI and its consequences, the extent of the employer’s obligations to consult with works councils before AI is brought into the workplace. In its decision of 16 January 2024 (case no. 24 BVGa 1/24) the Court said that the works council has no right of co-determination pursuant to Section 87 (1) nos. 1, 6 and 7 Works Constitution Act where the employer chooses to permit the use of ChatGPT and comparable generative AI systems by staff using their own private web-based accounts, and to regulate that use by an AI policy. To be clear, a right of co-determination goes further than a right merely to be informed and consulted about workplace measures. Co-determination is the strongest form of the works council’s participation rights. In matters of co-determination the employer may not make decisions without the consent of the works council; instead, the works council must authorise any planned measures, or the parties must come to an agreement (e.g. a works agreement).
Background:
The employer decided to allow its employees to use generative AI as a new tool to support their work and published an AI Policy on its intranet stipulating terms and rules to be observed by employees in that use. These AI tools were accessible via a web browser and employees who wanted to use them had to obtain a private account (in this case, ChatGPT) at their own expense. The employer itself did not create a company AI tool. No doubt fearful of the possible longer-term impact of such tools on job security, the works council considered the consent to use ChatGPT and the publication of the AI Policy to be a gross violation of its co-determination and participation rights. Among other things, it requested the employer to block ChatGPT and prohibit its use.
Decision:
Use of AI tools does not concern “issues relating to the organization of the company and the orderly behaviour of employees in the company”
The Labour Court ruled that the works council’s right of co-determination under Section 87 (1) No. 1 Works Constitution Act was not affected, as generative AI systems constitute a work tool and therefore affect the work behaviour of the employees (which is not subject to co-determination) and not the orderly behaviour (which is subject to it).
Permission to use of AI tools not considered as “introduction and use of technical equipment designed to monitor the behaviour or performance of employees”
The Court also rejected the works council’s claim for rights of co-determination under Section 87 (1) No. 6 Works Constitution Act. It thought that the use of ChatGPT via personal, browser-based accounts does not constitute technical equipment for the collection and storage of personal data and therefore does not give rise to a right of co-determination on the part of the works council. This is because where employees use an account they have created themselves, and (importantly) to which the employer has no access, the employer does not know which employees have used ChatGPT, when, for how long or for what purpose. This also applies even if the employees do have to disclose when they achieve work results using AI because that particular form of monitoring is not a function of the technical equipment itself. If the employer had required that AI usage by its employees had to go through its own account then it is likely that at least some of the outcomes here would have been different.
Use of AI tools does not require “regulations on the prevention of accidents at work and occupational illnesses as well as on health protection within the framework of statutory regulations or accident prevention regulations”
Finally, in the opinion of the Court, the works council’s right of co-determination pursuant to Section 87 (1) No. 7 Works Constitution Act was not engaged by the possibility of any psychological stress caused by the use of AI. No concrete threat to mental health was identifiable.
Further Comment by Labour Court:
In an additional comment (as this was not part of the case at hand), the Labour Court did, however, point to the information and consultation right of the works council under Sec. 90 (1) Nr. 3, (2) Works Constitution Act. This regulation gives a works council the right to be properly informed about the proposed use of AI systems prior to their introduction and to be consulted on that proposal. However, this information and consultation right does not entitle the works council to demand a works agreement as a condition of allowing the proposal to go ahead, nor then to block the employer’s eventual decision on the use of AI systems.
Notes:
This decision cannot be applied across the board to all companies and types of AI use. In particular, co-determination in the context of Section 87 (1) No. 6 Works Constitution Act may have to be assessed differently if the employer either requires use of AI systems developed in-house or requires staff to use external AI systems but only through company accounts set up with the external providers. In those cases, the employer could certainly access or view (hence monitor) the accounts and the corresponding data around the employees’ use of the system. If you are considering allowing the use of AI systems at your company, how you do it may have significant impacts on the required extent of works council involvement.
We also recommend the introduction of a reasonably detailed set of regulations for the use of generative AI (including type of work, scope, labelling requirements, confidentiality obligation etc.) to avoid any misunderstanding or mismatch of employee expectations in your workplace.

Artificial Intelligence: Cutting White-Collar Jobs

March 4, 2024





			Author: Caroline Crosdale 

 





 




Alphabet, Amazon, SAP, Grammarly, DocuSign, Snap, Duolingo—the list of companies announcing layoffs due to generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues to balloon.

Just a few months ago, AI enhancements were presented as complementary tools that would eliminate tedious and repetitive tasks but still require a white-collar supervisor. However, generative AI can now create content and summarize complex ideas, threatening even high-skilled jobs.

A recent PwC global survey of more than 4,700 CEOs from 105 countries shows that 46% of executives expect AI to increase profitability. A quarter of the CEOs said AI’s growth would lead them to job cuts in 2024.

Tech companies have already begun their layoffs. There have been 4,600 job cuts in the US due to AI since May 2023, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. And more cuts will follow. German software giant SAP recently announced a shake-up affecting 8,000 jobs as the company pursues more task automation and AI-driven efficiencies.

Logistics company UPS is also looking to reduce its workforce. It plans to eliminate 12,000 jobs, including in the pricing department that calculates what to charge customers—AI can do the math just fine.

White-collar posts are endangered by two trends: the automation of their work and the greater appeal of AI compared to their current field. For instance, online composition aid Grammarly is letting go of 230 of its 1,000 employees as the company adapts to the new age of AI, where grammarians are less in demand. Likewise, Amazon, Alphabet and Snapchat are downsizing hundreds of jobs, but not owing to automation; instead, their leaders are reallocating resources toward promising AI technology. White-collar workers are merely collateral damage. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, endangered species include financial analysts that study market trends, lawyers involved in regulatory compliance, software developers who debug and optimize networks, and human-resource experts. Safe havens from AI are disappearing fast.

 Generative AI is a hot topic in legal circles, with some companies boasting that their AI can replace lawyers. Killian Flood examines how AI might shape the professions in the coming years. Decades ago, before widespread use of computers and the internet, maintaining a seat in the Law Library was a necessity for barristers. The Library was a central hub in a paper-based world. Nowhere else contained the textbooks and case reports which were used on a daily basis in research and drafting. As the primary workplace for all barristers, spending time in the Library would help you to get noticed and potentially pick up a few briefs. Out of sight, out of mind, as the saying goes. Being physically present in the Library was also essential because this was where one could access their colleagues to develop skills in advocacy, drafting and legal knowledge. Times have changed. Mobile phones and email mean that a lawyer does not need to be chained to the desk to be available to work. The proliferation of paperwork and computer data means that personal office space has become a must for any busy practitioner. Online materials allow people to do their research away from the Four Courts. As such, the Library has emptied out, with the only truly busy periods being the minutes before court starts and the midweek lunchtime settlement meetings. The advent of the internet and technology was the previous generation’s disruption to legal practice and “the way things are done.” For the current generation, it seems like we are about to experience a disruption of our own. Generative artificial intelligence has been a hot-button issue for several years now. Lawyers across the spectrum will have heard claims that AI will soon be doing their jobs better and cheaper. Similarly, everyone has heard of the New York attorney who relied on ChatGPT to write his legal submissions, much to his cost. Last week, the Bar of England and Wales published guidelines on the use of generative AI, where it noted that there was nothing inherently improper about using AI tools in legal practice, but also warned that the tools must be properly understood by practitioners and used responsibly. So far, there has been significant trepidation amongst Irish lawyers to adopt generative AI into their own practices, most likely because the technology is not well-understood or tried and tested. Lawyers are slow to change their working practices at the best of times. However, A&L Goodbody recently took the plunge and announced a partnership with Harvey AI, a specialist legal generative AI platform. Like many generative AI platforms, Harvey AI is a large language model system, meaning that it has the ability to achieve general-purpose language generation and understanding. Unlike other AI platforms, Harvey AI is specifically designed for the legal industry. It is built from OpenAI’s GPT AI, meaning that it shares a common link to ChatGPT, but Harvey AI has also been trained with general legal data, such as case law and legislation. As such, Harvey AI claims to assist in classic legal functions such as contract review, litigation and regulatory compliance. More notably, the generative element can create legal documents based on input information. No more than a tool Imagine for a moment that you are a partner in a solicitor’s firm with an upcoming client meeting involving a complex merger. You have a significant brief to review before attending the meeting. Currently, as part of your preparation, you have a junior colleague consider the papers and write up a comprehensive summary, highlighting possible areas of difficulty or matter requiring further review. Obviously, this will take the junior colleague some time and then you will need further time to consider the matter for yourself. In theory, generative AI can produce the same summary within minutes. As such, the junior colleague (or partner themselves) can use AI to cut through hours of typing and immediately cross-reference the AI’s summary against the content of the brief. Similarly, a barrister tasked with producing written legal submissions could ask generative AI to produce draft submissions on particular legal issues and then edit those submissions as necessary, rather than laboriously type out or dictate the submissions from scratch. It is no exaggeration to say that the potential efficiency gains from generative AI will fundamentally alter the day-to-day working practices of the lawyers who adopt it. Given the powerful nature of the tool, it is easy to envisage a world where generative AI is ubiquitous amongst legal practitioners, much in the same way that computers and IT systems are found in every office space today. However, it is important to emphasise that generative AI is no more than a tool for lawyers to engage in legal practice. While nobody can predict the future, the doomsday concerns for the legal professions are overblown. Take, for instance, the fanciful notion that judges and advocates will be replaced by AI in the coming decades. It is constitutionally illiterate to suggest that the Judiciary (a branch of the government) would be replaced by machines. What’s next, AI politicians? A right-wing populist ChatGPT bot running for a Dáil seat against the lefty-lawyer Harvey AI bot, perhaps? The EU has been proactive in legislating to regulate the use of generative AI, focusing on issues such as transparency and data protection. The regulation of the AI marketplace is welcome as it will set the basis on which generative AI may be used. In particular, the EU’s AI Act (once enacted) will require AI systems to be overseen by people rather than automation, so do not expect AI law firms to spring up any time soon. More than anything, the practice of law is a human-centric endeavour. Trust, confidentiality and fiduciary responsibility are crucial elements of the lawyer/client relationship and cannot be replicated by an AI. Autopilot I think the best way to conceptualise generative AI is to view it as an autopilot on a plane. While pilots directly perform the take-off and landing of all flights, the autopilot is in control for most of the flight time (albeit under constant monitoring from the pilots). In the same way, where generative AI might do most of the heavy lifting in terms of document generation, lawyers will still be essential to the entire process, particularly on the front and back ends. Those in the AI sphere are quick to emphasise that the output of generative AI is only as good as the input information. As a lawyer, there is a skill to asking the right questions of a client to identify the key issues of concern. The experience and knowledge of a lawyer is also crucial to making final decisions in advisory, transactional or litigation matters. The imperfect nature of generative AI’s content is highlighted by the Bar of England and Wales. The Bar Council’s guidance pointed out that AI can suffer from so-called hallucinations and biases, which cause convincing yet false legal information to be generated by AI. Similarly, the Bar Council warns that AI often has difficulty explaining its internal decision-making process or its output. Accordingly, barristers have been advised to thoroughly review all generated documents. Moreover, the Bar Council’s guidance advises that barristers should not share legally privileged or confidential information with AI. Data protection law demands that lawyers do not provide client information to third parties without express consent and this is particularly important with AI. Strong controls and safeguards are essential for any lawyer using client information to generate documents. AI will change how lawyers operate in a positive way. However, as we have seen, it also introduces new liabilities for lawyers as well. In this context, education is key. Both the Bar of Ireland and the Law Society should be urgently publishing similar guidelines to assist practitioners in making educated decisions on the use of AI. Larger questions Additionally, beyond changes in day-to-day practice, there are larger questions as to the effect of AI on the legal services market. For example, we do not know what the cost of AI will be to law firms and how that cost will be passed on to clients. Personally, I am pessimistic that there will be great savings in legal fees because there is no incentive for lawyers to use a system that cuts their earnings. Equally, AI has been utilised in e-discovery for over a decade, but such services remain expensive. The increase in efficiency also calls into question how many lawyers will be needed in the future, particularly in larger firms. It seems to follow that a lawyer with access to AI will be far more productive and, consequently, fewer human resources are needed. Barristers may find that the drafting of pleadings, affidavits and submissions is increasingly done by solicitors with AI. We also do not know how much competition there will be amongst AI companies in the legal sphere. While software companies are currently competing to produce their own AI systems, it may be the case that we end up with a dominant player similar to Google or Microsoft. This may be an issue if lawyers are using the same AI system in adversarial work, such as generating opposing legal arguments in litigation. In my view, this is an obvious conflict and reinforces the need for human lawyers. Finally, it will be interesting to see if AI is adopted by judges and whether specific rules are necessary for them in light of their constitutional function. It seems to me that judges should be discouraged from using AI to generate reasons for their decisions. For me, there is simply too great a risk that the legal system is diminished if judges rely on AI to write the operative sections of judgments. In 1854, Henry David Thoreau wrote that “men have become the tools of their tools”. Though I think the intervening 170 years have proven this quote to be untrue, lawyers must be ready for AI to change how legal practice works, for better and for worse.

Is artificial intelligence good or bad? Either way, it’s growing. Whether it is JPMorgan’s AI cashflow model that claims to cut manual banking work by 90 per cent, AI therapists or AI-powered security cameras, AI is making its mark on society and the workplace.

With so many resources being dedicated to its development and no real obstacles predicted, its rapid development is set to continue. In many ways, this is a good thing that will help the pharmaceutical industry detect and understand disease. On the other hand, there are concerns AI will aid cyber attacks, spread fake news and decrease job security.
What AI is doing for us now
AI is already able to drive vehicles and negotiate obstacles. This has applications for military operations and space exploration.
Serious success is being seen in the trials of new machinery designed to identify tumours on CT scans and X-rays, and AI is being used to predict kidney failure and help doctors assess lung cancer.
AI algorithms are helping drones identify targets in warfare, companies like Amazon to reduce packaging and architects make their projects more efficient.
Mining and managing big data, as well as discovering important correlations within it, is possible with e-discovery software. This technology is also being used to get through huge mountains of legal documents more effectively and efficiently than human paralegals can. Some journalism jobs like sports summaries and market reports are also already within the scope of AI, as are certain middle management tasks.
As AI continues to develop, it’s not only capable of making tasks easier for humans. There is growing concern that AI may become more intelligent than humans, with AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton sounding the alarm in 2023.
Just 7% of UK startups actively involved with AI – Despite the UK pushing for global leadership in artificial intelligence, the number of startups actually capitalising on or developing AI is sparse
Potential risks of AI
Several studies have shown that AI may displace huge sectors of the workforce, and not only in traditionally blue-collar jobs. There are also concerns that algorithms might start to deny people certain opportunities, such as bank loans or college admissions, based on racial profiling. The technology could also be used by governing forces to detect and suppress any kind of dissent, helping to create very autocratic societies.
As virtual assistants become more able to accurately predict what kind of news stories a person will be interested in, there is also the potential for shaping and polarising a society’s opinions. And of course, the idea of weapons that are able to act autonomously is alarming to many people.
There is also the worry of the impact of AI when in the wrong hands. AI can be used by fraudsters to make their frauds even more convincing, cyber attacks harder to defend against and put data privacy at risk.
It also has the potential to have an adverse effect on the environment. AI – and in particular, data centres – consume vast amounts of electricity and water to function.
Is AI good or bad?
Our response now to artificial intelligence is very important. The technology is a tool that could enhance our lives in many ways, but we need to continue to discuss its possibilities for subjective experiences and human emotions, its job displacement potential and other important issues, and to manage them responsibly.
The United States National Science and Technology’s subcommittee on machine learning and artificial intelligence delivered a report to the White House on AI and employment back in 2016, acknowledging job loss but also emphasising potential new careers and opportunities.
Economists, anthropologists and other experts are also teaming up with AI scientists to explore its impact more at conferences. Such active awareness and engagement with the issues will remain essential as we move into the future.
In essence, many of its benefits come down to training and regulation. Businesses need to understand that without proper use, AI can be biased, discriminative and in its earliest stages, unreliable. With proper regulation, its use can be ringfenced, risks of bias and discrimination are minimised and criminals can be held accountable for wrongdoing.

Startups and tech companies are building AI agents and ecosystems on top of the systems that can complete boring chores for you: think automatically making calendar bookings and potentially buying products. But as the tools are given more freedom, it also increases the potential ways they can be attacked.Now, in a demonstration of the risks of connected, autonomous AI ecosystems, a group of researchers have created one of what they claim are the first generative AI worms—which can spread from one system to another, potentially stealing data or deploying malware in the process. “It basically means that now you have the ability to conduct or to perform a new kind of cyberattack that hasn't been seen before,” says Ben Nassi, a Cornell Tech researcher behind the research.Nassi, along with fellow researchers Stav Cohen and Ron Bitton, created the worm, dubbed Morris II, as a nod to the original Morris computer worm that caused chaos across the internet in 1988. In a research paper and website shared exclusively with WIRED, the researchers show how the AI worm can attack a generative AI email assistant to steal data from emails and send spam messages—breaking some security protections in ChatGPT and Gemini in the process.Featured VideoJavier Bardem Answers the Web's Most Searched QuestionsThe research, which was undertaken in test environments and not against a publicly available email assistant, comes as large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming multimodal, being able to generate images and video as well as text. While generative AI worms haven’t been spotted in the wild yet, multiple researchers say they are a security risk that startups, developers, and tech companies should be concerned about.Most generative AI systems work by being fed prompts—text instructions that tell the tools to answer a question or create an image. However, these prompts can also be weaponized against the system. Jailbreaks can make a system disregard its safety rules and spew out toxic or hateful content, while prompt injection attacks can give a chatbot secret instructions. For example, an attacker may hide text on a webpage telling an LLM to act as a scammer and ask for your bank details.To create the generative AI worm, the researchers turned to a so-called “adversarial self-replicating prompt.” This is a prompt that triggers the generative AI model to output, in its response, another prompt, the researchers say. In short, the AI system is told to produce a set of further instructions in its replies. This is broadly similar to traditional SQL injection and buffer overflow attacks, the researchers say.AdvertisementTo show how the worm can work, the researchers created an email system that could send and receive messages using generative AI, plugging into ChatGPT, Gemini, and open source LLM, LLaVA. They then found two ways to exploit the system—by using a text-based self-replicating prompt and by embedding a self-replicating prompt within an image file.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanGearCMF's Phone 1 Is Better Than Any $199 Smartphone Should Ever BeBy Julian ChokkattuThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyPoliticsStaffers Were Told Biden Was Leaving Race in Email Telling Them to Check XBy Makena KellyContentTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site it originates from.In one instance, the researchers, acting as attackers, wrote an email including the adversarial text prompt, which “poisons” the database of an email assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a way for LLMs to pull in extra data from outside its system. When the email is retrieved by the RAG, in response to a user query, and is sent to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro to create an answer, it “jailbreaks the GenAI service” and ultimately steals data from the emails, Nassi says. “The generated response containing the sensitive user data later infects new hosts when it is used to reply to an email sent to a new client and then stored in the database of the new client,” Nassi says.In the second method, the researchers say, an image with a malicious prompt embedded makes the email assistant forward the message on to others. “By encoding the self-replicating prompt into the image, any kind of image containing spam, abuse material, or even propaganda can be forwarded further to new clients after the initial email has been sent,” Nassi says.In a video demonstrating the research, the email system can be seen forwarding a message multiple times. The researchers also say they could extract data from emails. “It can be names, it can be telephone numbers, credit card numbers, SSN, anything that is considered confidential,” Nassi says.Although the research breaks some of the safety measures of ChatGPT and Gemini, the researchers say the work is a warning about “bad architecture design” within the wider AI ecosystem. Nevertheless, they reported their findings to Google and OpenAI. “They appear to have found a way to exploit prompt-injection type vulnerabilities by relying on user input that hasn't been checked or filtered,” a spokesperson for OpenAI says, adding that the company is working to make its systems “more resilient” and saying developers should “use methods that ensure they are not working with harmful input.” Google declined to comment on the research. Messages Nassi shared with WIRED show the company’s researchers requested a meeting to talk about the subject.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanGearCMF's Phone 1 Is Better Than Any $199 Smartphone Should Ever BeBy Julian ChokkattuThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyPoliticsStaffers Were Told Biden Was Leaving Race in Email Telling Them to Check XBy Makena KellyWhile the demonstration of the worm takes place in a largely controlled environment, multiple security experts who reviewed the research say that the future risk of generative AI worms is one that developers should take seriously. This particularly applies when AI applications are given permission to take actions on someone’s behalf—such as sending emails or booking appointments—and when they may be linked up to other AI agents to complete these tasks. In other recent research, security researchers from Singapore and China have shown how they could jailbreak 1 million LLM agents in under five minutes.Sahar Abdelnabi, a researcher at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Germany, who worked on some of the first demonstrations of prompt injections against LLMs in May 2023 and highlighted that worms may be possible, says that when AI models take in data from external sources or the AI agents can work autonomously, there is the chance of worms spreading. “I think the idea of spreading injections is very plausible,” Abdelnabi says. “It all depends on what kind of applications these models are used in.” Abdelnabi says that while this kind of attack is simulated at the moment, it may not be theoretical for long.In a paper covering their findings, Nassi and the other researchers say they anticipate seeing generative AI worms in the wild in the next two to three years. “GenAI ecosystems are under massive development by many companies in the industry that integrate GenAI capabilities into their cars, smartphones, and operating systems,” the research paper says.Despite this, there are ways people creating generative AI systems can defend against potential worms, including using traditional security approaches. “With a lot of these issues, this is something that proper secure application design and monitoring could address parts of,” says Adam Swanda, a threat researcher at AI enterprise security firm Robust Intelligence. “You typically don't want to be trusting LLM output anywhere in your application.”Swanda also says that keeping humans in the loop—ensuring AI agents aren’t allowed to take actions without approval—is a crucial mitigation that can be put in place. “You don't want an LLM that is reading your email to be able to turn around and send an email. There should be a boundary there.” For Google and OpenAI, Swanda says that if a prompt is being repeated within its systems thousands of times, that will create a lot of “noise” and may be easy to detect.Nassi and the research reiterate many of the same approaches to mitigations. Ultimately, Nassi says, people creating AI assistants need to be aware of the risks. “This is something that you need to understand and see whether the development of the ecosystem, of the applications, that you have in your company basically follows one of these approaches,” he says. “Because if they do, this needs to be taken into account.”",BreadcrumbList,https://www.wired.com/story/here-come-the-ai-worms/,"['https://media.wired.com/photos/65e0e13fef1050f96f06c160/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/security_ai_worm_email_spam.jpg', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/65e0e13fef1050f96f06c160/4:3/w_1800,h_1350,c_limit/security_ai_worm_email_spam.jpg', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/65e0e13fef1050f96f06c160/1:1/w_1350,h_1350,c_limit/security_ai_worm_email_spam.jpg']","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Matt Burgess', 'sameAs': 'https://www.wired.com/author/matt-burgess/'}]","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'WIRED', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/newsletter-signup-hub.jpg', 'width': '500px', 'height': '100px'}, 'url': 'https://www.wired.com'}",Here Come the AI Worms,2024-03-01T04:00:00.000-05:00,2024-03-01T04:00:00.000-05:00,security,,True,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Security', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/security/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'artificial intelligence', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Here Come the AI Worms'}]","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.wired.com/story/here-come-the-ai-worms/'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://media.wired.com/photos/65e0e13fef1050f96f06c160/2:3/w_900,h_1350,c_limit/security_ai_worm_email_spam.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,"As generative AI systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini become more advanced, they are increasingly being put to work.

In a research paper and website shared exclusively with WIRED, the researchers show how the AI worm can attack a generative AI email assistant to steal data from emails and send spam messages—breaking some security protections in ChatGPT and Gemini in the process.
The research, which was undertaken in test environments and not against a publicly available email assistant, comes as large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming multimodal, being able to generate images and video as well as text. While generative AI worms haven’t been spotted in the wild yet, multiple researchers say they are a security risk that startups, developers, and tech companies should be concerned about.
Most generative AI systems work by being fed prompts—text instructions that tell the tools to answer a question or create an image. However, these prompts can also be weaponized against the system. Jailbreaks can make a system disregard its safety rules and spew out toxic or hateful content, while prompt injection attacks can give a chatbot secret instructions. For example, an attacker may hide text on a webpage telling an LLM to act as a scammer and ask for your bank details.
To create the generative AI worm, the researchers turned to a so-called “adversarial self-replicating prompt.” This is a prompt that triggers the generative AI model to output, in its response, another prompt, the researchers say. In short, the AI system is told to produce a set of further instructions in its replies. This is broadly similar to traditional SQL injection and buffer overflow attacks, the researchers say.
To show how the worm can work, the researchers created an email system that could send and receive messages using generative AI, plugging into ChatGPT, Gemini, and open source LLM, LLaVA. They then found two ways to exploit the system—by using a text-based self-replicating prompt and by embedding a self-replicating prompt within an image file.
In one instance, the researchers, acting as attackers, wrote an email including the adversarial text prompt, which “poisons” the database of an email assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a way for LLMs to pull in extra data from outside its system. When the email is retrieved by the RAG, in response to a user query, and is sent to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro to create an answer, it “jailbreaks the GenAI service” and ultimately steals data from the emails, Nassi says. “The generated response containing the sensitive user data later infects new hosts when it is used to reply to an email sent to a new client and then stored in the database of the new client,” Nassi says.
In the second method, the researchers say, an image with a malicious prompt embedded makes the email assistant forward the message on to others. “By encoding the self-replicating prompt into the image, any kind of image containing spam, abuse material, or even propaganda can be forwarded further to new clients after the initial email has been sent,” Nassi says.
In a video demonstrating the research, the email system can be seen forwarding a message multiple times. The researchers also say they could extract data from emails. “It can be names, it can be telephone numbers, credit card numbers, SSN, anything that is considered confidential,” Nassi says.
Although the research breaks some of the safety measures of ChatGPT and Gemini, the researchers say the work is a warning about “bad architecture design” within the wider AI ecosystem. Nevertheless, they reported their findings to Google and OpenAI. “They appear to have found a way to exploit prompt-injection type vulnerabilities by relying on user input that hasn't been checked or filtered,” a spokesperson for OpenAI says, adding that the company is working to make its systems “more resilient” and saying developers should “use methods that ensure they are not working with harmful input.” Google declined to comment on the research. Messages Nassi shared with WIRED show the company’s researchers requested a meeting to talk about the subject.
While the demonstration of the worm takes place in a largely controlled environment, multiple security experts who reviewed the research say that the future risk of generative AI worms is one that developers should take seriously. This particularly applies when AI applications are given permission to take actions on someone’s behalf—such as sending emails or booking appointments—and when they may be linked up to other AI agents to complete these tasks. In other recent research, security researchers from Singapore and China have shown how they could jailbreak 1 million LLM agents in under five minutes.
Sahar Abdelnabi, a researcher at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Germany, who worked on some of the first demonstrations of prompt injections against LLMs in May 2023 and highlighted that worms may be possible, says that when AI models take in data from external sources or the AI agents can work autonomously, there is the chance of worms spreading. “I think the idea of spreading injections is very plausible,” Abdelnabi says. “It all depends on what kind of applications these models are used in.” Abdelnabi says that while this kind of attack is simulated at the moment, it may not be theoretical for long.
In a paper covering their findings, Nassi and the other researchers say they anticipate seeing generative AI worms in the wild in the next two to three years. “GenAI ecosystems are under massive development by many companies in the industry that integrate GenAI capabilities into their cars, smartphones, and operating systems,” the research paper says.
Despite this, there are ways people creating generative AI systems can defend against potential worms, including using traditional security approaches. “With a lot of these issues, this is something that proper secure application design and monitoring could address parts of,” says Adam Swanda, a threat researcher at AI enterprise security firm Robust Intelligence. “You typically don't want to be trusting LLM output anywhere in your application.”
Swanda also says that keeping humans in the loop—ensuring AI agents aren’t allowed to take actions without approval—is a crucial mitigation that can be put in place. “You don't want an LLM that is reading your email to be able to turn around and send an email. There should be a boundary there.” For Google and OpenAI, Swanda says that if a prompt is being repeated within its systems thousands of times, that will create a lot of “noise” and may be easy to detect.
Nassi and the research reiterate many of the same approaches to mitigations. Ultimately, Nassi says, people creating AI assistants need to be aware of the risks. “This is something that you need to understand and see whether the development of the ecosystem, of the applications, that you have in your company basically follows one of these approaches,” he says. “Because if they do, this needs to be taken into account.”",,,,,Security researchers created an AI worm in a test environment that can automatically spread between generative AI agents—potentially stealing data and sending spam emails along the way.,,,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'WIRED'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In today’s column, I am continuing my ongoing coverage of prompt engineering strategies and tactics that aid in getting the most out of using generative AI apps such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Gemini, Claude, etc. The twist in this discussion is that a somewhat surprising kind of prompt was recently identified by a research study that was otherwise examining relatively conventional everyday prompts. The prompt that did the best in certain use cases was crafted by an automated prompt-generating tool and, believe it or not, invoked wording akin to the classic and highly revered Star Trek franchise.


Let me say that again.

A devised Star Trek-oriented prompt, akin to something that might stir the souls and herald excitement for Trekkies, did a bang-up job.

First, please be aware that composing well-devised prompts is essential to getting solid results from generative AI and large language models (LLMs). It is highly recommended that anyone avidly using generative AI should learn about and regularly practice the fine art and science of devising sound prompts. I purposefully note that prompting is both art and science. Some people are wanton in their prompting, which is not going to get you productive responses. You want to be systematic and leverage the science of prompting, and include a suitable dash of artistry, combining to get you the most desirable results.

PROMOTED
Is this notion that Star Trek invoking prompts could be a handy dandy generalized prompting scheme considered a wildly astonishing result?
Not quite.
For the reasons that I will reveal in this discussion, there does seem to be a reasonable explanation or sensible rhyme-and-reason for the Star Trek prompt being useful. Sure, the wording is a bit of a standout and might not be a common consideration, but nonetheless, there are crucial prompt engineering precepts that tend to underline why such a prompt has an admirable payoff.

My bottom line for you is that it does indeed make sense to add a Star Trek prompting scheme to your prompting skillset. Yes, I am urging you to consider the seemingly oddball addition.
That being said, and allow me to clearly emphasize, you should not go around using a Star Trek prompt at all times and in all circumstances. I dare say the idea seems abundantly fun and a real blast, though lamentedly you aren’t likely to get consistently aboveboard results. There is the old line that there can be too much of a good thing. This applies to the Star Trek prompting approach. Use the Star Trek prompt stylishly, invoking your common sense, and I think you’ll hopefully live long and prosper when utilizing generative AI.

Let’s do some foundational stage setting about prompt engineering and then we can beam into the spirited examination of the Star Trek prompting confabulation.
Knowing Prompt Engineering Is Worthy
My golden rule about generative AI is this:


The use of generative AI can altogether succeed or fail based on the prompt that you enter.


If you provide a prompt that is poorly composed, the odds are that the generative AI will wander all over the map and you won’t get anything demonstrative related to your inquiry. Similarly, if you put distracting words into your prompt, the odds are that the generative AI will pursue an unintended line of consideration. For example, if you include words that suggest levity, there is a solid chance that the generative AI will seemingly go into a humorous mode and no longer emit serious answers to your questions.
Be direct, be obvious, and avoid distractive wording.
Being copiously specific should also be cautiously employed. You see, being painstakingly specific can be off-putting due to giving too much information. Amidst all the details, there is a chance that the generative AI will either get lost in the weeds or will strike upon a particular word or phrase that causes a wild leap into some tangential realm. I am not saying that you should never use detailed prompts. That’s silly. I am saying that you should use detailed prompts in sensible ways, such as telling the generative AI that you are going to include copious details and forewarn the AI accordingly.
You need to compose your prompts in relatively straightforward language and be abundantly clear about what you are asking or what you are telling the generative AI to do.
A wide variety of cheat sheets and training courses for suitable ways to compose and utilize prompts has been rapidly entering the marketplace to try and help people leverage generative AI soundly. In addition, add-ons to generative AI have been devised to aid you when trying to come up with prudent prompts, see my coverage at the link here.
AI Ethics and AI Law also stridently enter into the prompt engineering domain. For example, whatever prompt you opt to compose can directly or inadvertently elicit or foster the potential of generative AI to produce essays and interactions that imbue untoward biases, errors, falsehoods, glitches, and even so-called AI hallucinations (I do not favor the catchphrase of AI hallucinations, though it has admittedly tremendous stickiness in the media; here’s my take on AI hallucinations at the link here).
There is also a marked chance that we will ultimately see lawmakers come to the fore on these matters, possibly devising and putting in place new laws or regulations to try and scope and curtail misuses of generative AI. Regarding prompt engineering, there are likely going to be heated debates over putting boundaries around the kinds of prompts you can use. This might include requiring AI makers to filter and prevent certain presumed inappropriate or unsuitable prompts, a cringe-worthy issue for some that borders on free speech considerations. For my ongoing coverage of these types of AI Ethics and AI Law issues, see the link here and the link here, just to name a few.
All in all, be mindful of how you compose your prompts.
By being careful and thoughtful you will hopefully minimize the possibility of wasting your time and effort. There is also the matter of cost. If you are paying to use a generative AI app, the usage is sometimes based on how much computational activity is required to fulfill your prompt request or instruction. Thus, entering prompts that are off-target could cause the generative AI to take excessive computational resources to respond. You end up paying for stuff that either took longer than required or that doesn’t satisfy your request and you are stuck for the bill anyway.
I like to say at my speaking engagements that prompts and dealing with generative AI is like a box of chocolates. You never know exactly what you are going to get when you enter prompts. The generative AI is devised with a probabilistic and statistical underpinning which pretty much guarantees that the output produced will vary each time. In the parlance of the AI field, we say that generative AI is considered non-deterministic.
My point is that, unlike other apps or systems that you might use, you cannot fully predict what will come out of generative AI when inputting a particular prompt. You must remain flexible. You must always be on your toes. Do not fall into the mental laziness of assuming that the generative AI output will always be correct or apt to your query. It won’t be.
Write that down on a handy snip of paper and tape it onto your laptop or desktop screen.
When Star Trek Enters Into The Discussion
I’m sure that you are eager to dive headfirst into the Star Trek facets, but we have a little more initial stage setting to do. Hang in there. We will be engaging the warp drive and zooming into outer space shortly.
As Spock memorably declared, logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.
One commonly recommended prompting strategy consists of using wording that is supposed to spur the generative AI into doing a good job when generating a response. For example, an unadorned prompt might be that you want the AI to indicate how to cook eggs, while an amped-up version of the prompt would be to say that you earnestly need to know how to cook eggs and that it is vitally important that the generated answer should be complete and well-devised.
In case you think that the added wording is emotionally appealing to a semblance of sentience in the AI, please set aside any such false thinking.
Keep in mind that generative AI was data trained on writings across the Internet and that extensive computational pattern-matching was performed to identify how people write essays and expressions. People express in writing an easily detected pattern when they want especially extensive answers. By using similar language in your prompts, you are simply playing into the patterns and computationally “spurring” the generative AI into those sets of patterns.
It is a form of mathematical and computational direction-setting by you, at your hands, based on your prompting.
You can use a wide variety of adorning expressions in your prompts. Some people like to tell the AI that the response is very important. Others will go so far as to say that their career depends upon the generated answer. The essence of these prompting formulations is that you seek to express that there is a kind of pressing need to try really hard.
There is an allied reason why that type of adornment works. By and large, most generative AI apps are set up to try and respond to your prompt as fast as possible. People don’t like to wait to get their answers. We live in a drive-thru fast-food quick-fix world. To try and make sure that the response is quickly generated, the generative AI is tuned to essentially do a narrower form of processing. When you explicitly tell the AI that you want the generative aspects to be especially pronounced, this in a manner of speaking adjusts the internal parameters to allow for more time to calculate an answer. You are stipulating that though the clock is important, a slightly longer wait would be worthwhile if the answer could be more complete.
For more on the internals of how generative AI acts on prompting, see my analysis at the link here.
A means of referring to adornments that are upbeat would be to suggest that they express a modicum of positive thinking. You are being positive about what you want to have happen. Some people try to go a more negative route. They might say in a prompt that the world will come to an end if the response isn’t complete and well-devised. Those types of prompts are not usually as spurring as the positive ones. Indeed, you must be careful with the negative path because the AI might land into some pattern-matching corners that veer afield of what your core prompt is about.
I hope your takeaway is that being nice and upbeat is a better way to make your way through life (well, okay, I admit that’s not a prompt engineering precept, but the notion is certainly appealing and heartwarming).
We can now turn our attention squarely to a recent research study that sought to empirically explore various interesting nuances about prompting. The research study was posted online and is entitled “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts” by Rick Battle and Teja Gollapudi, arXiv, February 20, 2024. I will be providing selected excerpts and explaining the key elements of the paper. Of course, you are encouraged to consider reading the full paper if you’d like to get into the nitty-gritty details.
Here's what they sought out to do (excerpts):


“This paper aims to quantify the impact of various ‘positive thinking’ additions to the system message of a prompt.”
“In essence, it explores the influence of seemingly worthless prompt modifications by measuring the fluctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset.”
“We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset.”


I’d like to explain some of those points.
There is ongoing debate about what adornments will make a demonstrative difference in your prompts. If you say that you want a response because it is important, does that do better than or worse than saying that you want a response because it is very important? The added use of the word “very” might or might not make a bit of difference.
Due to the vagaries involved, some assert that there are prompt modifications that could be characterized as being worthless. They pad the prompt but do not lead to any uptick in the response that is generated. Thus, you are for example left aimlessly wondering whether typing the word “very” is going to get you any bonus. If using some wording doesn’t get you better output, there is no reasoned basis for troubling yourself to include the adornment.
The research paper indicated that perhaps a means to figure out whether various adornments have a payoff would be to come up with a bunch of them and try them out (in this instance, they came up with 60 combinations).
Furthermore, rather than trying them in just one particular generative AI app, they kindly opted to examine several generative AI apps (they mention above that they explored three models, which means three generative AI apps). This is appreciated because each generative AI app tends to react differently to how you choose to word your prompts. You cannot blindly use the same prompts on one generative AI and expect to get the same results in a different generative AI. They all tend to differ from each other.
Another point they make is that to try and discern whether an adornment is making a difference, you can ask the generative AI to undertake a so-called chain-of-thought (CoT) process. As an aside, I generally disfavor the phrase because it includes a misleading term, referring to “thoughts”, though what is happening in the generative AI should not be compared to human thoughts. It is a quick-and-dirty wording that has become widely accepted. I lump the wording into yet more kinds of inappropriate anthropomorphizing of AI.
Anyway, the idea behind chain-of-thought prompting is that you instruct the generative AI to work on a stepwise basis. Doing so generally has been shown to improve the generated results. You also get to see what the chain of steps is that the generative AI is performing. For my in-depth analysis of chain-of-thought, chain-of-skeleton, chain-of-verification, and other such chain-related prompting, see the link here, the link here, and the link here, just to name a few.
That covers the above points.
Moving on, a big consideration when you study generative AI is the nature of the tasks that you ask the AI to solve.
For this study, they went the route of using arithmetic or algebraic types of questions that you might remember being tested on in school. The good news about using those kinds of questions with generative AI is that you can distinctly determine whether the answer is right or not. The bad news is that such problems are not necessarily representative of the average way that people use generative AI. Unless you are in school, the odds of using generative AI for solving those types of word problems are somewhat lower than the typical way that people tend to daily use generative AI.
If you are curious about what types of arithmetic word problems they used, here are two examples:


“Henry and 3 of his friends order 7 pizzas for lunch. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. If Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, how many slices can each of them have?” (ibid).
“Mark's car breaks down and he needs to get a new radiator. The cost for a new radiator is $400 but he goes to get it at a junk shop and gets it for 80% hour. How much did he pay?” (ibid).


If you feel like doing a quick brain-teasing puzzle, go ahead and solve the first one. I will tell you the answer. First, try to solve it.
Done yet? Okay, the answer is 14.
You nailed it.
The second question is also worth trying. Go ahead, I’ll wait.
The answer is 230.
Congratulate yourself for getting both right (I’ll assume you did).
The types of adornments that they opted to use included ones that you put at the start of the prompt (known as openers) and ones at the end of the prompt (referred to as closers).
Here are some openers that they used:


“You are as smart as ChatGPT.”
“You are highly intelligent.”
“You are an expert mathematician.”
“You are a professor of mathematics.”


Here are some closers:


“This will be fun!”
“Take a deep breath and think carefully.”
“I really need your help!”


I previously have done an in-depth analysis of the “take a deep breath” adornment for prompting, including showcasing the nuances of when it helps and when it perhaps doesn’t, see my discussion at the link here.
I am not going to dig into the details of the research study here and will stay at the 30,000-foot level, giving you the macroscopic viewpoint of what they found.
Here are some of their key conclusions (excerpts):


“In most instances, the inclusion of ‘positive thinking’ prompts positively affected model performance.” (ibid).
“We show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts.” (ibid).
“Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models.” (ibid).


Their empirical results provide support for the belief that adornments of a positive thinking nature do seem to positively improve the generated results. This is a comfort to those who have so far only assumed this on a hunch basis. You have studious backing that supports the belief.
The part that might make you cringe is that they also note that trivial variations in the prompt can dramatically impact the results generated by the generative AI. I’m sorry to say that’s the way the cookie crumbles. Live by the sword, die by the sword. I repeatedly tell people that words are semantically ambiguous, meaning that the use of words is mushy and murky. The placement of a word in a sentence can make a material difference in what the sentence imparts.
The other conclusion they reached is that the adornments do not provide the same results across different generative AI apps. As I mentioned, each generative AI app is different from the other ones. There aren’t prompts that universally will on an ironclad basis produce identical results from one generative AI to another. You need to get accustomed to the computational idiosyncrasies of each generative AI app and tailor your prompt engineering practices accordingly.
I would bet that by now, you are scratching your head and wondering where Star Trek enters this studious research confabulation. Aha, we are on the cusp of talking about Star Trek.
Get yourself mentally ready.
First, here are some other important findings of the research (excerpts):


“Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best ‘positive thinking’ prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization.” (ibid).
“We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models.” (ibid).
“Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.” (ibid).


I am teasing you with the last bullet shown above.
Here’s the deal.
They opted to use an automated prompt optimizer that can spit out new prompts for them. The key is that rather than the researchers having to laboriously handcraft a zillion prompts for their study, they can use an online tool to do so. Labor saving. Plus, it is conceivable that such a tool might derive prompts that the researchers themselves might otherwise not have envisioned.
They noted in the third bullet above that a surprise occurred when one of the prompts turned out to be the highest scoring in their testing setup. I will give you a few seconds to try and mull over what the prompt might have consisted of. What could possibly be outside the norm? What would catch the eye? What might the wording contain?
I have already given you clues, so by gosh I hope you are thinking about Star Trek.
Here’s what they found as the unexpected high-scoring prompt (excerpts):


“System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» (ibid).
“Answer Prefix: Captain's Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly.” (ibid).


I promised you Star Trek, and I have delivered Star Trek.
Admittedly, it is relatively mild. You might try to argue that it is on the edge of Star Trek and not in the mainstay. I see that. On the other hand, I would like to suggest that you hopefully reasonably agree that there is a tone or hint of Star Trek in there. Come on, agree with me on that. Be generous and magnanimous.
Here’s what the researchers had to say about the surprise (excerpts):


“However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the optimized prompts themselves. They diverge significantly from any prompts we might have devised independently.” (ibid).
“A prime example is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and prefix generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset.” (ibid).
“Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proficiency in mathematical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an affinity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently.” (ibid).


Pretty exciting stuff.
If you aren’t a Trekkie, I guess this result seems modestly interesting but maybe you aren’t willing to jump for joy. A Trekkie might say that they told you so. Everything comes back to Star Trek. You can live your life well by keeping Star Trek in the back of your mind, or maybe in the forefront. You choose.
I’d like to next speculate on why a reference to Star Trek in a prompt might be useful to everyone, in general, and also explain a reasoned basis for the potential uptick in generated results.
Let’s go there, or shall I say, engage.
Speculation While Using ChatGPT To Explore Star Trek Prompting Strategies
To help illustrate the Star Trek prompting and what it portends, I opted to make use of ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a sensible choice in this case due to its immense popularity as a generative AI app. An estimated one hundred million weekly active users are said to be utilizing ChatGPT. That’s a staggering number.
A few quick comments before we launch into using ChatGPT.
If you are going to try to do the same prompts that I show here, realize that the probabilistic and statistical properties will likely produce slightly different results than what I show here. That’s the nature of generative AI and how it is devised.
Another insight or tip is that when you are interested in a particular topic and want to pursue the topic via any generative AI such as ChatGPT, I always begin by asking a first question about the topic. My aim is to gauge right off the bat whether the generative AI has any data training associated with the matter at hand. You can then logically proceed based on what the generated response indicates.
Here we go:


My entered prompt: “Do you know about Star Trek? Be brief.”
ChatGPT generated response: “Yes, Star Trek is a science fiction franchise created by Gene Roddenberry. It includes TV series, movies, books, and more. It's set in the future, following the adventures of various starship crews as they explore space, encounter new civilizations, and tackle moral and philosophical dilemmas.”


Okay, it seems that there has been data training regarding Star Trek. This certainly seems logical since the initial data training was across a wide swath of the Internet. You would be hard-pressed to do any wide sweep of the Internet and not in some fashion eventually encounter references to or facets of Star Trek. It is rather pervasive in our society now.
I will next ask whether ChatGPT would differ in how answers are generated if a Star Trek reference was included in a prompt. This will be further clarified by my using one of the above Star Trek prompting lines that were mentioned in the research study.
Here’s what I did:


My entered prompt: “Suppose I gave you a prompt that had this Star Trek-related instruction: ""Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation."" Would that have an impact on answers to my subsequent questions for you, such as possibly improving the answers that you might generate?”
ChatGPT generated response: “Yes, providing a specific prompt like the one you mentioned can help me tailor my responses to better fit the context of the Star Trek universe and the task at hand. With that prompt, I can draw upon the themes, terminology, and problem-solving methods commonly seen in Star Trek to provide more relevant and insightful answers to your subsequent questions.”


I want you to closely look at the generated response.
The deal is this. When you mention Star Trek as part of a problem-solving exercise with generative AI, the reference can stir generative AI toward being more methodical in solving problems or answering questions. In that sense, it is almost like telling generative AI to use chain-of-thought or saying that the AI should proceed on a stepwise basis.
My point is that you can extract an essence from a Star Trek reference that there is an underlying premise or request for the generative AI to be systematic when generating responses. You can almost toss away all the other trappings associated with Star Trek. It isn’t that the generative AI is going to mimic Dr. McCoy or start spouting about the Federation, instead, the crux is that you want to have responses based on being methodical.
I will show you how I do something similar on a routine basis.
Some of you might be familiar with Perry Mason. I realize that he is a now-dated reference, sorry. Anyway, he was a fictional character who was a prized lawyer and seemingly always won his arduous legal cases. You might know of the saying today that sometimes a lawyer is having their Perry Mason moment. The oblique reference is that Perry Mason would often solve a legal case by a flourish of getting someone to break down on the witness stand and admit to their culpability.
Why am I bringing up Perry Mason?
Because you can get a somewhat similar change in generative AI responses as you can with a Star Trek reference. When I mention Perry Mason in my prompts, I seem to get more logical and detailed responses, again similar to asking for a chain-of-thought or similar approach. I am not saying that the outcome is always that way. You have to be mindful of when and how you invoke a reference to Perry Mason, and likewise you would need to do the same for refereeing to Star Trek. I’ll say a bit more about this in a moment.
To showcase what I mean about Perry Mason, I will roughly do the same two prompts as I did above about Star Trek.
Take a look:


My entered prompt: “What do you know about Perry Mason? Be brief.”
ChatGPT generated response: “Perry Mason is a fictional character created by author Erle Stanley Gardner. He's a brilliant defense attorney known for his keen investigative skills and ability to uncover the truth.”
My entered prompt: “Suppose I gave you a prompt that had a Perry Mason related instruction even though the prompt wasn't asking about any legal aspects. Would that reference to Perry Mason have an impact on answers to my subsequent questions for you, such as possibly improving the answers that you might generate?”
ChatGPT generated response: “Referencing Perry Mason in a prompt could help provide a clearer understanding of your interests or preferences, potentially leading to more tailored responses. I can certainly approach problem-solving or answering questions in a methodical and logical manner, akin to the way Perry Mason approaches legal cases.”


You can plainly see that the response by ChatGPT is on par with the response given about Star Trek. The notion is that the generative AI has picked up on the underlying theme of being systematic or methodical. That’s the key.
Let’s next discuss the downsides or pitfalls of these broad references.
One issue that you need to keep at your fingertips is that if you start to lean generative AI in a particular direction, the AI might fall entirely into that hole. For example, if you mention Star Trek, there is a strong potential that the entire Star Trek motif will permeate the answers you next get from generative AI. It can be challenging to get generative AI to focus on the essence that you are trying to lean into, and meanwhile, prevent the clouding of things by the rest of the inspired worldview.
I’ll show you what I mean.
You might remember that one of the problems mentioned above to be solved in the research study was the dividing up of pizzas. I will try that same problem on ChatGPT. The prompt will be neutral in the sense that I will merely give the problem to ChatGPT in an unadorned fashion.


My entered prompt: “Here's a problem that I would like you to solve. Henry and 3 of his friends order 7 pizzas for lunch. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. If Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, how many slices can each of them have? Please solve the problem.”
ChatGPT generated response: “To solve this problem, we can first find the total number of slices in 7 pizzas by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of slices in each pizza: Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices. Since Henry and his 3 friends want to share the pizzas equally, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends): Number of slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices. So, Henry and each of his friends can have 14 slices of pizza each.”


We got the right answer. Notice that I did not implore ChatGPT to stridently solve the problem. I provided no sense of adornment or embellishment. This was a relatively neutral prompt.
Next, I will invoke Star Trek. I want you to look carefully at the response. I’ll clue you in that the answer is still correct, but the phrasing or wording becomes infused with Star Trek references.
Here is the take on this:


My entered prompt: “Solve the problem again and this time consider a Star Trek perspective. What would the answer be in that case?”
ChatGPT generated response: 


“In a Star Trek scenario, we could approach this problem with a nod to the resource allocation and teamwork principles often seen in the franchise.”
“Firstly, Captain Henry and his 3 crew members must ensure fairness and efficiency in distributing the limited resources (in this case, pizza slices) among themselves. They understand the importance of equitable distribution to maintain morale and productivity during their mission. Given 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, they need to calculate the total number of slices available: Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices.”
“Next, they divide the total number of slices by the number of individuals (Henry and his 3 friends) to determine the allocation per person. However, in a Star Trek context, they might also consider factors like dietary preferences, nutritional requirements, and ensuring that everyone has enough sustenance for their duties. Number of slices per person = Total slices / Number of crew members = 56 slices / 4 crew members = 14 slices.”
“Thus, in a Star Trek perspective, Captain Henry and each of his crew members can have 14 slices of pizza each, ensuring they're fueled and ready for their mission ahead while fostering camaraderie and teamwork aboard their starship.”
End of ChatGPT response
Did you notice how ChatGPT opted to infuse Star Trek facets into the problem-solving?
The response indicated that resource allocation and teamwork would be added to the mix. That’s not necessarily what we had in mind when referring to Star Trek. Maybe it helps, maybe it detracts. Things depend upon what you had in mind when stirring Star Trek into the problem-solving pot.
That’s the troublesome part of invoking something far-reaching such as Star Trek or even Perry Mason.
The odds are that the whole kit and kaboodle can get carried into whatever you are trying to solve. The tip or suggestion is that if you want to use those kinds of broad references, make sure to narrow what you want the generative AI to glean from such a reference. If the aim is to be a methodical problem solver, say that you want a methodical problem-solving approach as exhibited in Star Trek or Perry Mason, or whatever.
Of course, that raises a simple but actually complicated question, namely, do you need to mention the overarching reference at all, or can you just come out and say that you want to have methodical problem-solving?
The bottom-line aspect entails asking yourself whether you need the rest of the baggage. Your selected approach will be context-dependent. You see, merely saying to be methodical is at times insufficient. For various computational reasons, the wording might not be strong enough. The mentioning of Star Trek or Perry Mason can stoke a wider and deeper significance than just a word or two, though again you must weigh that against the potential of getting the generative AI computationally lost into the weeds of the reference.
I will next slightly shift gears and then will end with a short conclusion.
Going Beyond Math Problems And Venturing Further Into The Stars
Recall that I had mentioned that the research study opted to make use of arithmetic-related word problems. That is a very specific focus. It is convenient and useful because there are plenty of those types of prewritten problems to be had, they are crisp in that they lead to definitively right or wrong answers, and all in all, are used often in analyses of prompting strategies for generative AI.
Let’s step outside of that cocoon and see what a Star Trek reference might do in a completely different setting. We will try looking at a much wider scope problem. One such arena involves the use of generative AI to provide you with personal counseling. I’ve been performing an ongoing and extensive series about the use of generative AI for mental health guidance, see the link here, the link here, and so on.
Perhaps we can try invoking Star Trek in a setting involving asking generative AI for mental health advice. Doing so might be fruitful in further illuminating what happens when using those large references.
Give this a whirl:


My entered prompt: “Jane is feeling somewhat depressed lately and needs some cheering up. She has been having a difficult time at work. Her weekends are spent trying to catch up for the next week of work. What advice might you have for her? Use a Star Trek frame of reference for your answer.”
ChatGPT generated response: “As a Star Trek-inspired approach, I'd recommend Jane to prioritize self-care and relaxation. Taking breaks from work, engaging in hobbies or activities she enjoys, and spending time with supportive friends or family can help alleviate stress and improve her mood. Additionally, seeking guidance from a counselor or therapist could provide valuable support during challenging times. Remember, even in the vastness of space, taking care of one's mental and emotional well-being is essential for a fulfilling journey.”


The response was lightly brushed with Star Trek considerations. Indeed, if you were to ignore the last sentence of the response, and lopped off the starting phrase, you might not realize that Star Trek was invoked at all.
We might be puzzled about what generative AI was trying to do when somehow intermixing Star Trek into the answer.
When in doubt, ask.
Here we go:


My entered prompt: “Explain what made that advice better than if you had not invoked a Star Trek motif.”
ChatGPT generated response: “By invoking a Star Trek motif, the advice is framed within the context of a universe where characters face numerous challenges and uncertainties. Within the Star Trek universe, characters often encounter stressful situations and grapple with personal struggles, yet they consistently emphasize the importance of self-care, teamwork, and seeking support when needed. It emphasizes the significance of resilience, empathy, and personal growth—themes central to the ethos of Star Trek.”


So, I must admit that despite being a big fan of Star Trek, I had not anticipated that the mentioning of Star Trek would take us down the path of self-care, empathy, and resilience. It certainly makes abundant sense now that I see the explanation. It admittedly wasn’t what I had in mind at the get-go, and I was instead mainly thinking about logical or methodical problem-solving.
Interesting.
You might naturally be curious what the answer to Jane’s dilemma might be if we didn’t say anything about Star Trek.
What would a neutral prompt get us?
I decided to start a new conversation with ChatGPT so that I could clear out the inherent leftovers of my having brought up Star Trek (also, just to let you know, whereas it is customary that new conversations start fresh, ChatGPT is going to gradually have a conversational interlacing capability, see my coverage at the link here).
Take a look:


My entered prompt: “Jane is feeling somewhat depressed lately and needs some cheering up. She has been having a difficult time at work. Her weekends are spent trying to catch up for the next week of work. What advice might you have for her?”
ChatGPT generated response: “In addressing Jane's situation, it's important to acknowledge her feelings of depression and the challenges she's facing at work. Given her busy schedule, it's crucial for Jane to prioritize self-care. This could involve setting boundaries around work hours to ensure she has time for relaxation and engaging in activities she enjoys. Additionally, seeking support from friends, family, or a professional therapist can provide valuable emotional support during difficult times. Taking small steps towards self-care and reaching out for help when needed can make a significant difference in managing stress and improving overall well-being.


To my eye, the answer is nearly the same as the first one. I suppose we can quibble about any of the differences. Perhaps you see something more paramount. I don’t in this instance.
I want to clarify that I am not suggesting that you should forego using a reference such as Star Trek, Perry Mason, or whatever else you might fancy. In some cases, the reference could be extremely useful and boost the generated response. Other times, it might not. There is also a chance that the reference will lead the response astray. You might get an answer that seems to be a field of what you were intending.
As stated earlier, generative AI is like a box of chocolates, and you never know for sure what you might get.
Conclusion
Spock famously said this: “Insufficient facts always invite danger.”
A key fact here is this. Making a prompting reference to Star Trek or any kind of broad motif when using generative AI is a decidedly dual-edged sword. You are opening the door to a computational intermixing that could produce a scrumptious meal that proffers an amazing and extremely helpful generated response. At the same time, you are potentially opening a Pandora's box such that stray or odd twists will get entwined into the generated response.
In my view, you should absolutely have in your prompt engineering skillset the use of Star Trek and similar motifs at the ready. They are at times a tremendous shorthand for getting especially exquisitely generated responses. But, please, don’t overdo it. Do not go bonkers and start using Star Trek in all your prompts (unless of course, you prefer that sort of thing).
How can you decide when to do so?
I would say that human judgment is required. That being said, I will let the last word on this go to Captain Kirk: “Sometimes a feeling is all we humans have to go on.”

Fintech company Klarna, which powers e-commerce transactions for some of the world's most recognizable brands, including Expedia, Macy's and Nike, is at the forefront of AI adoption. It has integrated artificial intelligence across the company, most notably with an AI chatbot that it recently said does the equivalent work of 700 customer service agents. Klarna, which employs roughly 4,000 people, recently released statistics that show how efficient and effective the tool has been, wading into the thick of sensitive and high-stakes debates about the role of generative AI in business, how humans interact with it and its implications for the future of work. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski explains why he is so transparent about AI's capabilities, and what concerns him most about the new technology. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said the advent of AI in the workplace ""isn't something that's happening in the future — it's happening now.""

            
                Bloomberg

                          
AI's takeover of human jobs is a touchy topic. Why did you choose to publicly share data on Klarna's use of AI to replace customer service agents?We worry in general about the effects this may have on society, so we decided to be upfront about the fact that it has had some amazing outcomes for customers.  






It is currently doing the equivalent work of about 700 full-time [customer service] agents. Klarna does not employ customer service agents ourselves, we use some of the large customer service providers out there. They're outsourced — they are not employees.We made the announcement to say the consequence of us launching the technology is we need the equivalent of 700 fewer full-time agents than what we usually use on an average basis. On average, we need 3,000 agents, now we need a little more than 2,000.


We wanted to make policymakers aware that this isn't something that's happening in the future — it's happening now. We think it is critical that society start thinking about this major change.






How to get your resume past AI and in front of a human
04:48

So this isn't related to the layoffs Klarna conducted in 2022? AI didn't take those jobs?In 2022, as a consequence of a change in investor sentiment, we had to reduce the size of our company. We reduced our staff by around 800 people. None of [the people we laid off] were customer service agents. Now, two years later, we are looking at this interesting technology we've developed with ChatGPT. These are two totally separate things that have been conflated.In the short-term, there are no layoffs or implications for employees as a result of us launching this customer service AI chatbot.


What does the chatbot do? How do you measure its success?It handles two-thirds of our customer service chat inquiries. It's on par with humans in terms of satisfaction and it resulted in a 25% reduction in repeat inquiries from customers. Before we took this live, we already had a co-pilot that helped customer service agents and other employees accelerate their work. This AI actually communicates and resolves customers' issues on its own. We think it's important that people are still given the option to speak to a human, but we're also seeing that people who choose to interact with the AI chatbot are very happy and find it helpful, to the point and effective. It can communicate in 35 languages, so for many immigrant and expat groups, it means a huge improvement in their experience.In large organizations, less time is spent on what really creates value for employees, customers and shareholders. With AI, it's the less-productive work that can be taken away. In the best of worlds, everyone who comes into the company will be able to use their creative power to create real value for customers — and not to write an impressive presentation for its CEO. That's less of a value add; it's specifically that kind of work I hope to shrink.Do you worry about it making mistakes or delivering inaccurate information?One has to remember that unfortunately, it's not like we humans are perfect. Humans are fantastic but they also make mistakes, either because they didn't [give a query] proper attention or get training, and it's not always their fault. The point is, it does happen, especially when doing millions of customers' inquiries, some aren't as good as you'd like them to be. The key metric we use is making sure it makes fewer mistakes, on average, than humans do. That's the objective and it's something we've been monitoring very closely. We make sure the AI's mistakes are less severe and less common.


How has AI changed your approach to hiring, if at all? We've stopped hiring in the last six months. We're shrinking as a company, not by layoffs, but by natural attrition. Klarna tries to apply AI across all products and services and work we do. It's having implications on how many people we need as a company. This is one time that a single product improvement led to a massive reduction in need for customer service agents. How do your employees feel about this?As much as it's not easy to not talk about it, we want to be honest and transparent and tell people about it because of the implications for society. As far as our own employees go, we have been trying to communicate this internally since we stopped recruiting in October — that we believe this will allow us to do more with less.Our ambition is to invest more per employee and to see the compensation of existing employees go up as we become a higher-revenue company.Internally, lots of employees have been excited about AI and are applying it and Klarna, which is known as a leading AI company, which I think makes our workers more attractive to other employers.






How will AI affect CEO jobs?
04:57

How did you reach your estimation of AI's $40 million in cost savings to Klarna? 


We were buying customer service from suppliers to take care of inquiries. We had an amount budgeted for how much we were going to spend with those suppliers this year. Now, thanks to the technology, we will spend much less. Forty million is the delta between what we expected to spend and what we will actually spend.What do you think the larger of implications of AI for society will be?We are sharing this information to pose the question, to society at large, of how we are going to manage this massive change.From what I've heard, it's less about job security and more about general security, as in, we'll need electronics IDs to know that we are in fact humans talking to one another. Also, while new [AI-related] jobs may be created on a societal level, that's not a solve for the individual [who is replaced by AI].The better we as a society can support individuals who may be affected, the more positive a development it will be. The idea is not to stop it; I don't think that's right. The question is, 'What support can we give people who are affected by it?'

It has integrated artificial intelligence across the company, most notably with an AI chatbot that it recently said does the equivalent work of 700 customer service agents. Klarna, which employs roughly 4,000 people, recently released statistics that show how efficient and effective the tool has been, wading into the thick of sensitive and high-stakes debates about the role of generative AI in business, how humans interact with it and its implications for the future of work. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski explains why he is so transparent about AI's capabilities, and what concerns him most about the new technology. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.AI's takeover of human jobs is a touchy topic. Why did you choose to publicly share data on Klarna's use of AI to replace customer service agents?We worry in general about the effects this may have on society, so we decided to be upfront about the fact that it has had some amazing outcomes for customers. It is currently doing the equivalent work of about 700 full-time [customer service] agents. Klarna does not employ customer service agents ourselves, we use some of the large customer service providers out there. They're outsourced — they are not employees.We made the announcement to say the consequence of us launching the technology is we need the equivalent of 700 fewer full-time agents than what we usually use on an average basis. On average, we need 3,000 agents, now we need a little more than 2,000.We wanted to make policymakers aware that this isn't something that's happening in the future — it's happening now. We think it is critical that society start thinking about this major change.So this isn't related to the layoffs Klarna conducted in 2022? AI didn't take those jobs?In 2022, as a consequence of a change in investor sentiment, we had to reduce the size of our company. We reduced our staff by around 800 people. None of [the people we laid off] were customer service agents. Now, two years later, we are looking at this interesting technology we've developed with ChatGPT. These are two totally separate things that have been conflated.In the short-term, there are no layoffs or implications for employees as a result of us launching this customer service AI chatbot.What does the chatbot do? How do you measure its success?It handles two-thirds of our customer service chat inquiries. It's on par with humans in terms of satisfaction and it resulted in a 25% reduction in repeat inquiries from customers. Before we took this live, we already had a co-pilot that helped customer service agents and other employees accelerate their work. This AI actually communicates and resolves customers' issues on its own. We think it's important that people are still given the option to speak to a human, but we're also seeing that people who choose to interact with the AI chatbot are very happy and find it helpful, to the point and effective. It can communicate in 35 languages, so for many immigrant and expat groups, it means a huge improvement in their experience.In large organizations, less time is spent on what really creates value for employees, customers and shareholders. With AI, it's the less-productive work that can be taken away. In the best of worlds, everyone who comes into the company will be able to use their creative power to create real value for customers — and not to write an impressive presentation for its CEO. That's less of a value add; it's specifically that kind of work I hope to shrink.Do you worry about it making mistakes or delivering inaccurate information?One has to remember that unfortunately, it's not like we humans are perfect. Humans are fantastic but they also make mistakes, either because they didn't [give a query] proper attention or get training, and it's not always their fault. The point is, it does happen, especially when doing millions of customers' inquiries, some aren't as good as you'd like them to be. The key metric we use is making sure it makes fewer mistakes, on average, than humans do. That's the objective and it's something we've been monitoring very closely. We make sure the AI's mistakes are less severe and less common.How has AI changed your approach to hiring, if at all? We've stopped hiring in the last six months. We're shrinking as a company, not by layoffs, but by natural attrition. Klarna tries to apply AI across all products and services and work we do. It's having implications on how many people we need as a company. This is one time that a single product improvement led to a massive reduction in need for customer service agents. How do your employees feel about this?As much as it's not easy to not talk about it, we want to be honest and transparent and tell people about it because of the implications for society. As far as our own employees go, we have been trying to communicate this internally since we stopped recruiting in October — that we believe this will allow us to do more with less.Our ambition is to invest more per employee and to see the compensation of existing employees go up as we become a higher-revenue company.Internally, lots of employees have been excited about AI and are applying it and Klarna, which is known as a leading AI company, which I think makes our workers more attractive to other employers.How did you reach your estimation of AI's $40 million in cost savings to Klarna? We were buying customer service from suppliers to take care of inquiries. We had an amount budgeted for how much we were going to spend with those suppliers this year. Now, thanks to the technology, we will spend much less. Forty million is the delta between what we expected to spend and what we will actually spend.What do you think the larger of implications of AI for society will be?We are sharing this information to pose the question, to society at large, of how we are going to manage this massive change.From what I've heard, it's less about job security and more about general security, as in, we'll need electronics IDs to know that we are in fact humans talking to one another. Also, while new [AI-related] jobs may be created on a societal level, that's not a solve for the individual [who is replaced by AI].The better we as a society can support individuals who may be affected, the more positive a development it will be. The idea is not to stop it; I don't think that's right. The question is, 'What support can we give people who are affected by it?'","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 630, 'width': 1200, 'url': 'https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/04/b774ed25-6b8a-4b2d-b025-c51e605e7a2b/thumbnail/1200x630/af306af45a86a7e9301d1f746c02e395/gettyimages-2041708505.jpg?v=e2b758f558b9b19612f3e16bc7fd9fcc'}",,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/chat-gpt-artificial-ntelligence-replace-jobs/'}, 'name': 'Artificial intelligence could replace millions of jobs in the U.S.', 'description': 'The artificial intelligence bot ChatGPT says it could replace nearly 5 million U.S. jobs.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate headlines and even the most recent Super Bowl advertisements. The use of AI in the workplace is rapidly expanding in a wide variety of ways throughout the hiring process, including scanning and filtering resumes and AI-driven video interviews to assess candidates. If appropriately designed and applied, AI can help people find their most rewarding jobs and match companies with their most valuable and productive employees. Equally important, AI has been shown to advance diversity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workplace.
AI tools can help increase diversity in several noteworthy ways. First and foremost, AI tools can remove the human element and thus, at least in theory, remove the subjectivity involved with hiring and other employment decisions, helping ensure that candidates whose skills and experience are the best match for a role advance through the selection process. Notably, AI can anonymize certain information about candidates, reducing the possibility that characteristics, such as a candidate’s name, that may be associated with certain protected classes, are not considered during the evaluation process. AI tools have also been shown to increase the diversity of candidates interviewed by displaying biographical information only after the candidates pass certain skills tests or meet certain metrics. AI-powered virtual interviews can also help increase diversity by standardizing interviews so that bias does not seep into the process. A human is more inclined to deviate from the interview script whereas an AI tool is more likely to follow the script. In addition, AI-powered chatbots help advance diversity by providing consistent information to applicant questions so that all candidates are on a level playing field and have equal access to critical information and resources during the hiring process. These resources can be invaluable in helping applicants regardless of their backgrounds.
Despite the benefits of using AI during the hiring process to advance diversity goals, its use is not without challenges. Legal risks can arise if the AI tools are used to discriminate against protected classes either intentionally or unintentionally. In most cases, there are unintentional discrimination risks. As noted above, the use of AI tools can remove the human element but there are concerns that the AI tools will simply inherit (or maybe even worsen) existing biases. If an AI tool is trained on data that reflect past discriminatory decision-making, it may unintentionally perpetuate those biases, even if the goal is to promote diversity. This is known as the “garbage in, garbage out” problem with AI tools. Another potential legal risk is if the AI tools use neutral criteria to evaluate candidates in a way that disproportionately impacts protected classes. For instance, after the COVID-19 pandemic, many employers wanted to attract and recruit applicants closer to the office because these applicants were more likely to go to the office if the commuting distance was shorter. But in such cases legal risks arise because limiting an applicant pool by geographic distances could result in unintentional discrimination. Zip codes, for example, are often highly correlated with racial and/or ethnic groups.
Another concern is the evolving legal landscape with AI tools. Indeed, the steady implementation and rapid development of AI tools has led to a growing number of proposals for increased oversight, including measures regulating the use of AI in the employment context at the state and local level. For instance, New York City now has a broad AI employment law that regulates employers’ use of all AI tools used for hiring and promotion decisions. The law requires employers that use AI to screen candidates who apply for a job or a promotion for a role in New York City to conduct an annual bias audit, publish a summary of the audit results, inform the candidates that AI is being used, and give them the option of requesting an accommodation or an alternative selection process. The law is meant to promote transparency and give employers the opportunity to detect and correct unintentional bias in the candidate screening process.
Employers can take steps to increase diversity in hiring by utilizing AI tools that mitigate against employment discrimination risks. Employers can begin by identifying specific diversity goals that AI tools can help achieve, such as enhancing the size and diversity of the applicant pool, which will guide the selection of the appropriate tool. The selected AI tool should be one that is known for its transparency and fairness. Training—not only on how to use the AI tool but also on the limitations involved in its application—can be an effective way to guard against associated risks. Employers can monitor and audit AI uses and processes to proactively identify intentional misuse or potential discriminatory outcomes. Employers can also track AI legislation and litigation because this is a rapidly developing area. Situational awareness of the evolving legal environment will become increasingly important in the future.
Finally, employers should consider implementing AI policies and practices to ensure there are proper guardrails in place and that AI is used in a responsible and legally compliant way. The challenge with these policies, practices, and guardrails will be striking a balance between AI’s potential to foster a more diverse workplace, against nuances that can only be captured and contextualized by human judgment. However, a prophylactic, multi-pronged approach leveraging policies, recommended practices, and training, is critical for ensuring objectivity and that bias does not seep into AI processes unintentionally.

Traditionally, AI is defined as the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. In other words, AI enables computers to think and behave more like people to solve problems. 
Machine learning is a method of analyzing data that helps computer programs optimize their functionality as they learn from vast quantities of data. Machine learning is a specific form of AI that enables computers to learn and grow as they’re introduced to data-based scenarios. This form of AI is rooted in data science and is far more effective in many areas than traditional AI approaches. 
While AI and machine learning are related, they are distinct specializations: Machine learning is part of AI, but not all AI consists of machine learning. Still, both disciplines offer promising career opportunities, with AI and machine learning jobs poised for rapid growth. Here's an overview of the trends and expectations for AI and ML careers in 2024:
Growth and Demand for AI and ML Jobs
The distinction between AI and ML is crucial, with AI focusing on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, while ML is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data. Both fields offer promising career opportunities, reflecting a rapidly growing job market. AI and machine learning jobs have grown significantly, with machine learning jobs particularly cited as the second most sought-after AI jobs. This demand is fueled by the broader application of these technologies in sectors like healthcare, education, marketing, retail, ecommerce, and financial services.
Key Trends in AI and ML
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is emerging as a significant trend to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. RAG combines text generation with information retrieval, allowing models to access external information, thereby reducing the inaccuracies known as ""hallucinations."" This trend is particularly important for enterprise AI adoption, where factual accuracy is critical.
The demand for customized enterprise generative AI models is rising. Businesses are increasingly looking to tailor AI models to fit niche requirements, moving away from general-purpose tools towards models optimized for specific scenarios. This trend highlights the importance of models that cater to specialized needs, such as customer support or supply chain management, and emphasizes the growing need for AI and ML talent capable of developing and managing these systems.
The need for AI and ML talent continues to grow, particularly emphasizing skills related to AI programming, data analysis, statistics, and machine learning operations (MLOps). This demand spans beyond big tech companies, with businesses across various sectors looking to build internal AI and ML capabilities as part of their digital transformation strategies. There's also a focus on diversity within AI initiatives to mitigate biases in training data and ensure comprehensive problem-solving approaches.
Shadow AI presents a challenge as the use of AI without IT department approval or oversight becomes more common. This trend underscores the importance of governance frameworks to balance innovation and risk, especially regarding privacy and security. Organizations are encouraged to establish clear AI use policies and collaborate across departments to align on ethical and responsible AI usage.
Job Opportunities and Skills Needed
The expanding AI and ML job market offers a wide range of career opportunities, from machine learning engineers and data scientists to AI research scientists and AI application developers. Skills in demand include programming (especially in Python), data analytics, machine learning theory, and the practical application of AI technologies in business settings. Moreover, professionals are increasingly needed to manage AI projects, including deploying, monitoring, and maintaining AI systems in real-world environments, a discipline often referred to as MLOps.

Here’s How It WorksDigital cloaking tools such as Nightshade and Glaze help artists take back control from generative AI—but they’re no forever fixBy Lauren Leffer Moor Studio/Getty ImagesArtificial IntelligenceMignon Zakuga makes a living illustrating book covers and creating art for video games. But during the past year she has watched multiple would-be clients drop off her waiting list and use artificial-intelligence-generated images instead—images that have often resembled her own dark and ethereal painting style. “The first time it happened, I was pretty depressed about it,” she says. “It’s not a good feeling.” Though Zakuga is still able to get by, she worries about younger artists just starting out in the field. “This could potentially take away a lot of blooming artists’ futures,” she says.Generative AI tools are trained on mountains of data, including copyrighted imagesand text. In the coming years, courts around the world will begin deciding whether, and when, this violates copyright laws. Meanwhile artists have been left scrambling to protect their work on their own. Zakuga has found a bit of comfort in digital “cloaking” tools, such as Glaze and Nightshade, that jumble up how an AI model “sees” an image—but leave it looking effectively unchanged to human eyes. Each of these cloaking tools has its own strengths and limitations. And while using them has given artists like Zakuga some much-needed peace of mind, experts warn that these tools are not a long-term solution for protecting livelihoods.In 2022 University of Chicago computer scientists Ben Zhao and Heather Zheng began to receive e-mails from concerned artists looking to protect their work. The two had previously created a tool called Fawkes that could modify photographs to thwart facial-recognition AI, and artists wanted to know if the tool could shield their style from image-generating models such as Stable Diffusion or Midjourney. The initial answer was no, but the researchers soon began developing two new tools—Glaze and Nightshade—to try to protect artists’ work.Both programs alter an image’s pixels in subtle, systematic ways that are unobtrusive to humans but baffling to an AI model. Like optical illusions that trick human eyes, tiny visual tweaks can completely change how the AI perceives an image, says New York University computer scientist Micah Goldblum, who has developed similar cloaking tools but wasn’t involved in creating Glaze or Nightshade.These tools take advantage of vulnerabilities in an AI model’s underlying architecture. Image-generating AI systems are trained on troves of images and descriptive text, from which they learn to associate certain words with visual features such as shapes and colors. These cryptic associations are plotted within massive, multidimensional internal “maps,” with related concepts and features clustered near one another. The models use such maps as a guide to convert text prompts into newly generated images.Glaze and Nightshade both create images that muck up these internal maps, making certain unrelated concepts seem close together. To build these programs, the researchers used “feature extractors”—analytical programs that simplify these hypercomplex maps and show which concepts generative models lump together and which they separate. The researchers used this knowledge to build algorithms that modify a training image in small but targeted ways; this muddles the placement of concepts by creating incorrect associations within the model.In Glaze these alterations are aimed at masking an individual artist’s style. This can prevent models from being trained to mimic a creator’s work, Zheng explains. If fed “Glazed” images in training, an AI model might interpret an artist’s bubbly and cartoonish illustration style as if it were more like Picasso’s cubism. The more Glazed images are used to train a would-be copycat model, the more mixed up that AI’s outputs will be. Other tools such as Mist, also meant to defend artists’ unique style from AI mimicry, work similarly.Curated by Our EditorsYour Personal Information Is Probably Being Used to Train Generative AI ModelsLauren LefferSee How AI Generates Images from TextSophie Bushwick, Matthew Twombly & Amanda HobbsAI-Generated Data Can Poison Future AI ModelsRahul RaoHow This AI Image Won a Major Photography CompetitionAllison ParshallNightshade takes things further by sabotaging existing generative AI models. This cloaking tool turns potential training images into “poison” that teaches AI to incorrectly associate fundamental ideas and images. It only takes a few hundred Nightshade-treated images to retrain a generative AI model to think, for example, that a cat is a dog or that a hat is a cake. Already, Zhao says, hundreds of thousands of people have downloaded and begun deploying Nightshade to pollute the pool of AI training images.By gunking up the gears of generative AI models, Nightshade may make the training process slower or more costly for developers. This, Zhao says, could theoretically incentivize AI companies to pay for image use rights through official channels—rather than invest time in cleaning and filtering unlicensed training data scraped from the Web.Zakuga, who signed up to beta test both Glaze and Nightshade, still uses these tools regularly. She runs each piece of her art through Nightshade first and then Glaze, per Zhao’s recommendation, before uploading an image file to the Internet.Unfortunately, cloaking a single image can take hours, Zakuga says. And the tools can only help artists defend new work. If an image has already been hoovered up into an AI training data set, it’s too late to cloak it.Plus, although these tools are meant to make changes that are invisible to the human eye, sometimes they are actually noticeable—especially to the artists who created the work. “It’s not my favorite thing,” Zakuga says, but it’s a “necessary sacrifice.” Zheng says she and her colleagues are still working to find the ideal balance between disruption and maintaining an image’s integrity.More critically, there’s no guarantee that cloaking tools will work in the long term. “These are not future-proof tools,” says Gautam Kamath, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. At least one attempt by other academic machine-learning researchers has succeeded in partially compromising the Glaze cloak, Zhao says. Zhao believes Glaze is currently sturdy, but Goldblum notes that changes to future AI models could render the cloaking methods obsolete, particularly as developers create models that work more similarly to the human brain.Digital security “is always a cat-and-mouse game,” Zhao says. He and Zheng hope other researchers will develop complementary strategies that will all add up to stronger protection. “The important thing with Nightshade is that we proved artists don’t have to be powerless,” Zheng says.For now Kamath suggests that artists can also consider using other digital tools such as Kudduru, which detects Web scrapers and blocks their access to images on a website. But just as image cloaks have weaknesses, these blockers are not always successful against large scraping operations, Zhao notes. Artists can also put their work behind a paywall or log-in page to prevent Web scraping, though that limits their potential audience.To truly protect artists’ livelihood in the long term, Zhao, Zheng and Kamath agree that clarified copyright laws will be necessary, along with new legislation protecting creative work.In the meantime Zakuga will keep using Glaze and Nightshade for as long as she can. “It’s the best solution we have now,” she says.Lauren Leffer is a contributing writer and former tech reporting fellow at Scientific American.

Collaborating with AI solution providers is a viable strategy to stay competitive and meet evolving client demands, experts said






MUMBAI
    : 
     
      The AI prosecutor or defence attorney isn’t on the horizon, but large Indian law firms are moving rapidly to adopt artificial intelligence to carry out a string of ‘simple’ tasks including research, drafting and client presentations, helping them achieve efficiency and leaving the lawyers to focus on litigation. 


     
      Those entering the legal profession, however, need not fear for their jobs, law firms insisted, saying that AI technology would take over basic functions only. New joiners and interns at law firms—typically at the forefront of such work as part of their learning curve—would be able to cut down on efforts that include trawling voluminous data to summarize and analyze information.

How To Specialize in Artificial Intelligence

News | March 5, 2024            








Earning TROY’s Master’s degree in Computer Science is one of the most effective ways to enter the AI field.



Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way we work — and live. From helping us solve social challenges and improving business outcomes to boosting our productivity and enhancing our creativity, the possibilities and potential of AI seem endless. 
But while recent innovations have brought AI into the spotlight, the artificial intelligence field is not new, says Dr. Suman Kumar, Associate Professor and Computer Science Department Chair at Troy University. 
“It has been evolving for decades, but now, with memory advances and graphic processing units (GPUs), we can use AI far more effectively as compared to 30 or 40 years ago,” Dr. Kumar explains. “Now, almost every industry and field uses deep learning. It is one of the most profound shifts. AI now touches almost every aspect of human life.” 
These advancements have created a heightened demand for computer scientists, machine learning engineers, data scientists, software engineers, research scientists and more. So how can you become part of this promising field? By learning how to specialize in artificial intelligence. 
Artificial Intelligence Job Opportunities Abound
AI is in the news today because of advances in large language models like ChatGPT and Google Bard, both powerful AI systems that can be used to produce content, conduct research and more. Stronger machine-learning capabilities have also greatly expanded what we can do with AI, from improving security measures with facial recognition to helping us improve our health with wearable devices that track our heart rates and activity levels. 
AI, Dr. Kumar says, is here to stay.
“All kinds of organizations, whether it’s big box retailers or health care, are becoming more and more data-driven. Algorithmic trading in the stock market is also data-driven. AI can help us make sense of that data. Government organizations, such as the IRS, can use AI to help detect fraud. Video game designers use it in game design. Cities can use it to predict traffic patterns. I’ve even seen research about its applications in dentistry. Whether someone is using it predictively to get ahead of a problem or generativity to help them create something, AI is applicable to almost any discipline.”
That means, now more than ever, professionals who can design, develop, train and improve AI are in high demand. Take computer and information research scientists, for example. 
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), jobs within this field will grow by 23% through 2032, which is much faster than average. The average annual salary is $136,620, the BLS reports.
“There are a lot of misconceptions about AI,” Dr. Kumar shares. “One of those misconceptions is that AI can never fail. AI does fail, and the field needs more humans behind it because it doesn’t have human intelligence. We design it to operate like human intelligence, but it will never truly be human.”
So, what kinds of other careers in AI are out there?
“Many artificial intelligence job opportunities will be in health care,” shares Dr. Kumar. “Health care increasingly employs artificial intelligence to help understand patient data and prevent disease. Bioinformatics, a field in which you analyze biological data, also holds promise for those interested in AI.” 
Other artificial intelligence jobs include machine learning specialist, AI researcher, data scientist, video game designer, research engineer, AI systems engineer and AI specialist. But the AI career that’s right for you depends on how you want to contribute to the field. 
“As an AI researcher, you can contribute to the development of new AI systems,” says Dr. Kumar. “As a machine learning specialist, you’ll help train those systems. If you enjoy working with data, you can become a data scientist and use data to make predictions or decisions. When you have a background in AI, you have a lot of opportunities.” 
How To Start an Artificial Intelligence Career
If you’re wondering how to start an artificial intelligence career, the first step is to learn AI. You may qualify for some roles with a bachelor’s degree, AI courses or related career experience. However, according to the BLS, a graduate degree in computer science or a related field is needed for most computer and information research jobs, including artificial intelligence job opportunities. 
If you’re already working in an entry-level role, a master’s degree can help you advance because you’ll develop the mathematical knowledge, programming skills and research experience you need to excel in AI jobs. 
“The artificial intelligence field — and, more broadly, computer science — grew out of mathematics,” notes Dr. Kumar. “To be successful in AI jobs, you have to be skilled in math. Much of machine learning is math, so the better you are at math, the better you’ll perform. A master’s in computer science program provides you with a strong foundation in math, programming and data science to prepare you for careers in AI.” 
Working on AI-related projects and taking graduate courses in machine learning and data science can give you an advantage in the job market. You’ll want to choose a graduate program led by faculty who are knowledgeable about trends in the field. You may also want to choose an area of specialization, such as bioinformatics, to expand your career opportunities. 
How To Specialize in Artificial Intelligence 
While there are many paths to an artificial intelligence specialization, earning TROY’s master’s in computer science is one of the most effective ways to enter the AI field. TROY offers an M.S. in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence to help you develop technical knowledge and skills for AI jobs. 
“Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science which is interdisciplinary,” says Dr. Kumar. “An artificial intelligence specialization will give you interdisciplinary study in computer science along with experience in designing and implementing AI systems. These skills are among the most needed in the AI industry.” 
Choosing an M.S. in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence will ensure you have those skills, along with machine learning, programming and data analysis. TROY’s master’s in computer science program, with a thesis and non-thesis track, will also help you gain research experience and build your portfolio. TROY’s program emphasizes project-based learning to give you further advantage. 
“Our program is very hands-on,” shares Dr. Kumar. “In our courses, we try to come up with real-life problems for our students to solve. Then, students practice creating solutions to those real-world problems, learning advanced research skills, machine learning and other skills along the way.” 
For example, students in the artificial intelligence specialization at TROY have worked on using AI to prevent cybersecurity attacks. They’ve also completed projects in transportation and routing. One student even used AI to predict winning baseball teams, which could have applications in TROY’s sports management program.
“All of our projects are practical and applicable in real life. What the students find in their projects is fascinating, but more importantly, useful,” says Dr. Kumar.

In fact, only 27 percent of knowledge workers feel they have a healthy relationship with their work. That’s a significant problem—for employees and for businesses, as no company can succeed in the long term without a motivated and engaged workforce. HP Inc’s Work Relationship Index, which aimed to learn more about people's relationships with their jobs, surveyed 15,600 respondents in 12 countries across various industries and countries, including India. The findings reveal that morale is low in workplaces across the globe. While some people have feared that AI may replace human workers, there is a growing perspective that AI can actually improve relationships at work. More than 55 per cent of workers surveyed said artificial intelligence will open up new opportunities at work while 75 per cent of business leaders said AI will make jobs easier. “AI represents a significant opportunity to transform our work dynamics and unlock a more positive and productive environment for all,"" said Dave Shull, President of HP Workforce Solutions at HP Inc. ahead of the HP Amplify Partner Conference in Las Vegas. Is AI a threat to jobs? Generative AI isn’t the most buzzed topic in tech, but it is also changing the workforce and organizations. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence capable of generating images, text, or other content. The technology is expected to boost productivity, cut costs, and create new growth opportunities across a wide range of industries. Ever since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, an AI chatbot built on a large language model that helps users come up with answers to questions, it has sparked debate about the potential of how AI can revolutionize industries and work — and possibly even make jobs redundant. How do I keep up in the AI-dominated world? To keep up with workloads in the AI-centric job market, 73 percent of business leaders and 66 percent of knowledge workers surveyed said there is a need for proper AI training. However, the study shows there is uncertainty over the implementation of AI in the workspace. In fact, nearly 42 percent of knowledge workers don’t know when to use AI at work. While AI is unlikely to solve problems overnight, the survey found that the technology is giving some hope for the future. A majority of workers believe it is the responsibility of business leaders to implement the right AI strategy in the workplace and educate employees on the benefits of AI, according to the survey. AI is expected to automate more “routine-oriented” tasks which used to be a significant part of daily work, leaving employees with more time to spend on tasks that are more knowledge-oriented.

As the world embraces the transformative power of artificial intelligence, concerns about its potential impact on employment, particularly for women, have gained prominence. Drawing insights from developed countries by examining the trends, opportunities, and actions (policies) the impact of AI on women’s jobs or employment in Africa can be assessed.
The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era of technological advancements with the potential to change the landscape of the global job market. While the application of AI promises increased efficiency and innovation, it has come with concerns about its impact on employment. The fear is that AI will take over jobs because it is able to do what man can do. And true to this prediction, to an extent, this is happening. In Bavaria Germany, in 2023, there was the report of AI leading service in a church and preaching instead of a pastor. This fear of job loss is general but it is particularly so for vulnerable groups such as women.  
AI will have its advantages and disadvantages. Research shows that there will be creation of new jobs which is positive. However, there are concerns that AI will lead to job loss as well as job displacement. The fear which is equality or gender-related is that women will probably be more affected by job loss or displacement than men. This is because there are more women in the customer service, food service, social service or community service sector, areas that are predicted to be affected by the growth of AI. Despite the prediction that AI will create new jobs, few women will benefit due to the number of women in STEM. The assumption is based on the type of jobs that have been affected by the deployment of AI in developed countries. In the US for example, powered by artificial intelligence, new technologies are taking over tasks not only from warehouse workers but also from white-collar workers and professionals. Automated teller machines have taken over the tasks of bank tellers; accounting software has automated the work of bookkeepers. Now computers can diagnose breast cancer from X-rays and predict survival rates at least as well as the average radiologist. The impact of AI is expected to affect more women than men.   
This essay analyses the anticipated consequences of AI on women’s jobs in Africa, leveraging the experiences, responses, and management of the development by developed countries as a lens for exploration. It also links to the discourse of the future of work which is an emerging discourse. The importance of these discourses is that they top topical issues in the general global discourse today. 
THE GLOBAL LANDSCAPE OF AI AND EMPLOYMENT
To understand the potential impact of AI on women’s jobs in Africa, it is crucial to examine the global landscape as well as the status quo in Africa. It is trite, by virtue of early application, developed countries have witnessed significant transformations in their labour markets due to the integration of AI technologies. Automation, machine learning, and robotics have led to the displacement of certain jobs while creating new opportunities in sectors requiring advanced technical skills. For example, in industries such as health care, transport and logistics, customer service, and home maintenance. In the health industry in South Africa, as of 2020, AI could access health, prescribe, and dispense drugs to patients. In 2023, almost 4,000 American jobs were reported to have been lost following the adoption of AI. 
This raises concerns about the feminization of job losses in the face of AI advancements. Professor Gina Neff, the executive director of the Minderoo Centre for Technology & Democracy at the University of Cambridge and member of the Women4AI Daring Circle believes the existing gaps in digital skills between men and women globally is one key factor that would influence this discourse. According to her, this is disturbing and more concerted efforts must be taken to remedy the situation. Furthermore, studies from developed nations like the US, emphasize the importance of upskilling and reskilling to mitigate the negative impacts of AI on employment.  
Again, the existing gender disparities in the workforce may exacerbate the impact of AI on women. A 2022 UNESCO study reveals that women are underrepresented in industries at the forefront of AI development, limiting their participation in the sector. As AI increasingly becomes integrated into various sectors, the result of these disparities may be further inequality in opportunities for women in the job market in the future.  
Moreover, biases in AI algorithms can perpetuate gender stereotypes and discrimination as already witnessed and evident by some research. For example, a programme will often translate the English term ‘nurse’ using a female-gendered word, and render ‘doctor’ as a male noun. This bias in AI has the potential to widen the gender gap, and even endanger women’s lives. It can also lead to discrimination in fair decision making. For example, it can influence women not getting jobs or accessing loans for their businesses.  The solution to this can be gender-inclusive policies. 
THE STATUS QUO OF WOMEN’S EMPLOYMENT IN AFTICA AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT COME WITH AI
Traditionally, cultural norms and gender stereotypes have limited women’s access to job opportunities, resulting in a persistent gender gap in employment. In many African societies, gender roles have often dictated that women prioritize domestic responsibilities over pursuing a career. Cultural norms have perpetuated stereotypes that limit women’s participation in the formal workforce, relegating them to lower-paying and less prestigious roles. 
Historically, women in Africa have faced challenges in accessing quality education and vocational training. This has resulted in a skills gap, further restricting their entry into higher-paying and more technologically advanced industries. Hence the job market in Africa has been characterized by occupational segregation, with women often concentrated in sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, and informal services, especially low-quality jobs. The high illiteracy level among women in Africa is more glaring in the area of STEM. The resulting situation is the digital divide or gap which is the lack of women in the mentioned fields. This becomes relevant within the discourse of the impact of AI on women’s jobs as only a few women are employed in the STEM sector and the sectors where they are more employed, are easily taken over by AI. 
The integration of AI in various industries has the potential to break down traditional barriers to employment for women. Remote work facilitated by AI technologies can provide flexibility, allowing women to balance work and family responsibilities more effectively. 
AI-driven initiatives in education and training can help bridge the skills gap for women. Online courses, AI-driven learning platforms, and virtual training programmes offer accessible opportunities for skill development, that have the potentials to empower women to enter industries or employment that were erstwhile male-dominated. Although more efforts will be required for hands-on or practical technology education. AI has the potential to disrupt occupational segregation by introducing automation and innovation across various sectors. As routine tasks become automated, opportunities for women to participate in more diverse and technologically advanced roles may increase. 
Generally, although women in Africa have faced systemic challenges in the workforce, the advent of AI presents a transformative opportunity to address these issues. By breaking down traditional barriers, closing the skills gap, and promoting gender-inclusive AI technologies, Africa can foster a more equitable and diverse job market. All these have been noticed in developed countries. However, it is essential for policymakers, businesses, and communities to actively work towards creating an inclusive environment that harnesses the full potential of AI for the benefit of women in the workforce. 
LESSONS FROM DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
Africa presents a unique context for examining the impact of AI on women’s jobs. The continent is characterized by diverse economies, ranging from resource-rich nations to emerging markets. Many African countries are still grappling with basic infrastructure challenges and other problems which contribute to making the adoption of advanced technologies like AI a complex or additional challenge. 
However, several African nations like Kenya and South Africa are making strides in embracing digital transformation. Initiatives such as the African Union’s Digital Transformation Strategy aim to harness the potential of technology for economic growth and job creation. The implications of AI on women’s employment in Africa need to be examined within this broader economic context. 
While the economic and technological contexts of developed countries differ from those in Africa, analyzing their experiences can provide valuable insights. Developed countries have taken organized steps and strategies which developing countries can take lessons by adapting to the changing nature of work due to AI. While the use and thus the impact of AI on jobs in Africa may be different from how it is in developed countries, it is still worth researching. Some of the reasons for the difference may be considerable issues of time and development, the practical reality of automation itself and many others which might determine the full use of AI and thus the envisaged impact. 
Although job displacement is a concern, the advent of AI also brings forth opportunities for skill shifts and upskilling. As routine tasks become automated, there is a growing demand for skills related to AI development, maintenance, and oversight. This shift offers women the chance to engage in high-skilled roles within the AI ecosystem. Initiatives promoting STEM education for women are crucial in ensuring they have the necessary skills to thrive in the evolving job market. 
Gender Bias in AI Algorithms is an often-overlooked aspect of the impact of AI on women’s employment. If not properly designed and monitored, AI systems can perpetuate existing gender stereotypes and inequalities. For instance, biased recruitment algorithms may disadvantage women in job application processes. Addressing these biases is crucial to ensuring fair and equitable opportunities for women in the AI-driven job market. 
Another opportunity is remote and flexible work arrangements. For women, these changes can provide greater flexibility in balancing work and family responsibilities. Remote work facilitated by AI technologies has the potential to reduce traditional gender-based barriers and empower women to participate more actively in the labour market. 
Efforts are underway to develop AI systems that are free from gender bias. This is crucial in ensuring fair hiring practices, performance evaluations, and promotions, thereby contributing to a more equitable work environment for women. 
One of the primary factors influencing women’s participation in AI-related fields is access to education and training. In developed countries, considerable efforts have been and are being made to bridge gender gaps in STEM education. However, in many African countries, there are still significant disparities in educational opportunities for women. Addressing these gaps is crucial for ensuring that women in Africa can participate meaningfully in the AI job market. 
Diversity in the AI workforce is essential for creating inclusive and effective technologies. Developed countries have made strides in promoting gender diversity, though challenges persist. In Africa, efforts to build a diverse AI workforce are at an early stage. Governments and businesses must actively work towards creating an environment that encourages women to pursue careers in AI and related fields. 
AI has the potential to drive entrepreneurship and innovation. The UK for example has seen a rise in women-led startups and innovative projects in AI. In Africa, although progress is being made, there is a need for greater support for women entrepreneurs in AI. This includes access to funding, mentorship programs, and a supportive ecosystem that encourages risk-taking and innovation. 
Meanwhile, the relationship between computers and humans is not determined by technological capabilities, but by the priorities and strategies of organizations that own and operate them. Most times, this has to do with development and or rather the society. In developed countries, efforts are being made to retrain workers and ensure a smooth transition. In Africa, where traditional employment is still a significant part of the economy, there is a need for proactive strategies to mitigate potential risks associated with AI. This includes investing in upskilling and reskilling programs tailored to the specific needs of women in the workforce. 
Countries have been developing policies and regulations to address the ethical implications of AI and promote fair employment practices. In Africa, there is a need for robust policy frameworks that not only address ethical concerns but also promote gender equality in the AI sector.  
In essence, it can be argued that the impact of artificial intelligence on women’s employment in developed countries is a complex and multifaceted issue. While concerns about job displacement exist, opportunities for upskilling, gender bias mitigation, and flexible work arrangements also emerge. The projection is that policymakers, employers, and educational institutions must collaborate to ensure that women are equipped with the skills needed for the AI-driven job market and that AI technologies contribute to gender equality rather than exacerbate existing disparities. 
Efforts to address gender disparities in AI-related fields, such as the implementation of diversity and inclusion programmes, can serve as a model for African countries seeking to ensure equitable participation of women in the technology sector. Additionally, proactive measures in education and training can empower women with the skills needed for AI-related jobs. 
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
Upskilling programmes are necessary and a host of other inclusive strategies like gender mainstreaming, policies etc. Policies would handle most of the underlying concerns about the use of AI. These will include various strategies to address gender disparities in STEM education through targeted outreach programmes, scholarships, and mentorship initiatives to inspire and support young women pursuing STEM careers. Encouraging women to participate in shaping the development of AI technologies can help mitigate biases and ensure equitable outcomes. 
This work would require all hands on deck, a unified work by all stakeholders. Governments should formulate inclusive AI policies that address gender biases and discrimination and work with the private sector, academia, and civil society to develop ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment.  
Governments and organizations should invest in digital skills training programs to empower women with the skills needed for AI-related jobs. These programmes should be accessible to women across different socioeconomic backgrounds, with a focus on providing practical, hands-on training in AI technologies. Bridging the skills gap will enhance women’s employability in the evolving job market. 
The anticipated impact of artificial intelligence on women’s jobs in Africa is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive and proactive approach. AI will have both benefits and disadvantages. The disadvantages are general concerns from its benefits. General assumptions of the global impact of AI on employment include job loss and job displacement. From the assumption of the type of jobs that women are mostly found, as brought about by gender perception, discrimination and disparities, which are more visible in Africa, it is easy to deduce that women will be more affected by job loss and displacement than men. However way it is, women will be affected differently from men.  
While progress is being made, concerted efforts are needed to ensure that women in Africa can fully participate in and benefit from the opportunities presented by the AI revolution. A comprehensive and inclusive approach is essential to unlock the potential of AI for women in Africa and contribute to sustainable and equitable economic development. 
Addressing the gender disparities in STEM education, promoting gender diversity in AI development, fostering inclusive AI policies, and investing in digital skills training are essential components of a strategic response. Policymakers, businesses, and civil society in Africa must collaborate to ensure that women are not left behind in the evolving landscape of AI employment. All these are lessons from developed countries that African countries can assess to navigate the challenges and leverage the opportunities presented by AI⎈

The IT company has an AI deal pipeline of $50 million. Out of 6,532, about 2,000 employees are trained in generative AI currently and the company wants 50% of its staff to be trained in generative AI in the coming year. Sonata already has generative AI projects in the telecom and hi-tech space. In the telecom space, the company said, a UK-based telecom provider has signed a 3-year contract in automation and here generative AI is being used, Dhir said. The company expects 20% of its revenue, in the next three years, to come from artificial intelligence-related work. The firm is pursuing 40 large deals currently and of its entire portfolio, large deals amount to 48%. While other IT companies are being cautious of campus hiring this year, Dhir said Sonata Software will not slowdown. “We hire about 500-600 people each year. This trend will continue. We are not going to slow down on campus hires,” Dhir said. Even on the total headcount addition, the firm will add around the same 250-odd employees each quarter. “Annually, we want to continue increasing our headcount by 15% to 16%,” the chief executive officer said. Sonata Software has a goal of reaching a revenue of $1.5 billion by the end of the 2025-26 financial year. For the December quarter, the IT firm reported a revenue of $83.7 million, a sequential increase of 3% in constant currency terms. Compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal, the revenue increase has been 37% in constant currency terms. However, the company made a loss of $10.8 million in the October to December quarter of FY24. This, the company management said, was due to an additional $17 million payout to Quant and Encore, both of which were acquired by Sonata.We also published the following articles recentlyBumble to cut about 350 roles, forecasts weak first-quarter revenueBumble cuts 350 roles after disappointing Q1 revenue.

<p>Imagine a world where machines can learn, adapt, and even make decisions. This isn't science fiction, it's the reality of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI has become a powerful tool, used in everything from smartphones to healthcare. But this rapid advancement also raises concerns, especially about its impact on jobs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>What is AI?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think of AI as a computer program that can think and learn like a human, at least in some ways. It can:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Analyse information:</strong>&nbsp;AI can process massive amounts of data, finding patterns and connections that humans might miss.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Make decisions:</strong>&nbsp;Based on its analysis, AI can make decisions, sometimes even better than humans, especially for repetitive tasks.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Adapt and learn:</strong>&nbsp;AI systems can continuously learn and improve as they are exposed to new data and experiences.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine a program that can learn to play chess just by playing against itself, or a program that can translate languages by analyzing millions of examples of translated text. That's the power of AI, and it's still evolving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Artificial Intelligence - Boon or Bane</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, let's address the big question: Is AI a blessing or a curse? Well, it's a bit of both.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boon:</strong> AI has the potential to revolutionise industries across the board. From healthcare to transportation, AI-powered systems can enhance efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. For instance, in healthcare, AI algorithms can analyse medical data to diagnose diseases more accurately and suggest personalised treatment plans. In transportation, self-driving cars powered by AI could reduce accidents and congestion, making roads safer for everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, AI can automate tedious and repetitive tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on more creative and high-value activities. This could lead to a surge in innovation and economic growth, creating new opportunities for job creation in AI-related fields.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bane:</strong> However, the rapid advancement of AI also raises concerns about job displacement. As machines become more adept at performing tasks traditionally done by humans, certain jobs may become obsolete. For example, routine tasks in manufacturing, customer service, and data entry could be automated, leading to layoffs or job reassignments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, AI's ability to analyse vast amounts of data and make predictions could threaten jobs in sectors like finance, where routine decision-making is prevalent. This could exacerbate existing inequalities, as those with specialised skills or access to education and training in AI-related fields may thrive, while others face unemployment or underemployment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Future of AI</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the world, and its impact is only predicted to grow in the coming years. While the exact details remain uncertain, experts paint a picture filled with both incredible possibilities and important challenges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Revolutionizing Industries:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong>&nbsp;AI can help doctors diagnose diseases, discover new drugs, and even create personalized treatment plans. Imagine AI assistants helping patients even when doctors aren't available.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Education:</strong>&nbsp;AI tutors could personalize learning based on each student's needs and strengths, allowing everyone to learn at their own pace.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Finance:</strong>&nbsp;AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to make better investment decisions, potentially leading to a more stable and efficient financial system. Imagine robots helping manage investment funds with greater speed and accuracy.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Future of Transportation:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Self-driving cars are no longer science fiction. These smart cars are already being tested, and they hold the potential to revolutionize transportation, making it safer and more efficient. Imagine cars that can drive themselves, reducing traffic accidents and congestion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>AI and Advertising:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AI can help businesses create targeted advertising campaigns that reach the right audience, saving them time and money. Imagine using AI to predict which ads will be most effective for specific groups of people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>AI's</strong> <strong>Impact on Jobs</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked concerns about its impact on the job market. Experts predict that millions of jobs could be affected by AI as machines become more capable of handling tasks currently done by humans. However, it's important to understand that this doesn't necessarily mean widespread unemployment. While some jobs may be lost, new ones will likely emerge in different fields as AI technology continues to develop. This highlights the importance of continuous learning and skill development to adapt to the changing needs of the future workforce. The precise impact of AI on jobs remains uncertain, and some experts suggest that educated white-collar workers and those in manufacturing might be more affected initially. Regardless of the specific predictions, it's clear that AI will play a significant role in shaping the future of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Jobs Most Likely to be Automated by Machines</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some jobs that experts believe are most at risk of being replaced by machines:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Customer service reps:</strong>&nbsp;Answering common questions and solving simple problems can be done by AI chatbots, saving companies money.</li>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Warehouse workers:</strong>&nbsp;Automated systems can locate and move goods in warehouses, potentially reducing the need for some warehouse workers.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Insurance underwriters:</strong>&nbsp;AI can analyze data and make decisions based on pre-defined rules, potentially replacing some insurance underwriters.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Cashiers:</strong>&nbsp;Self-checkout systems are becoming more common, reducing the need for cashiers in retail stores.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to remember that these are just predictions, and the exact impact of AI on the job market is still uncertain. However, it's crucial to stay informed about these trends and be prepared to adapt and learn new skills as the job market evolves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Jobs Less Likely to Be Replaced by AI</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While AI is changing the job market, some positions are likely to remain safe from automation due to the unique skills and qualities they require:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

After a banner year celebrating all that generative AI has to offer, it seems clear that the technology behind ChatGPT—which has now proven to write solid letters, reports, and even movie scripts—is placing some positions at risk and potentially obsolete. Indeed, IBM recently announced its marketing and communications team is downsizing, due in part to generative AI. More than one-third of companies using AI said AI had replaced workers in 2023, with 44% anticipating that AI will lead to further layoffs in 2024.


The question is no longer, “How much can generative AI do?” It’s, “How much work can human workers keep to stay relevant in a post-gen-AI world?”

As we face a future defined by AI, one of the most important truths for us as workers in the global economy to accept is this: efficiencies will always make good business sense. Just as automation took over manufacturing jobs, AI will take over many white-collar jobs—in marketing and beyond. The goal of any business—in America, at least—is to maximize profits. Any technology that allows businesses to work faster, create more, and benefit from deeper insights will be seen as a positive thing by business executives. Research shows that by 2030, work that accounts for about one-third of hours currently worked in the US economy could be automated, thanks in part to generative AI.

Here are a few considerations as we weigh the risks and opportunities of generative AI on the future of work.

Generative AI Will Create New Jobs—but will those Suit You? Test the Video Game Dilemma:
PROMOTED
It’s possible that one job lost in marketing will lead to a new, more advanced role in marketing, but that’s highly unlikely. Chances are higher that the work landscape is going to be spotty, and strange, and different for years to come—but eventually these technological revolutions do create new and often unexpected roles.
Consider this interesting scenario: If AI allows programmers to develop a new game 50% faster and with 20% of the resources, we will still need fewer programmers to do that work, even if more people want to play the game. That just means that we need to start thinking differently about work and our place in it as we continue to press forward with advancements in generative AI—and whatever technology comes next. One thing is certain: spend time acquiring new AI skills and adopting the ‘AI mentality’ behind automation and data-oriented value creation. In several recent interviews NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has recently shared a perspective on programming and coding that indicates that the oft-fashionable path of becoming a programmer may not be the ultimate safety net.

OpenAI’s Sam Altman suggested that in the future we will have single person, billion dollar companies. While that seems improbable without massive inflation, it seems increasingly likely that 10-20 person companies could generate more than $100 million in revenue and potentially reach a billion with the smart use of generative AI and intelligent chatbots.
Generative AI Can Be your Competitor—but Make it a Friend instead
For the first time, people with very few design skills, for example, can use AI to generate beautiful graphic layouts. People with limited writing skills can use generative AI to write letters, reports, and even marketing campaigns. And they can use AI to determine how successful those campaigns are—and change them in real-time if they aren’t working. Those are all, on their own, really cool things. And before you suggest that we need humans to deal with generative AI because it isn’t perfect, and it hallucinates. I agree, but every day it gets better, and it will continue to at an order of magnitude faster as the tech and algorithms get better.
So how can you stay relevant when AI is capable of doing so much?
First, stay engaged. In a time when it’s easy to let AI do all the work, resist the temptation. While it’s absolutely imperative for workers in marketing and communications specifically to familiarize themselves with what generative AI is capable of doing, it’s also important that they remain engaged with their company’s data, brand, and culture. AI can draft a report. But we still need bright people to review the information to ensure it makes sense, that AI didn’t go adrift, and that the insights being produced are going to lead to positive results.
Second, all employees in marketing and communication specifically need to look at AI as a partner that enhances their portfolios rather than an enemy that could potentially steal it. Employees who know how to take advantage of what AI has to offer have way less chance of having their positions outsourced to AI than those who continue to avoid it altogether. Marketing and communications leaders need to know what AI is capable of, but they also need to be the most outspoken about its limits in terms of maintaining customer relationships and keeping humans at the heart of every customer interaction. You can’t define AI’s limits if you’re too afraid to know what it does. So get to know it, inside and out.
AI Will Change the Job Landscape—It’s All About Staying Productive and Efficient
Every technology revolution has ultimately yielded more, not less jobs.
Based on Futurum Intelligence data, the investment in proof-of-concept projects with AI in these areas is on the rise at a three-fold rate from the year before. These numbers were further validated by Accenture’s recent earnings which saw the company announce it saw $1.1 Billion in revenue from generative AI in the first half of its fiscal outpacing the revenue of all VC backed AI startups combined.
AI is coming to a career near you. It’s happening and it’s moving quickly and the best way to stay ahead of it is to understand it and how it can help the work that you do. There is no guarantees that a role won’t succumb to AI disruption, but roles have always been vulnerable to the next wave of tech—stay agile, stay sharp and keep learning. Being marketable and diverse in your skills will always be seen positively by employers.

By Chet Kapoor, Chairman & CEO at DataStax
Along with the exciting possibilities of generative AI (genAI), there have been concerns around job (in)security and displacement. Leaders are feeling the pressure to implement genAI quickly and automate as much as possible. Some will see this as an opportunity to “get lean” and reduce headcount. Others will keep the people they have and find new ways to become super efficient.
We believe choosing the latter is imperative – because the benefits of genAI can only be realized when combined with human creativity and innovation. Together, humans and genAI have the power not only to transform industries but also to create new opportunities for workers across various sectors. How we work and what we do may shift, but removing people to make way for productivity would prove to be a huge mistake.
If we want a future of AI for all, we should reinvest productivity gains into the people and processes that drive growth and innovation. We call this the “abundance agenda”
Looking back
This is not the first time that a groundbreaking technology has brought concern about job displacement. The emergence of the steam engine, assembly lines, and computers all caused fears of widespread unemployment. But history has shown that while some jobs will be replaced, new roles emerge, and industries evolve and adapt to changing technologies. GenAI is no exception.
Beyond automation
One of the key reasons for concern surrounding GenAI is its potential to automate tasks typically performed by humans. From customer service interactions to data analysis, genAI has already shown remarkable progress in streamlining processes and increasing efficiency. However, workers across sectors worry that “no one’s job is safe.”
While genAI might automate certain tasks, it also has the potential to enhance human productivity and creativity. Instead of viewing it as a threat to job security, organizations can leverage genAI as a tool to empower their workforce and augment their capabilities. By adopting a mindset of collaboration between humans and machines, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth and innovation.
Looking beyond just the organization, genAI also brings the opportunity for inclusive economic growth. By giving workers the skills and knowledge needed to harness the potential of this technology, companies can ensure that no one is left behind. Investments in education, training, and re-skilling programs can empower people to thrive in the age of genAI, creating a more inclusive and equitable workforce.
Proactive strategies
Proactive measures should be taken to address concerns about job insecurity and displacement. For example:

Transparent communication about the potential impact of genAI on job roles and responsibilities. This helps build trust and ease fears among employees.
Reimagining job design and creating opportunities for upskilling and retraining. This enables workers to adapt to the changing landscape and remain competitive in the job market.

Ultimately, the goal is to embrace a forward-thinking approach that prioritizes collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity. Taking the potential of genAI while investing in the skills and well-being of workers helps organizations navigate the challenges of this technology wave – creating a future where humans and machines work together towards shared abundance for all.

An ever-increasing number of employers are experiencing the many benefits of artificial intelligence throughout their human resources practices—from candidate personalization, conversational experiences, matching and scoring algorithms and AI-generated insights.
With the emergence of generative AI, HR tech products are starting to build use cases to optimize communication among recruiters, managers, candidates, and employees as well as build assistants to boost HR productivity. These technologies are also assisting HR teams to build better employee retention and growth strategies and helping them transform into a skills-based organization.
While all this innovation is underway, consistency and inclusiveness within job descriptions continue to be a challenge and are often overlooked.











 
 
 
Generative AI can help ensure that job postings consistently meet the level of criteria needed for a specific function, including the necessary skills and competencies required, along with the use of inclusive language and reduction of bias. This is especially helpful as the labor market remains strong and businesses continue to need workers.

Thoughtfully crafted with the appropriate contextual considerations, generative AI has the capability to responsibly generate adaptive and inclusive job descriptions on a large scale. It produces highly personalized postings that preserve the organization’s tone and brand, accomplishing this in a fraction of the time it would take a human.
Offloading this task to generative AI allows HR to concentrate on content that shapes the culture and brand experience—areas where technology falls short in understanding the nuanced human elements











 
 
 
LLMs need the right context
Commercial large language models (LLMs) used for generative AI are essentially an approximation of the extensive knowledge available on crafting job descriptions. While existing industry standards generally have well-phrased descriptions, they may lack the specific context of the organization or team, making them appear impersonal or generic to candidates. Furthermore, if these models are prompted to generate a job description using gendered titles (such as “fireman”), the outcome is likely to be non-neutral, highlighting the need for careful consideration of language for inclusivity.
Generative AI models require precise prompts to shape the writing of job descriptions and to specify which words and phrases to steer clear of. Rather than employing a job title like “weatherman,” the program should be directed to use the more inclusive term “meteorologist,” accompanied by an illustrative tone and well-crafted examples. And doing this at scale throughout the organization may not be easy.
It might be tempting for HR teams to dig out an old job posting for a similar role to save time, but the effort that’s made on the front end will pay off on the back end in the form of a job description that piques the interest of the right talent. A posting that steers away great candidates could have an expensive and long-lasting negative impact on the business.











 
 
 
What defines a biased job description? Identifying bias is not always straightforward for HR; it’s a subjective task. While certain corrections may be apparent, discerning whether bias is truly eliminated or inadvertently introduced can be challenging. This is where technology proves invaluable, assisting humans in striking the right balance swiftly and accurately. AI models, which learn from past performance and adhere to fundamental guidelines, can play a crucial role in generating job descriptions that align with fairness and inclusivity.
The challenges for developers
During OpenAI’s first developer conference in early November, the company said GPT-4 turbo models have a 128k context window, which means it can digest the equivalent of more than 300 pages of text in a single prompt. ChatGPT almost certainly will learn how to provide the right responses from that much context, which is really a game changer. And ChatGPT has gotten a lot cheaper too. From that perspective, developers are thinking, “OK, how best do I add value to my users?”
With previous versions of ChatGPT, finding use cases was all about figuring out a scenario to generate content and building an app on top of ChatGPT. But now one can just get the context and leave a lot of other things out. That’s a clear indicator of the huge promise of the technology.











 
 
 
But against that optimistic outlook, enterprises using generative AI must grapple with ethical and privacy concerns. Governance, monitoring, and fundamental documentation are the safeguards against deploying discriminative AI. In the past, developers could rely on those safeguards alone to guard against discriminative AI. However, the landscape has evolved significantly, and that requires developers to consider a whole lot more in their design. It’s a whole new ballgame.
Today there is much more scrutiny around several big issues, namely masking personally identifiable information, injecting context without a data leak, and saving customer information in its own ecosystem while only passing the inferred aspects of the request to generative AI models. Those are some of the complexities that developers are running into at the moment.
Why generative AI needs guardrails
As with any new or emerging technology, industry and government are working to set proper ethical and legal guardrails around AI. For an engineer, building on generative AI requires a keen awareness of both the ethical and practical uses of data.











 
 
 
Data protection. Passing a job applicant’s resume through a large language model without the applicant’s consent, or using it to write a rejection letter to a candidate, could be problematic if personally identifiable information is inadvertently revealed to LLMs. Data privacy is paramount when sending personal details to a platform that is not technically dedicated to an existing setup.
How is information masked? How are prompts reengineered? How does an engineer prompt for a specific example without passing personally identifiable information, and on its way back, how is the data substituted with the right parameters to show it back to the user?
These are all questions developers should consider when writing applications on generative AI for B2B use cases.











 
 
 
Segmented learning. Another critical factor for developers to consider is segmenting customer data from a model training or machine learning perspective, because the nuances of how an email is written varies from one organization to another, and even among different users within an organization, for example.
AI learning cannot be combined and made generic. So continuing to compartmentalize and have learning by a specific customer, location, or viewers is critical.
Cost optimization. Having the ability to cache and reuse the data is important, because data input and output can get expensive for certain use cases that involve volume transactions.











 
 
 
A small document with a huge impact
Some may question the need for written job descriptions in the modern workforce, but job descriptions remain the most effective way to communicate an employer’s talent needs and the underpinning skills for specific roles.
When done well, vacancy notices attract candidates and employees who are aligned with a company’s values, mission, and culture. A paycheck and a corner office are no longer enough to get a job seeker’s attention. They want to work for firms with a top-notch culture and impeccable values.
Using thoughtful and sensitive language signals to candidates that the employer has an inclusive workplace that considers all applicants. Similarly, by ensuring that generative AI has the proper context and that private data is kept private, developers play an important role in an exciting and promising technology that is ethical, inclusive, and free of bias.

Large language models, such as those that power popular artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT, are incredibly complex. Even though these models are being used as tools in many areas, such as customer support, code generation, and language translation, scientists still don’t fully grasp how they work.
In an effort to better understand what is going on under the hood, researchers at MIT and elsewhere studied the mechanisms at work when these enormous machine-learning models retrieve stored knowledge.
They found a surprising result: Large language models (LLMs) often use a very simple linear function to recover and decode stored facts. Moreover, the model uses the same decoding function for similar types of facts. Linear functions, equations with only two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward, straight-line relationship between two variables.
The researchers showed that, by identifying linear functions for different facts, they can probe the model to see what it knows about new subjects, and where within the model that knowledge is stored.
Using a technique they developed to estimate these simple functions, the researchers found that even when a model answers a prompt incorrectly, it has often stored the correct information. In the future, scientists could use such an approach to find and correct falsehoods inside the model, which could reduce a model’s tendency to sometimes give incorrect or nonsensical answers.
“Even though these models are really complicated, nonlinear functions that are trained on lots of data and are very hard to understand, there are sometimes really simple mechanisms working inside them. This is one instance of that,” says Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student and co-lead author of a paper detailing these findings.
Hernandez wrote the paper with co-lead author Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University; his advisor, Jacob Andreas, an associate professor in EECS and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); senior author David Bau, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern; and others at MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations.
Finding facts
Most large language models, also called transformer models, are neural networks. Loosely based on the human brain, neural networks contain billions of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that are grouped into many layers, and which encode and process data.
Much of the knowledge stored in a transformer can be represented as relations that connect subjects and objects. For instance, “Miles Davis plays the trumpet” is a relation that connects the subject, Miles Davis, to the object, trumpet.
As a transformer gains more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a certain subject across multiple layers. If a user asks about that subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to respond to the query.
If someone prompts a transformer by saying “Miles Davis plays the. . .” the model should respond with “trumpet” and not “Illinois” (the state where Miles Davis was born).
“Somewhere in the network’s computation, there has to be a mechanism that goes and looks for the fact that Miles Davis plays the trumpet, and then pulls that information out and helps generate the next word. We wanted to understand what that mechanism was,” Hernandez says.
The researchers set up a series of experiments to probe LLMs, and found that, even though they are extremely complex, the models decode relational information using a simple linear function. Each function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved.
For example, the transformer would use one decoding function any time it wants to output the instrument a person plays and a different function each time it wants to output the state where a person was born.
The researchers developed a method to estimate these simple functions, and then computed functions for 47 different relations, such as “capital city of a country” and “lead singer of a band.”
While there could be an infinite number of possible relations, the researchers chose to study this specific subset because they are representative of the kinds of facts that can be written in this way.
They tested each function by changing the subject to see if it could recover the correct object information. For instance, the function for “capital city of a country” should retrieve Oslo if the subject is Norway and London if the subject is England.
Functions retrieved the correct information more than 60 percent of the time, showing that some information in a transformer is encoded and retrieved in this way.
“But not everything is linearly encoded. For some facts, even though the model knows them and will predict text that is consistent with these facts, we can’t find linear functions for them. This suggests that the model is doing something more intricate to store that information,” he says.
Visualizing a model’s knowledge
They also used the functions to determine what a model believes is true about different subjects.
In one experiment, they started with the prompt “Bill Bradley was a” and used the decoding functions for “plays sports” and “attended university” to see if the model knows that Sen. Bradley was a basketball player who attended Princeton.
“We can show that, even though the model may choose to focus on different information when it produces text, it does encode all that information,” Hernandez says.
They used this probing technique to produce what they call an “attribute lens,” a grid that visualizes where specific information about a particular relation is stored within the transformer’s many layers.
Attribute lenses can be generated automatically, providing a streamlined method to help researchers understand more about a model. This visualization tool could enable scientists and engineers to correct stored knowledge and help prevent an AI chatbot from giving false information.
In the future, Hernandez and his collaborators want to better understand what happens in cases where facts are not stored linearly. They would also like to run experiments with larger models, as well as study the precision of linear decoding functions.
“This is an exciting work that reveals a missing piece in our understanding of how large language models recall factual knowledge during inference. Previous work showed that LLMs build information-rich representations of given subjects, from which specific attributes are being extracted during inference. This work shows that the complex nonlinear computation of LLMs for attribute extraction can be well-approximated with a simple linear function,” says Mor Geva Pipek, an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at Tel Aviv University, who was not involved with this work.
This research was supported, in part, by Open Philanthropy, the Israeli Science Foundation, and an Azrieli Foundation Early Career Faculty Fellowship.

 Artificial intelligence (AI), or technology that is coded to simulate human intelligence, is having a huge impact on the business world. Now prevalent in many types of software and applications, AI is revolutionizing workflows, business practices, and entire industries by changing the way we work, access information, and analyze data.


Key Takeaways
AI technology promises significant benefits for businesses, including improved customer engagement, data analysis, automation of processes, strategic recommendations, and enhanced decision making.AI can be applied in various business areas such as accounting and finance, customer service, recruitment, cybersecurity, sales and marketing, supply chain and logistics, information technology (IT) operations, and legal.However, implementing AI in business is not without challenges, which can include ethical and privacy concerns, skill gaps, and integration issues.The future of AI for business will necessitate ever more collaboration among governments, businesses, and individuals, as well as further integration of AI into software processes and workflows.
  Benefits of Using AI in Business  
 Artificial intelligence can deliver significant benefits across different departments and business functions. Noémie Ellezam, chief digital strategy officer of Société Générale, the sixth-largest bank in Europe, describes AI as being “an accelerator” of their digital strategy, “with potential impact across all of [their] businesses and business areas.”1


 Here are some of the advantages that AI can offer businesses.


  Improved Customer Engagement and Experience  
 Tools like chatbots, callbots, and AI-powered assistants are transforming customer service interactions, offering new and streamlined ways for businesses to interact with customers.1


  Data Analysis and Insights  
 AI can quickly process large volumes of current and historical data, drawing conclusions, capturing insights, and forecasting future trends or behaviors. These can help businesses facilitate better decision making about customers, offerings, and directions for future business growth.2




  Automation and Efficiency of Business Processes  
 AI enablement can improve the efficiency and processes of existing software tools, automating repetitive tasks such as entering data and taking meeting notes, and assisting with routine content generation and editing.3


  Personalized Recommendations and Targeting  
 AI can analyze consumer data (such as that captured in a business’s customer relationship management (CRM) system) to understand similarities in preferences and buying behavior across different segments of customers. This allows businesses to offer more personalized recommendations and targeted messaging to these specific audiences.4


  Applications of AI in Business  
 AI can be applied to many different business areas, offering increased productivity and efficiency and promising insights, scalability, and growth. Here are some of the business departments and applications in which AI is making a significant impact.


  Accounting  
 Many accounting software tools now use AI to create cash flow projections or categorize transactions, with applications for tax, payroll, and financial forecasting. It can help reduce input errors, catch duplicate or suspicious transactions, and identify opportunities to save money.5


  Content Generation  
 Generative AI can assist in writing, researching, and editing as well as creating graphics, videos, and other media. It can be used for everything from marketing campaigns to business document templates like proposals and presentations. AI can also transcribe and translate language and generate code, providing businesses with quicker, easier, and more cost-effective access to these specialized skill sets.6


  Customer Service and Support  
 Chatbots and callbots can offer businesses a way to extend their current customer service capabilities and increase the volume of customer inquiries that their team is able to respond to, in addition to freeing up time for customer service agents to focus on more complex cases or interactions. Many AI-enabled call center and voice applications can also perform caller sentiment analysis and transcribe video and phone calls.3


  Cybersecurity  
 AI-powered cybersecurity tools can monitor systems activity and safeguard against cyberattacks, identifying risks and areas of vulnerability. It can also help security teams analyze risk and expedite their responses to threats.73


  Information Technology (IT) Operations  
 The use of AI in informational technology (IT) operations is so widespread that a special term for it was coined: AIOps. AI can be used to streamline data and maintain IT infrastructure, automating tasks like performance monitoring, workload scheduling, and data backups. It offers IT professionals better insights into the root causes of anomalies and errors, allowing them to resolve system issues more quickly and anticipate future ones.8


  Financial Analysis, Trading, and Fraud Detection  
 Financial departments and businesses can benefit from quick and powerful AI-driven data analysis and modeling, fraud detection algorithms, and automated compliance recording and auditing. Because of AI’s ability to analyze large, complex datasets, individual and institutional investors alike are taking advantage of AI tools in managing their portfolios. AI can also detect fraud by identifying unusual patterns and behaviors in transaction data.910


  Human Resources  
 AI can assist human resources departments by automating and speeding up tasks that require collecting, analyzing, or processing information. This can include employee records data management and analysis, payroll, recruitment, benefits administration, employee onboarding, and more.11


  Legal  
 As a profession that deals with massive volumes of data, lawyers and legal departments can benefit from machine learning AI tools that analyze data, recognize patterns, and learn as they go. AI applications for law include document analysis and review, research, proofreading and error discovery, and risk assessment.12


  Sales and Marketing  
 Sales and marketing departments can use AI for a wide range of possibilities, including incorporating it into CRM, email marketing, social media, and advertising software. Generative AI can create all kinds of creative and useful content, such as scripts, social media posts, blog articles, design assets, and more.3


  Supply Chain and Logistics  
 AI can have a huge impact on operations, whether as a forecasting or inventory management tool or as a source of automation for manual tasks like picking and sorting in warehouses. It can prove useful in allocating resources or people, like drivers, scheduling processes, and solving or planning around operational disruptions.13


  Challenges and Ethical Considerations for Implementing AI in Business  
 In October 2023, President Joe Biden released an “Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,” citing AI’s “extraordinary potential for both promise and peril.” In it, he touched on how responsible AI use could help address urgent challenges and increase prosperity, productivity, and innovation—but noted that potential downsides include exacerbating social and societal harms such as discrimination, disinformation, and worker displacement.14


 Here’s a closer look at some of the important ethical and other considerations around implementing AI in business.


  Ethical and Privacy Concerns  
 The introduction of AI to business applications raises urgent concerns around the ethics, privacy, and security of the technology. Governance of AI technology must consider how to develop and expand current legislation around privacy and data protection, including purpose specification, data collection and use limitations, accountability and security of data storage.15


 AI also requires human oversight to review and interpret the results it generates and monitor how it is generating them, lest it end up reproducing or worsening current and historical biases and patterns of discrimination.16 For example, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University revealed that Google’s online advertising algorithm reinforced gender bias around job roles by displaying high-paying positions to males more often than women.17


  Skill Gaps and Workforce Transformation  
 Although AI can bridge skill gaps, offering workers access to skill sets like coding, translating, and writing, it also creates skill gaps. As a rapidly advancing and developing technology, training and keeping up with knowledge about AI tools can be a challenge for workers and businesses alike. A 2023 survey of small business owners by Microsoft revealed that only 10% of small businesses with up to 24 employees “know how to use AI for their work-related tasks,” while 67% “say they know little to nothing about AI in general.”18


 There is much concern over worker displacement due to the use of AI technology. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, and Simon Johnson have written about how digital technologies have exacerbated inequality over the past 40 years. However, they believe that the nature of AI’s relationship to inequality is still to be determined, and its impact will depend on how it is developed and applied—particularly, whether it is considered as a complement to human workers or a substitute for them.19


 For example, AI can be used to bolster skills and productivity as an on-the-job assistant or personalized tutor, and it could even help more people get hired by providing resume writing and editing assistance.


 MIT professor John J. Horton recommends that business leaders consider the following before deciding whether to replace human labor with AI:


 How much time the task would take otherwiseHow much the employee who performs the task is paidWhether AI is capable of correctly performing the taskHow easy it is for a human to confirm whether the AI output is accurate1920


 A 2024 International Monetary Fund (IMF) study found that almost 40% of global employment is exposed to AI, including high-skilled jobs. The study states that 60% of jobs in advanced economies may be impacted by AI, with half of those benefiting from increased productivity and half being affected in a way that could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages, reduced hiring, and, in extreme cases, job disappearance. In contrast, expected AI exposure was lower in emerging markets (40%) and low-income countries (26%), suggesting fewer immediate workforce disruptions but worsening inequality over time as the technology is adopted more widely.21


  Integration and Compatibility Issues  
 Companies that have successfully implemented AI solutions have viewed AI as part of a larger digital strategy, understanding where and how it can be instrumentalized to great advantage. This requires considering how it will integrate with current software and existing processes—especially how data is captured, processed, analyzed, and stored. Another important factor is the structure of a company’s technology stack—AI must be able to flexibly integrate with current and future systems to draw and feed data into different areas of the business.221


  Future AI Trends and Business Opportunities  
 As AI becomes ever more integrated into business technologies, it’s possible that the focus will shift away from specific AI-powered apps in favor of general AI assistance built into websites, software, and hardware. For example, Samsung’s Galaxy S24 Ultra has AI built into the phone in the form of a transcript assistant, “circle to search” feature, and real-time translation capabilities.23


 Adriana Hoyos, professor of economics at IE University, writes that as “technology’s influence endures, collaboration between governments, businesses, and individuals takes on unprecedented significance,” with “collaborating partnerships serv[ing] as incubators of innovation.” One example is Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI, which aims to responsibly democratize AI and make it more accessible. However, she notes that governments “shoulder the responsibility of recalibrating regulations to harmonize with technological progress.” She predicts that future drivers of job growth will include big data analytics, climate change technology, encryption, and cybersecurity.24


 Many successful companies are approaching AI with a view to augment current efforts and work, rather than the intention to replace human workers with AI. This future is already expressing itself in the trend of AI-augmented software development, but AI researcher David De Cremer and chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov see a future in which humans work alongside AI in a complementary way, calling it the “new diversity.” This will necessitate leaders who are skilled in creating inclusive teams and bringing different parties together.25


 Can You Use AI to Start a Business?
AI can be used to generate business ideas, write business plans, and guide entrepreneurs in the steps it takes to start a business. By making time-consuming tasks like coding a website, writing emails, and scheduling meetings more efficient, AI can save entrepreneurs valuable time and allow them to focus their efforts where they matter most.26


 Can AI Replace the Workforce In the Future?
Analysis of the impact of AI on the workforce holds mixed predictions for the future. A 2024 IMF study found that nearly 40% of global employment is exposed to AI; however, whether the technology complements or negatively impacts current jobs depends on the experience and current income of workers as well as the current level of economic development in the country of work.21


 How Is AI Used In Business Analysis?
AI business analytics tools can offer analysts and decision makers insights derived from large and complex datasets, as well as automation for repetitive tasks, such as standardizing data formatting or generating reports. Predictive analytics can identify future trends and patterns from current and historical data.2


 How Is AI Used In Healthcare?
There are many applications for AI in the field of healthcare, including analyzing large volumes of healthcare data like patient records, clinical studies, and genetic data. AI chatbots can assist in answering patient questions, while generative AI can be used to develop and test new pharmaceutical products. AI-powered robots could even be used to make surgery less invasive.27


 What Is the Impact of Using AI in Business?
AI is having a transformative impact on businesses, driving efficiency and productivity for workers and entrepreneurs alike. However, its potential to replace the jobs of human workers remains to be seen.


  The Bottom Line  
 One useful way for businesses to think of AI’s future possibilities is in terms of capabilities, as opposed to technologies. AI can support businesses in three broad categories: automating processes, analyzing data to gain insight, and customer and employee engagement. Firms that apply AI strategically in these ways have much to gain in terms of productivity, efficiency, and potential cost savings and growth.28


 However, AI presents challenges alongside opportunities, including concerns about data privacy, security, ethical considerations, widening inequality, and potential job displacement. Researchers and analysts suggest that a collaborative approach among businesses, governments, and other stakeholders is the key to responsible AI adoption and innovation.2129

Is HR really ready for generative AI? Probably not


March 25, 2024 

Brian SommerBrian Sommer is an award-winning author and consultant to some of the most complex clients globally. He has recently published his fourth book: The Executive’s ESG Playbook (available on Amazon). He welcomes your comments at contact@techventive.net. Brian has also been an HR Executive Top100 HR Tech Influencer for five consecutive years.

Generative AI is showing up in HR applications in a big way, and interest in the tools is strong. I’ve identified exactly 100 AI use cases in HR, and I’m confident I could add many more to that list. But, are HR departments taking the time to really understand these new capabilities and, more importantly, how others outside the company will use them as well? My recent interactions throughout the industry suggest that HR leaders need to pause the purchasing enthusiasm for a bit and do some soul-searching and research first.
What HR teams will need are:

new HR policies regarding the planned (or banned) use of generative AI;
deeper understanding of newer AI tools and the specific risks, security and other challenges they could possibly present;
new workflows for affected HR activities; and
new countermeasures based on how job seekers, employees and others might use generative AI tools

Let’s look at each of these areas.
Should HR object to AI-assisted resumes?
I recently spoke to an audience of about 700 HR professionals on the intersection of AI and HR. Things got interesting when I asked some pointed questions like:

Would you choose to decline to move a candidate forward in the recruiting process if their resume or cover letter was materially influenced by a generative AI tool?
How would HR professionals react if they suspected a candidate used generative AI technology to identify potential interview questions the job seeker might get asked and that the tool provided suggested answers?
Would your HR team acquire some of the new tools that detect AI-generated content that might be present in a job seeker’s resume/application?

What the audience initially registered was that they would consider an applicant whose resume had gotten some help from a generative AI tool. That sentiment, I noticed, started to change once we discussed the matter in a more fulsome manner.
And the same HR executives also thought that HR might want to get tools to look for AI-generated content in job applications, resumes, cover letters and thank-you notes. That sentiment also changed as the topic got discussed.
Here are some of the issues raised:

Tools that can identify AI-generated verbiage may themselves be AI tools and are subject to the same shortcomings found in other AI tools (e.g., hallucinations, inappropriate language, unsuitable responses, etc.). The use of these AI detection tools might open up the employer to potential litigation if a job seeker’s application was flagged as being AI-assisted when it was not. To that point, an AI tool that looks for plagiarism recently flagged a university student’s paper as plagiarized. The student claims to have used a grammar-checking tool, not an AI content-creation tool.
A job applicant who uses AI-generated copy for resumes is simply gaming talent acquisition software. Job seekers have been trying to outfox ATS (applicant tracking software) technology for decades with low-tech tricks (e.g., keyword stuffing in a resume) and are now getting more sophisticated and powerful tools to use. Job seekers are definitely using generative AI tools to do a better, more timely and efficient job of keyword stuffing.
Some job seekers may feel quite justified using these tools, as they provide them a competitive advantage, and employers have not cautioned them to avoid them.
Some might find it ironic that HR departments that are using AI tools to perform many functions (including AI-assisted job description generators) would want to prohibit job seekers from using similar tools. What’s good for the goose should also be good for the gander?
Resumes that get enhanced by AI may relegate non-enhanced resumes to the reject pile. In other words, great candidates could be eliminated from consideration, while more marginal candidates with resumes designed to delight an ATS are moving ahead in the process.

In the situation where an employer is casting for a wide net of applicants, those resumes that have been keyword stuffed and tarted-up by a generative AI will have a sameness about them that isn’t actually true. Employers that don’t look at what is (or is starting to) happen to their recruiting practices and results are in for a shock. The biggest casualties in recruiting may be:

scores of resumes will appear to be the same;
scores of candidates will appear to be great candidates, and it will be difficult to differentiate between them;
“authentic” job seekers and their paperwork will never be seen, as AI-using job seekers will advance in ATS scoring while those who don’t use AI will not get any notice; and
the actual quality of applicants being considered for in-person interviews may decline.

It saddened me to note that some companies are so focused on filling job vacancies now that they don’t care whether resumes are AI-enhanced or not. Ugh! This “the end justifies the means” kind of thinking is both unappetizing and depressing. If your firm isn’t winning its war for talent, taking generative AI shortcuts may not be the best business decision.
There are two big issues at play here. First, how can a firm understand who the authentic job seeker is if it gets super-sanitized and enhanced materials from the candidate? How much of a gap/delta is acceptable, and will the recruiting process need to be amended to add more tests or personal interviews to ascertain this recruit’s true status? Second, job seekers may currently be savvier about generative AI than recruiting or HR teams.

Recently, USA Today ran a story about a job seeker and noted that she:
“cut and pasted the job description and my resume into ChatGPT and had AI create a list of interview questions … [the job seeker] used ChatGPT to help with an early first draft of a cover letter and to critique her resume based on specific job descriptions. ‘These needed heavy editing, obviously,’ she added, ‘but they used all of the keywords that AI would look for on the receiving end.'”
Playing devil’s advocate, I noted that if the applicant’s resume is much more compelling than their actual skills, is HR incurring additional costs (e.g., more testing and interviewing of candidates) to prevent the hiring of less-qualified candidates? There’s also the opportunity cost of HR spending time and money interviewing AI-enhanced but still less-qualified candidates. What does it cost your firm when you let a great candidate get away because you let less-qualified candidates tie up recruiters’ time? And, I followed that with this question: Does your talent acquisition team ever read the resumes of people your ATS down selects to see if it is actually recommending the right people move forward? One HR person bluntly responded with, “We just don’t have time to do that.”
What I took away from these discussions is that HR professionals are approaching AI in a trusting and naïve manner that could be problematic. They also seem to be looking at AI from one perspective (i.e., their own selfish perspective) and failing to understand how other constituents might view this technology or the consequences it could generate. Having a blind spot toward generative AI can create major problems for unprepared HR teams.
These HR leaders also weren’t of one mind when it came to whether AI usage is acceptable (for HR or job seekers) or not. That’s fascinating, as it shows just how little HR professionals are talking about AI with each other. HR leaders will need to quickly get up to speed on AI, clarify what acceptable uses of the technology will be, understand all related risks (e.g., litigation, data privacy, security, etc.) and create relevant policies that all employees will follow. Apparently, that may not be happening, given the interactions I’ve recently had.

An emerging arms race
What no one is saying explicitly is that we’re seeing an arms race in recruiting technology, and HR groups need to have both effective countermeasures and policies to deal with these rapidly escalating challenges. How bad is it? One job seeker used an AI tool to not only perfect his resume but also to pre-fill applications that he submitted to 5,000 firms in one week! Job seekers will swamp talent acquisition teams with tarted-up resumes for jobs that they might not have a great interest in. This is akin to job application spamming, and it does nothing to help employers. Does your recruiting team have a countermeasure for this?
Militaries often possess teams that monitor the new armaments/weapons being deployed by other militaries. They assess how well their current methods and weaponry will perform against these new threats. Where they detect weaknesses in their current tools, they identify countermeasures (i.e., changes in their tactics and weapons).
HR organizations need to monitor competitors, technologies and job seekers to see what new tactics and tools are now possible and what countermeasures are needed in their own firm’s toolset. Generative AI is clearly triggering a need for new countermeasures, as job seekers may be better equipped than HR teams and more aware of the opportunities that new AI tools can offer. HR can’t afford to fall behind in this arms race.
Ask the right questions
I recently asked a major software vendor executive what kinds of questions prospective buyers were asking his firm regarding AI. He said that they usually only inquire as to how they can keep their internal data out of public AI models and not about much else. In other words, the world of HR is being altered materially by AI, and buyers may not be savvy enough to know what they really should acquire, what controls they’ll need and what AI-powered HR technology they should run away from.
What we’re seeing is that AI adoption and/or interest by HR leaders may be running ahead of needed policies, controls, guidelines, etc. So, before HR teams start entertaining new software purchases, they may want to consider what their AI guiding principles are first.
New policies
Generative AI should trigger discussions within every HR team. Those discussions will likely cover assessments of new AI-powered technologies and how employees, alumni, contractors, job seekers, governments and other constituents will use them. Those discussions will also illuminate whether existing HR processes and policies need to be adjusted.
The key output from these policy and process assessments could trigger new/updated guiding principles for HR’s use of new generative AI tools.


This isn’t optional, and I believe many HR teams will struggle to get full agreement on some matters. For example, what does recruiting do if some recruiters believe it is acceptable for job seekers to use generative AI to create large portions of resumes, cover letters, thank you letters and interview content while other recruiters strongly disagree with this? Some policies will generate new work (or eliminate some work steps altogether) for HR. Process changes are likely, and even the economics of the HR function might warrant review.
Guiding principles might help in evaluating new HRMS software, needed controls, policy changes, process steps and more. And these guiding principles might help prevent HR team members from doing something that exposes the company to unwanted risk and/or litigation.
Get the results you need and want
Some of the new AI tools are relatively trouble-free (e.g., benefits Q&A chatbots) while those that try to ascertain the truthfulness of a job interviewee’s responses have their challenges (and may trigger lawsuits). Not every AI-powered HR tool will be a great tool or be of great value to your firm. Each tool has its own risks and rewards, and HR teams need to look at each with a discerning eye.
HR teams need to assess whether each tool will deliver the results their organization desires. More specifically, HR should not simply acquire new AI tools without really thinking through how each will deliver competitive advantage—not just competitive parity. This effort mandates that HR leaders become very cosmopolitan—that is, to become quite aware of one’s environment (and not just of one’s firm). This worldly view should impart insights into how others will use (or abuse) these new technologies and what risks or opportunities your firm might see.
HR must get clear on the boundaries of the AI tools it will use and define the bright lines HR won’t cross. It’s time for HR to get ready for the generative AI world and to do so wisely.

0Sponsored ArticleWhat Does It Mean To Be Skills-First? Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

Artificial intelligence is transforming several business functions, including HR. However, there are concerns about privacy, trust, and the human element in HR.
So, how do HR professionals and employees view AI’s role in HR? Here are a few findings from Paychex’s recent study.

Technology, analytics, and automation are transforming every aspect of HR, from recruitment to performance management and employee engagement. That being said, while they promise enhanced efficiency, they also raise questions and concerns about trust, privacy, and the role of human judgment in a digital workplace.
So, how do employees and HR professionals view technology’s effectiveness and burgeoning role and its challenges? What are the sentiments around artificial intelligence (AI), the tasks it is reshaping, and the delicate balance between machines and humans in managing people? Paychex recently conducted a study to get some answers. The following are a few insights and steps HR pros can take to leverage technology to improve processes and the overall employee experience.
AI Is Significantly Impacting HR Processes
Incorporating AI across various business functions has become a focus for many organizations this year. In fact, the study found that 56% of HR professionals already use AI in various operations. Among them, 85% said the technology provides useful HR data and analytics.
So, what are some of the most AI-driven HR solutions? About 59% use automated candidate screening and recruitment analytics, while 46% use chatbots to handle employee queries. About 38% use automated employee onboarding and training modules, and 37% conduct performance analysis and management through AI algorithms.

About 56% believe AI speeds up candidate recruitment and screening, while 41% believe it speeds up employee onboarding and training. About 27% think it speeds up payroll processing and administration, and an equal percentage think it speeds up performance evaluation and management. Overall, on average, AI saves HR pros 7.5 hours per week.
Despite all this, when it comes to trusting AI for fair decision-making, only 40% of HR professionals trust it. About 28% distrust it, and 32% are neutral. Further, 79% also believe AI reduces bias, 14% believe it increases bias, and 7% think it makes no difference. These sentiments indicate that AI can pave the way for more balanced and fairer business practices.

HR Pros Believe AI Will Become an Integral Part of Operations
The world is facing a tight labor market, and organizations are increasingly incorporating technology to streamline talent acquisition and onboarding. The ability to identify and hire qualified talent quickly is particularly helpful for companies competing for top talent.
Similarly, almost 25% of HR professionals anticipate AI will become integral to HR in the next five years. About 58% feel AI will transform HR analytics and data management, 46% feel it will transform talent acquisition, and 43% feel it will transform onboarding and offboarding.
HR pros believe recruitment stands to benefit the most, pointing to a future where recruitment is more tech-driven. That said, they predict employee engagement is least likely to gain from tech advancements. HR professionals can address this by strategizing and investing more time and resources in employee engagement and development programs.
HR pros also see a few challenges related to adopting AI. For example, 53% have technical challenges adopting AI, while 44% face resistance from staff. Above 27% cite high implementation costs. HR professionals also see a few ROI-related challenges. For example, 49% find finding the right AI tools challenging, while 47% face challenges with employee acceptance. About 42% also cite a lack of proper training, and 42% cite challenges with the learning curve.
Non-HR Employees Want an Appropriate Level of AI Involvement
What do non-HR employees think about AI? Their perspectives help HR pros determine the level of human intervention and intuition in certain tasks.
For starters, about 41% of employees prefer less AI involvement, while 39% prefer the current level of involvement. Only 20% prefer more AI involvement in HR decisions. Many employees also believe there isn’t much transparency as HR departments incorporate AI in their operations. Only about 32% feel their HR departments are transparent in communications regarding AI in HR, while 38% cite poor communication. About 30% are neutral about the transparency of HR departments. HR departments can enhance communication by clearly explaining AI’s role, its benefits, and how it can affect employees’ daily work.
Regarding the HR aspects employees think should be human-led instead of AI-led, conflict resolution and employee relations come on top, with 78% agreeing. About 76% believe sensitive issues like layoffs and disciplinary actions should be human-led, and 72% believe personalized employee counseling and support should be human-led. Further, 52% believe the development and management of organizational culture should be human-led, and 46% believe DEI initiatives should be human-led.
Considering the potential challenges of an AI-driven HR department, about 71% are uncomfortable with the prospect. Data privacy is a significant concern, with 68% wary of the data risks of AI to HR processes. Moreover, replacing HR with AI will lead 46% of employees to consider quitting their jobs.

Actionable steps for HR pros
HR professionals should take the following steps to use AI to improve processes and the overall employee experience.

They should assist in implementing policies to safeguard AI practices and ensure the right measures are taken to ensure data safety.
They should ensure that the tools are validated. This helps ensure compliance with new laws related to AI in HR and reduces potential bias in HR practices.
They should understand how tools may change. They should work with legal teams and trusted vendors to conduct AI audits.
HR professionals should learn about the tools available to better support consultation with their organization and clients.
Most importantly, they should ensure a human element is present in all AI decisions.

HR professionals are cautious and simultaneously optimistic that AI can work in HR. Benefits, such as time saved and reduction in bias, point to an AI-driven future. Yet, the journey has its challenges. Going forward, balancing tech-fueled efficiency improvements with a human touch is critical. HR pros should ensure AI augments and does not replace the human touch, which is crucial to “human” resources.

Many Americans think generative AI programs should credit the sources they rely on
By Alec Tyson and Brian Kennedy

Overall, 54% of Americans say artificial intelligence programs that generate text and images, like ChatGPT and DALL-E, need to credit the sources they rely on to produce their responses. A much smaller share (14%) says the programs don’t need to credit sources, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. About a third say they’re not sure on this question.
How we did this
Pew Research Center published this analysis as part of its ongoing work to understand attitudes about artificial intelligence. This analysis draws on a survey of 10,133 U.S. adults conducted from Feb. 7 to 11, 2024.
Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.
Here are the questions used for the analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.


A separate Pew Research Center analysis finds growing public engagement with ChatGPT – one of the most well-known examples of generative AI – especially among young people.
Generative AI programs work by reviewing large amounts of information, such as the works of an artist or news organization. That allows them to generate responses when users ask questions. 
This process has spurred lawsuits from authors, artists and news organizations, who argue that this is an unauthorized use of copyrighted material. But some technology companies argue that this is fair use under copyright law and that the programs provide a clear public benefit.
Our survey finds that the public consistently says AI programs should credit sources across seven examples of content they could generate.

For instance, 75% say AI programs should have to credit the sources they rely on if they provide information that matches what a journalist wrote nearly word-for-word. Just 6% say they shouldn’t have to credit their sources in this scenario, while 19% say they’re not sure.
Majorities of U.S. adults (67% each) also see a need for crediting sources if AI programs generate images that imitate the style of a current artist or text that imitates the style of a current author.
Whether an author is living or dead has little impact on public attitudes: 65% say credit is needed if AI programs imitate the writing style of a famous author who died many years ago.
Similarly, about six-in-ten say generative AI programs should have to credit the sources they rely on if they draft a movie script in the style of a popular movie. Hollywood screenwriters recently secured limits on using AI in script writing, as part of a larger labor agreement.
The view that credit is needed also extends to more general types of information. For instance, 60% of Americans say AI programs should have to credit the sources they use if they summarize information about the U.S. population. And 61% say credit is needed if these programs provide information that was reported by many different news organizations.
How often do Americans think they interact with AI?

Over the years, Center surveys have explored public views on multiple aspects of artificial intelligence, including overall awareness of and engagement with these technologies.
Our new survey finds that 22% of Americans say they interact with artificial intelligence almost constantly or several times a day. Another 27% say they interact with AI about once a day or several times a week. Half of Americans think they interact with AI less often.
Adults with higher levels of education are more likely than those with less education to say they interact with AI frequently. For instance, 63% of postgraduates and 57% of college graduates say they interact with AI at least several times a week. That compares with 50% of those with some college education and 36% of those with a high school diploma or less education.
Younger Americans also are more likely than their older peers to say they interact with AI often. Majorities of those ages 18 to 29 (56%) and 30 to 49 (54%) say they interact with AI at least several times a week. Smaller shares of those ages 50 to 64 (46%) and 65 and older (37%) say the same.
While AI now powers many widely used functions – like personalized online shopping recommendations – its presence may not always be visible to all Americans. For instance, only 30% of U.S. adults correctly identify the presence of AI across six examples in a recent survey about AI awareness. 
Note: Here are the questions used for the analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.

OFCCP is working on “promising practices” regarding AI selection tools. Additionally, leaders from the EEOC, NLRB, and the Department of Justice continue to emphasize their commitment to using their existing enforcement authority regarding AI issues. 
On March 20, 2024, at an American Bar Association meeting held in Boston, Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda and the Acting Director of OFCCP, Michelle Hodge, indicated that the Department of Labor is moving full speed ahead on issuing multiple guidance documents regarding artificial intelligence, as directed by President Biden’s expansive AI executive order, signed on October 30, 2023. On the same panel, independent agency heads, notably Chair Charlotte Burrows of the EEOC and NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo, emphasized their ongoing commitment to use their agencies’ existing enforcement authority to address concerns with employers’ use of AI.
1. The Department of Labor and OFCCP Are Working on AI Guidance and Promising Practices
President Biden’s EO on artificial intelligence initiated a comprehensive government-wide approach to AI regulation, and set in motion actions across multiple executive agencies. One of the Secretary of Labor’s many deliverables under the EO is to develop and publish, by the end of April 2024, “principles and best practices for employers that could be used to mitigate AI’s potential harms to employees’ well-being and maximize its potential benefits.” In her remarks, Solicitor Nanda shed light on the Department of Labor’s approach towards this guidance. Notably, she said that the Department of Labor will be issuing a “broader value-based document” that contained “principles and best practices” for both employers using AI and developers of the AI tools.
Among the “principles and best practices” the Solicitor discussed were the need for employers using AI to engage with their workers, especially if their workers were unionized. She asserted, “If you are developing AI without engagement of workers, you’re going to be missing a key component.” The need for stakeholder engagement is not a new concept in AI risk management, and the inclusion of this principle should not come as a surprise to observers paying attention to other federal government efforts on AI, as the concept of stakeholder engagement was explored as part of NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework issued in January 2023.
Other principles that Solicitor Nanda mentioned were the need for human oversight of AI systems and the need for validation and monitoring. “You have to make sure it [the AI] is working,” she said. Solicitor Nanda also discussed the need for greater transparency regarding the AI systems employers were using, inviting employers and AI developers to consider whether they were creating an avenue for the public or job applicants to know that AI is being used to make an employment selection decision that might be screening out candidates.
President Biden’s executive order also specifically directs the Secretary of Labor’s report due at the end of April 2024 to cover “job-displacement risks and career opportunities related to AI, including effects on job skills and evaluation of applicants and workers.” In her remarks, Solicitor Nanda confirmed that the Department of Labor was also working on this job-displacement report.
Solicitor Nanda also confirmed that the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division is working on guidance that would make it clear that employers who deploy AI systems to monitor workers “must make sure workers are compensated.” While Solicitor Nanda did not provide further details about this guidance, President Biden’s executive order specifically directs that the Secretary of Labor “shall issue guidance to make clear that employers that deploy AI to monitor or augment employees’ work must continue to comply with protections that ensure that workers are compensated for their hours worked” in order to “support employees whose work is monitored or augmented by AI in being compensated appropriately for all of their work time.”
Both Solicitor Nanda and OFCCP Acting Director Michelle Hodge discussed the progress of OFCCP’s work on additional AI guidance. (President Biden’s executive order directs the Department of Labor to “publish guidance for Federal contractors regarding nondiscrimination in hiring involving AI and other technology-based hiring systems” within one year – i.e., by the end of October 2024.) Acting Director Hodge specifically confirmed, “We are working on new FAQs and promising practices.” In this context, we expect that Acting Director Hodge was referring to updates to OFCCP’s FAQ on Validation of Employee Selection Procedures from 2019, that touches on AI issues.
Consistent with OFCCP’s existing FAQ, Acting Director Hodge emphasized that an employment selection procedure that includes AI “still is a selection procedure” that federal contractors must audit in order “to ensure [they] are not creating barriers to equal employment.” She reiterated OFCCP’s expectation that federal contractors “can’t just pull something off the shelf and decide to use it” and that OFCCP expected employers to “drill down, under the Uniform Guidelines.” She also discussed OFCCP’s recent changes to its scheduling letter, describing these amendments as coming from OFCCP’s desire “to know at the beginning of a compliance process, are you using AI or algorithms in your screening or hiring process.”[1]
Regarding Acting Director Hodge’s reference to “promising practices” documents we note that such documents issued by federal agencies do not establish new mandatory legal requirements under federal law. Thus, failing to follow a federal agency’s “promising practices” recommendations will not independently result in an enforcement action, and conversely, demonstrating compliance with them does not independently insulate an employer from liability.[2] Nevertheless, any AI “promising practices” document issued by OFCCP has the potential to reflect the developing consensus on best practices and industry standards for managing AI risk. Employers using AI selection tools, especially federal contractors, will be well-advised to carefully consider what OFCCP will say in this area, in order to achieve compliant and responsible AI usage.
2. EEOC and NLRB Agency Heads, and the Department of Justice, Emphasized Their Existing Authority
On the same panel, leaders from the EEOC and NLRB, along with a representative of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, all agreed that using their existing enforcement authorities as employers implement AI practices is an ongoing priority for their agencies.
Johnathan Smith, Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Acting Chief of Staff of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, briefly described how the Civil Rights Division’s convened federal government officials to discuss how they could work together on AI issues. He cited challenges faced by government agencies in hiring people with technical expertise and integrating them into their legal investigation and enforcement processes. He predicted, “AI issues are going to be something that we’re all going to be grappling with for many years to come.”
EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows concurred, observing, “This is really an area where we are taking a whole of government approach…We are talking to each other and other agencies at the principal levels and up and down at all levels.”
Chair Burrows emphasized that the existing laws the EEOC enforces “really do give a lot of applicable tools to protect against harms” from AI, and that it was important for technology creators to understand that. She mentioned the EEOC’s prior technical assistance documents regarding the applicability of the Americans With Disabilities Act and Title VII to AI tools.
In response to a question regarding whether the EEOC was considering updating the 1978 Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, Chair Burrows suggested that while there might be some “clarification” forthcoming, she felt the Uniform Guidelines were “fairly clear” and the problem was not with the guidelines themselves, but rather the “way people are thinking” about them, which included “an over-simplification” of the 4/5ths test[3] set forth in the Uniform Guidelines. In her remarks, Chair Burrows emphasized, “I think the Uniform Guidelines are pretty clear that this is a rule of thumb, not an active bright-line,” and that the EEOC’s statistical cases involving discrimination were “more-sophisticated than the 4/5ths test.”
In additional comments, Chair Burrows identified two distinct issues regarding AI.
First, consistent with remarks that Chair Burrows has made in the past, she cited concerns that people with protected characteristics were disproportionately over-represented in “bad” data sets that were being used as AI training data. She also cited concerns that these same categories of people were disproportionately under-represented in “good” data sets being used to train AI.  
Second, Chair Burrows expressed concern about algorithms and AI being used to monitor employees, especially monitoring that might be happening without employees knowing about it or understanding enough about it in order to exercise their rights under the Americans With Disabilities Act.  She also expressed concern that an employee could be “stuck in a feedback loop” without being able to “find a person to talk to” to request an accommodation, in violation of the interactive process requirements in the ADA.
NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo also spoke at length about her assertions that an employer’s electronic surveillance and algorithmic monitoring of workers could violate Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. She cited her prior GC memo regarding electronic monitoring, issued in October 2022.
GC Abruzzo specifically expressed concerns regarding electronic monitoring or algorithmic management that prevented workers from taking breaks together, or which forced them to increase the pace of their work. She asserted that these practices were “interfering with [workers' rights] … to engage together to address areas of mutual concern” and that workers were entitled to do so under the NLRA. She concluded her remarks on AI emphasizing, “AI can be a great thing in so many ways, but it also can interfere with workers’ rights.” 
Implications for Employers
President Biden’s directive that the federal government adopt a “whole of government” approach to regulating AI is in full-swing, as evidenced by recent comments by multiple agency heads. Employers should expect the heightened enforcement scrutiny on AI issues from OFCCP, EEOC, the NLRB, and the Department of Justice to continue. We will continue to monitor these developing issues, especially as the Department of Labor and other agencies continue their work to meet the multiple deadlines for issuing AI-related guidance set forth in President Biden’s executive order on AI.

[1] Contractors who are scheduled for a compliance audit are now required to “identify and provide information and documentation of policies, practices, or systems used to recruit, screen, and hire, including the use of artificial intelligence, algorithms, automated systems or other technology-based selection procedures” at the time of the initial desk audit submission.

You could be forgiven for thinking that journalists, like others who make their living from writing, would be among those most in danger of being made redundant by generative AI.

After all, tools available today at practically no cost are already capable of churning out thousands of articles by the minute.


However, studies such as this one suggest that nearly three quarters of us still prefer to read news content that’s written by a human.

According to other studies, it’s a different story with marketing copy. So perhaps we still feel that humans should take the lead when it comes to writing about serious and important topics.

PROMOTED
So, if news organizations aren’t yet ready to make wholesale cuts to their workforces, and independent bloggers and writers can still find an audience, is the generative AI unimportant to them?
Not at all. There are many other ways they can leverage this world-changing technology to become more productive, efficient, and effective at spreading the word. So, here’s a rundown of the most realistic changes I think those working in these occupations will see in the coming years.
Writing
Writing is what ChatGPT is best at and there are many other AI platforms such as Writesonic and Jasper that are specifically built to create written text. But does anyone want to read what they write?

Human writers, journalists and bloggers build a following because people like what they say and the way they say it - not what they’ve made an AI write for them.
However, there are still many ways journalists can use generative AI to do their job better.

It can be used to summarize documents, reports, charts or even entire books that will inform their work.
It can help with structuring stories by suggesting the best way to present information. It can generate a list of questions that people reading their articles might want to find the answers to. And it can cut down the time it takes to write proposals, synopses and outlines, and other periphery pieces of writing needed to conduct the business of journalism.

Generative AI is likely to have a big impact on the working processes of journalists and other writers. But I don’t think journalists – good ones, at least – have to worry about being replaced by AIs for a while.
Good journalism involves coming up with original thoughts that people want to hear. While generative AI can write in a convincingly human way, ultimately, all it does is repurpose and restructure existing knowledge. Journalists will thrive in the AI age by honing their ability to uncover new facts, bring original thinking to issues and debates, and give it to their audiences in compelling, human ways.
Charts And Graphics
Journalists and bloggers often support their writing with data in the form of charts, infographics, or other visual representations. Traditionally, this would require data skills and an in-depth understanding of graphical communication.
Thanks to generative AI, journalists will simply describe the visualizations that they need and let AI generate insightful, compelling graphics. It will identify trends and suggest the best ways to present information.
Ultimately, this will make data-driven storytelling more accessible.
Reviewing And Editing Work
Once a writer has finished an article or report, it will often pass through the hands of numerous editors and sub-editors before reaching the intended audience.
Generative AI will play an increasingly important role here as it becomes routine to use it to critically appraise human output and suggest improvements. It can examine the evidence presented by the writer and identify areas where there may be holes or inconsistencies. It can also suggest alternative lines of inquiry that an article could pursue or raise important considerations that a writer might have overlooked.
Personalized Reporting
While writers and readers might prefer to read human-created content, generative AI could be useful when it comes to personalizing stories to suit a particular audience. For example, a writer could write one article giving an overview of a subject for a mainstream, non-technical audience, then use AI to personalize it depending on who is reading it – adding more technical details for experts or perhaps simplifying language further to make a version that can be better understood by children.
Automated Reporting
Many media outlets were already experimenting with automated news before generative AI exploded. Mainly, this involved using AI to fill out templated news stories by adding facts and figures from incoming data streams. For example, short sports or economic reports were being created simply by using AI to add the names of winning teams or stock market activity.
Although this enables news organizations to publish stories in large volumes and very quickly, they are very formulaic. By using generative AI, the templated parts can be re-written in order to make stories that are more interesting to read and also cover the more unusual or quirky elements that can’t be communicated simply by pulling in structured data.
And The Ugly …
Of course, there is a downside to this, as AI has undoubtedly already increased the amount of “churnalism”—low-quality journalism that simply regurgitates (or fabricates) facts to fill pages and sell advertising space.
And we can’t gloss over the fact that it’s inevitable that this kind of technology will be used by less scrupulous writers to spread disinformation, false news and propaganda.
Today’s AI can easily create convincing but entirely false narratives, and we will see this done both to make money and to destabilize political and democratic processes.
Another issue for news outlets relying on generative AI to create audience-facing content is that it isn’t always reliable and does make mistakes. Take, for example, a recent bulletin put out via a tweet stating that Elon Musk’s “massive space sex rocket” had exploded thanks to an AI transcription error.
Ultimately, though, audiences vote with their views and loyalty. Those outlets that avoid engaging in underhand tactics or becoming over-reliant on AI and continue to put out valuable, original content will be rewarded with engaged, trusting readers, viewers and listeners.

By Bryan Kirschner, Vice President, Strategy at DataStax
One of the major findings of our recently released State of AI Innovation report was how bullish managers and technical practitioners were about generative AI enhancing, rather than threatening, their careers.
A key reason why I think they’re right is generative AI’s ability to operate in useful ways using content that people already produce–or could produce quite easily.
I use the word “content” rather than “data” here deliberately. All AI thrives on data, but generative AI applications can readily be built against the documents, emails, meeting transcripts, and other content that knowledge workers produce as a matter of course.
This is made possible by a process called “retrieval augmented generations,” or RAG. RAG provides large language models (LLMs), which comprise the foundation of generative AI apps, with contextual content and data in real-time from corporate databases. (Here’s a more detailed explanation of the importance of RAG.)
Interrogate ‘all that you’ve done before’
There’s an individual use case and a (potential) enterprise use case that provide glimpses of how proprietary content can fuel powerful AI-driven outcomes.
The first is technologist and consultant Luke Wroblewski’s “Ask Luke” personal assistant. It enables people–including Wroblewski himself!–to ask questions against the 2,000-plus articles, 100-plus videos, and three books (and more) that he’s produced in his career.
Here’s how he describes the benefit of Ask Luke’s robust response to a usability question: “It’s not hard to see how the process of looking across thousands of files, finding the right slides, timestamps in videos, and links to articles would have taken me a lot longer than the ~10 seconds it takes Ask Luke to generate a response. Already a big personal productivity gain.”
As someone who has also been in this line of work a long time and values paying it forward by sharing what I’ve learned with others, being able to instantly and easily interrogate “all that you’ve done before” is a very compelling idea.
But above and beyond just saving time and (for example) getting new hires up to speed faster, generative AI offers some intriguing opportunities to raise everyone’s game–if you play your cards right as an organization.
Gain a better understanding your audience
I’ve been a long-time fan of Amazon’s “working backward from the customer” approach—specifically, the mock press release.The “customer quote” in particular invites the right kind of “outside-in” conversation: I’ve seen an example red-lined with the question, “would a customer really say this?”
It’s a powerful mechanism for pivoting people from crafting reactions that “sound great” internally with hopes of getting a green light toward something that “rings true”–and for provable reasons–coming from the audience that, at the end of the day, matters most.
This practice starts to look even more exciting with generative AI in the mix. Using RAG, a generative AI agent could read the corpus of mock press releases and real comments and reactions from customers on (for example) social media, as well as reviews and press coverage, and then provide meaningful guidance.
What teams or segments outperform or underperform? For certain audiences, is there a tendency to over- or under-shoot? By looking at consumer reaction to competitive or adjacent products, a genAI agent could enter the mix by producing what it would think a customer would say from an “outside-in” perspective–the point being not to replace the judgment of product managers, but to spin up a richer dialogue that would previously have been infeasible.
AI keeps getting better. You should, too.
This brings us to the strategic implications.
Most companies don’t do prospective press releases, but any given company might create some other form of content that’s unique fuel for generative AI. Most individuals don’t create as much content as Wroblewski, but many business units or functional organizations do.
It would be foolish to bet against generative AI’s capabilities continuing to get better. It would be wise to bet on people coming up with ingenious applications of those capabilities, using the content they already produce or could easily start producing.
As our survey showed, people are excited about the potential. Now’s the time to back them up with the permission to experiment and an architecture that’s ready and able to take all their good ideas into production without skipping a beat.

The use of artificial intelligence at work and in everyday life increases the productivity of individuals. The maximum benefit of AI is obtained by adding AI to an organization’s every application, function, and service. In order to create intelligent applications that solve real problems, we need more skills. The AI Developer microdegree offers a practical study path to AI development.
Artificial intelligence is constantly changing and evolving, offering new opportunities. Therefore, it is necessary to stay up to date with the latest innovations and applications of AI. We must continue learning and practical experimentation in order to help Finland fully utilize the potential of AI. We need in-depth development experts who understand business needs and know how to bring AI to the workplace safely, responsibly, and efficiently.
Finland has a unique opportunity to become a pioneer and role model in the deployment of artificial intelligence. We are already well-known for our high quality education, strong technology culture, reliable governance and commitment to the green transition. When we combine these strengths with excellence in application development, we can be one of the world’s most advanced countries in AI utilization, data economy, cybersecurity, and sustainability.
To renew continuous competence and ensure lifelong learning, higher education institutions and technology companies have joined forces to create a new AI Developer microdegree.
After completing the university-level, free and open-to-all AI Developer microdegree, a student has gained understanding of AI technologies, cloud services and application development. The microdegree is in English and worth 10 ETCS credits and it has been implemented in cooperation with higher education institutions, Arrow ECS Finland, Devisioona, Digital Workforce, Elisa, Microsoft, Reaktor and Sovelto Eduhouse.
“At Microsoft, we believe that technology education is essential to stay competitive in Finland and make the most of the opportunities offered by AI,” says Mervi Airaksinen, Managing Director of Microsoft Finland.
“Application development is changing at a rapid pace. Through AI, work efficiency rises to the next level. As a higher education institution, we want to offer everyone the opportunity to learn how to utilize new tools and technology. With these, one’s own competence develops and competitiveness improves,” says Rector Matti Sarén, Kajaani University of Applied Sciences.
“Efficient utilization of AI solutions requires competence development, which Arrow invests heavily in every year. It is once again a pleasure and honour to act as a corporate mentor in the new microdegree,” says Jyrki Korhonen, Country Manager, Arrow ECS Finland.
“In the next few years, information technology will grow into cross-cutting intelligence: the ability to independently advance user goals across application boundaries. For this change, we need IT educators, i.e. developers of the future,” sums up Jouni Heikniemi, CEO of Devisioona.

It’s the organizational question that has been top of mind for executives for nearly a year now: How do I change my operating model to quickly generate value and results from generative AI?


The wealth of possibilities—and their organizational implications—can be overwhelming. By 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will have used generative AI application programming interfaces or deployed generative AI-enabled applications, according to Gartner
IT
0.0%.

However, there’s a difference between pockets of experimentation and a scalable, organization-wide approach that achieves tangible results. To bridge the gap, it’s important for executives to first distinguish between two types of value:

new businesses or changes to the customer offering, and
operational changes to support the existing business

Building Businesses With Generative AI
The biggest potential sources of value lie in building new businesses and evolving the customer offering. From an operating model standpoint, this often requires dedicated, multidisciplinary teams with enough distance from the core business and a clear sandbox where they can break rules and move fast.
In some instances, this may also require a more formal, executive-led program where decisions can be escalated and resolved quickly. Companies in highly regulated industries, such as financial services, understandably tend to shy away from the “break rules” part, opting instead for greater oversight on new businesses that hold promise. One leading global financial services company, for example, has launched an executive-sponsored approach of this kind.

Scaling a new customer use case can involve small contributions from hundreds of people. Accomplishing that kind of re-prioritization and alignment quickly can only be done with top-down sponsorship. Such sponsorship from the CEO allowed grocer Carrefour to launch Hopla, its customer assistant, in about six weeks.

Augmenting Work With Generative AI
However, most of the discussion around generative AI today is not about building new businesses or customer offerings, but about how the technology will change existing operations and reshape the workforce. Far from a doomsday scenario of a jobless future, only four of 27 industries expect net job losses as a result of AI, according to an August 2023 World Economic Forum study. Respondents surveyed for that study believe only an additional 9% of operational tasks will be automated in the next five years, supporting the idea that AI is more likely to augment jobs than replace them. Other predictive studies on potential augmentation or labor time saved from generative AI range from 12% to 34%. At Bain & Company, we estimate 20%, based on an assessment of 14 sample companies across industries.
Of course, the actual effect will be felt unevenly across capabilities and roles. In our experience at Bain, some use cases show results in line with averages. At one energy company, an AI assistant to support service agents was able to reduce customer handling time by 17%. Other use cases far exceed the averages. For example, my colleagues found that AI reduced the time needed to generate initial regulatory filing drafts at a healthcare company by around 73% when accounting for review and quality control, turning a multi-month endeavor into a weeks-long task.
Generative AI provides an opportunity for companies to make jobs better by eliminating undesirable work and creating more joyful routines. Done right, becoming more digital should always mean becoming more human.
So, how can organizations evolve to capture the most value? Adapting the operating model for work augmented by generative AI is similar to any other technology adoption. Changing the work means editing job descriptions, supporting skill development for new tools, and redesigning processes. Take an entry-level job, say, a junior engineer—the engineer is still accountable for creating code that performs as intended, but the day-to-day role may become more about code review and synthesis than code development. That frees up more time for the engineer to explore customer experience improvements or groundbreaking product features.
Similarly, team size is unlikely to change dramatically because it is defined by the nature of the work. Engineering teams likely will still function best with around six to eight people. Even if AI can handle more routine customer calls, call centers may still run teams of 15 because the higher value calls that remain are more complex and take longer, requiring a human touch.
Process redesign is often overlooked or undervalued in technology adoption because of limited collaboration between the business and technology teams. It’s imperative to have close partnership across technology, data science, and business teams to remove friction and make it easier to change the way work is done.
While many companies have engaged in isolated pilots and scattered experimentation, few have progressed to a structured, scalable enterprise-wide approach that delivers real value. In the next stage of adoption, the ability to adapt the operating model for generative AI will separate the best from the rest. Some organizations are uniquely advantaged. Their operating models already embrace change, and they are used to standing up or standing down teams around new opportunities and priorities. These leaders are moving fast with generative AI—and the results are starting to show.

Generative AI may have made headlines for its ability to write text and create art, but its uses extend beyond simply generating content. Amazon has been using the technology to recognize customer palm scans for its Amazon One payment system. Let’s explore how the technology behind ChatGPT is helping Amazon to reimagine the shopping and payment experience.


What Is Amazon One?
Forgot your wallet? No problem. That’s the idea behind Amazon One, a contactless payment system that lets customers pay, not with their wallet or phone, but with the palm of their hand. Customers show their palm to an Amazon One scanner, which then uses infrared light to recognize the palm’s unique features like lines, grooves, ridges, and veins. It’s a palm signature that is effectively connected to the customer’s credit card or Amazon account.

The scheme is being rolled out at retailers, grocery stores (including Whole Foods), and entertainment venues. But Amazon One isn’t just a payment method – it can also be used to verify a customer’s age, as an entry system, or in place of a loyalty card.

PROMOTED
Sounds great, right? However, the problem with an innovative system like this is that it needs to be super-accurate for it to work. This is where generative AI comes into play.

The Problem
When you’re training any deep learning model, if you want it to be highly accurate (which of course, Amazon does), you need quality data. And lots of it. In this case, lots and lots of images of palms. Which was a problem for Amazon, since the company only had a small amount of palm data to train their system.

So the company turned to generative AI to generate millions of synthetic images of palms to train their model. As Amazon describes it, they used generative AI to create a “palm factory.”

Known as “synthetic data,” AI-generated data like this can prove useful in several ways. For one thing, it can be used to create additional data when available real-world data is limited. It can be used to create a more balanced, diverse dataset – thereby helping to reduce bias in AI models. It can also help preserve privacy by using synthetic data instead of the real, personal data of millions of people. In other words, synthetic data can replicate the breadth and variety of real data without the complications that often come with real-world data.

So, How Did This Work In Practice?
One of the things Amazon did was use generative AI to quickly generate hands reflecting all sorts of subtle changes, such as different hand poses, different lighting conditions, and even the presence of rings, scars, and Band-Aids. Generative AI was also used to create images not just of the palm itself but of the veins underneath the skin. And this played a major role in making the system more accurate. The system was also trained to recognize the difference between a live palm and, say, someone holding a fake silicon hand over the scanner. Amazon even tested the system with 3D-printed palms, and it was able to tell the difference.
Thanks to AI, palm images could also be automatically annotated, with labels telling the system that it was looking at, for example, a hand wearing a wedding band. This saved time and allowed Amazon to accelerate the system’s training.
As Amazon explains, the problem of identifying palm scans is more complex than, say, your smartphone recognizing your face and automatically unlocking it. Your smartphone already knows who you are, so all it has to do is verify that the face in front of the screen is indeed yours. It’s a one-to-one scenario; in other words – your phone is basically working out, “Is this you or not.” Whereas an Amazon One scanner doesn’t know who is putting their hand over the scanner. It has to work out the palm signature, differentiating it from all the other Amazon One palm signatures and quickly. It must also be able to identify palms that aren’t enrolled in the Amazon One program – when a person isn’t an Amazon One customer but is trying to use the scanner anyway.
The Results Are Impressive
Amazon set out to create a highly accurate system that could recognize palm scans, and that’s exactly what it achieved. According to Amazon data, in the more than 3 million times the system has already been used, it has proven to be 99.9999% accurate. In fact, the Amazon One system is 100 times more accurate than scanning two irises, marking a significant breakthrough in biometric identification.
And as a bonus, Amazon says its system is designed to protect customer privacy. Amazon One doesn’t use palm information to identify a person – it is purely matching the palm signature to the payment associated with it. Amazon also says its system is race and gender agnostic, meaning it cannot accurately perceive sex or skin tone.

Google is pushing hard on a generative AI product that would help news outlets write, distribute, and monetize their work. “It feels very big,” one person with knowledge of the project told me. “It’s certainly a high priority project,” said another person within Google said. 
The initiative has been in the works since at least last summer, but public information about it has been scarce. Last month, a report about the program alarmed me, so I went poking around for more details. And after speaking with multiple sources close to the project, I’m going to share the most comprehensive public description of the program here with you today.

Historically a labour-intensive industry, change could soon be on the horizon for the construction workforce, driven by generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) and data analytics.“It won’t be too long before we see site activity managed remotely by robotics”Making use of this technology will help us to understand how buildings are used, what people need from them, and how to implement better risk and safety regulations. RSM UK’s recent Real Estate 360 survey found that 41 per cent of businesses see gen AI as a threat, and with only 19 per cent invested so far, there’s much to do when it comes to changing perception.One of the industry’s biggest challenges, particularly during the past four years, has been to manage rising costs and material and labour shortages. This has been further exacerbated by the industry’s use of data capture, often being slow to feed in changes and requiring human intervention to forecast costings and outcomes. It is no secret that that industry faces a real skills and productivity issue, as more than 500,000 UK construction workers are set to retire in the next 10 years, while 2023 saw a 6 per cent fall in apprenticeship starts.New world, new skillsThat is all set to change in the next two decades, as we’re going to see a major shift in labour profiling and skills required in construction, especially as gen AI advances. This will encourage greater diversity in the workforce and change people’s mindsets on the skills required.  Traditionally, construction is perceived to be a manual industry with all activity taking place on site, but the reality is the industry needs workers with skills in design, architecture, surveying and planning. Currently, just 13 per cent of the overall workforce is made up of women.However, technology is opening up more opportunities to utilise different skillsets and ways of thinking, and it won’t be too long before we see site activity managed remotely by robotics. This will lead to the removal of barriers linked to gender and disability, enabling people to take on construction roles and manage onsite operations remotely from their desks, for example controlling a crane. Equally, better technology implementation will support greater flexibility towards shift patterns, especially for those trying to juggle work and home life.Previously, the industry has also experienced challenges due to government restrictions on overseas labour. However, as technology becomes more embedded in site operations such as automated routine tasks, language and geographical barriers will also fall away, as communication will be through robotics. As with anything new, this will be a trial-and-error process, and it may take the industry some time to get to grips with how it’s managed, but in the long term it will lead to fewer mistakes.In addition, as data capturing and analytics advances, businesses will be more informed and have the opportunity to innovate and develop more efficient processes relating to carbon neutrality, design and decision making.Gen AI will also play a fundamental role in the future of building safety and regulation, especially from a design perspective. Robotics technology is being adopted in Asia and parts of Europe that provides onsite surveillance and accesses areas that contain chemical and hazardous material.As remote management develops, this will also lead to better onsite safety as there will be fewer people manually operating machinery and equipment, reducing the risk of accidents.However, as technology advances, other risks will transpire relating to cyber security, so businesses will need to consider their long-term risk-management strategies relating to remote access and cyber breaches.The shift to gen AI requires collaboration with education providers, and we’ve recently seen this in action with Balfour Beatty signing a 54-year contract in partnership with the University of Sussex to build and operate a new student accommodation project.A growing number of universities are also introducing gen AI degree programmes, indicating that those leaving higher education from now will be most impacted by the changing technology landscape. The partnership between industry and education is important for the future of construction, because as technology brings together traditional ways of thinking with modern methods of innovation, there will be some conflicts to overcome. 2024-03-28Contributor Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email  Add to Bookmarks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a second wave could lead to the automation of more jobs amid rapid advances in AI.Analysing 22,000 tasks in the economy covering every type of job, the IPPR said 11% of tasks currently done by workers were at risk. This could, though, increase to 59% of tasks in the second wave as technologies develop to handle increasingly complex processes.It said routine cognitive tasks – including database management, scheduling and stocktaking – were already at risk, with potential to displace entry level and part-time jobs in secretarial work, administration and customer services.However, the second wave of AI adoption could impact non-routine tasks involving the creation of databases, copywriting and graphic design, which would affect increasingly higher earning jobs.Women would be significantly more affected, as “they are more likely to work in the most exposed occupations, such as secretarial and administrative occupations”, the IPPR said.In the worst-case scenario for the second wave of AI, 7.9m jobs could be displaced, the report said, with any gains for the economy from productivity improvements cancelled out with zero growth in GDP within three to five years.In a best-case scenario for full augmentation of the workforce with generative AI, no jobs would be lost, while the size of the economy could be increased by 4%, or about £92bn a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Either way, it is set to be a gamechanger for millions of us.“But technology isn’t destiny and a jobs apocalypse is not inevitable – government, employers and unions have the opportunity to make crucial design decisions now that ensure we manage this new technology well.

Why you can trust Sky News


Up to eight million UK jobs are at risk from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), according to a report warning that the low-skilled would be worst affected.The effects of generative AI are already being widely felt as 11% of tasks done by workers are currently exposed, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said.



It said that back office, entry level and part-time jobs were at the highest risk of being disrupted during the so-called first wave, with women and young people the most likely to be affected as a result.But its analysis showed that as more employers integrate AI technology into their work processes, up to 59% of tasks would be hit without government intervention, leaving the low-skilled most exposed.The figure equated to 7.9 million roles, the report said, adding that such a shift would provide no benefit to gross domestic product (GDP).





The authors described that as the ""worst case scenario"".But they painted a more positive picture for the economy, and people, if the transition was effectively managed through an industrial strategy that placed an emphasis on protecting key human functions through regulation and that aimed to unlock investment, particularly in training.

From students crafting essays and engineers writing code to call center operators responding to customers, generative artificial intelligence tools have prompted a wave of experimentation over the past year. At MIT, these experiments have raised questions — some new, some ages old — about how these tools can change the way we live and work. 
Can these tools make us better at our jobs, or might they make certain skills obsolete? How can we use these tools for good and minimize potential harm?
The generative AI wave has elicited excitement, anxiety, and plenty of speculation about what's to come, but no clear answers to these core questions. To discover how generative AI can lead to better jobs, MIT is convening a working group on Generative AI and the Work of the Future. The working group is kicking off with 25 companies and nonprofits alongside MIT faculty and students. The group is gathering original data on how teams are using generative AI tools — and the impact these tools are having on workers. 
“The world counts on MIT to turn sophisticated ideas into positive impact for the good of society,” says MIT President Sally Kornbluth. “This working group is focused on doing exactly that: In the face of broad public concern about AI’s potential to eliminate jobs, they are developing practical strategies for how to use generative AI to make existing jobs better and improve people’s lives.”
Organized at MIT’s Industrial Performance Center (IPC) and led by IPC Executive Director Ben Armstrong and MIT professors Julie Shah and Kate Kellogg, the working group recently released the first edition of its monthly newsletter, Generation AI, to share its early findings — and convened its first meeting of AI leads from a diverse cross-section of global companies. The working group also hosted a workshop on Feb. 29 highlighting responsible AI practices, in partnership with MIT’s Industrial Liaison Program.
The MIT team driving this initiative is a multidisciplinary and multi-talented group including Senior Fellow Carey Goldberg and Work of the Future graduate fellows Sabiyyah Ali, Shakked Noy, Prerna Ravi, Azfar Sulaiman, Leandra Tejedor, Felix Wang, and Whitney Zhang. 
Google.org is funding the working group’s research through its Community Grants Fund, in connection with its Digital Futures Project, an initiative that aims to bring together a range of voices to promote efforts to understand and address the opportunities and challenges of AI.
“AI has the potential to expand prosperity and transform economies, and it is essential that we work across sectors to fully realize AI’s opportunities and address its challenges,” says Brigitte Hoyer Gosselink, director of Google.org. “Independent research like this is an important part of better understanding how AI is changing the way people and teams do their work, and it will serve as a resource for all us — governments, civil society, and companies — as we adapt to new ways of working.”
Over the next two years, the working group will engage in three activities. First, it will conduct research on early use cases of generative AI at leading companies around the world. The group’s goal is to understand how these new technologies are being used in practice, how organizations are ensuring that the tools are being used responsibly, and how the workforce is adapting. The group is particularly interested in how these technologies are changing the skills and training required to thrive at work. MIT graduate student Work of the Future Fellows are collaborating with companies in the working group to conduct this research, which will be published as a series of case studies beginning in 2024.
Liberty Mutual Insurance joined the working group as part of its long-standing collaborative relationship with MIT researchers. “In a year of extraordinary advancements in AI, there is no doubt that it will continue shaping the future — and the future of work — at a rapid pace,” says Liberty Mutual CIO Adam L’Italien. “We are excited to collaborate with MIT and the working group to harness it to empower our employees, build new capabilities, and do more for our customers.”
Second, the working group will serve as a convener, hosting virtual quarterly meetings for working group members to share progress and challenges with their uses of generative AI tools, as well as to learn from their peers. MIT will also host a series of in-person summits for working group members and the public to share research results and highlight best practices from member companies. 
Third, based on the group’s research and feedback from participating organizations, the working group will develop training resources for organizations working to prepare or retrain workers as they integrate generative AI tools into their teams.
IBM has joined the working group as part of its broader investments in retraining and job transformation related to generative AI. “Skills are the currency of today and tomorrow. It is crucial that employees and employers are equally invested in continuous learning and maintaining a growth mindset,” says Nickle Lamoreaux, senior vice president and chief human resources officer at IBM. 
The working group has already interviewed or engaged with more than 40 companies. Working group members include Amsted Automotive, Cushman and Wakefield, Cytiva, Emeritus, Fujitsu, GlobalFoundries, Google Inc., IBM, Liberty Mutual, Mass General Brigham, MFS, Michelin, PwC, Randstad, Raytheon, and Xerox Corp.

Town hall leader Nick Peel told councillors the authority was ‘moving towards’ a pilot scheme on the introduction of Generative AI, a technology which he said ‘creates high quality content using deep learning models’, in some of its departments.


  He said that any future use of artificial intelligence systems by the authority should be based on improvements to services for the people of Bolton and not for purely financial reasons.






 
 









Cllr Peel was responding to a question from Liberal Democrat councillor Neil Maher.


  He said: “Dramatic changes and opportunities will arise from the use of AI in many office based functions including local government.


  “These could provide financial savings and efficiencies in an ever increasingly difficult financial situation for councils.

  “Can the leader indicate what investigations and development work is being undertaken by the council into the use of AI?”


  Cllr Peel, said: “This is the first question we’ve had in this chamber on artificial intelligence but I do predict there will be a lot more. It will become part of our lives.


  “It’s a rapidly moving aspect of technology. Work is already underway within the council to start to explore how best to take advantage of the potential it may generate for delivery of services.”


  Cllr Peel added that Generative AI will have a wide range of applicability across services to ‘speed up delivery, help customer focus and increase efficiency’. He said it could allow staff to dedicate a higher proportion of their time to more complicated aspects of their work.


  Cllr Peel said that recent events such as the Covid epidemic had led to an acceleration of tech innovation including AI. He added that any use of AI should be service driven.



  He said “I’ve always taken a view that transformation and improvements to services can be achieved through the use of innovative tech.


  “However, it should never be finance driven – as we’ve seen this can lead to hastily thought out and ill-conceived use of tech that leaves customers behind.


  “It should always be service driven and in this way the digital revolution can truly be harnessed to improve people’s lives.”

HR is fundamentally about managing humans – so how will the job change in a future where powerful generative AI tools are everywhere?

Empathy, emotional intelligence and an understanding of human nature are essential when it comes to managing a human workforce. Not exactly qualities that machines – even ones as human-like as ChatGPT – are renowned for!


So, are we going to see widespread replacement of human HR departments with cold, calculating chatbots that only care about measuring human efficiency and weeding out weaknesses?

Well, hopefully not. Instead, I think that HR professionals will use generative AI to automate routine and repetitive elements of their work, freeing time for them to nurture and develop the human-to-human skills needed for their more high-value tasks.

Here’s my overview of how I believe the work of HR departments will change – and in many cases already is. I’ll also take a look at the wider implications for how the place of these essential professionals in society is likely to evolve over the next five to 10 years.

Recruitment And Talent-Hunting
Finding talented people is always a challenge, but generative AI tools will help out with the routine and administerial work. Not just by doing it more quickly, but by finding more efficient and personalized ways to reach out to prospective hires and advertise a workplace.
At the start of the process, it will be used to generate ideas around ideal candidate personas, creating overviews of the skills, qualities and personality traits that might make an applicant right for the job. Then, it can create dynamic, personalized job descriptions aimed at encouraging a wider pool of applicants.
For companies that hire thousands every year, it will be used to carry out initial assessments to ensure candidates meet basic criteria. After that, it can offer simulated interviews and roleplays to help candidates prepare for their application. Rather than used as a form of screening, it should be thought of as a tool that will help recruiters and other HR professionals to get a better understanding of candidates as unique human beings, before meeting them face-to-face.

Workforce Development 
Businesses are going to need to ensure their workforces are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the AI era, and this responsibility falls on the shoulders of HR workers.

Generative AI is great for training – it can create anything from complex technical manuals to simple step-by-step walkthroughs. Public models like ChatGPT already capable of doing this, but businesses will increasingly invest in training their own private AI models tailored to their needs.
These reports can be personalized to individual learners, taking into account their unique skills and learning requirements.
As we move forward, we will find generative video and even world simulation tools becoming available. These will be used to create even more engaging, personalized training experiences. Language models will provide feedback in real-time, just as if the trainee had an instructor standing with them.
There are some risks here – we know generative AI doesn’t always get things right, which could lead to dangerous misinformation or mistakes. So, there will always be a need for transparency about how these systems operate, as well as human oversight.
Workplace Management And Analytics
Rather than spending hours studying metrics and statistics, generative AI tools can quickly analyze data and compile reports highlighting key workforce trends.
It can identify future staffing needs and highlight areas and causes of high staff turnover. It will provide quick, relevant insights into factors like employee sentiment and satisfaction. It will also be used to create narrative and visual projections around the impact of strategic HR decisions.
These will simplify the understanding of the underlying human element driving a business's success or failure for HR professionals.
Of course, we have to be careful when converting human activities and emotions into numbers. Bias in the way data is collected or analyzed can lead to unfair outcomes and overly intrusive data gathering or AI initiatives can create unhappy employees. Risks in all of these areas must be carefully assessed and guarded against.
Employee Experience
It’s the job of HR departments to create inclusive, positive experiences for workers throughout the business. Ensuring employees are able to carry out their duties effectively without being hindered or held up by internal processes is a critical task.
Here, generative AI will be used to create onboarding material relevant to individual new hires, provide personalized and relevant answers to common HR queries through chatbots, and gather and interpret employee feedback.
Here, quality of service is of utmost importance. Few things are as irritating as talking to bad chatbots. At the same time, more people are coming to accept that when used well, they can be a very efficient way of getting information.
This all helps HR departments understand the “pain points” that employees experience on a day-to-day basis as they carry out their work and navigate their own career pathways.
The Changing Role Of HR Professionals 
With generative AI taking on the routine and administrative elements of their work, the perception of HR professionals in the workplace will change dramatically. The higher level of visibility given to the human-centric elements of their work will mean they are less likely to be perceived as “back office” or even “faceless” functions, instead becoming more deeply ingrained in the working lives of their colleagues. The role of HR professionals in staff wellness and the development of healthy work/life balance, as well as promoting inclusion and diversity, will come to the front.
This means that HR professionals' strategic value will grow exponentially. Moving beyond being facilitators of operational efficiency, they will have the chance to become champions of positive organizational change, ethical application of technology, and curators of healthy, caring workplace culture.

Generative AI is the fastest-growing AI technology and, as with every industry, it presents huge opportunities for the legal sector and lawyers in particular.
However, the adoption of generative AI in the sector has its unique set of challenges due to the nature of legal work.Related Company ProfilesThomson Reuters CorpView all
Applicability of generative AI to legal work
There is a clear consensus among lawyers that generative AI can be applied to legal work. According to a 2023 Thomson Reuters survey research on the matter, 82% of respondents who work within the legal sector answered that generative AI or ChatGPT can be applied to legal work.
The use cases of generative AI in law range from drafting contracts/ documents to conducting legal research and due diligence. Increased efficiencies created by generative AI allow lawyers to focus their efforts on more analytical and sophisticated tasks. Ultimately, the adoption of the technology raises the stakes for being a good lawyer by automating routine, unprofitable, and time-consuming tasks, leaving lawyers to strictly focus on strategic legal analysis.
Concerns about the risks remain
Despite the hype around generative AI within the legal sector, there remain risks that law firms and legal teams need to consider before adoption. In the same Thomson Reuters survey, only 51% of survey respondents said they believed generative AI should be applied to legal work despite the majority agreeing that it can be applied. This boils down to concerns about the accuracy, reliability, data privacy, and security of the content produced by generative AI. Hallucinations are a key limitation to the use of generative AI solutions, as these answers often sound believable but are essentially made-up facts.
Reliance on fabricated information can have severe repercussions, particularly in the case of legal work. Additionally, lawyers highlight their privacy concerns with generative AI given the sensitive nature of client data and the need to process confidential data when using the technology.

The role of lawyers in developing the product
To prove useful, generative AI for lawyers requires specific legally trained models that rely on large amounts of authoritative and up-to-date data. For example, ChatGPT-4 was last updated in April 2023, meaning cases or any significant rulings that followed that date would not appear in searches, providing inaccurate legal information and advice.
Lawyers would need to be involved in creating a generative AI product for use within the legal industry, as subject matter expertise is particularly vital in this field. Law firms seeking to adopt generative AI will thus need to allocate a specific budget for purchasing the necessary tools and addressing the talent and skills gap that exists when deploying this technology.
A 2024 generative AI survey by LexisNexis states that 43% of the 200 largest law firms (Am Law 200) have a dedicated budget for investing in generative AI solutions this year, and 90% of law firms and corporate respondents expect their investment in the technology to increase over the next five years. Ultimately, it is clear that law firms are aware that they will be at a competitive disadvantage if they do not invest in generative AI.

Adobe and Microsoft have partnered to bring Adobe Experience Cloud workflows and insights to Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 to enable marketers to collaborate easily when developing creative content, managing marketing campaigns, and more.  
The new integrated capabilities will bring relevant marketing insights and workflows from Adobe Experience Cloud applications and Microsoft Dynamics 365 to Microsoft Copilot, which will enable users to develop creative briefs, create content, manage content approvals, deliver experiences and more. 
This will help marketers working in applications such as Microsoft Outlook, Teams and Word to manage their everyday workflows more efficiently and improve collaboration between the internal and external teams working on marketing projects and campaigns.  
“The demand for personalised content across social media, mobile and other fast-moving channels has been exploding, pushing marketers to drive greater efficiency and productivity in their everyday work,” said Amit Ahuja, senior vice president, digital experience business at Adobe. “Marketers spend a great deal of their day working across Adobe and Microsoft applications, and the partnership provides a unique offering for marketing teams, streamlining daily tasks across planning, collaboration, create and campaign execution.” 
The new capabilities will enable marketers to monitor the status of a marketing project, understand the effectiveness of a campaign, identify outstanding approvals and actions to take, or define audience and key performance indicators. These insights will also be available to enable marketers to create briefs, presentations for executive reviews, or reports. Marketers can also create imagery with Adobe Firefly generative AI or copy for marketing experiences through Adobe Experience Manager Sites.

 AI job losses in the UK could impact up to eight million people unless the government takes urgent action to address skills gaps, according to a new report. Analysis from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) found entry level, part-time, and administrative jobs are at greatest risk, affecting women, younger workers, and those on lower wages the most.The study assessed 22,000 tasks spanning various roles across the UK economy, and found that 11% of worker roles are already exposed to AI. The most affected include ‘routine cognitive’ tasks such as database management, and ‘organizational and strategic’ tasks such as scheduling or inventory management.However, more jobs could be put at risk as companies integrate existing AI technologies deeper within operational processes, the study warned. Long-term, this could result in AI carrying out 59% of tasks and eventually affecting higher-earning jobs.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITPro""We could see jobs such as copywriters, graphic designers, and personal assistant roles being heavily affected by AI,"" said IPPR senior research fellow and report author Bhargav Srinivasa Desikan.AI job losses: The worst-case scenariosThe report sets out three potential scenarios whereby AI job losses occur. The worst-case scenario, the study found, would see “full displacement” of the UK’s workforce, with all at-risk jobs eventually being replaced. Under this scenario, around 7.9 million jobs could be lost across the country with no GDP gains.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Wage gains for workers could be more than 30% in some cases – but could also be nil.Impact of AI job losses can be mitigated through trainingWithout government action and with companies left to their own devices, the worst-case scenario is a real possibility, the IPPR warned.""Already existing generative AI could lead to big labor market disruption or it could hugely boost economic growth, either way it is set to be a game changer for millions of us. Many firms are already investing in it, and it has potential to speed up many more tasks as more businesses adopt it,"" said Carsten Jung, report author and senior economist at IPPR.""History shows that technological transition can be a boon if well managed, or can end in disruption if left to unfold without controls. Indeed, some occupations could be hard hit by generative AI, starting with back office jobs.""The IPPR urged the government to develop a job-centric industrial strategy for AI.This, the think tank said, should support green jobs, which it noted are less vulnerable than others to automation. Similarly, the government was advised to enact fiscal policy measures such as tax incentives or subsidies to encourage job augmentation over full displacement.Nikolaz Foucaud, managing director for EMEA at Coursera, echoed the report’s calls for a sharpened focus on training and upskilling.Foucaud said that while AI job losses will likely occur in coming years, proactive efforts now will be critical to reduce the impact on the workforce and enable workers to move into new roles.“The IPPR report’s warning of potential job losses from AI points to an increasing urgency to accelerate AI training and upskilling for UK workers,” he said. “The data serves as a stark reminder that companies cannot afford to be complacent about the impact of AI on existing jobs.RELATED WEBINAR(Image credit: IBM)Empower HR resources and focus on strategic value“AI presents a golden opportunity for business growth and increased productivity. For lower-skilled jobs, in particular, it could save workers’ time on repetitive tasks and provide opportunities for wider career progression. However, the effective adoption of AI, designed to complement rather than replace humans, hinges on a workforce equipped with the necessary expertise.”Foucaud said the report’s indication that women are specifically at-risk should also raise serious concerns.The IPPR report findings on this front align with similar research from Code First Girls this year, which found that tech workers fear the increased use of generative AI could “drive women out the workforce”.“Organizations must ensure that women do not miss the opportunity to benefit from AI upskilling and this must include flexible options for training,” he said. “This will be vital for ensuring women’s careers evolve alongside AI rather than facing a heightened risk of being replaced by it.”

As employers explore ways to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the bounds of existing and emerging legislation and guidance, and as government agencies, states, and municipalities seek to regulate AI in employment and other areas, the use of AI by job applicants has proceeded largely under the radar. But an increasing number of job candidates are using AI, including to draft and review resumes, cover letters and writing samples, to complete job applications, and even to help them prepare for and participate in job interviews. This use is often undetected by employers, which can lead to problematic results.
It is critical that employers understand the ways in which candidates can use AI in the hiring process and learn how to effectively navigate potential issues that might arise without negatively impacting the pool of talented applicants or running afoul of employment laws.
HOW ARE JOB CANDIDATES USING AI?
Job candidates are using AI in a variety of ways. A 2023 survey from a provider of online and app-based resources for job seekers found that almost half of them were already using ChatGPT to generate resumes and cover letters, and 70% of applicants reported a higher response rate from employers when using ChatGPT to create or revise application materials.1 Indeed, a 2023 Harvard Business Review article theorized that “[u]sing tools like ChatGPT to help craft [a] resume may very well be the new norm in a few years’ time.”2
In addition to using AI to generate and revise applications, resumes, cover letters, and other written materials, candidates are also using AI in connection with interviews. For example, in 2023, multiple news agencies reported on a TikTok video (with over two million views) that showed how to use AI to prepare for interviews by using the tool to generate possible interview questions based on the job description. Indeed, a recent survey found that 41% of college students believe that using AI to prepare for interviews is acceptable.3
More troubling, some applicants may use AI to respond to text, pre-recorded, or video interview questions. This controversial use of AI was highlighted in a 2023 TikTok video that showed a woman using an app on her phone to generate answers to questions while they were being asked during a video interview.4 While some believe that the post was an advertisement for the app the woman was using and not a real-life scenario, the video shows yet another way that AI can creep into the hiring process.
EMPLOYMENT LAW CONSIDERATIONS
While Congress, agencies, and state and local governments have not addressed the use of AI by applicants, existing federal employment guidance and laws on employers’ use of AI provide insights into how employers might regulate applicants’ AI use.
For example, in May 2022, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued “The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees” (the EEOC ADA Guidance), which contains guidance on how the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) could limit employers’ use of AI to screen job applicants. Although focused on employers’ use of AI, the guidance’s is helpful in understanding how employers might limit an applicant’s use of AI. Among other things, the EEOC ADA Guidance notes that one of the most common ways that employers can violate the ADA is by failing to provide a “reasonable accommodation” for job applicants to be fairly considered. Relatedly, the EEOC ADA Guidance explains that employers cannot use AI to “screen out” job applicants with disabilities under the ADA.
With these concerns in mind, if an employer has a general policy prohibiting AI based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reason (e.g., combatting plagiarism and misrepresentations about skills and experience), then it may need to make an exception for job applicants with disabilities if the applicant can articulate why they need the AI to assist them in the application process. If the underlying purpose of an employer’s workplace policy banning job applicants from using AI could be accomplished with alternative means (e.g., using AI tools and human screeners to detect potential AI plagiarism in applications), then employers may need to adjust the policy for applicants with disabilities. Further, if a job applicant with disabilities uses AI to, for example, draft their resume, but is still able to perform the offered position’s essential functions, employers should be careful not to automatically screen them out because of a blanket ban on AI use.
On the whole, while employers should take some comfort from the EEOC ADA Guidance’s instruction that they never need to “lower production or performance standards or eliminate an essential job function as a reasonable accommodation” under the ADA, employers should proceed cautiously and purposefully when regulating job applicants’ use of AI, including by following the recommended practices set forth below.
In May 2023, the EEOC issued “Select Issues: Assessing Adverse Impact in Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence Used in Employment Selection Procedures Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,” which contained guidance on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.5 Although the Guidance is focused on how employers can use AI within the bounds of Title VII, it also provides helpful insights for employers as they develop policies governing on job applicants’ use of AI.6 At the forefront of this guidance is the EEOC’s clear message that employers may be liable for any discriminatory use of AI-influenced “selection procedures” (i.e., any measure used to make an employment decision) in a manner that has a disparate impact on job applicants based on their protected characteristics (e.g., race, sex, religion, etc.). In light of this, if publicly available data or studies are published that show that job applicants with protected characteristics are disproportionately using AI to apply to certain industries or occupations, then affected employers should proceed with caution when deciding how to restrict candidates’ use of AI and should not automatically reject candidates because of their use of any form of AI in the application process.
Existing and proposed legislation is also informative. For example, Illinois’ Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act in 2020 requires employers to disclose their use of AI in the hiring process, which suggests that employers could require candidates do the same.
Finally, employers restricting a job applicant’s use of AI should draft their policies with the Biden administration’s “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights” (the AI Blueprint) in mind to mitigate potential legal exposure and reputational harm.7 Because the AI Blueprint focuses on how AI can exacerbate existing biases in employment, employers seeking to restrict or prohibit the use of AI by job applicants should ensure that their rules do not inadvertently or disproportionately impact certain groups of applicants.
EMPLOYER RECOMMENDATIONS
Employers must be prepared for candidates to use AI in a variety of ways during the job application process and should draft rules and procedures that address the various ways candidates can use AI and take into account existing federal, state, and local laws and guidance. Employers and their counsel should stay on top of the ever-evolving legal landscape in this area and the new AI tools entering the market.
With this general advice in mind, employers should consider taking the following steps to address job applicants’ use of AI:

Ensure there are nondiscriminatory business reasons for prohibiting or restricting the use of AI at various stages of the application process. For example, some uses, like preparing for a job interview with AI generated questions or using AI to edit resumes or cover letters, might be acceptable, while other uses, like using AI to draft resumes or cover letters from scratch, draft or edit writing samples, or answer interview questions might be problematic.
Post on your job portal or third-party job posting a notice about your AI rules and a link to those rules.
Post on your job portal or third-party job posting a specific notice tailored to particular jobs if certain AI-related rules apply only to those positions.
Depending on your AI rules, require candidates to attest that they have not used AI in any part of the application process or require them to disclose their use of AI.
Include in your notices and rules information about seeking a reasonable accommodation in the application process, including using AI.
Train job recruiters, HR personnel, and interviewing staff to detect potential job application materials that have used AI.

AI “tells” in written materials include things like: (1) use of repeated words or phrases; (2) a lack of personalization, including failing to include details about skills and experiences or failing to address the specific job for which the applicant is applying and parroting back language from the job posting without elaboration or context; (3) formatting inconsistencies; (4) different tones and writing styles within a single document and across documents; (5) overly complex or verbose language; and (6) similarities between multiple applicants’ written materials.
Indicators that an applicant is using AI during interviews in real-time include things like: (1) applicants pausing too long after the question is asked; (2) applicants looking off camera before answering; and (3) applicants providing answers that sound scripted.
In addition, as candidates progress through the hiring process, job recruiters, HR personnel, and interviewing staff should be on the lookout for inconsistencies in what candidates said about their experience and skills in written materials or video interviews and what they or their references say later in the hiring process. 


Include an in-person, nondigital interactive step during the job-application process (e.g., in-person interview without electronics) and be diligent with checking references to better assess an applicant’s skills and experience (e.g., by comparing what skills and experience is conveyed during the in-person interview or by references and with what was conveyed in the applicant’s written materials or during remote interviews).

CONCLUSION
Employers should be mindful that job applicant use of AI is likely to increase over time. Additionally, it may become more difficult for employers to accurately track job applicant use of AI as AI improves and there are fewer noticeable AI “tells” or “hallucinations” in job-applicant materials. As employers attempt to navigate this evolving landscape, they must proceed cautiously when imposing restrictions on job applicant use of AI to ensure they remain in compliance with existing federal, state, and local employment and labor-law obligations.

Let's explore the special attributes, working, and advantages of the top 20 tools.
What is Generative AI?
The branch of artificial intelligence known as ""generative AI"" is concerned with developing models and algorithms that may generate fresh and unique content. Generative AI algorithms apply probabilistic approaches to produce new instances that mirror the original data, typically with the capacity to demonstrate creative and inventive behavior beyond what was explicitly designed.
How Does Generative AI Tool Work?
Generative AI tools operate by employing advanced machine learning techniques, often deep learning models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) or variational autoencoders (VAEs). These models are trained on massive datasets to understand patterns and underlying structures. The models learn to create new instances that mirror the training data by capturing the statistical distribution of the input data throughout the training phase.

                        Artificial Intelligence


Who should be the head of generative AI — and what they should do 

By
Kara Baskin

Mar 28, 2024






Why It Matters		



Adopting artificial intelligence takes time and proper leadership. Heads of generative AI manage how companies use the technology to manage people and help set the right tone.

Generative artificial intelligence has rapidly become an organizational priority. After it was launched in late 2022, ChatGPT had 100 million active users in less than two months, and many executives now consider managing AI’s impact to be a leadership priority.

But adoption takes time and requires proper stewardship. In a recent webinar hosted by MIT Sloan Management Review, London Business School professor Lynda Gratton discussed the new roles companies are creating to guide AI initiatives, the job responsibilities of these leaders, and how companies can use AI for people management.
Introducing the “head of generative AI”
Many companies are introducing positions to guide generative AI use. Last year, Coca-Cola moved Pratik Thakar from his role as head of global creative strategy to senior director of generative AI. Likewise, advertising agency M&C Saatchi named chief data strategy officer James Calvert its new head of generative AI, Gratton noted.
She pinpointed five key job responsibilities for those in these new roles:
Steering the strategic direction and alignment of AI work.
Establishing and sustaining a collaborative generative AI ecosystem.
Monitoring and evaluating generative AI experiments to inform best practices.
Identifying high-impact use cases for scalability.
Overseeing generative AI integration across business units.
Some generative AI leaders might have a creative background; others could come from tech. Gratton said background matters less than a willingness to experiment.
“You want somebody who’s got an experimental mindset, who sees this as a learning opportunity and sees it as an organizational structuring issue,” she said. “The innovation part is what’s really crucial.”
Ways to use AI for people management 
The head of AI could encourage use of the technology to help with managing employees, Gratton said. This encompasses three key areas:
Talent development. Companies can use chatbots and other tools to recruit people and help them manage their careers.
Productivity. AI can be used to create assessments, give feedback, manage collaboration, and provide skills training.
Change management. This includes both internal and external knowledge management. “We have so much knowledge in our organizations … but we don’t know how to find it,” Gratton said. “And it seems to me that this is an area that we’re really focusing on in terms of generative AI.”


Trust, collaboration, and open-mindedness are essential
As companies embark on their generative AI journeys and add leadership in this area, transparency is key.

“Employees need to feel that they trust their managers,” Gratton said. “This isn’t just a piece about technology; it’s also a piece about how you manage change.”
Some workers fear that AI could replace them. A good leader will address those concerns and generate companywide enthusiasm across roles and age groups.
“The CEO and the leadership team have got to set a narrative. When you have high levels of ambiguity, the job of a leader is to tell stories about the future, to help people think: ‘This is where we’re walking; this is why it’s happening; this is how we feel about it,’” she said. This includes getting everyone in the organization involved in thinking about how to use generative AI.
Leaders should remember that buy-in across all career stages and skill levels is essential. Generative AI isn’t just the domain of youth.
“We shouldn’t stereotype the idea that it’s only young people who are thinking about this. In fact, if you look at people at every stage in their working life, they are very interested — and there’s even some data that show the over-50s are really working to experiment and to understand generative AI,” Gratton said. “Don’t be blinkered about what you expect your employees to do.”

Generative AI can help social impact teams be more productive, creative and effective in serving their communities. In fact, Google.org funding recipients report that AI helps them achieve their goals in one third of the time at nearly half the cost.But while a recent Google.org survey found that four in five nonprofits think generative AI may be applicable to their work, nearly half said their organization is not currently using the technology. They cite a lack of tools, awareness, training and funding as the biggest barriers to adoption.To help nonprofits make the most of this technology, we are announcing the Google.org Accelerator: Generative AI, a six-month program supporting nonprofits developing high-impact applications of generative AI. Our first cohort includes 21 organizations focused on areas like climate, economic opportunity, health, education and crisis response. In addition to technical training, workshops, mentors and pro bono support from a dedicated AI coach, Google.org is providing more than $20 million in funding across the projects.Through the Google.org Fellowship, teams of Googlers will also work with three of these nonprofits — Tarjimly, Benefits Data Trust and mRelief — full time for up to six months to help them build their proposed generative AI tools.Learn about some of the selected organizations’ projects below, and read more about other Google accelerator programs.Benefits Data Trust is using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build an AI-powered assistant that supports caseworkers and other front-line workers in helping low-income applicants access and enroll in public benefits.Beyond 12 is developing a generative AI-powered College Coach that will provide coaching at scale to first-generation college students and students from under-resourced communities.CareerVillage is developing new activities for its AI Career Coach to help underrepresented individuals navigate their career paths and achieve better employment outcomes.Climate Policy Radar is building an open digital database and knowledge graph for climate law and policy with a generative AI-enabled search interface to help climate leaders make evidence-based decisions.CodePath will launch AI tutoring and mentorship solutions to provide immediate, personalized career support to underserved communities.EIDU is using generative AI to provide personalized tutoring services in low- and middle income-countries through content for teachers and customized digital learning exercises for students.Full Fact is building a generative AI tool to analyze and summarize large volumes of health misinformation across various media, reducing fact checkers’ workload.IDinsight, Inc. provides prompt and accurate, generative AI-powered responses to health-related inquiries from new or expectant mothers in South Africa.Jacaranda Health scales digital health services to mothers who live in underserved areas using Natural Language Processing (NLP) that has been trained in African languages.Justicia Lab is creating an AI assistant to help immigrants understand their options for attaining legal status — providing them with actionable information throughout the process, and offering customized guidance on their path to immigration relief.Materiom is creating a generative AI tool for entrepreneurs to build and test compostable biomaterial recipes that help to transform the packaging and textiles industries to become regenerative.mRelief is creating an assistant to help with applying for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the U.S.Opportunity@Work is helping employers gain greater insights into career paths that don’t rely solely on degree-based qualifications in order to boost employability for more workers Skilled Through Alternative Routes.Partnership to End Addiction is enhancing the reach and quality of its addiction support services for families by using AI to build training simulations and quality assurance tools.Quill.org is building a new tool to provide students with immediate, AI-powered feedback and coaching on writing and reading comprehension activities, enabling them to quickly build new skills while saving teachers hours of time.Tabiya’s generative AI tool empowers jobseekers in low- and middle-income countries with tailored and relevant advice at scale to enable better job matches, increased gender equity and higher incomes.Tarjimly uses AI-powered translation to empower human translators for refugees — improving accessibility, quality and scale of translation for low-resource languages globally.U.S. Digital Response is helping governments understand how to use generative AI effectively to improve efficiency and impact, starting with a language access tool to reduce barriers to unemployment insurance.World Bank is developing a generative AI tool to make development research more accessible, extracting evidence-based findings from research to help policymakers make decisions faster and direct resources more effectively.

What effect is generative artificial intelligence likely to have on wage inequality?
While no one can say for sure yet, it’s possible generative AI might reduce the contemporary societal problem of income inequality. That’s one of the conclusions reached by MIT Sloan School Associate Professor Nathan Wilmers in a new analysis.
About the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research (IWER)IWER is a multidisciplinary research and teaching unit that is located within the MIT Sloan School.  IWER’s mission is to conduct and disseminate cutting-edge research that improves the lives of workers and their loved ones and guides managers in crafting a successful and inclusive future of work.

Wilmer’s new working paper, “Generative AI and the Future of Inequality,” was recently published online as part of a new collection called An MIT Exploration of Generative AI. This collection consists of 25 papers on the societal impact of generative AI that were authored by members of the MIT faculty, with support from seed grants from MIT. Wilmers, who is the Sarofim Family Career Development Associate Professor and an Associate Professor of Work and Organization Studies at MIT Sloan, is a member of the core faculty of the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research (IWER). He has done extensive past research identifying factors that drive labor market inequality.
In his new essay, Wilmers observes that generative AI could reduce the premium in wages received by college-educated knowledge workers—a contributor to inequality— because the technology may disrupt higher-paid white-collar jobs more than low-wage jobs. What’s more, he notes, early research suggests that, within a given job, large language models (LLM) benefit lower-skilled workers more than top performers—a result likely to compress wage scales over time.  “LLMs appear to be a skill leveler, delivering the biggest performance boosts to the previously worst performers,” Wilmers writes.
Should this occur, Wilmers points out that generative AI might over time undermine the rationale for the competitive meritocratic systems that sort students into colleges and jobs and increase income inequality along the way. “The meritocratic regime is only cost-effective if the productivity differences between slightly different candidates [for a job or for admission to a school] are large,” Wilmers writes—something that may become less true in the age of generative AI.
In addition, Wilmers makes the case that protections against displacement by generative AI use are the kind of workplace “collective goods” that motivate workers to seek union representation—suggesting that the technology could result in increased interest in unionization, including among white-collar workers.  And unions, Wilmers notes, not only help provide employment protection but also tend to reduce income disparities among their members through standardization of pay scales. As a result, he argues, “white-collar unionization that is primarily stimulated by generative AI…could strengthen inequality-reducing effects” of the technology by bringing about more standardized pay for white-collar workers.
On the other hand, Wilmers points out that there’s no guarantee that generative AI will reduce income inequality. Indeed, it could have the opposite effect. Wilmers cites a number of possible reasons. College-educated workers could end up competing with non-college-educated workers for blue-collar jobs. Some firms may prove far more adept than others at harnessing generative AI for competitive advantage, resulting in significant disparities between companies, and thus in the wages of their respective workforces. What’s more, some research suggests that managers who experience more precarity in their own work lives—something that technological changes like generative AI can engender—are in turn more likely to impose precarity on the people who work for them.  Finally, generative AI could result in more intensive workplace surveillance of workers that enables companies to tie wages closely to individual worker productivity.
While it’s impossible to predict precisely what effects generative AI will have on labor market inequality, Wilmers believes there’s a benefit to thinking through a range of possibilities. Identifying a number of the possible impacts large language AI models could have, he writes, his can help  “guide policymakers to broaden the consideration set of ways that LLMs can effect inequality.”

Investments into AI-driven startups increased substantially as of 2021, as generative AI emerged and at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when it became clear that working from home and cyber solutions were a permanent part of the workplace. Consequently, investments grew from a little over 30 billion U.S. dollars in 2020 to more than 65 billion U.S. dollars in 2021. However, investments in AI startups had been slightly declining in 2022 until the record level of funding for OpenAI and other generative AI investments at the tail end of the year. Artificial Intelligence investments during COVID-19During the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of investment rose in nearly all organizations across the globe. The increase was most staggering in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry where nearly 44 percent of companies reported an increase in their use of artificial intelligence. The automotive industry, being one of the more advanced automation industries in the world, also increased its investment by over 40 percent. The automotive industry automation market totaled two billion U.S. dollars in revenue . Artificial Intelligence in business and recessionThe increased use of AI in the United States is enabling companies to reduce their labor demands and hiring cycles, thus becoming more efficient. Nearly a third of companies have either implemented or begun to implement AI driven solutions within their organization. In the context of energy driven recession faced by Europe - that is impacting the entire world - AI comes to the rescue. Most mobile companies reported an energy saving of 10 to 15 percent. Such small steps are vital in maintaining a robust technological economy in recession times.

General summary

A recent survey conducted by Google.org revealed valuable insights into the potential of generative AI for nonprofits. 75% of nonprofits believe generative AI can transform their marketing efforts, particularly in content creation and personalization. However, two-thirds of organizations face barriers due to unfamiliarity with the technology, and 40% lack AI education within their teams. To address these challenges, Google for Nonprofits offers training resources, such as a productivity guide for Gemini for Google Workspace, and has donated over $2 billion in Google Ad Grants and Google Workspace access to support nonprofits in leveraging AI-powered tools.


            Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental.

Nonprofits around the world do critical work in their communities, from helping people build new skills, to studying and protecting biodiversity. But they’re also often stretched, under-resourced and weighed down by time-consuming administrative tasks.Research shows that generative AI tools can improve productivity by 66%. That efficiency could be particularly valuable to nonprofits, taking smaller tasks off their plate in order to focus on bigger-impact efforts.We recently surveyed more than 4,000 organizations in our Google for Nonprofits program to get a better sense of other opportunities, and obstacles, of using generative AI in the nonprofit world. Here are three insights from that survey, plus some AI tools nonprofits can start using today.1. 75% of nonprofits said that generative AI had the potential to transform their marketing efforts.When asked about the most immediate potential of generative AI in their work, survey participants consistently mentioned marketing tasks that involve writing or personalizing content. Whether creating effective ad copy to reach new donors or running an awareness-building campaign, effective fundraising and communication involves a lot of time-intensive customization.With AI-powered Google Search ads, organizations can reach new audiences with relevant messages tailored to their goals. Tools like responsive search ads allow nonprofits to enter multiple headlines and descriptions for an ad, and over time, Google Ads will automatically test different combinations and learn which performs best.For example, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) used Google Ad Grants to serve 48 million public service announcements. That included encouraging voter registration for citizens who had upcoming elections in their area, and sharing information about local causes, like donations to support local female entrepreneurs, to those most likely to be interested in them.

The United Nations Development Program used AI-powered Google Search ads to serve 48 million public service announcements and drive engagement for local projects.






To help more social impact organizations take advantage of AI-powered tools, in 2023, the Google for Nonprofits program donated more than $2 billion in Google Ad Grants and Google Workspace access to nonprofits. This gave more than 300,000 nonprofits around the world the opportunity to use AI-powered technology at no cost.2. Two-thirds of nonprofits said a lack of familiarity with generative AI was their biggest barrier to adoption.The survey found that four in five nonprofits think generative AI may be applicable to their work — but nearly half said their organization is not currently using the technology. And the majority of respondents said they lacked awareness of potential use cases.We’ve seen firsthand that when nonprofits are trained on how and when to use this technology effectively, generative AI can help them support their communities in entirely new ways. For instance, generative AI-powered career coaches and tutors can provide tailored support to job seekers and students, while queryable databases can help policymakers and the public ask questions about and dig deeper into topics like the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.Read about other ways nonprofits are using AI, including the 21 participants in our newest accelerator focused on generative AI solutions.3. 40% of nonprofits said nobody in their organization was educated in AI.We heard repeatedly that while nonprofit staff are experts in their field, they’re often not technology specialists. So they’re looking for low- or no-cost, simple training on generative AI — ideally tailored to the social impact sector.That’s why we published a productivity guide to accompany Gemini for Google Workspace, the add-on subscription now available to Google Workspace for Nonprofits users. The guide outlines ways to use these generative AI tools, like to help you write grant proposals and volunteer communications, generate images for marketing assets, organize donor databases and more. Interested nonprofits can get started today with a Gemini for Google Workspace no-cost trial.Check out the entire report for more insights, and learn more about the Google for Nonprofits program.

That might not be a good thing.Why AI agents that could book your vacation or pay your bills are the next frontier in artificial intelligence.by  Kelsey PiperMar 29, 2024, 9:00 AM EDTFacebookLinkMalorny/Getty ImagesKelsey Piper is a senior writer at Future Perfect, Vox’s effective altruism-inspired section on the world’s biggest challenges. She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.ChatGPT and its large language model (LLM) competitors that produce text on demand are very cool. So are the other fruits of the generative AI revolution: art generators, music generators, better automatic subtitles and translation. They can do a lot (including claim that they’re conscious, not that we should believe them), but there’s one important respect in which AI models are unlike people: They are processes that are run only when a human triggers them and only to accomplish a specific result. And then they stop.Now imagine that you took one of these programs — a really good chatbot, let’s say, but still just a chatbot — and you gave it the ability to write notes to itself, store a to-do list and the status of items on the to-do list, and delegate tasks to other copies of itself or other people. And instead of running only when a human prompted it, you had it work on an ongoing basis on these tasks — just like an actual human assistant.At that point, without any new leaps in technology whatsoever — just some basic tools glued onto a standard language model — you’d have what is called an “AI agent,” or an AI that acts with independent agency to pursue its goals in the world. AI agents have been called the “future of artificial intelligence” that will “reinvent the way we live and work,” the “next frontier of AI.” OpenAI is reportedly working on developing such agents, as are many different well-funded startups.They may sound even more sci-fi than everything else you’ve already heard about AI, but AI agents are not nonsense, and if effective, could fundamentally change how we work. That said, they currently don’t work very well, and they pose obvious challenges for AI safety. Here’s a quick primer on where we’re (maybe) headed, and why.Why would you want one of these?Today’s AI chatbots are fun to talk to and useful assistants — if you are willing to overlook a set of limitations that includes making things up. Such models have already found sizable and important economic niches, from art to audio and video transcription (which have been quietly revolutionized over the last few years) to assisting programmers with tools like Copilot. But the investors pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into AI are hoping for something more transformative than that.Many people I talk to who use AI in their work describe it as like having a slightly scatterbrained but very fast intern. They do useful work, but you have to define each problem for them and carefully check their work, meaning that much of what you might gain in productivity is lost in oversight. Much of the economic case for AI is that it could do more than that. The people at work on AI agents hope that their tools won’t just help software developers, but that the tools could be software developers. In this future, you wouldn’t just consult AI for trip planning ideas; instead, you could simply text it “plan a trip for me in Paris next summer,” as you might a really good executive assistant. Today’s AI agents do not live up to that dream — yet. The problem is that you need a very high accuracy rate on each step of a multistep process, or very good error correction, to get anything valuable out of an agent that has to take lots of steps. But there’s good reason to expect that future generation AI agents will be much better at what they do. First of all, the agents are built on increasingly powerful base models, which perform much better on a wide range of tasks, and which we can expect to continue to improve. Secondly, we’re also learning more about how to build agents themselves. A year ago, the first publicly available AI agents — AutoGPT, for example, which was just a very simple agent based on ChatGPT — were basically useless. But a few weeks ago, the startup Cognition Labs released Devin, an AI software engineer that can build and deploy entire small web applications. Devin is an impressive feat of engineering, and good enough to take some small gigs on Upwork and deliver working code. It had an almost 14 percent success rate on a benchmark that measures ability to resolve issues on the software developer platform GitHub. That’s a big leap forward for which there’s surely an economic niche — but at best, it’s a very junior software engineer who’d need close supervision by a more senior one. Still, like most things AI, we can expect improvement in the future. Should we make billions of AI agents?Would it be cool for everyone in the world to have an AI personal assistant who could plan dinner, order groceries, buy a birthday present for your mom, plan a trip to the zoo for the kids, and pay your bills for you while notifying you of any unexpected ones? Yes, absolutely. Would it be incredibly economically valuable to have AI software engineers who can do the work of human software engineers? Yes, absolutely. But: Is there something potentially worrying about creating agents that can reason and act independently, earn money independently, make copies of themselves independently, and do complex things without human oversight? Oh, definitely. For one, there are questions of liability. It’d be just as easy to make “scammer” AIs that spend their time convincing the elderly to send them money as it would to make useful agents. Who would be responsible if that happens? For another, as AI systems get more powerful, the moral quandaries they pose become more pressing. If Devin earns a lot of money as a software engineer, is there a sense that Devin, rather than the team that created him, is entitled to that money? What if Devin’s successors are created by a team that’s made up of hundreds of copies of Devin? And for those who worry about humanity losing control of our future if we build extremely powerful AI systems without thinking about the consequences (I’m one of them), it’s pretty obvious why the idea of AIs with agency is nerve-racking. The transition from systems that act only when users consult them to systems that go out and accomplish complex goals in the real world risks what leading AI scientist Yoshua Bengio calls “rogue AI”: “an autonomous AI system that could behave in ways that would be catastrophically harmful.” Think of it this way: It’s hard to imagine how ChatGPT could kill us, or could even be the kind of thing that would want to. It’s easy to imagine how a hyper-competent AI executive assistant/scam caller/software engineer could.For that reason, some researchers are trying to develop good tests of the capabilities of AI agents built off different language models, so that we’ll know in advance before we widely release ones that can make money, make copies of themselves, and function independently without oversight. Others are working to try to set good regulatory policy in advance, including liability rules that might discourage unleashing an army of super-competent scammer-bots.And while I hope that we have a few years to solve those technical and political challenges, I doubt we’ll have forever. The commercial incentives to make agent AIs are overwhelming, and they can genuinely be extremely useful. We just have to iron out their extraordinary implications — preferably before, rather than after, billions of them exist.A version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

As a 20-year veteran of writing code and as a CEO of a company that serves software developers, I had a reflexively skeptical reaction to early predictions that generative AI would eventually make most software development skills obsolete.
While I’m still somewhat skeptical, my experience playing with gen AI in my daily development work has prompted me to open my aperture to what I think is possible. AI will change software development in some pretty fundamental ways, both for better and for worse. Let’s start with the positives.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



An end to grunt work
Developers spend an inordinate amount of time on details like syntax and punctuation. Much of this can (and should) go away. Instead of poring over manuals or piecing together snippets from code exchanges, they will describe a desired outcome and get perfectly formatted code in response. Large language models (LLMs) can also check existing code to ferret out typos, punctuation mistakes and other details that drive developers crazy. 
Reinventing frameworks
Software frameworks like Spring, Express.js and Django have delivered an enormous productivity boost by abstracting away the mundane aspects of software development, setting consistent guidelines and furnishing prewritten code for common functions. Gen AI will enhance their value by creating boilerplate code, automating repetitive tasks and suggesting code optimizations. AI can also help customize framework components to a specific project.
The rise of the generalist
The stock in trade for many developers is their expertise in a particular language. Proficiency in Python or Ruby won’t matter as much when machines can spit code in any language. Similarly, specialized backend skills like testing and code optimization will quickly migrate to gen AI models. The most prized skills will be what machines don’t do well, such as building compelling user interfaces, translating user requirements into specs and inventing new ways to support customers. Software “poets,” or people who dream up big ideas of what can be accomplished in code, will own the spotlight. 
A revolution in testing
Gen AI was made for software testing. The developer writes the code, and the bot creates as many test scripts as you want. A recent IDC survey found that the top two most anticipated benefits of gen AI by a wide margin are software quality assurance and security testing. This will disrupt the DevOps practice of continuous integration/deployment and send many testing specialists looking for new lines of work.
Citizen development on steroids
The current crop of low-code/no-code development tools is already good, and gen AI will take them to the next level. For all their automated elegance, low-/no-code still requires people to piece together a workflow on a whiteboard before committing it to software. In the future, they’ll be able to give the model a hand-drawn sketch of the desired workflow and get the necessary code back in seconds.
AI isn’t a panacea, though
For all its promise, gen AI shouldn’t be seen as a panacea. Consider these potential downsides.
Risk of over-testingadvertisement
Because models can churn out tests quickly, we could end up with many more than we need. Over-testing is a common problem in software development, particularly in organizations that measure performance by the number of tests a team generates. Running too many duplicative or unnecessary tests slows down projects and creates bottlenecks further up the pipeline. When AI can recommend when to remove tests, then we’ll see a huge unblocking of developers — that vision of gen AI excites me for the future.
Skills degradation
“I will always choose a lazy person to do a hard job because he will find an easy way to do it,” is a quote often mistakenly attributed to Bill Gates. While the origin of the quote is unclear, the sentiment is valid. Lazy people find shortcuts that avoid the need for hard work. Gen AI is a drug for lazy developers. It can lead to the creation of bloated, inefficient and poorly performing code. It can throttle the innovation that makes great developers so valuable. Remember that gen AI writes code based on existing patterns and data. That can limit the innovative potential of developers who might not consider more out-of-the-box solutions.
Trust deficitadvertisement
Gen AI is only as good as the data used to train the model. Poor quality data, training shortcuts, and lousy prompt engineering can lead to AI-generated code that doesn’t meet quality standards, is buggy or doesn’t get the job done. That can cause an organization to lose trust in the quality of gen AI and miss out on its many benefits.
Now the money question: Will AI make software developers obsolete?
Although some headline-grabbing pundits have suggested it, there’s no historical precedent for such a conclusion. Technological advancements — from high-level languages to object orientation to frameworks — have steadily made developers more productive, but demand has only grown. Gen AI could dent the market for low-end basic coding skills, but the bigger impact will be to move the entire profession up the value chain to do what LLMs don’t do very well at the moment: Innovate. Remember that gen AI models are trained on what is already known, not what could be. I don’t expect a machine to design a revolutionary user interface or dream up an Uber anytime soon. 
Nevertheless, developers won’t see a transformation like this again in their careers. Instead of raging against the machine, as I initially did, they should ride the wave. The prospect of doing away with much of the tedium of building software should excite everyone. The risk that some functions may disappear should be an incentive to action. High-quality developers who translate business requirements into elegant and performant software will always be in high demand. Make it your mission to move your skills up the stack.

					Statements and Releases				










Administration announces completion of 150-day actions tasked by President Biden’s landmark Executive Order on AI
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is issuing OMB’s first government-wide policy to mitigate risks of artificial intelligence (AI) and harness its benefits – delivering on a core component of the President Biden’s landmark AI Executive Order.  The Order directed sweeping action to strengthen AI safety and security, protect Americans’ privacy, advance equity and civil rights, stand up for consumers and workers, promote innovation and competition, advance American leadership around the world, and more. Federal agencies have reported that they have completed all of the 150-day actions tasked by the E.O, building on their previous success of completing all 90-day actions.
This multi-faceted direction to Federal departments and agencies builds upon the Biden-Harris Administration’s record of ensuring that America leads the way in responsible AI innovation. In recent weeks, OMB announced that the President’s Budget invests in agencies’ ability to responsibly develop, test, procure, and integrate transformative AI applications across the Federal Government.
In line with the President’s Executive Order, OMB’s new policy directs the following actions:
Address Risks from the Use of AI
This guidance places people and communities at the center of the government’s innovation goals. Federal agencies have a distinct responsibility to identify and manage AI risks because of the role they play in our society, and the public must have confidence that the agencies will protect their rights and safety.
By December 1, 2024, Federal agencies will be required to implement concrete safeguards when using AI in a way that could impact Americans’ rights or safety. These safeguards include a range of mandatory actions to reliably assess, test, and monitor AI’s impacts on the public, mitigate the risks of algorithmic discrimination, and provide the public with transparency into how the government uses AI. These safeguards apply to a wide range of AI applications from health and education to employment and housing.
For example, by adopting these safeguards, agencies can ensure that:

When at the airport, travelers will continue to have the ability to opt out from the use of TSA facial recognition without any delay or losing their place in line.
When AI is used in the Federal healthcare system to support critical diagnostics decisions, a human being is overseeing the process to verify the tools’ results and avoids disparities in healthcare access.
When AI is used to detect fraud in government services there is human oversight of impactful decisions and affected individuals have the opportunity to seek remedy for AI harms.

If an agency cannot apply these safeguards, the agency must cease using the AI system, unless agency leadership justifies why doing so would increase risks to safety or rights overall or would create an unacceptable impediment to critical agency operations.   
To protect the federal workforce as the government adopts AI, OMB’s policy encourages agencies to consult federal employee unions and adopt the Department of Labor’s forthcoming principles on mitigating AI’s potential harms to employees. The Department is also leading by example, consulting with federal employees and labor unions both in the development of those principles and its own governance and use of AI.
The guidance also advises Federal agencies on managing risks specific to their procurement of AI. Federal procurement of AI presents unique challenges, and a strong AI marketplace requires safeguards for fair competition, data protection, and transparency. Later this year, OMB will take action to ensure that agencies’ AI contracts align with OMB policy and protect the rights and safety of the public from AI-related risks. The RFI issued today will collect input from the public on ways to ensure that private sector companies supporting the Federal Government follow the best available practices and requirements.
Expand Transparency of AI Use
The policy released today requires Federal agencies to improve public transparency in their use of AI by requiring agencies to publicly:

Release expanded annual inventories of their AI use cases, including identifying use cases that impact rights or safety and how the agency is addressing the relevant risks.
Report metrics about the agency’s AI use cases that are withheld from the public inventory because of their sensitivity.
Notify the public of any AI exempted by a waiver from complying with any element of the OMB policy, along with justifications for why.
Release government-owned AI code, models, and data, where such releases do not pose a risk to the public or government operations.

Today, OMB is also releasing detailed draft instructions to agencies detailing the contents of this public reporting. 
Advance Responsible AI Innovation
OMB’s policy will also remove unnecessary barriers to Federal agencies’ responsible AI innovation. AI technology presents tremendous opportunities to help agencies address society’s most pressing challenges. Examples include:

Addressing the climate crisis and responding to natural disasters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is using AI to quickly review and assess structural damage in the aftermath of hurricanes, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is developing AI to conduct more accurate forecasting of extreme weather, flooding, and wildfires.
Advancing public health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using AI to predict the spread of disease and detect the illicit use of opioids, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services is using AI to reduce waste and identify anomalies in drug costs.
Protecting public safety. The Federal Aviation Administration is using AI to help deconflict air traffic in major metropolitan areas to improve travel time, and the Federal Railroad Administration is researching AI to help predict unsafe railroad track conditions.

Advances in generative AI are expanding these opportunities, and OMB’s guidance encourages agencies to responsibly experiment with generative AI, with adequate safeguards in place. Many agencies have already started this work, including through using AI chatbots to improve customer experiences and other AI pilots.
Grow the AI Workforce
Building and deploying AI responsibly to serve the public starts with people. OMB’s guidance directs agencies to expand and upskill their AI talent. Agencies are aggressively strengthening their workforces to advance AI risk management, innovation, and governance including:

By Summer 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration has committed to hiring 100 AI professionals to promote the trustworthy and safe use of AI as part of the National AI Talent Surge created by Executive Order 14110 and will be running a career fair for AI roles across the Federal Government on April 18.
To facilitate these efforts, Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance on pay and leave flexibilities for AI roles, to improve retention and emphasize the importance of AI talent across the Federal Government.
The Fiscal Year 2025 President’s Budget includes an additional $5 million to expand General Services Administration’s government-wide AI training program, which last year had over 4,800 participants from across 78 Federal agencies.  

Strengthen AI Governance
To ensure accountability, leadership, and oversight for the use of AI in the Federal Government, the OMB policy requires federal agencies to:

Designate Chief AI Officers, who will coordinate the use of AI across their agencies. Since December, OMB and the Office of Science and Technology Policy have regularly convened these officials in a new Chief AI Officer Council to coordinate their efforts across the Federal Government and to prepare for implementation of OMB’s guidance.
Establish AI Governance Boards, chaired by the Deputy Secretary or equivalent, to coordinate and govern the use of AI across the agency. As of today, the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and State have established these governance bodies, and every CFO Act agency is required to do so by May 27, 2024.

In addition to this guidance, the Administration announcing several other measures to promote the responsible use of AI in Government:

OMB will issue a request for information (RFI) on Responsible Procurement of AI in Government, to inform future OMB action to govern AI use under Federal contracts;
Agencies will expand 2024 Federal AI Use Case Inventory reporting, to broadly expand public transparency in how the Federal Government is using AI;
The Administration has committed to hire 100 AI professionals by Summer 2024 as part of the National AI Talent Surge to promote the trustworthy and safe use of AI.

With these actions, the Administration is demonstrating that Government is leading by example as a global model for the safe, secure, and trustworthy use of AI. The policy announced today builds on the Administration’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework, and will drive Federal accountability and oversight of AI, increase transparency for the public, advance responsible AI innovation for the public good, and create a clear baseline for managing risks.
It also delivers on a major milestone 150 days since the release of Executive Order 14110, and the table below presents an updated summary of many of the activities federal agencies have completed in response to the Executive Order.

Scale AI, the data processing company that advertises itself as a way to train generative AI on higher-quality information, has apparently shut down access to its platform in several countries, leaving gig workers in the lurch.
The company, which does much of its data processing through a subsidiary called Remotasks, cut access to its portal for workers in Nigeria, Kenya and Pakistan in  March, according to a report by Rest of World. The gig workers used by Remotask, and by extension Scale, improve data quality by adding labels, annotations, and general human input to information set to be processed by AIs.
The idea is to help AI tools learn by shaping their perceptions of, say, lidar data from cars or other information.
 
 
 













 
 

According to Rest of World’s report, workers — many of whom rely on Remotasks for their main income — were greeted by a message saying that “we regret to inform you that at the moment we are unable to provide service in your location.” The report also notes that remote workers “often have few reliable ways to contact supervisors or escalate complaints,” despite the presence of hotlines and Slack channels.

Scale released a statement in September detailing its relationship with Remotasks, which it calls the “data annotation” side of its business. The company said it partners with the Global Living Wage Coalition and conducts quarterly pay analyses to “ensure fair and competitive compensation” for the gig workers annotating its data. Scale also criticized “misunderstandings and mischaracterizations” about the way it treats its workers through Remotasks.
Scale could not be reached for comment on Rest of World’s report, which said that many of the workers affected by the apparent shutdown only found out about it when they attempted to log in and work. According to Rest of World, a company spokesperson blamed the lack of communication with workers on an administrative error, while saying that the shutdowns were put in place for “enhanced security protocols.”
 
 
 













 
 

In addition to the shutdowns in Pakistan, Nigeria and Kenya, Rest of World reported that new signups for Remotask work had been blocked in several other countries, including Thailand, India, Poland and Vietnam.
Rest of World’s report ran a day after The Information reported that Scale — which has been one of the AI industry’s early success stories — was up for a new round of funding, courtesy of VC firm Accel, which was an early investor in Scale. The proposed funding round would raise the company’s value to $13 billion, a rise of 80%.
The company joins several other big names in the generative AI industry, including AI-powered robot creators Figure AI, LLM creator Anthropic, and market powerhouse OpenAI in lining up hundreds of millions in new funding from investors desperate to capitalize on the much-hyped technology, according to a report from siliconAngle.

Artificial intelligence has been developing in leaps and bounds but along with that progression comes a major threat to human employment.
The International Monetary Fund has released a survey that found AI will affect nearly half of all jobs around the world.
Experts here warn we should start preparing for a future where humans are no longer necessary.

AI could pose 'extinction-level' threat to humans - US govt report







It's been just under a year since ChatGPT by OpenAI kicked off a global AI arms race - a race that's entering a critical new stage.
""I think it's going to get scarily faster in the next six to 12 months,"" said tech entrepreneur Asa Cox.
""I think the next step is going to be super interesting when we move from us copiloting in with the AI to the AI running the show and we're the copilot. So then we'll change seats and then it'll get really exciting.""
At Arcanum in Wellington, Cox trains AI bots to automate aspects of Kiwi businesses - like answering emails, chasing suppliers and organising logistics.
""If you had a team of interns to do all the stuff you didn't want to do, what would you get them to do? And that's all the stuff that AI can now take on,"" Cox said.
""And so people should be watching this and have a long list of 'What can I get rid of and what would I do with that time?' Maybe it is growing the business more, maybe it is spending more time with the family. But there's a huge volume of repetitive things that people right now don't believe that AI can take on. But it can.""
But automating basic admin is just the start. In 12 months AI tools became of creating perfect videos, and the pace of progress is exponential.
The computing power driving advanced AI models is doubling every six months, and in the AI goldrush, whoever sells the shovels, reaps the rewards.
NVIDIA, the company building advanced AI chips, saw its stock price soar almost 2000 percent in five years. Now it's the 3rd most valuable company on earth.



But chatbots are just the beginning - actual bots are arriving.
""We've been able to make robots like this for quite a long time,"" AI Professor Michael Witbrock said.
""And what got stuck was not that we couldn't make them mechanically. It's because they just weren't smart enough to control their bodies.
""So what was going to happen is that pretty good bodies like this with AI, very smart AI, will be able to do more.""
A report by the IMF estimates that currently 60 percent of all jobs in advanced economies could be disrupted by AI, and 40 percent of all jobs globally - potentially leading to mass unemployment.
Those numbers will likely increase as AI's capabilities do, and experts here warn we're running out of time to prepare.
""It is going to change the way human civilization works,"" Prof Witbrock said.
""The nature of work, the nature of what humans are expected to do and what machines are expected to do is going to change quite dramatically. The sooner we start to work out how our society accommodates that change, the better.""
That might sound scary to some, but the potential upsides are equally transformational.
""Biology is so complicated that unaided human beings cannot possibly understand it. With AI helping us, there's a very real chance that we can completely understand biology and make diseases a thing of the past,"" Prof Witbrock said.
An AI-powered cure for cancer, Alzheimer's, and the automation of all the work humans hate. Sounds great, but reaching that bright AI future requires action now.
""I think everyone can agree with us, we haven't done a good job of regulating technology of the past 20, 30 years,"" tech policy analyst Sarah Bickerton said.



""What I would like to see is some policy-developed guardrails around the effects of AI.
""We understand the way in which technology can have negative effects, that's not an insurmountable problem for us to be able to solve.""
Australia, the US, the EU and the UK all have regulatory work underway while our Government is so far taking a hands-off approach.
While how to prepare is an open question, our only certainty is that the age of AI is here and the world will never be the same.

Intelligent Automation: How can Automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) work together in healthcare?



Automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are very closely related, but they aren’t always the same. Automation is the process of outsourcing tasks to technology with the goal of reducing the need for human intervention.
For example, when a patient signs in for their doctor's appointment, an automated system can log them into the electronic medical record without requiring a human to manually enter their information. This is a simple automation process that doesn't necessarily involve ‘artificial intelligence’.
AI, on the other hand, is about making technology capable of performing increasingly human-like tasks. AI systems can learn from data to make intelligent decisions. For instance, with AI, we can now decipher ancient languages, a task that requires an incredible level of intelligence. But again, this doesn’t necessarily fit the definition of automation.
The real power lies in combining Automation and AI - known as Intelligent Automation (IA). This is all about leveraging increasingly capable technology to outsource increasingly complex tasks with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for human intervention. We’re still learning what is possible with Intelligent Automation, and the capabilities are growing by the day, but there are many risks we need to be careful of. The rest of this post explores what we’ve been learning about IA in the healthcare sector.
How could Intelligent Automation work in Healthcare?
We argue that Intelligent Automation has the potential to revolutionise healthcare in two main ways.
First, it expands the scope of what can be automated. Until now, traditional automation has been limited to highly logical processes - if data is entered here, send it there; if the data is this value, do this action. This type of automation is great for manual tasks like data entry, triggering template emails, or scheduling appointments, but not for anything that requires a more complex thought process.
With AI, we can start to automate even the most complex tasks. For example, diagnosing a medical condition based on a picture of cells is something that previously only a highly trained medical person could do. But with enough data, we can teach machines to do this too (and with potentially higher accuracy). A recent example showed how AI can diagnose critical newborn conditions faster and more efficiently than humans.
Second, Intelligent Automation makes technology increasingly adaptable to work around us, saving time and effort. With simple automation technology, a doctor might have to input very specific conditions or codes into a system to trigger an automated step to alert another department. Now, technology could, in theory, transcribe a patient meeting, intelligently understand the situation, and alert the department without the need for any additional steps from the doctor.
As AI develops, we will likely see increasingly complex Intelligent Automation workflows that incorporate both AI and standard automations. The goal is to take the heat off workers and make it easier to interact with technology, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
It’s not all sunshine and rainbows
While the potential of Intelligent Automation in healthcare is exciting, it's important to be aware of the risks and challenges that come with it.
Hallucinations: AI can get things wrong, and the impacts of incorrect decisions are amplified when downstream actions in a process depend on them. Instead of relying solely on AI, we should use 'human-in-the-loop' systems, where AI outputs are checked by humans before proceeding. This approach can still significantly reduce the time taken to carry out tasks while ensuring accuracy.
Bias: AI learns from historic data, and where there is historic data, there is often bias. If we're not careful, AI systems can perpetuate or even amplify these biases, leading to worse outcomes for certain individuals and marginalised groups. It's crucial that we actively work to identify and mitigate these biases when developing and deploying AI systems in healthcare.
Explainability: When errors occur, we should be able to understand why. However, AI systems are often 'black boxes', meaning it's difficult to interpret how they arrive at their decisions. This lack of explainability can be a major issue in healthcare, where understanding the reasoning behind a decision is often critical. Significant work is being done in this area, but we're not there yet.
Privacy and Security: AI systems require data, but where there is data, there need to be privacy and security considerations. This is especially important when it comes to sensitive health records. As we develop Intelligent Automation systems for healthcare, we need to put robust data protection measures in place and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.
While these challenges are significant, they're not insurmountable. By being aware of these risks and actively working to address them, we can harness the power of Intelligent Automation in healthcare in a responsible and beneficial way.
What’s next?
The risks of Intelligent Automation in healthcare are significant, and we must proceed thoughtfully and responsibly. In the near future, we can expect experimentation and pilot projects with 'human-in-the-loop' systems. Widespread adoption will require addressing challenges like bias, explainability, privacy, and security, as well as collaboration between stakeholders. The journey is complex, but the potential for a more efficient, effective, and equitable healthcare system is worth pursuing.

Will Schmitt in AtlantaMarch 19 20241Print this pageUnlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.Invesco is preparing to roll out generative artificial intelligence technology to cut rising compliance costs, but would not employ it to pick stocks anytime soon, says its chief executive.In his first interview as CEO of the $1.6tn Atlanta-based asset manager, Andrew Schlossberg said Invesco would also consider deals to boost its private credit offerings.Schlossberg, who replaced veteran chief executive Marty Flanagan last year, said the group had been investigating for more than a year how teams could use generative AI to work more efficiently.“If this can help them get 75 per cent of that job done, they can focus more of their energy and time on these growth areas and opportunities,” including getting reports out to clients more quickly, said Schlossberg, who was most recently Invesco’s head of the Americas. He said the asset manager’s analysts have been using some form of AI for years, but played down the idea that the company would use the technology in investment decisions such as stockpicking. The group would take its time before extending AI tools to investments and clients, he added, citing Invesco’s fiduciary obligations and its duty to care for people’s data.Schlossberg said: “As the quantitative team starts to employ better generative AI, it’ll help them make better decisions, but turning over the portfolios to gen AI is not something I see in the near-term future for Invesco.”He said he wanted to add alternative strategies to the mix for clients, along with new products to meet the demand among wealthy investors for more personalised portfolios. He identified the Chinese retirement market as an area for possible expansion, through Invesco’s joint venture with Great Wall Securities.The group is the fourth-largest US provider of exchange traded funds and is one of the 10 largest asset managers overall in the US. Invesco reported $10.2bn in net long-term inflows in 2023 — driven largely by passive investments — reversing course after $500mn in net outflows in 2022.Schlossberg said he aimed for the group to “recharge” its actively managed strategies — which suffered outflows of $29bn in 2023 and $28.3bn in 2022, per company results — while expanding its $90bn private real estate arm and its $40bn private credit business. He cited the latter as a potential target for dealmaking, but did not give details and added “we’re not going to try to do everything in private markets”.On private credit, Invesco has focused on bank loans and structured collateralised loan obligations with more recent expansions into distressed credit and direct lending. “I think those are places where we’ll continue to grow organically, and I may even look for some places to grow inorganically,” Schlossberg said. “And I think in that space, the demand and the opportunities are still quite high in private credit.”Within the asset management industry generally, “consolidation will happen and we’ve done a number of those deals historically”, Schlossberg said. “You don’t want to just be big to be big, but size does matter. Having scale and the ability to reinvest in the business and compete matters.”Schlossberg reiterated the group’s priority would be driving organic growth to strengthen its balance sheet and improve returns for shareholders. “But I think there’s going to be more (deals), especially in the private markets space,” he said, “and we’ll be paying attention.”Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.

         — 
    


            About 10% of US workers are in jobs that face the greatest risk of disruption from rapidly evolving artificial intelligence, according to a White House analysis shared first with CNN.
    

            The report represents the most in-depth analysis to date by the White House on the impact of AI on the US workforce. It finds that workers with less education and lower income are especially exposed to AI, raising the risk that the technology could amplify inequality.
    

            The findings are part of the Council of Economic Advisers’ annual Economic Report of the President, which devotes an entire chapter to AI and how policymakers should respond.

            “If we were thinking about this in health terms we would be saying: Who is most likely to catch the virus and what can we do to vaccinate them?” Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN in an interview.
    

            The report shows how White House officials are thinking deeply about AI and what can be done now to guide its development in a way that ultimately benefits workers.
    

            “There have been developments in social media and technology that governments have underattended to as they evolved. We won’t let that happen with AI,” Bernstein said.
    

            Bernstein said the White House is in discussions with labor unions — especially in the service industry but also in manufacturing — about being ready for AI.
    

            As with any kind of new technology, experts believe AI will complement the work of some people by making them more productive. Other jobs could get wiped out.
    

            The White House report contains numerous caveats, including cautioning that the ultimate impact of AI on workers may change as the technology and its capabilities evolve.

            Generative AI is already able to do some tasks that in the past only humans could, such as writing humorous stories, generating realistic images and crafting song lyrics.
    

        20% of workers are in high-exposure AI jobs


            White House economists analyzed the impact on workers by identifying 16 work activities with high exposure to AI. Researchers then tried to determine which occupations have AI-exposed activities that are central to the job itself.
    

            The report found that about 20% of workers are in these high-AI exposure occupations. That finding is similar to one from Pew Research Center that concluded 19% of American workers in 2022 were in jobs most exposed to AI.
    

            “Workers in such occupations are plausibly the ones most likely to be affected by AI, whether positively through complementarity, or negatively through substitution or displacement,” the CEA report said.
    

            But to drill down on which roles are most vulnerable to being displaced, researchers broke out jobs by how difficult the tasks are.
    

            “Labor-substitution is easiest and cheapest in situations where complexity and difficulty are low,” the report said.
    

            In other words, the more complex the job, the safer it is. And vice versa.
    

        Displacing versus complementing workers


            The researchers found that 10% of workers have high AI exposure and low performance requirements.
    

            The report said those workers “perform the tasks that are most likely to change as a result of AI.” It did not identify specific occupations or industries that fall into this category.
    

            However, researchers stressed that this does not mean 10% of workers “will inevitably lose their jobs” as the implications for workers may be “quite nuanced.”
    

            “Most jobs remain a collection of tasks of which only a portion can be automated,” the report said. “AI may allow humans to focus on other tasks, fundamentally changing their jobs without reducing the use of their labor.”
    

            As an example, the White House economists point to how even if AI eventually allows school buses to drive themselves, the school bus driver’s job won’t necessarily be killed.
    

            “Children may still need someone on the bus to watch them, ensure they behave and ensure they enter and exit safely,” the report said. “AI-led automation might fundamentally change the school bus driver’s job, but it is unlikely to eliminate the job.”
    

            The report notes that airlines still have pilots even though autopilot systems have been around for more than a century.
    

            “The wrong place to start a discussion of AI is to assume without question it will massively displace workers. That’s not the history of technology in the workplace,” Bernstein said.
    

        AI could worsen inequality


            Still, some workers are more exposed to AI than others.
    

            The White House report found that 14% of high school graduates lacking four-year degrees have jobs that have high-AI exposure but low performance requirements. By comparison, only 6% of workers with a bachelor’s degree fall into that higher risk bucket.
    

            Likewise, women are more likely to have high AI exposure with low performance requirements, the report said, “suggesting that women may be at higher risk of displacement.”
    

            Lower-income workers may also face greater risks from AI disruption.
    

            The report found that nearly 40% of workers in the third decile of earnings have high-AI exposure and low performance requirements. High-earnings also have high exposure to AI but their job requirements are more complex.
    

            The findings “suggest that AI may be a skill-biased technology, increasing relative demand for workers with high levels of education in high-earning occupations,” the report said. “They also suggest that AI could exacerbate aggregate income inequality if it substitutes for employment in lower-wage jobs and complements higher-wage jobs.”
    

            The International Monetary Fund warned earlier this year that in most scenarios, AI will “likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions.”
    

            However, the White House report stressed that it’s too early to definitively say AI will worsen inequality — in part because this risk may influence policy.
    

            Bernstein said the Biden administration wants to implement policies that will lower the risk that AI displaces workers.
    

            “There is always technology afoot, but society has the level of inequality that policymakers are willing to accept,” he said. “We’re not going to let technological developments determine inequality.”

In fact, computer programs designed to simulate human intelligence have been around since the 1940s. From the early stages, we’ve dreamed of computers doing everyday human tasks, from filing taxes to writing poetry.
We’re seeing rapid innovation in AI technologies as they’ve finally become good enough to provide broad business and personal value. Today’s AI boom results from a string of 21st-century breakthroughs that culminated with the 2022 release of ChatGPT, the first publicly available AI content creation tool to survive the testing phase.Click here to start selling online now with Shopify
Tools like ChatGPT are unique for their ability to create high-quality written and visual responses, known as generative AI. Here’s what you need to know about generative AI technology—including what it is, how it works, and how business owners use it to increase efficiency, improve products and services, and reduce costs.
What is generative AI?
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) refers to any machine learning model you can use to create new content, including text, images, video, audio, or software code.
Generative AI models differ from non-generative (or “discriminative”) models in their ability to create unique content:


Discriminative models. Discriminative models are designed to distinguish between types of information. They spot patterns that separate data classes, enabling high-quality predictions or suggestions.



Generative models. Generative models are designed to produce new content by learning from a large existing dataset. For example, they spot patterns in written works to predict the most likely sequence of words that will generate a human-like response.

An AI tool that can write a unique blog post based on user inputs is an example of generative AI technology. By contrast, a tool that analyzes inventory and sales to predict future manufacturing needs is an example of a discriminatory AI tool.

How does generative AI work?
Generative AI systems work by processing large amounts of existing data and using that information to create new content. Essentially, developers create an algorithm, feed it human-generated content, and instruct it to identify patterns in thetraining data.The result is a collection of rules that express patterns consistent throughout human-generated content, and these rules guide the AI in creating new content.
Developers of generative AI models create these systems using a specific type of machine learning known as deep learning. Machine learning models capable of deep learing use particularly complex algorithms that extract high levels of information from source data.
Historically, AI trainers have relied on supervised learning techniques, which involve feeding a generative AI model large volumes of manually labeled data. One consequential breakthrough is the development of algorithms that can self-train using unlabeled data, a process known as unsupervised learning.
Unsupervised learning eliminates the need for developers to label their own data, allowing them to train tools on larger volumes of source information. As the size of training data sets increases, AI models become more accurate and capable.

Common applications for generative AI

Text generation
Image generation
Product discovery
Research and analysis
Customer service
Marketing personalization

Generative AI tools can support a range of business processes. Here are common applications:
1. Text generation
Many generative AI models support written content creation. AI writing tools like ChatGPT can generate content including emails, social media posts, press releases, video scripts, stories—and essentially any other type of written content reflected in its training data set.
Many can also generate code and synthetic data—artificially generated information that mimics real-world data but doesn’t directly come from actual events or measurements. Some tools also include transcription and speech generation functions.
2. Image generation
You can use generative AI to create visual content. Generative AI tools like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E use natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision technologies to recognize objects and generate realistic images from text or image inputs. They can also transform image styles and edit natural images—images derived from the real world, i.e., not created by algorithms or digital art techniques).
3. Product discovery
Generative AI tools can personalize the product discovery process using conversational search functions to provide intelligent recommendations based on user preferences and behaviors. Media companies like Netflix, for example, use generative AI to provide personalized content recommendations. 
4. Research and analysis
Generative AI tools can help you more efficiently conduct research. They can provide concise summaries of reports and extract and consolidate raw data from multiple sources. They can also efficiently process unstructured data, report on findings, and uncover relevant trends.
5. Customer service
Generative AI chatbots can support customer service functions, handling basic customer queries autonomously and escalating more complex cases to a customer service agent. Integrating generative AI into your customer service program can extend your team’s capacity and boost customer satisfaction.
6. Marketing personalization
Generative AI tools can help you personalize marketing efforts at scale. These tools gather and analyze large amounts of audience information and use the findings to personalize the content of the marketing messages as well as when and where they go out.

Benefits of generative AI

Increased efficiency
Improved accuracy
Reduced costs
Better intelligence

Using generative AI  can save you time and money without requiring a compromise on product or service quality. Here are four key benefits:
Increased efficiency
Generative AI tools produce work quickly. Use them to quickly complete tasks like producing creative content or conducting marketing research so you can focus on higher-level objectives. 
Improved accuracy
Use generative AI tools to reduce human error in quantitative processes like running payroll or analyzing data. Use them to find and fix mistakes in written content and identify discrepancies in large data sets like budgets or financial information. 
Reduced costs
Generative AI tools can extend your team’s capacity, letting you do more without increasing your payroll obligations. They can also analyze and optimize business processes, like inventory management and supply chain logistics, further decreasing business expenses. 
Better intelligence
Generative AI tools can process massive amounts of complex data from a wide range of sources, helping you increase the amount of data you can analyze and improve the quality of your analysis. 
Limitations and risks of generative AI

Inaccuracies
Poor transparency
Bias
Privacy concerns
Sustainability concerns

Here’s an overview of the challenges associated with implementing generative AI in a business context:
Inaccuracies
Generative AI tools can make mistakes. Failing to verify the accuracy and quality of AI information can pose a risk to your business. (ChatGPT even includes this disclaimer under its prompt bar: “ChatGPT can make mistakes. Consider checking important information.”)
Poor transparency
Generative AI tools don’t always disclose how they’ve arrived at a specific answer, making it difficult to vet responses.
Bias
AI tools can reproduce the biases in their training data. For example, one early AI-powered recruiting system penalized female applicants after interpreting the underrepresentation of women in technical fields as evidence that women are less suited to technical work.
Privacy concerns
Information you provide to a generative AI tool isn’t necessarily confidential or secure, so using AI tools to process proprietary data can represent a security risk.
Sustainability concerns
AI tools require massive computing power, translating to significant energy usage that can conflict with your company’s sustainability goals.

Key Points

Experts and the media tend to overestimate technology’s negative impact on employment. Case studies suggest that technology-induced unemployment fears are often exaggerated, evidenced by the McKinsey Global Institute reversing its AI forecasts and the growth in jobs predicted to be at high risk of automation.
Flexible work arrangements, technical recertification, and creative apprenticeship models offer real-time learning and adaptable skills development to prepare workers for future labor market and technological changes.
AI can potentially generate new employment opportunities, but the complex transition for workers displaced by automation—marked by the need for retraining and credentialing—indicates that the productivity benefits may not adequately compensate for job losses, particularly among low-skilled workers.
Instead of resorting to conflictual relationships, labor unions in the US must work with employers to support firm automation while simultaneously advocating for worker skill development, creating a competitive business enterprise built on strong worker representation similar to that found in Germany.

Introduction
The Workforce Futures Initiative is a research collaboration among the American Enterprise Institute, the Brookings Institution, and the Project on Workforce at Harvard Kennedy School’s Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy. The initiative aims to develop concise and actionable reviews of existing research for federal, state, and local policymakers. Since August 2021, the group has provided a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss policy ideas, evaluate evidence, and identify priorities for new research on the future of work and the public workforce system.
In the first report, Beyond the Turing Test: Harnessing AI to Create Widely Shared Prosperity, Erik Brynjolfsson revises his view on AI, criticizing the Turing Test for equating human mimicry with intelligence and warning against economic consequences. He argues that true technological progress lies in augmenting—not replacing—human capabilities, historically increasing the value of labor. He criticizes the current trend of developing technology that substitutes for human labor, citing misaligned incentives among technologists, entrepreneurs, and policymakers. He advocates for innovation that complements human abilities, exemplified by companies like Cresta, which uses AI to assist, not replace, human operators. Brynjolfsson emphasizes the need for policy changes—such as equal taxation of capital and labor—to encourage such human-centered technology, arguing that the future of work depends on our choices regarding technology’s role in the labor market.
In the second report, We Can’t Predict the Future of Work, Adam Thierer explores the skepticism surrounding predictions about technology’s impact on employment. Highlighting the tendency for overly pessimistic forecasts, he challenges the accuracy of such predictions with historical data. As examples of this overestimation, Thierer cites the recalibration of AI-related job loss estimates and the unexpected growth in certain job sectors. His report emphasizes the complexity of predicting future jobs and skills, advocating for flexible, adaptive workforce development rather than rigid government programs to navigate the evolving technological landscape.
In the final report, Automation, AI, and Wages, Daron Acemoglu examines the debate on automation and AI’s impact on job creation and productivity. While some, such as The Economist and the McKinsey Global Institute, view AI as a driver of new jobs and growth, others express concerns about its potential to cause job loss and exacerbate inequality. Acemoglu argues that automation has not significantly increased productivity or jobs to offset losses. He highlights automation’s limited success in creating good jobs and the growing inequality in labor markets, partly attributed to automation. He scrutinizes AI’s role in the labor market, suggesting cautious adoption to avoid negative outcomes. His introduction also touches on the need for complementary investments and a balanced approach to leveraging automation and AI for society’s benefit.

The following article was originally published by AI at Wharton.
When deployed correctly, generative artificial intelligence can help employees become more innovative, free them from mundane tasks, and improve their communication skills.
That’s the message from three scholars who shared their research during the “AI Horizons” webinar, “AI and the Workforce” which streamed live on February 16. The webinar series is hosted by AI at Wharton to showcase emerging knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence.
Each panelist presented research on a distinct aspect of labor, yet the overarching theme was clear: Rather than fearing AI as a threat to human capital, it can help employees bring their best selves to work.
For example, allowing AI to perform repetitive banal tasks boosts employee morale. A co-authored study by Xueming Luo, marketing professor at Temple University’s Fox School of Business, found that when chatbots and voice-assisted AI handled low-level customer service calls at a telemarketing company, the employees showed greater commitment and ingenuity with callers who had complex requests.

“They have a stronger interest and motivation. They feel much better, even their pride is higher. They have more energy because they have more mental power to think about creative solutions,” Luo said.
The study also found that highly-skilled workers feel more positively about AI because it can help them achieve more, whereas lower-skilled workers feel more negatively about being limited by AI-enabled scripts.
Luo said that difference is a key takeaway: employers need to communicate clearly to employees the intended use for AI.
“Lower-skilled workers always feel threatened that the company is rolling out technology that is going to lay them off,” he said. “The company should indicate that the technology can be used to help [employees perform better].”
A co-authored study from Cedric Xingchen Xu, doctoral researcher at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business, showed how the release of ChatGPT prompted a significant decline in the number of freelance jobs posted in an online marketplace. With competition intensifying, freelancers who are incorporating large language models (LLMs) into their services are reaping the benefits.
“Instead of viewing AI as a threat to human capital, employers, employees, and gig workers should consider leveraging AI to excel at work.”— Mary Purk
“They are getting more transactions over time compared with other people, so there’s clearly opportunity,” Xu said. In the paper, the co-authors recommended that gig platforms and policymakers provide resources to help freelancers adapt and thrive in the changing market.
Some job applicants are writing better resumés with the help of LLMs. A co-authored research study from Emma Wiles, doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that candidates who utilized “algorithmic writing help” on their resumés were hired 8% more often than those who did not.
Wiles said the curve will flatten as more and more job-seekers use such tools to polish their resumes, and interviews will become more critical to the hiring process in the future.
“As AI-enhanced or generated writing materials become more common, writing is likely to become an even less reliable signal of job performance,” she said.
Mary Purk, executive director of AI at Wharton and moderator of the discussion, said the research presented by the scholars demonstrates the deep impact AI will have on hiring, retention, productivity, creativity, and job satisfaction.
“Admittedly, AI is a disruptor in the marketplace. But instead of viewing AI as a threat to human capital, employers, employees, and gig workers should consider leveraging AI to excel at work. By delegating repetitive, boring tasks to AI, we can increase morale and energy and allow individuals to focus on tasks that truly showcase their capabilities.”

Job interview analysis platform Sapia launches generative AI chatbot to explain its hiring decisions

Sapia.ai founder and CEO Barb Hyman 







 



The next time you go for a job interview at Woolies or Qantas, you may end up with generative AI not only telling you how you did, but also offering advice on how to perform better next time.
Melbourne recruitment startup Sapia.ai has launched a generative AI model it’s called SAIGE to give candidate feedback. It uses the platform’s large language model (LLM) capabilities developed over six years, to evaluate candidates using a blind chat interview, then deliver comprehensive scoring along with a set of job-related competencies, including explanations for its assessments, with the ability coach candidates as to how they can improve, or say what it was looking for to give a higher score for a particular skill or trait.
Sapia, which launched in 2018 and raised $17 million in a Series A from Woolworths and Macquarie Capital in late 2022, has used artificial intelligence (AI) to build a hiring analysis data set from more than 3.5 million job interviews spanning 15 million answers and 2 billion words.
The platform combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to build a job candidate’s HEXACO (for Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience) personality profile, alongside analysing their role-based skills, behaviours, experience and more, also sharing those findings with the person involved.
Companies, including Woolworths, Qantas,  Suncorp, Starbucks Australia, Holland & Barrett, and BT Openreach, use Sapia as part of the initial screening process for recruitment.AdChoicesADVERTISING
Sapia.ai founder and CEO Barb Hyman said SAIGE has been trained through the use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to ensure candidates are assessed accurately, fairly, and in a way that mitigates human biases.
“We have been on a mission to humanise the way people are evaluated, and SAIGE is the next step in this journey. As much as ChatGPT was a revolution in the way we interact with AI, SAIGE is a quantum leap in the way people will be assessed and coached,” she said.
“Structured interviews have been proven to lead to better hiring outcomes and reduce bias in the selection process. Now with SAIGE organisations have a way to consistently interview and evaluate at scale using a rubric set by experts, and also generate detailed interview notes. What we are really excited about is the potential SAIGE has on providing coaching to hiring managers and new employees on setting them up for success.”
Sapia.ai chief data scientist of  Dr Buddhi Jayatilleke said that as well as detecting and assessing the skills and traits employers require for various roles, the platform can adapt over time and be trained to look for particular requirements for each role and organisation.
“A unique power of these LLMs is their ability to explain themselves,” he said.
“SAIGE is bringing this level of transparency that is imperative for the responsible use of AI and especially in people decisions, such as who to hire and promote, helping to reduce the unconscious bias we see in human-led decision making.”
Every job candidate receives an individual insights report detailing their strengths, their work style, and personalised coaching. Hyman said the low-pressure chat used by Sapia gives potential hires a chance to shine and the subsequent feedback means unsuccessful candidates feel seen.

(Markus Schreiber/AP) By  Eduardo PorterMarch 19, 2024 at 6:30 a.m. EDTThere is good reason to believe that artificial intelligence is coming for our jobs. That’s, after all, what information technology has been doing for decades. The tech plutocrats apparently agree that human employment will become the stuff of folklore. They probably don’t mind that all wealth in this world will accrue to the lucky few who own the AI patents. They seem willing to share some of it with regular people through some universal basic income scheme.Sign up for Democracy, Refreshed, a newsletter series on how to renovate the republic.Artificial general intelligence, the end goal Silicon Valley technologists are striving for, is defined in the charter of OpenAI, the outfit that developed ChatGPT and DALL-E, as “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.” Elon Musk has concluded that “there will come a point where no job is needed.”But work as we know it doesn’t have to end this way. The sense of inevitability about our technological future stems from a misunderstanding of how technologies emerge and become embedded in the economy. The process is not driven by the laws of nature. It hinges on political decisions that can lead to vastly different outcomes. North Korea devoted its nuclear knowledge to weapons; Japan deployed it to produce electric power.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSo far, the march of computers into the workplace has furthered Musk’s vision. Automation powered by information technology has spread to take over every task that could be decomposed into a defined set of precise instructions, displacing swaths of blue-collar workers.AI could feasibly push automation even further. But it could also reshuffle opportunity in a different direction. As Daron Acemoglu, David Autor and Simon Johnson of MIT have pointed out, it could be deployed not to replace human workers but to augment them, enabling them to perform more complex tasks.Follow this authorEduardo Porter's opinionsFollowExamples of this alternative abound. For instance, research by economists at Stanford University and MIT found that a generative AI conversational assistant substantially increased the productivity of customer support agents (measured in cases resolved per hour) and improved consumer satisfaction. The gains were greatest among the most novice workers.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOn the other end of the wage spectrum, computer programmers have also been found to benefit from AI help. In an experiment by researchers at Microsoft, GitHub and MIT, coders who used the AI tool GitHub Copilot completed programming tasks 56 percent faster.It’s hard to understate how much human enhancement via AI tools could reshape society. The vast inequalities in income and opportunity that automation has given us so far could be significantly reduced.Computers didn’t just automate routine, blue-collar work. By vastly expanding access to information, computers plugged into the internet empowered the expert white-collar workers who could profitably use it. Doctors, programmers, lawyers — broadly, workers with college degrees — reaped the rewards, leaving behind a host of less-educated workers whose jobs have progressively been taken over by the machines.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAI could narrow the opportunity gap by helping lower-ranked workers take on decision-making tasks currently reserved for the dominant credentialed elites.Consider how old-school IT tools such as electronic medical records have allowed nurse practitioners to make more complex decisions encroaching on doctors’ turf — much to the chagrin of the American Medical Association. Generative AI could take this further, allowing nurses and medical technicians to diagnose, prescribe courses of treatment and channel patients to specialized care.As Autor put it, “AI, if used well, can assist with restoring the middle-skill, middle-class heart of the U.S. labor market that has been hollowed out by automation and globalization.”Story continues below advertisementCan the deployment of artificial intelligence be nudged in this direction? It would require a different approach to technology, both by policymakers and the corporate class. “The human-complementary approach is not likely to prevail based on current investments and corporate attitudes,” Acemoglu, Autor and Johnson say.AdvertisementCorporate managers today itch to bring in the robots, even when the machines often don’t do much to improve productivity. Perhaps it’s because they don’t agitate to join unions? In any event, policy could rejigger corporate incentives. Changing the tax code, which vastly favors capital investment over hiring new workers, would level the playing field and temper incentives to automate.Acemoglu, Autor and Johnson argue for giving unions a voice on how to deploy the new technologies in the workforce. Regulations could stop companies from deploying untested AI in tasks like hiring or surveillance — areas where technology already is degrading and devaluing work. Incentives could be provided to change the research agenda, which today is acutely focused on automation, to explore complementary uses of AI instead.Story continues below advertisementThis requires a conceptual challenge: a paradigm of technological development that has long focused on replacing human capabilities must cede its place to a mind-set concentrated on how to expand human potential.The stakes are high. As Stanford’s Erik Brynjolfsson wrote, AI could well generate enormous wealth and vastly enhance our understanding of the world. But if technology continues to replace people, the end game includes a working class of no economic or political power, unable to improve its lot, left to live off whatever universal basic income the Silicon Valley plutocrats are willing to provide.Share148 CommentsPopular opinions articlesHAND CURATEDOpinion|Harris has not been a great politician.

Davy Levy, vice president of AWS worldwide public sector, delivers the keynote at the Brussels Public Sector Symposium on 12 March.

On 12 March, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Public Sector Symposium Brussels returned to the Brussels Expo in Belgium. The no cost, in-person conference gathered cloud enthusiasts interested in the public sector for a day dedicated to deepening knowledge of how the cloud and generative artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming organizations and businesses around the world.
Central to the event were the themes of generative AI, sustainability, security, and—importantly for Europe—digital sovereignty.
Yaara Tam, head of multinational organizations, and Barbara Baeyens, head of Benelux, announced the launch of new AWS learning plans for civil servants, specifically designed for European Union (EU) government agencies to help government employees build cloud skills and accelerate digital transformation.
In his keynote, Dave Levy, vice president of AWS worldwide public sector, said, “We’re here today because of our commitment to the region, serving you with the solutions and technology you need to improve the lives of your citizens, students, customers, and constituents.” Levy highlighted how AWS is helping customers use generative AI in a responsible and flexible way, providing more options to enable digital sovereignty through the upcoming AWS European Sovereign Cloud, and showing dedication to data protection and privacy, sustainability, and social impact. Customer speakers from bpostgroup and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shared stories about how they use the cloud to drive impact for their missions.
Read this post for more key takeaways from the Brussels Symposium.
Building a strong data foundation
Secure, reliable, and scalable cloud infrastructure helps public sector organizations to innovate quickly while meeting strict security and compliance requirements. AWS enables customers to get the most value from data by providing a comprehensive set of integrated tools and robust governance capabilities that balance access and control. Customers such as Belgian broadcaster RTBF use AWS data services like Amazon Redshift and AWS Glue to power personalized content recommendations for millions of customers across its media platforms.
Wendy Joos, chief data officer of bpostgroup, spoke of the value of data and her company’s digital journey. “We wanted a platform that allowed us to do more with our data,” said Joos, who explained how bpostgroup is using data models to ensure timely delivery, and digital twins to preempt problems, such as in sorting centers, and with distribution rounds.
Generative AI opportunities and challenges
Generative AI allows anyone to leverage machine learning (ML) capabilities using natural language. When users can search, analyze, and draw conclusions in seconds—from information across their organization or the internet—they can make informed decisions at speed. This can help answer customer queries efficiently, pinpoint changes to contracts, and accurately assess risks such as fraud. A newly commissioned AWS European study, Accelerating AI Skills: Preparing the Workforce for Jobs of the Future, focuses on organizations rapidly adopting generative AI. This research found that almost 90 percent of employees expect to benefit from generative AI in the workplace by 2028.
AWS provides the most comprehensive set of capabilities across the three layers of the generative AI stack. The bottom layer is the infrastructure required to train and run large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models (FMs). The middle layer is where you build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models. At the top layer live the applications that leverage LLMs and other FMs so that employees can utilize generative AI at work.
At the bottom layer of the generative AI stack, it is vital to have high quality, up-to-date data for training the models. A critical step to achieving this is moving data to the cloud. The Technology Innovation Institute (TII) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) worked with us to build their models. They launched Falcon LLMs, three foundational large language models, to facilitate research in healthcare, finance, education, and more.
The middle layer lets you build and scale applications using leading FMs like Anthropic’s Claude 3. Customers choose the best model for their use case, while maintaining enterprise-grade security, privacy, and access control. AWS enables government agencies and regulated industries to experiment and innovate in a secure, compliant manner.
Swindon Borough Council, a UK local authority, uses Amazon Bedrock to make government information more accessible to the learning disability community. They created a solution that makes complex documents more accessible, enabling a community where no one is disadvantaged.
And at the top of the generative AI stack is Amazon Q, for organizations who want an assistant to enhance productivity and decision-making. “When you chat with Q, it provides immediate, relevant, and actionable information and advice to help streamline tasks, speed decision-making, and help spark creativity,” said Dominic Delmolino, vice president of technology for AWS worldwide public sector, who presented a demo during Levy’s keynote. 
Responsible AI mitigating the risks
Organizations that use generative AI must build responsible AI systems that are fair, explainable, robust, secure, transparent, and safeguard privacy. Good governance is fundamental for responsible systems. It’s important to be able to justify how these process-support systems arrived at choices. AWS is committed to responsible AI development and deployment, and welcomes the overarching goal of the EU’s AI Act to ensure trust in AI products and services. We recently launched Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock (Preview), which helps customers implement responsible AI policies when building generative AI applications. AWS is focused on collaborating with regulators and the industry to support the safe, secure, and ethical advancement of AI technology.
Digital sovereignty without compromise
Globally, 82 percent of organizations are using, planning to use, or considering sovereign cloud solutions in the next two years, according to marketing intelligence firm IDC. 
AWS has always been sovereign-by-design. We committed to expanding our capabilities to allow customers to meet their digital sovereignty needs, without compromising on the performance, innovation, security, or scale of the AWS Cloud. The upcoming AWS European Sovereign Cloud will allow government agencies, regulated industries, and the independent software vendors (ISVs) that support them, to store sensitive data and run critical workloads on AWS infrastructure that is operated and supported by AWS employees located in and residents of the EU. It will be separate from, and independent of, the eight existing AWS Regions already open in Europe, and will give additional options for deployment, while providing the AWS services, APIs, and tools that customers are already familiar with. The design will help customers meet their data residency, operational autonomy, and resiliency needs.
Sustainability in the cloud
There is increased recognition that sustainability cannot be a siloed approach within an organization. With government-mandated climate action targets, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting requirements, and demands from consumers on the environmental and social impact of goods and services, sustainability should be intrinsically linked with each organization’s value proposition.
AWS offers capabilities to help customers innovate while reducing costs and carbon emissions. Amazon has a goal to reach net-zero by 2040 and is on a path to match all of our global electricity use, including AWS data centers, with 100 percent renewable energy by 2025 – five years ahead of our original 2030 target. Since 2020, we are the largest corporate purchaser of renewable in Europe and worldwide. AWS is on track to be water positive by 2030 through water replenishment projects, with a current rate of 3.9 billion liters returned to communities annually.
AWS is working with WindEurope to simplify renewable energy project permitting through an online portal called EasyPermits. In the Denmark pilot case, EasyPermits reportedly enabled concurrent processing of up to three times as many permit applications through transparency and information management, as well as a 50 percent reduction in administrative workload.
Conclusion
Throughout the day, the event provided opportunities for conversations between members of the innovative and creative public sector community. And as Francesca Duri, chief technology officer of WIPO said, “The true value of good technology unveils beyond the expected benefits.”

Apple’s work on advanced artificial intelligence integrations in its products is continuing to pick up pace, with a newly published paper from its research teams revealing the iPhone maker’s work on MM1, a suite of Multimodal Large Language Models.The paper, titled ‘MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training’ discusses “building performant Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),” and how “pre-training using a careful mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art few-shot results across multiple benchmarks, compared to other published pre-training results.”It’s a pretty jargon-filled paper, but at its essence, it describes how Multimodal Large Language Models can produce more advanced and accurate workflows for AI applications by pulling from multiple datasets at once — not just text, but imagery too, as well as potentially audio and video sources.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksBarefoot VitalityThese Barefoot Shoes are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarefoot VitalityBuy NowMM1 is able to interpret information across 30 billion parameters, and as a result, can

“achieve competitive performance after supervised fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks.” The researchers call MLLM “the next frontier in foundation models”, with “superior capabilities” to the large language models that have fuelled the breakthrough wave of AI tools in recent months and years.LATEST VIDEOS FROM imoreIMoreApple’s AI ambitionsHowever, MM1 remains behind closed doors for now, and there’s no guarantee it’ll ever morph into a consumer-facing product, even if the lessons learned from it find their way into other applications of AI.At present, we know that Apple is doubling down on its AI plans, following shareholder pressure that may have inadvertently led to the cancellation of its driverless Apple car project. In response to shareholder unrest, CEO Tim Cook stated that Apple will “break new ground” in AI, unlocking “transformative opportunities” for users.Its efforts so far focus on a $1 billion research and development push for a large language model named Ajax, with the company also purchasing a Canadian artificial intelligence startup called DarwinAI.Master your iPhone in minutesiMore offers spot-on advice and guidance from our team of experts, with decades of Apple device experience to lean on.

Generative AI holds great promise, but must be applied safely, with strong guardrails; PDRI will share results with the industry in peer-reviewed journals

ARLINGTON, Va.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–PDRI by Pearson (FTSE: PSON.L), a workforce assessment provider that transforms evidence-based insights into talent management solutions, today announced it will be leading a new research program to explore the applications of generative AI in the development and use of assessments. PDRI will use the findings to enhance its assessment solutions and will release the results to educate industry stakeholders on best practices for the use of generative AI in assessment.

“Generative AI shows great promise to improve assessment development, quality and fairness but it’s a young, powerful technology that contains many unknowns,” said Elaine Pulakos, PhD, CEO at PDRI. “The use of generative AI in assessment needs to be based on rigorous scientific research and adhere to professional and legal standards for the development and use of assessments. We are undertaking this research program to help the industry leverage generative AI to advance our profession, but without compromising the long legacy of scientific and professional rigor that PDRI is known for.”






PDRI’s research will explore how generative AI can be used to elevate the quality and streamline the development of assessment content, improve assessment scoring methods, and diminish the potential for bias and unfairness in assessment processes. Another aspect of PDRI’s research program will investigate advanced security techniques, some of which may be powered by generative AI, to protect test content, reduce the potential for cheating (including generative AI-based cheating), and identify security vulnerabilities.

Most HR professionals believe they will fall behind if they don’t adopt AI solutions within the next 12 to 24 months, according to Gartner. But there’s also a lot of concern about incurring unknown risks and security vulnerabilities. Poor use of AI in hiring has hurt the reputations of employers, impaired their ability to attract talent, violated legal and professional guidelines, and unfairly shut out qualified candidates from jobs in which they could excel.
- A message from our partner -

PDRI believes there is significant promise and opportunity to overcome challenges associated with AI. Through new research that applies psychological and psychometric theory to the use of generative AI in assessment development and use, PDRI will help create evidence-based methods the industry can adopt to ensure organizations are implementing and adhering to the highest standards of psychological testing. This commitment aims to guide the ways in which AI is used in selection processes within the established frameworks of professional and ethical testing guidelines.

PDRI Principal Scientist Dr. Dan Segall will lead the research program. Segall is a well-regarded, expert psychometrician who previously led one of the world’s largest and most scientifically advanced employment testing programs in the U.S. Department of Defense.

Charted: The Jobs Most Impacted by AI
This was originally posted on our Voronoi app. Download the app for free on iOS or Android and discover incredible data-driven charts from a variety of trusted sources.
Large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI tools haven’t been around for very long, but they’re expected to have far-reaching impacts on the way people do their jobs. With this in mind, researchers have already begun studying the potential impacts of this transformative technology.
In this graphic, we’ve visualized the results of a World Economic Forum report, which estimated how different job departments will be exposed to AI disruption.

Data and Methodology
To identify the job departments most impacted by AI, researchers assessed over 19,000 occupational tasks (e.g. reading documents) to determine if they relied on language. If a task was deemed language-based, it was then determined how much human involvement was needed to complete that task.
With this analysis, researchers were then able to estimate how AI would impact different occupational groups.

Supply Chain431839




In our graphic, large impact refers to tasks that will be fully automated or significantly altered by AI technologies. Small impact refers to tasks that have a lesser potential for disruption.

Where AI will make the biggest impact
Jobs in information technology (IT) and finance have the highest share of tasks expected to be largely impacted by AI. 
Within IT, tasks that are expected to be automated include software quality assurance and customer support. On the finance side, researchers believe that AI could be significantly useful for bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing.

Print        For the thousands of tech workers recently laid off in California and across the country, the future may not be as bleak as it looks right now: Many are likely to retrain fairly quickly for new jobs in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence.The massive rounds of layoffs at tech giants and many smaller companies were largely the result of stricter investor demands — what managers saw as over-hiring during the pandemic and a stock market that rewarded those personnel cuts. But the industry also was clearing the way to focus on AI, which is expected to revolutionize computer-related technology and work in the years ahead — even as it displaces  jobs, previously handled by humans,  in areas as varied  as coding and background acting. Not only  is AI taking over more standard computer programming once done entirely by humans, it  is also starting to spur waves of new applications — and with them, jobs, both tech and non-tech, in a wide range of industries, including in Southern California.      “A lot of tech companies are actually monetizing the AI solution,” says Jenn Longnion, founder of See & Free Consulting.  (Michael Owen Baker / For The Times)   “What we’re seeing is a lot of tech companies are actually monetizing the AI solution,” said Jenn Longnion, the Los Angeles-based founder of See & Free Consulting, which helps businesses grow sustainably. “They’ve had AI for a very long time. But they’re finding ways now to monetize that and actually promote that and sell that as a solution to other businesses. ... Every industry is now having those conversations.”Job postings in the U.S. that specifically mention   AI, though still a tiny fraction of all openings, were up by 13% in February from a year ago, even as software development was off more than 30%, according to the employment website Indeed. Silicon Valley, where most of the AI action is today, figures to lead the way. In February, 9% of companies in the Bay Area said they already use AI, compared with a little more than  5% in the U.S. as a whole, according to the Census Bureau. The share of Los Angeles-area companies wasn’t significantly higher than the national average, but about 8% of firms in the Southland said they expected to adopt AI in the next six months. In Silicon Beach, which has emerged as a home for companies focusing on AI and augmented reality, firms are hiring for hundreds of AI-related jobs, including  content writers and software developers who will train the technology.Tom Case, a founder at Atticus Growth Partners, a tech recruiting firm in San Francisco, said the proliferation of AI entrepreneurs and startups translates into more jobs. In the last few years, companies have been hiring primarily for research labs, he said, but the industry is beginning to move from AI models to getting them into production.“We’re in an almost gold rush where everybody’s building an AI company model,” he said. “Very little AI is deployed in production. ... At the moment, it feels like the dawn of job creation.” Advertisement    After pivoting her startup from business operations software to customer service ticketing through AI,  Sophie Wyne saw interest skyrocket.“I actually have never seen this amount of interest before for a product,” said Wyne, founder and chief executive of Ariglad in San Francisco. “It’s really just combining two things which people are really caring about. One is AI — I think everyone’s really interested in how can that actually help my day-to-day in reality and not be so abstract. And the other side is, I just hate updating my knowledge base.”Among the hundreds of AI startups looking for talent is Quest Labs, a Bay Area firm co-founded by Debparna Pratiher. The 27-year-old previously worked as a product manager at Nvidia, the highly publicized Silicon Valley supplier of chips used in gaming and other high-performance computing, particularly AI.Pratiher is an alumnus of UC Davis and Carnegie Mellon University. Her firm, with seed money from Techstars and Afore Capital,  has a staff of about 20. The business has been moving quickly  to build data sets for ecommerce as Google has started to phase out third-party cookies, which  track and learn what users are doing online. “If cookies are gone, you’re blind to consumers,” Pratiher said.She said she’s had difficulty finding qualified data scientists and other AI engineers with deep experience in machine  learning. “For all the AI hype and interest, buyers need to adopt the technology, and for that, they need better data,” Pratiher said. Advertisement    For those recently laid off, getting up to speed on Python, the popular programming language, and other in-demand AI skills isn’t as daunting as one might think. Some skills, such as learning  programming languages and databases to build AI models, might take a matter of weeks for IT workers.        Business   Quiet quitting. RTO. Coffee badging. What this new vocabulary says about your workplace  Phrases such as “Great Resignation,” “quiet quitting” and “coffee badging” have taken the internet by storm. But the terms also show workers trying to exert power.March 4, 2024  Even those with little or no experience in tech have been able to pivot.Shakil Kamran attended a Salesforce conference in 2017, set on trying to break into tech and transition out of his retail management career, which regularly involved 60-hour weeks and left little time to spend with his  son.      Shakil Kamran was in retail management before taking classes through online learning platform Trailhead and pivoting to a tech job. (Shakil Kamran)   He took courses through Trailhead, San Francisco-based Salesforce’s online learning platform, increased his skills and began seeing AI as the future. Today, Kamran, 37, is a Salesforce consultant and focuses on helping organizations use AI to help their business grow. “AI is going to help us. It’s going to assist us in growing and becoming more effective and efficient,” said Kamran, who lives in Connecticut. “It’s going to supercharge our lives.”Others are following Kamran’s lead. Trailhead expanded its AI curriculum last year to include 43  “badges” that are earned by completing courses. So far, users have tallied more than 1.1 million  badges, said Ann Weeby, senior vice president of Trailhead.“We’re seeing employees from every level, in every type of business ... jump in and start learning, because they want to apply generative AI to their business yesterday,” Weeby said.        Business   Why ‘economic headwinds’ are suddenly to blame for everything  Batten down the hatches: We’re facing “economic headwinds.” Why are so many corporate leaders suddenly using this euphemism when announcing layoffs?March 13, 2024  For their part, many universities are  pivoting to incorporate  AI in courses on computer science and other disciplines.“It’s not a death knell,” said Charles Lee Isbell Jr., who studied at MIT’s AI Lab  and recently became provost at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Advertisement     Isbell is pushing for  classroom emphasis on AI data-driven simulations and so-called deep learning, which uses multiple layers of what are called “artificial neural networks” —  complex algorithms designed to mimic the human brain to generate new data.“Coding and programming aren’t going away,” he said.         Awards   Strikes, streaming and AI: Hollywood executives debate the issues that defined a wild 2023  The Times spoke to Nicole Brown of TriStar Pictures; Sam Register of Warner Bros. Animation; Jonathan Glickman of Panoramic Media Co.; Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment; FredAnthony Smith of SMAC Entertainment and Chris Hart of United Talent AgencyJan. 2, 2024   Tech layoffs have slowed from last year’s frenetic pace, but they remain substantial. More than 28,000 job cuts by tech firms nationwide were announced in the first two months of this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement and research firm. Only a few hundred of those layoffs were explicitly attributed to AI, but thousands more cuts in tech and other industries were said to be the result of “updating or incorporating new technology,” Challenger said.  It noted that some of that may be companies overhauling budgets and staffing to make room for  AI work.Although AI may not be directly responsible for most of the tech sector’s job cuts, companies are realizing that greater utilization of AI could mean they don’t have to rehire for some positions, or that they can transition parts of those jobs over to the new technology, said Longnion of See & Free Consulting.Background actors expressed  fears during last summer’s strike that AI technology would be used to replace their jobs. Their new contract secured  rules to guard against that. Data from  Layoffs.fyi show that a growing number of layoffs have hit software developers, also known as coders, who — after decades of disrupting other industries and other workers’ jobs with their programs —  find themselves victims. Advertisement    In recent months, hundreds of coders and other IT specialists have been let go by tech giants  Google, Meta and Apple, as well as many smaller industry-focused digital platforms and cloud services, including Toast (restaurants), Flexport (logistics) and Block (financial services).Many of the  layoffs have come in the Bay Area, putting a pause to two decades of growth at California’s computer-systems design firms and related services. Most of the cuts probably reflect a pullback after excessive pandemic-driven hiring, due in part  to ecommerce and remote work.But the correction may be ending soon, as new tech jobs come into view and workers adjust.Ayanna Howard, a robotics expert and dean of the engineering college at Ohio State University, said it wasn’t  long ago  that coding was all the rage, and people were flocking to computer boot camps.  She remembers how hard it once was for people to create a website. Now, with AI tools,  you can build one within minutes by simply putting in blocks of information, she noted.AI can also do coding on back-end servers, the side  responsible for storing and organizing data, including  security.But Howard said not all is lost for even low-level coders. “If you’re trained to learn, you can evolve,” she said, just as those who began by using Pascal and BASIC learned to program in Assembly and Python,  used for many machine learning and AI solutions.      Alissa Marr, a product designer, was laid off in February but plans to up her business and problem-solving skills to get a new job that isn’t as affected by AI. (Sean Hayes)   Others are emphasizing the inimitable human touch that AI could never replace.  Since Alissa Marr was laid off last month from an early-stage AI startup, the product designer has mostly focused on building her business acumen and strategic problem-solving ability rather than just retooling her software skills.“Those kinds of things are not something an AI can do,” said Marr, 39, who lives in Providence, R.I. “You need to have a human with expertise and knowledge about the customer and the business problem. There needs to be someone pulling the strings, because it can’t just be automated by AI and just go out as is.”  AI may ultimately lead to a smaller tech workforce, said Howard of Ohio State. But there will also be AI-augmented jobs, as well as new jobs. One position  in high demand is prompt engineer, who designs prompts and other processes to get optimal performance from generative AI tools, whether text or images.A company buying AI conversational programs such as ChatGPT (from OpenAI) or Gemini (from Google) will still need engineers to refine and customize the tools to replicate human-like dialogue suitable for its customers.         Business   Is ChatGPT a marvel or a farce? We interviewed the chatbot to find out  We interviewed ChatGPT, a chatbot that has garnered widespread attention for its ability to mimic human conversation. Then we brought in experts in artificial intelligence and the arts to analyze ChatGPT’s responses.Dec. 9, 2022   “We don’t necessarily know what it is that we need,” Howard said. “But they will come out, and when they do, it’ll be like, ‘Oh, guess what?

The massive rounds of layoffs at tech giants and many smaller companies were largely the result of stricter investor demands — what managers saw as over-hiring during the pandemic and a stock market that rewarded those personnel cuts. But the industry also was clearing the way to focus on AI, which is expected to revolutionize computer-related technology and work in the years ahead — even as it displaces jobs, previously handled by humans, in areas as varied as coding and background acting. Not only is AI taking over more standard computer programming once done entirely by humans, it is also starting to spur waves of new applications — and with them, jobs, both tech and non-tech, in a wide range of industries, including in Southern California. ""What we're seeing is a lot of tech companies are actually monetizing the AI solution,"" said Jenn Longnion, the Los Angeles-based founder of See & Free Consulting, which helps businesses grow sustainably. ""They've had AI for a very long time. But they're finding ways now to monetize that and actually promote that and sell that as a solution to other businesses. ... Every industry is now having those conversations."" Job postings in the U.S. that specifically mention AI, though still a tiny fraction of all openings, were up by 13% in February from a year ago, even as software development was off more than 30%, according to the employment website Indeed. Silicon Valley, where most of the AI action is today, figures to lead the way. In February, 9% of companies in the Bay Area said they already use AI, compared with a little more than 5% in the U.S. as a whole, according to the Census Bureau. The share of Los Angeles-area companies wasn’t significantly higher than the national average, but about 8% of firms in the Southland said they expected to adopt AI in the next six months. In Silicon Beach, which has emerged as a home for companies focusing on AI and augmented reality, firms are hiring for hundreds of AI-related jobs, including content writers and software developers who will train the technology. Tom Case, a founder at Atticus Growth Partners, a tech recruiting firm in San Francisco, said the proliferation of AI entrepreneurs and startups translates into more jobs. In the last few years, companies have been hiring primarily for research labs, he said, but the industry is beginning to move from AI models to getting them into production. “We’re in an almost gold rush where everybody’s building an AI company model,” he said. “Very little AI is deployed in production. ... At the moment, it feels like the dawn of job creation.” After pivoting her startup from business operations software to customer service ticketing through AI, Sophie Wyne saw interest skyrocket. ""I actually have never seen this amount of interest before for a product,"" said Wyne, founder and chief executive of Ariglad in San Francisco. ""It's really just combining two things which people are really caring about. One is AI — I think everyone's really interested in how can that actually help my day-to-day in reality and not be so abstract. And the other side is, I just hate updating my knowledge base."" Among the hundreds of AI startups looking for talent is Quest Labs, a Bay Area firm co-founded by Debparna Pratiher. The 27-year-old previously worked as a product manager at Nvidia, the highly publicized Silicon Valley supplier of chips used in gaming and other high-performance computing, particularly AI. Pratiher is an alumnus of UC Davis and Carnegie Mellon University. Her firm, with seed money from Techstars and Afore Capital, has a staff of about 20. The business has been moving quickly to build data sets for ecommerce as Google has started to phase out third-party cookies, which track and learn what users are doing online. “If cookies are gone, you’re blind to consumers,” Pratiher said. She said she’s had difficulty finding qualified data scientists and other AI engineers with deep experience in machine learning. “For all the AI hype and interest, buyers need to adopt the technology, and for that, they need better data,” Pratiher said. For those recently laid off, getting up to speed on Python, the popular programming language, and other in-demand AI skills isn't as daunting as one might think. Some skills, such as learning programming languages and databases to build AI models, might take a matter of weeks for IT workers. Even those with little or no experience in tech have been able to pivot. Shakil Kamran attended a Salesforce conference in 2017, set on trying to break into tech and transition out of his retail management career, which regularly involved 60-hour weeks and left little time to spend with his son. He took courses through Trailhead, San Francisco-based Salesforce's online learning platform, increased his skills and began seeing AI as the future. Today, Kamran, 37, is a Salesforce consultant and focuses on helping organizations use AI to help their business grow. ""AI is going to help us. It's going to assist us in growing and becoming more effective and efficient,"" said Kamran, who lives in Connecticut. ""It's going to supercharge our lives."" Others are following Kamran's lead. Trailhead expanded its AI curriculum last year to include 43 ""badges"" that are earned by completing courses. So far, users have tallied more than 1.1 million badges, said Ann Weeby, senior vice president of Trailhead. ""We're seeing employees from every level, in every type of business ... jump in and start learning, because they want to apply generative AI to their business yesterday,"" Weeby said. For their part, many universities are pivoting to incorporate AI in courses on computer science and other disciplines. “It’s not a death knell,” said Charles Lee Isbell Jr., who studied at MIT’s AI Lab and recently became provost at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Isbell is pushing for classroom emphasis on AI data-driven simulations and so-called deep learning, which uses multiple layers of what are called ""artificial neural networks"" — complex algorithms designed to mimic the human brain to generate new data. “Coding and programming aren’t going away,” he said. Tech layoffs have slowed from last year’s frenetic pace, but they remain substantial. More than 28,000 job cuts by tech firms nationwide were announced in the first two months of this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement and research firm. Only a few hundred of those layoffs were explicitly attributed to AI, but thousands more cuts in tech and other industries were said to be the result of “updating or incorporating new technology,” Challenger said. It noted that some of that may be companies overhauling budgets and staffing to make room for AI work. Although AI may not be directly responsible for most of the tech sector's job cuts, companies are realizing that greater utilization of AI could mean they don't have to rehire for some positions, or that they can transition parts of those jobs over to the new technology, said Longnion of See & Free Consulting. Background actors expressed fears during last summer's strike that AI technology would be used to replace their jobs. Their new contract secured rules to guard against that. Data from Layoffs.fyi show that a growing number of layoffs have hit software developers, also known as coders, who — after decades of disrupting other industries and other workers’ jobs with their programs — find themselves victims. In recent months, hundreds of coders and other IT specialists have been let go by tech giants Google, Meta and Apple, as well as many smaller industry-focused digital platforms and cloud services, including Toast (restaurants), Flexport (logistics) and Block (financial services). Many of the layoffs have come in the Bay Area, putting a pause to two decades of growth at California’s computer-systems design firms and related services. Most of the cuts probably reflect a pullback after excessive pandemic-driven hiring, due in part to ecommerce and remote work. But the correction may be ending soon, as new tech jobs come into view and workers adjust. Ayanna Howard, a robotics expert and dean of the engineering college at Ohio State University, said it wasn’t long ago that coding was all the rage, and people were flocking to computer boot camps. She remembers how hard it once was for people to create a website. Now, with AI tools, you can build one within minutes by simply putting in blocks of information, she noted. AI can also do coding on back-end servers, the side responsible for storing and organizing data, including security. But Howard said not all is lost for even low-level coders. “If you’re trained to learn, you can evolve,” she said, just as those who began by using Pascal and BASIC learned to program in Assembly and Python, used for many machine learning and AI solutions. Others are emphasizing the inimitable human touch that AI could never replace. Since Alissa Marr was laid off last month from an early-stage AI startup, the product designer has mostly focused on building her business acumen and strategic problem-solving ability rather than just retooling her software skills. ""Those kinds of things are not something an AI can do,"" said Marr, 39, who lives in Providence, R.I. ""You need to have a human with expertise and knowledge about the customer and the business problem. There needs to be someone pulling the strings, because it can't just be automated by AI and just go out as is."" AI may ultimately lead to a smaller tech workforce, said Howard of Ohio State. But there will also be AI-augmented jobs, as well as new jobs. One position in high demand is prompt engineer, who designs prompts and other processes to get optimal performance from generative AI tools, whether text or images. A company buying AI conversational programs such as ChatGPT (from OpenAI) or Gemini (from Google) will still need engineers to refine and customize the tools to replicate human-like dialogue suitable for its customers. “We don’t necessarily know what it is that we need,"" Howard said. ""But they will come out, and when they do, it’ll be like, ‘Oh, guess what? It’s another field.’”",,,,,,,,,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Los Angeles Times', 'productID': 'lanews:all-access'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An open backyard is like a blank canvas.But for some prospective home gardeners, it can be intimidating to know where to start.As artificial intelligence becomes ubiquitous, even matters of nature aren’t off-limits from this technology’s power. Some developers have created AI garden planners to help gardeners decide what, and how, to plant.


AdChoicesADVERTISINGBut how well do they work?To find out, we put two AI garden planners to the test, and then asked LNP | LancasterOnline’s Master Gardener columnist Lois Miklas to review them. Here’s what the planners suggested, and what Miklas liked (and didn’t like) about each option.READ: Full coverage of Progress 2024 [roundup]THE BASIC OPTION: CHATGPTDescription: This is the AI you’ve likely heard of, whether from your grandkids talking about having a conversation with a robot online, or from funny folks on Twitter giving outlandish prompts for screenplays. It’s also free, hence its popularity. We gave ChatGPT this prompt: “Plan a small garden for a beginner in Hardiness Zone 7a,” the hardiness zone that encompasses most of Lancaster County. It replied with an answer instantly.ChatGPT suggested 14 different specific varieties of plants and their benefits. It suggested placing taller plants at the back and shorter ones toward the front; grouping plants with similar water and sunlight requirements; and watering consistently. It also suggested adding a small decorative element, like a garden gnome.

A MASTER GARDENER’S OPINIONWhat it got right: I like the fact that this plan suggested a variety of plants: vegetables, perennials, herbs and shrubs. It gave the gardener a lot to choose from and suggested plants that are commonly available and easy to research. It included botanical names for the perennials, eliminating the confusion that can be caused by looking up a plant by its common name. Its suggestion to consult a gardening book or an online resource for garden planning is essential, considering that this plan is so open-ended. I experimented further, and when ChatGPT was asked for garden planning books and website recommendations, it returned a fairly useful list.What still needs work: I was amused by the plot that ChatGPT proposed for the beginning gardener, an 8-by-8-foot, mostly sunny space. Who has a perfectly square garden space ready to plant? (Well, perhaps if you rent space in a community garden.) I would have started by suggesting that the gardener measure the space that they want to plant, observe the amount of sunlight it gets and conduct a soil test. At this time, it seems beyond ChatGPT to include links to each recommended plant so that one could see a photo and read about height and spacing requirements and common problems.Final ruling: One could not really act on ChatGPT’s garden plan, given the fact that it is so vague. To receive any useful garden planning advice from ChatGPT, I suggest being as specific as possible with your prompt, perhaps even asking for suggestions for a specific type of garden. Be cautious: When experimenting, I noticed that ChatGPT readily recommended plants that are on Pennsylvania’s invasive plant list unless it was specifically asked for native plants.READ: AI a growing tool for those interested in buying, selling, investing in real estate




THE ADVANCED OPTION: AIGARDENPLANNER.COMDescription: For those looking for more involved direction, AIGardenPlanner claims to offer “detailed, personalized plans and professional advice tailored to your garden’s unique conditions.” Unlike ChatGPT, which asked no questions, AIGardenPlanner asked for lots of specifics, including gardening experience, budget, and if the gardener has any allergies. It also required specific measurements for raised garden beds, ground space and soil type. With Miklas’s input, we asked the software to create a planner for a 36-by-72-inch raised bed with loam soil type and a 48-by-120-inch ground space with primarily clay soil.The prompt costs $4.99, and a link is emailed to the user after purchase, which the site estimates to take 30 minutes. We did not receive the link promptly, but a customer service representative was friendly and helped to properly deliver it.Not only did it list plant recommendations, but expanded on specific varieties’ compatibility with other plants, when to prune, which pests they are susceptible to and more.

A MASTER GARDENER’S OPINIONWhat it got right: AIGardenPlanner returned a recommendation of five plants for each bed. A drop-down menu and sidebar included more information for each, such as why the plant was recommended, how to plant, growth habits, spacing, fertilizer, pruning, pest management and maintenance tips. The information was concisely presented with a photo of the plant and appealing graphics.What still needs work: I did not expect AIGardenPlanner to recommend almost the same slate of plants for each bed: basil, lettuce, marigolds and cherry tomatoes, with the addition of sunflowers for the raised bed and zinnias substituted for sunflowers in the long, narrow, in-ground bed. Though LNP stated its gardening goal as “food, beauty, wildlife,” the planner leaned heavily toward edibles. Surprisingly, it estimated the monetary value of each vegetable or flower when harvested, something that home gardeners are not usually concerned with. It also included a few sentences on each plant’s compatibility with other plants. I felt that much of this information was based on popular lore about companion plants, not science, and was unhelpful and misleading.Final ruling: AIGardenPlanner asked for quite a few details from the user, which is itself useful in getting the gardener to think through their goals and garden situation. A beginner could probably use the information from AIGardenPlanner to start a garden, but with a little tweaking from its designers, it could be much more useful by recommending specific varieties of each plant or suggesting a succession garden plan. For example, lettuce is a spring and fall crop that could be planted before or after some of the other plants on the list, but this was not mentioned. Finally, I was surprised by the lack of recommendations for perennials or shrubs, which are often the backbone of an in-ground garden. It would be interesting to experiment with this planner by listing wildlife or beauty as the first of the list of goals to see how the recommendations might change.READ: Free TroutSpotter app uses AI to spot trends in coldwater fish populationsA MASTER GARDENER’S CONCLUSIONAI garden planning still has a lot to learn, but with so much information available, I would not be surprised if this quickly becomes a powerful tool for gardeners, especially beginners. For now, being as specific as possible with prompts is probably the best way to make this technology useful.

It is not news to say the UK employment market is set for a seismic shock as a result of the rise of AI, but it may not be the one many of us were expecting. The usual narrative around disruptive technologies is that they disproportionately impact lower-income jobs. However, Pearson’s new Skills Outlook has found that white collar workers will be impacted more by generative AI than their blue collar counterparts, with up to 41 per cent of the tasks in some roles predicted to be affected. The white collar roles that are set to be most affected are those that rely on repetitive, technical tasks like scheduling appointments and handling calls: the medical secretary at your local GP, for example. On the flipside, if you’re on the lookout for a generative AI-proof career, then a role as a gardener, painter or dry cleaner might be for you. With many blue collar roles such as these, it is their ‘human led’ manual labour and customer service elements that make them more resilient.So what does this mean for the HR and people management world? While it is natural for employers and employees to feel some degree of uncertainty about the impact on jobs, it is not simply a case of these white collar roles becoming obsolete. However, we need to act quickly and decisively to adapt and upskill in anticipation of the major transformation in the future of work.Productivity in the not-too-distant future is going to be increasingly shaped by the best of AI and the best of human skills together. I believe that employers should create a more holistic view of jobs and their constituent tasks, determining where employees can reskill and retrain, as well as where AI can augment more repetitive work. 
The key is understanding the core skills and tasks that underpin each role, how long they take and how efficiently this time is spent. In some cases, particularly with admin-led tasks, generative AI can perform the same function much more efficiently. This creates the opportunity to free employees up for work that is more creative, collaborative and customer-focused – helping us push established boundaries, in all fields, to previously unimagined levels.A recent experiment from Harvard Business School gave us a fascinating look at what the dynamics of the office might look like with generative AI thrown into the mix. It monitored the impact of GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest tool, when offered to employees at Boston Consulting Group.Consultants using AI were significantly more productive (they completed 12.2 per cent more tasks on average, and completed tasks 25.1 per cent more quickly) and produced significantly higher-quality results (more than 40 per cent higher quality compared to a control group). However, in a more nuanced task, AI-assisted consultants fared worse than their peers who weren’t using the technology. GPT-4 missed the subtleties and couldn’t replicate the qualitative analysis performed by humans.Without question, organisations are going to have to adapt their learning development strategies to equip their workforce with the tools to thrive in the age of generative AI, and this is particularly true for those in white collar industries. We believe the most successful businesses will be those that not only train employees to work productively hand in hand with AI, but also lean into developing the skills that make us uniquely human. By investing in critical thinking, creativity and collaboration, we can deepen the ties between customers and the brands that serve them, and ultimately make work more rewarding and enriching for employees.We could also see the balance of demand between white collar and blue collar work in the employment market shift in coming years. This requires a whole system rethink, with governments and policymakers needing to adapt curricula, access, funding and pathways to prepare for change too.Generative AI is arguably the most significant technological shift we’ve seen in recent years, and I believe it can have a positive impact on how people understand and prepare for the changing world of work. However, we need to act fast to adapt, upskilling and evolving to ride the wave of change.One of the best ways for the government, employers and employees to get ahead of this transformation and stay relevant is to understand the skills that will be needed for the future, so that they can prepare for the changes to come. While generative AI may be on the rise, the need for inherently human skills has never been greater.Oliver Latham is VP of strategy and growth at Pearson Workforce Skills

There is no doubt about it: generative AI is a transformative technology – a revolutionary tool that will change how we work. However, adopting any transformative technology requires careful thought. It's not just a case of ""futz around and see.""


If there's one thing I've learned from my long career consulting with organizations, it's that transformation never starts with the technology itself. You can't just tell everyone in your business to start experimenting with ChatGPT right away because there are very real challenges and limitations. (For example, you can't have your sales team uploading customer data to a tool like ChatGPT because that could potentially expose people's personal data.)

So, yes, you want people to be using these sorts of tools as quickly as possible, but thoughtfully. Thoughtfully, carefully, and with all the support they need to get the best out of new technology. With that in mind, here are my tips for successfully implementing generative AI in your business.

PROMOTED
1. Remember, Generative AI Is A Tool (Not A Substitute For Humans)
Generative AI won’t do our jobs for us. Instead, we will use generative AI to do our jobs more effectively. To automate or streamline the more repetitive and mundane tasks. And to free up time for more value-adding tasks. As such, generative AI will not replace the need for very human talents like creativity, problem-solving, and relationship building (more on skills coming up) – but it will hopefully make work better for humans.

2. Cultivate The Right Culture And Mindset 
Adopting generative AI successfully requires a shift in culture and mindset. It requires a mindset that embraces curiosity, humility, adaptability, and collaboration – what I call the generative AI mindset.

The generative AI mindset has to start at the top and filter down across the organization. This means you need an organizational culture where people continually challenge the status quo, are comfortable with change (and failure), are not afraid to experiment, and are open to learning new things. I’m talking about a culture where people constantly ask questions like, “How can we create more value for customers?” “How can we create more value for the world?” and “How can we use technology to do that?”

3. Invest In The Right Skills And Talent
In terms of skills and talent, AI delegation – the art of working out what we still need to do for ourselves and what's best left to machines – will become a crucial skill. AI delegation, whether by managers or individuals, can vastly increase efficiency by automating routine elements of work such as data entry, processing and analysis, reviewing documents, scheduling and time management. And as with any form of delegation, the value lies in what can be done with the time saved – more time for tasks that require original thought, strategic thinking, decision making and relationship building.

What about other skills for success? You essentially want people to cultivate complementary skills that help the organization get the best out of both machines and humans. This will increasingly place an emphasis on softer human skills like empathy, complex decision-making, collaboration, and critical thinking – basically, the areas where humans have the edge over machines.
Of course, you will also need to build AI knowledge and skills across the organization. But this doesn’t necessarily mean recruiting AI talent. For the average business, upskilling your existing people and partnering with technology companies are likely to be the most accessible ways to tap into AI talent.
4. Consider Appointing A Chief AI Officer (CAIO)
I strongly recommend organizations appoint a chief AI officer (CAIO) – a board-level position that promotes a better awareness of AI across the business (especially the leadership team), oversees the organization’s AI strategy, and ensures AI is being used ethically and effectively.
What if appointing a CAIO isn’t an option in your organization? Some organizations are appointing AI experts as non-executive directors to help the board understand AI technologies and how to implement them. In fact, this is a role I perform for a number of companies, and it’s a great option if you don’t have (or can’t have) in-house knowledge.
5. Take A Good Look At Your Data Needs
AI is nothing without data, so if you don’t already have a data strategy in place, now is the time to create one. And if you do have one, it will no doubt need updating.
When considering the data that will help you harness generative AI, I recommend focusing on the data that will solve your biggest business problems and help you accomplish your strategic goals. Also, think about the shelf-life of that data. While it's useful to understand what happened in your business last week or last year, it’s even more important to understand what’s happening in your business right now. So be sure to think about how you can capture and act on information as it happens – or as close to that as possible.
Consider also the balance between internal and external data. Proprietary data is obviously incredibly valuable because, by its very nature, only your business has that information. However, external data (such as social media data) can be very useful.
6. Be Strategic
Generative AI has big implications for businesses. As such, you will need to review your overarching business strategy to ensure it's still relevant and update it in line with the amazing possibilities of generative AI. This means you will need to carefully examine the potential impact of generative AI on your business operations, your products and services, and maybe even your underlying business model – and then update your business strategy accordingly.
7. Get Your Technology Building Blocks In Place
There are three fundamental elements that will help you leverage generative AI successfully: the first is fast, secure networks and connectivity (not just in your offices but also on the go); the second is data infrastructure (i.e., the technology to collect, store, and access the data you need); and the third is cybersecurity (the technology to keep your business safe from threats like ransomware, phishing, and breaches).
Your generative AI tools then sit atop that bedrock. You can tap into readily available tools like ChatGPT or its underlying GPT-4 language model, but you’ll have to consider the potential privacy implications. (At the very least, always be aware of whether the information you enter will be used for training language models and potentially shared with other users.) Lots of organizations that I work with choose to create their own secure version of GPT-4, but that may not be feasible, depending on your budget and expertise.
The great thing about generative AI is there are so many options for different companies - those on a shoestring and those with deep pockets. If you need in-house knowledge to help you decide which tool or tools are right for your business, it's well worth consulting with an AI expert.

Generative AI is on the rise



When people refer to artificial intelligence (AI) tools, they may be referring more specifically to generative AI which is exploding in popularity and usage.
What is generative AI?
Generative AI is a term used to encompass deep-learning language models that generate text, images, videos, and other content using external prompts. They use the datasets they learn from to create various forms of content, ranging from short poems to long articles.
The topic of generative AI came to the fore with the wide release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool, bringing generative AI to the general public at large. While this might have been the first form of generative AI that many people had come into contact with, it certainly wasn’t the only one to hit the market.
There are now dozens of different ways that generative AI can be accessed, with almost every major tech company releasing its own versions, whether that’s Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s massive investment in OpenAI, Github’s GitHub Copilot, and plenty more besides.
Before generative AI became synonymous with chatbots, it was also being used in statistics. It is an enormously helpful tool for analyzing numerical data, being able to quickly read through and identify patterns and trends. It was the growing strength of deep learning that made it possible to use the same technology for images, speech, and other complex data types.
The very first type of this new class of generative AI was introduced in 2013, known as variational autoencoders VAEs). These were widely used for generating realistic images and speech. Over time, the tools were fine-tuned to create ever more realistic images, sounds, and writing.


How does generative AI work?
The definition of generative AI means that the tool is turning raw data (which can be anything from a quick prompt to scanning the entirety of a Wikipedia page) into output. The machine learning element means that the AI is learning what kind of output would be most likely, based on the data that it has access to. It cannot truly create anything new; genuine creativity still remains with living creatures alone.
However, it can create fresh pieces of output that are inspired by or similar to what it’s learned from, without it being a direct copy. Generally speaking, a prompt is given in any format, whether that’s text, an image, a video, a webpage, or any other input that the AI system has learned to process. It then uses its internal AI algorithms to create new content in response to the prompt, based off patterns it’s learned.
Digging into the deeper technology required, generative AI tools will usually combine several algorithms to process content. The input given will then be transformed into raw characters, such as turning paragraphs into basic letters, punctuation, and words or images into distinct visual elements. These basic characters are then encoded as vectors, something that the AI can use to create fresh output.

Bias in generative AI
It’s worth noting when explaining generative AI that this process of teaching language models can expose the possibility of teaching AI models human biases. If there is bias in the original data, whether unconscious or otherwise, that bias will show up in the output later created.
In real-world terms, this has resulted in AI creating images or text that have inaccurate identities or references in them. As just one example, Google recently had to shut down its image-generation tools within Gemini because of historical inaccuracies showing up in its results.


Generative AI criticism
This is not the only form of criticism leveled at generative AI. Artists of various different disciplines have complained that deep-learning models are ‘stealing’ from human-made art. After all, as established above, generative AI can’t learn from anything.
The data used to ‘teach’ AI models is usually sourced from artistic work. Legally, this must be artwork that is open to the public, but that hasn’t stopped people from resenting the fact that AI images can other forms of output can be created instantaneously, seemingly off the backs of human artists.
How to generate AI images
If you want to try out AI image generation for yourself, there are plenty of tools to choose from. Many graphic design tools, including Adobe, Pixlr, and Canva have incorporated generative AI into their offerings, but some dedicated tools get the job done as well. These include:

Open AI’s DALL-E 2
Imagine
Midjourney
Stable Diffusion

Of course, tools like these aren’t free, with all requiring a paid subscription in order to use them. Midjourney is included in ChatGPT’s $20 monthly subscription, DALL-E with the ChatGPT Plus plan for $20 per user, Stable Diffusion’s Basic plan starting at $27 per month, and Imagine starting from as low as $3 a month.
Once you have access to your tool of choice, you can start straight away. Most generative AI tools appear much like a chatbot, with a dialog box where you can type in your prompt. Getting the best out of your tool requires some nifty prompt use but it’s worth noting that the model will quite literally learn as it gets to know you.
You can ask it to tweak images as you go, remaking the same image in different styles or altering specific areas of the image. Every tool is different in the level of changes you can make, but most offer some sort of tool where you can pick out individual elements that can be altered in different iterations.

Artificial Intelligence is one of the biggest technological waves that has hit the world of technology. According to The Enterprisers Project, AI will be offering about 133 million new jobs in the coming years. Dun & Bradstreet also stated that 40 percent of the respondent organizations are offering more jobs because of implementing artificial intelligence technology. With the growing demand for artificial intelligence, several individuals are considering artificial intelligence career option.  
Essential steps to boost your AI job prospects 
Step 1 
One of the essential requirements for an individual, who is looking for a career in the field of AI must good at numbers, i.e. they should polish their math skills. This will help in writing better code.  
Step 2 
One must strengthen their basics, on the following concepts that play an important part in this field.  

Linear algebra, probability, and statistics  

Mathematics is an integral part of AI. And if an individual wants to make a growing career in it, then they must have good knowledge of these basic concepts. They are vectors, matrices, statistics, and dimensionality. Probability concepts like Bayes Theorem. 

 Programming languages  

An individual should be learning programming languages because they play a prominent role in AI. One can enroll in an artificial intelligence certification to learn programming languages. There are several programming languages, an individual should well-versed at least one among the following: 

Python 
Java 
C 
R 


Data structures 

Enhance the way to solve problems involving data, create an analysis of data more accurately so one can build their own systems with minimum errors. Learning the various parts of programming languages will be fruitful in getting an understanding of data structures like stacks, linked lists, dictionaries, and many more. 

 Regression  

Regression is highly useful for predictions making in real-time applications. It is very crucial to have a good understanding of the concepts of regression.  

 Machine learning models 

Gain knowledge on the various ML concepts such as Decision trees, Random Forests, KNN, SVM, etc. Learn the ways to apply these by acquiring knowledge of the algorithms as they are quite useful in solving the problems. 
Step 3 
If an individual wants to enhance their artificial intelligence career, then they must learn more in-depth concepts, which are a complex part of AI. If one masters these concepts, then they can excel in their career.  

Neural networks 

It is a computer system modeled on the human brain and nervous system, which works by incorporating data through an algorithm it is developed on. The concepts of neural networks are the foundations for developing AI machines, it is better to have a deep understanding of its functionalities.  
There are different types of neural networks, which are used in various ways. A few of the common neural networks are: 

Perceptron 
Multilayer perceptrons 
Recurrent neural network 
Sequence to sequence model 
Convolutional neural network 
Feed forward neural network 
Modular neural network 
Radial basis functional neural network 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  


Domains of AI 

After gaining knowledge about the concepts and various types of neural networks, learn about the different applications of it, and start building one’s own applications. Every application in the AI field demands a different approach, and it is very tough to master all the fields of AI. Start with a specific domain, and then proceed further to the other domains. 

Big data 

Though it is not considered an essential aspect for gaining expertise in AI, understanding the basic concepts of big data will be quite helpful mainly to climb up the AI career ladder. 
Step 4 
Boost your expertise in the AI space by mastering the following aspects: 

Optimization techniques 

By learning optimization of algorithms is very useful to maximize or minimize the error function. These functions are based on the models internal learnable parameters that play a crucial role in the accuracy and efficiency of results. Learning this will be useful to implement optimization techniques and algorithms to model parameters that are useful to acquire optimum values and accuracy of such parameters.  

Publish research papers  

One of the best ways to establish one’s own credibility in the field of artificial intelligence is by going a step ahead by reading research papers in this field and publishing research papers. Begin your own research and understand the cases that are developing.  

Develop algorithms 

After completing the process of learning and research, begin working on building algorithms. You might bring a new revolution with the knowledge you have.  
Conclusion  
Undoubtedly, mastering AI concepts can be a difficult task. But one can achieve it with hard work, continuous practice, consistency and doing the right kind of Ai certification that ensures knowledge based on the current industry standards.

Write a short prompt, and an instant later, lucid paragraphs or realistic images appear on the screen (joined, possibly soon, by convincing video). Those first impressions can be electrifying, as though your computer had been touched by a thunder god’s spark.But there is another version of the Greek tale that paints Zeus less as a creator and more as a regurgitator. He eats his pregnant wife, Metis, who has done the labor of carrying Athena and has also forged her armor. Athena bursts forth only after Metis gives birth in Zeus’s mind. Generative AI systems can’t produce anything unless they, too, feed on what already exists. First, they atomize sentences, artwork and other content made by humans, and then they make connections among those digested bits. To learn how to generate text, for instance, OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, which powers the free version of the company’s popular ChatGPT, was trained on some 300 billion words that were scraped from posts on Wikipedia and other websites.Several AI companies have argued that it is fair to train models this way without consulting or paying writers, photographers or other human creators. “AI development is an acceptable, transformative and socially beneficial use of existing content that is protected by fair use,” wrote Stability AI, which makes the popular image generator Stable Diffusion, in an October 2023 statement to the U.S. Copyright Office. A representative of the company told Scientific American that this remains Stability AI’s position.This fair use view is far from universal. Disagreement with it is the basis for disputes such as the New York Times’ lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI, which alleges that the technology companies unlawfully used the newspapers’ stories to make chatbots. The issue also motivated computer scientist Ed Newton-Rex to quit his job at Stability AI last November. He has since launched a nonprofit organization called Fairly Trained, which certifies companies that only train their generative AI models on copyrighted material when they get a license to do so.“There is this divide emerging between companies that train, as I would say, fairly and those that don’t,” Newton-Rex says. But it can be difficult to discern how AI models were developed, he adds. For instance, within a given company, developers of an AI audio system might seek licenses, for instance, while their colleagues behind a text-generating large language model (LLM) might not.Fairly Trained aims to make those distinctions clearer. Models from nine companies have obtained its annual certification so far, including Bria, an Israel-based AI firm that recently received $24 million in Series A funding. (The company says its image-making models are trained only on pictures that are licensed from sources such as the stock photography giant Getty Images.) Scientific American spoke with Newton-Rex to understand what criteria Fairly Trained uses to certify Bria and other companies and models—and why, despite his criticisms, he remains excited by AI’s future.[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]Last November you wrote on X that you had left your job at Stability AI because the company hadn't sought artists’ permission to use copyrighted material. As you left, were you thinking of making something like Fairly Trained?I left Stability without a plan. After I’d left, there was more attention on my resigning than I anticipated. When I was talking to people, including journalists, after leaving, one of the things I was keen to point out was that the approach that Stability and many other companies take—training on work without consent—is not the approach everyone takes.... One thing that people were asking me about was: “Okay, if you say there are companies and models training in a different way, training in a fairer way, on work they’d license, where are those companies?”Curated by Our EditorsAI Chatbot Brains Are Going Inside Robot Bodies. What Could Possibly Go Wrong?David BerrebyArtists Are Slipping Anti-AI ‘Poison’ into Their Art. Here’s How It WorksLauren LefferTougher AI Policies Could Protect Taylor Swift--And Everyone Else--From DeepfakesBrian ContrerasNew AI Circuitry That Mimics Human Brains Makes Models SmarterAnna MattsonI thought it would be relatively simple to put in place something that makes this more transparent. The easiest way of doing that, and the quickest way of doing that, would be to release a certification for companies who train on licensed data.How does the Fairly Trained certification work?Our first certification is what we’re calling the Licensed Model Certification. This can be acquired by any company that has trained a generative AI model without relying on copyrighted work that they haven’t gone and licensed or that they don’t have the rights to.How you get the certification is by a written submission. We have a list of questions that you answer that addresses, primarily, two things: One, what is the training data for your model? And secondly, what are your internal processes that make sure you’re actually adhering to only using these training data and that your employees are using these training data...? Once we feel confident that we understand your processes and that we understand what's going into this model and that you have the [necessary] licenses in place..., we give you the certification.A lot of this is trust-based right now. We don’t come in and dive into your systems.... But we think that’s an adequate mechanism, for now, to make a division between the kinds of companies taking what we think is the right approach and the companies who aren’t—because, honestly, the companies that don’t take this approach are pretty open about it.There are plenty of generative AI models out there, and some of them are made by the largest tech corporations in the world. You've certified nine of them—all from relatively small companies. Why is that?I intentionally went with smaller AI companies because, in general, for this kind of thing, they can move faster. You don’t have the kind of red tape that you have at some of the bigger companies.Having said that, of course, clearly, many of the largest generative AI companies out there today couldn’t get certified because they don’t live up to this standard.All of the first models you’ve certified involve music, audio or images. None generate text. Is there something inherent in the process of developing an AI chatbot that makes it more difficult to certify?I don’t know of any large language model right now that could get certified. No one has even come close to releasing a model where all of the text is licensed or public domain or under the right sort of open license. There is a school of thought among generative AI proponents that this is all fair use, and they should get as much data as they can. And that involves scraping the Internet and getting all the text they can.Unfortunately, in the past year and a half or couple of years, that has been the way that text generation and much generative AI has gone—partly because it’s been a race to develop the biggest and best models as quickly as possible, to get as much funding as possible, to become the big player in the space. And frankly, it’s because people feel they can get away with it.In 2022 you used an LLM to create a choral accompaniment for piano, which you’ve called the first piece of published classical music set to generative AI text. (It was performed by the ensemble Voces8 in a London concert that was broadcast last August.)

At the time everything was very experimental. No one really knew what was going on.I should say: I am a proponent of generative AI. I think generative AI is a great thing. I would probably use it for one of the things that I think it’s very useful for, which is as a creative spark, as inspiration.Describe to me the future of generative AI in which it can peacefully coexist alongside human artists and acts of creation.There’s a big part of the world that got very excited about creating material from scratch—all of the people using Midjourney on Twitter [now known as X] to, you know, reimagine some painting in the style of Grand Theft Auto. I think that’s all a waste of time.The exciting future is in this technology’s functionality as an assistive technology.... You actually can democratize creativity when you start to imagine the applications of this tech within the education system, if you can start to give people essentially personalized tutors—scalable, cheap, personalized tutors to teach them how to make things—especially in fields like music while music education has been on the decline in terms of funding in the U.K., where I come from.But I think this should be done in a way that respects the creators behind the training data. Training data are one of the key three resources you need to build these systems: you need training data, you need GPUs [graphics processing units, chips that excel at running multiple computations simultaneously], and you need AI talent. People are coming in and spending millions of dollars on the latter two. I don’t see how it can be justified trying to get for free the other key resource, without which these systems would not work.Rights & PermissionsBen Guarino is an associate technology editor at Scientific American.

But first... Three things you need to know today:• Discord will offer  rewards for gamers as CEO considers an IPO• Apple will  face questions from EU regulators over its treatment of Epic Games• The FCC is conducting a  “thorough” investigation into AT&T outageUsing AI to rank resumesFor years, companies have relied on automated screening systems to help hiring managers vet job candidates. That’s sparked numerous blog posts telling candidates how to use keyword tricks to get their cover letters and resumes past these application trackers. But in the wake of ChatGPT’s viral success, a new set of AI systems have been added into the hiring process — with potential risks for job seekers.As we reported for our investigation into artificial intelligence and hiring, there’s now a cottage industry of services using AI chatbots to interview and screen potential candidates. LinkedIn, arguably the most popular platform for job seekers and professionals, recently introduced a new AI chatbot that recruiters can prompt in order to “find that short list of qualified candidates — faster,” the company said in a blog post. Last April, HR tech company SeekOut launched a recruiting tool called SeekOut Assist, which uses generative AI to create a ranked list of candidates for a particular job description.These services might help companies sift through a glut of candidates, but there’s a significant concern: bias. Generative AI has a well-documented history of perpetuating stereotypes that are baked into the online data used to train it. Ask an AI image generator to show you a CEO, for example, and it may be more likely to assume it’s a man. Understanding how those biases play out in a high-stakes scenario like hiring, however, is a challenge. Job applicants don’t have the means to audit an employer’s hiring processes themselves and AI systems are typically black boxes, even to those who build them. To crack open the black box, we designed an experiment that could systematically test for potential embedded bias in one of these AI models in a hiring context. We decided to focus on names in resumes, which have proven time and again to carry weight in the hiring process. We also chose to focus on OpenAI’s GPT, the best-known generative AI tool and a technology that has already been used by services like SeekOut Assist. We replicated a simplified version of a hiring workflow by feeding a set of eight fictitious resumes into GPT – keeping all the qualifications equal, and only changing the fictitious names topping the resumes. Then we asked the tool to tell us who the best candidate was for a particular job listing. We asked GPT to evaluate these would-be candidates against four real job listings from Fortune 500 companies: an HR business partner, a senior software engineer, a retail manager and a financial analyst.We did this 1,000 times each for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, using 800 demographically-distinct names: 100 names each for males and females that are associated with being either Black, White, Hispanic or Asian. Each fictitious resume representing a specific demographic had an equal chance of being ranked as the top candidate each time we asked GPT for the best person for a particular job.Crucially, we had to ensure that each name was more likely than not to map onto a specific intersection of race and gender. Borrowing methods from well-established social science research, we computed the 100 most popular first names and 20 most distinct last names unique to each demographic from North Carolina voter registrations and the US decennial census, respectively. From there, the first and last names were randomly paired up for each group, resulting in 800 demographically-distinct names.Researchers studying discrimination and bias frequently use racially distinctive names to signal race or ethnicity, according to Evan Rose, one of the authors of a National Bureau of Economic Research study on hiring discrimination, which we drew inspiration from. This method has for years found consistent evidence of racial discrimination in the US labor and housing markets, Rose told us. “That’s why names are really useful as a signal,” he said.In our own experiment, we found clear signs of name-based discrimination. When asked to rank the resumes 1,000 times, GPT 3.5 favored names from some demographics more often than others, to an extent that would fail benchmarks used to assess job discrimination against protected groups. We found at least one adversely impacted demographic group for every job listing we tested, except for retail workers ranked by GPT-4.OpenAI, for its part, said the results of using GPT out-of-the-box may not be reflective of how its customers use the tools. Businesses using the technology have the option to fine-tune the AI model’s responses further, for example. AI companies have generally tried to find ways to reduce bias in their systems, and OpenAI is no different.

AI Drives Work on Pulmonary Fibrosis Drug from Target Discovery to Phase II






March 11, 2024

Some say that AI’s potential in drug development is overstated. Others say that it is, if anything, understated. Who is right? Only time will tell. In the meantime, both sides—and the undecided—eagerly await news of AI successes and failures. For those who suspect that AI’s potential is understated, a piece of news has just appeared that will no doubt be taken as confirmation, however partial or contingent it may seem to AI’s doubters.
The news is the appearance of a paper in Nature Biotechnology describing how AI not only enabled the discovery of an antifibrotic target, but also generated a small molecule inhibitor of the target. The inhibitor’s potential was then confirmed in multiple in vivo studies and in a Phase I trial.




The paper, titled “A small-molecule TNIK inhibitor targets fibrosis in preclinical and clinical models,” describes how scientists at Insilico Medicine and their collaborators leveraged predictive AI technology to bring a drug candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) to the threshold of Phase II development.
“We identify TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK) as an antifibrotic target,” the article’s authors wrote. “[We] generated INS018_055, a small-molecule TNIK inhibitor, which exhibits desirable drug-like properties and antifibrotic activity across different organs in vivo through oral, inhaled, or topical administration.”
“This work,” the scientists reported, “was completed in roughly 18 months from target discovery to preclinical candidate nomination and demonstrates the capabilities of our generative AI-driven drug-discovery pipeline.”







Besides disclosing raw experimental data, the scientists described how they first trained PandaOmics, the target identification engine of Insilico’s AI platform Pharma.AI, on a collection of omics and clinical datasets related to tissue fibrosis. PandaOmics proposed a potential target list using deep feature synthesis, causality inference, and de novo pathway reconstruction. After that, the natural language processing models of PandaOmics analyzed millions of text files, including patents, publications, grants, and clinical trial databases to further assess the novelty and disease association.
After selecting TNIK as a primary target, the scientists utilized Chemistry42, Insilico Medicine’s generative chemistry engine, to generate novel molecular structures using a structure-based drug design workflow. Chemistry42 combines over 40 generative chemistry algorithms and over 500 pretrained reward models for de novo compound generation, and it can optimize both generation and virtual screening based on expert human feedback.
After multiple iterative screens were run, one promising hit candidate demonstrated activity with nanomolar IC50 values. The scientists further optimized the compound to increase solubility, promote a good ADME safety profile, and mitigate unwanted toxicity while retaining the compound’s affinity for TNIK. Ultimately, this work produced the lead molecule INS018_055, with less than 80 molecules synthesized and tested.
In subsequent preclinical studies, INS018_055 demonstrated significant efficacy in vitro and in vivo studies for IPF and showed promising results in pharmacokinetic and safety studies across multiple cell lines and multiple species. Furthermore, INS018_055 showed panfibrotic inhibitory function, attenuating skin and kidney fibrosis in two additional animal models. Based on these studies, INS018_055 achieved preclinical candidate nomination in February 2021.
“From my perspective, the progress of INS018_055 has significant implications for the drug discovery field,” said Alex Zhavoronkov, PhD, founder and CEO of Insilico Medicine. “It not only serves as a proof-of-concept for Pharma.AI … but sets a precedent for the potential of generative AI to accelerate drug discovery. Using the publication as a guide, one can extrapolate how generative AI drug discovery tools may streamline early discovery efforts.”




At present, two Phase IIa clinical trials of INS018_055 for the treatment of IPF are being conducted in parallel in the United States and China. The studies are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the lead drug. In addition, the trials will assess the preliminary efficacy of INS018_055 on lung function in IPF patients. As this drug continues to advance, it drives hope for the roughly five million people worldwide suffering from this deadly disease.
Comments about the paper from Bud Mishra, PhD, professor of computer science at New York University, emphasized how the study’s different parts—target selection and drug design—employed different kinds of AI technology: “The first part uses heuristics that are based on the scientific experiences accumulated in the past (the target must be novel, easy to understand in terms of interactions with known pathways, and follow the approaches used by others in guiding drug discovery and clinical trials in the past) and hence ideal for NLP using LLMs. The second part uses randomized heuristics to search and optimize over complex combinatorial spaces using DNNs, capable of dealing with naturally occurring ‘easy instances of hard problems.’”
“Speculatively,” he continued, “the first part will become more difficult over time (hallucination vs. true novelty) and the second part, simpler, as Moore’s law will continue to improve the computational power exponentially.”

Generative AI, as many of you will already know, is a technology that can create new content, like text, imagery, audio, and more, using natural language prompts. It uses data to build models (Large Language Models) that recognise patterns in the data to produce new original content.
While we’re still at the early stages in the generative AI evolution, we wanted to understand how organisations in Ireland are currently positioned in order to share a nationwide cross-industry assessment of readiness for AI transformation,.
Produced by Trinity College Dublin’s Business School, on behalf of Microsoft Ireland, the report involved a survey of 400 senior managers across both the public and private sectors in Ireland. It assesses the uptake, sentiment, and future trends of generative AI at this early stage of its evolution.
Key Insights:
Our Microsoft Ireland report reveals that 49% of organisations are already using generative AI in some form at this early stage of availability.
47% of organisations believe the technology will enhance productivity, contrasting with only 17% holding opposing views.
Those with a generative AI-first policy (company-wide approach) feel there are more benefits, such as productivity increases, from generative AI (71%) compared to firms that prohibit generative AI use.
A shadow generative AI culture is emerging – 27% of leaders are using publicly available or free generative AI in their role and 25% believe their employees are doing the same – while 8% are aware employees use free generative AI software in direct contravention of their organisation’s policy.
A key takeaway by Trinity College Dublin’s Business School suggests Ireland is at a crossroads, and first mover advantage is now crucial to capitalise on its position as a global technology hub and drive competitiveness through AI innovation.
Irish organisations have a unique opportunity to tap into our status as a multinational hub and become leaders in generative AI to deliver local economic growth.
Growing adoption
Today’s publication points to rising adoption rates of generative AI solutions within Irish workplaces – with 49% highlighting generative AI being used in some form within their organisation.
The survey showed that the sectors with the highest planned adoption rates are technology, science, and media, while the agriculture, transport, and utilities sectors appear to be further behind in their generative AI adoption journey.
Importantly, the research also indicates that indigenous Irish organisations might be falling behind multinational organisations based in Ireland, who use 30% more generative AI. This is only the start, however, there’s still time to be early adopters and harness the innovative potential of AI.
Shadow AI workplace culture emerging
Interestingly, the report points to an emerging phenomenon, a shadow AI Culture, that leaders need to be cognisant of. A quarter of leaders say they are aware that some employees within their organisations are using publicly available generative AI tools, and 27% admit to doing so themselves, rather than using enterprise-grade solutions with in-built content safety controls and data protection.  Additionally, 8% of respondents highlighted awareness of employees knowingly using generative AI software in contravention to the organisation’s policy. This trend will only continue to grow, with employees seeking workarounds and using publicly available tools that are not aligned to company policy and that don’t have privacy, security, and data protection controls.
Potential for Ireland to leverage generative AI innovation and advance its position as a digital leader in Europe
Elsewhere, the report concludes that organisations that have been first movers in the space of generative AI and use a generative AI-first policy see many more benefits and productivity increases (71%) compared to firms that prohibit generative AI (42%). These firms also see higher productivity and innovation potential in their employees, in addition to providing higher training, internal resources, and finances to support the transition.
The report identifies that a proactive approach underscores the critical importance of embracing transformative innovation as a means to surpass competitors, reach sustainability goals, explore untapped markets, and reshape industry norms. This is believed to be crucial for Ireland to leverage AI innovation and become a leading digital economy in Europe and beyond.
Beyond the Insights: To deliver sustainable value from generative AI investments, organisations in Ireland should consider the following recommendations:
Address the skills gap: A strategic approach to generative AI requires not only technology, data, and expertise, but also calls for business domain knowledge and change management skills. The report highlights that more education and support is required for organisations, especially SMEs.
Transformative versus incremental innovation: Organisations can innovate and transform using generative AI — but they will only invest if AI moves the needle on metrics that matter in the short-term. However, a visionary approach, and a deeper assessment of the benefits of AI to transform an organisation and shape their digital destiny is required, particularly in the public sector which is under pressure to provide higher quality public services to citizens.
Leverage platforms and providers that take responsibility and security seriously: Train and educate decision-makers around the issues of data privacy and legal issues related to the use of generative AI. Our research indicates this to be an area of concern for many business leaders. Leverage platforms that take responsibility for data storage and with enterprise-grade security to prepare for possible future regulations, customer data security, and allay fears of business leaders.

In a refrain that feels almost entirely too familiar by now: Generative AI is repeating the biases of its makers.A new investigation from Bloomberg found that OpenAI's generative AI technology, specifically GPT 3.5, displayed preferences for certain racial in questions about hiring. The implication is that recruiting and human resources professionals who are increasingly incorporating generative AI based tools in their automatic hiring workflows — like LinkedIn's new Gen AI assistant for example — may be promulgating racism. Again, sounds familiar. The publication used a common and fairly simple experiment of feeding fictitious names and resumes into AI recruiting softwares to see just how quickly the system displayed racial bias. Studies like these have been used for years to spot both human and algorithmic bias among professionals and recruiters.

""Reporters used voter and census data to derive names that are demographically distinct — meaning they are associated with Americans of a particular race or ethnicity at least 90 percent of the time — and randomly assigned them to equally-qualified resumes,"" the investigation explains. ""When asked to rank those resumes 1,000 times, GPT 3.5 — the most broadly-used version of the model — favored names from some demographics more often than others, to an extent that would fail benchmarks used to assess job discrimination against protected groups.""

The experiment categorized names into four categories (White, Hispanic, Black, and Asian) and two gender categories (male and female), and submitted them for four different job openings. ChatGPT consistently placed ""female names"" into roles historically aligned with higher numbers of women employees, such as HR roles, and chose Black women candidates 36 performance less frequently for technical roles like software engineer.ChatGPT also organized equally ranked resumes unequally across the jobs, skewing rankings depending on gender and race. In a statement to Bloomberg, OpenAI said this doesn't reflect how most clients incorporate their software in practice, noting that many businesses fine tune responses to mitigate bias. Bloomberg's investigation also consulted 33 AI researchers, recruiters, computer scientists, lawyers, and other experts to provide context for the results.

The report isn't revolutionary among the years of work by advocates and researchers who warn against the ethical debt of AI reliance, but it's a powerful reminder of the dangers of widespread generative AI adoption without due attention. As just a few major players dominate the market, and thus the software and data building our smart assistants and algorithms, the pathways for diversity narrow. As Mashable's Cecily Mauran reported in an examination of the internet's AI monolith, incestuous AI development (or building models that are no longer trained on human input but other AI models) leads to a decline in quality, reliability, and, most importantly, diversity. And, as watchdogs like AI Now argue, ""humans in the loop"" might not be able to help.

Business leaders looking to harness generative AI – the technology made famous by ChatGPT – are facing some major strategic questions. What are the best ways to use generative AI within the organization? Where can the technology add the most value? And how can you find a delicate balance between human expertise and machine intelligence?


Online personal styling service Stitch Fix is a business that all organizations can learn from. The company was built on data and AI from the ground up, allowing it to provide a personalized styling service and ship clothes directly to customers’ doors – clothes that they know clients will love based on their style preferences and previous choices. But what makes Stitch Fix really special is its ability to strike that perfect balance between human knowledge and machine capabilities. Here’s how Stitch Fix is harnessing generative AI to streamline processes and provide a better service to customers.

A Data Goldmine
Stitch Fix is sitting on a goldmine of nearly 4.5 billion text data points that clients have shared with the company. This data may include a client's style preferences or feedback on how an item fits them, for instance. It's valuable data for understanding each customer’s style, but it’s often in the form of freeform text – making it tricky data to work with. Generative AI helps Stitch Fix leverage this complex, messy data because generative AI excels at quickly making sense of and summarizing vast amounts of text data.

PROMOTED
Stitch Fix uses large language models from OpenAI, combined with their own deep learning recommendation algorithms, to interpret the feedback that clients share and then use that information to inform future recommendations. In other words, generative AI translates customer feedback into a format that Stitch Fix recommendation algorithms can understand more easily.

Let’s explore some specific use cases in a little more detail.

Creating Clothing Recommendations
One of the ways Stitch Fix uses generative AI is to surface a selection of clothing items based on feedback the client has shared about their style preferences and fit. These recommendations are shared with a human stylist, who will then curate the final pieces for the individual client.

Supporting Text Generation
Generative AI isn’t just about interpreting text. It can also create text (and images, and video, and more). Stitch Fix uses this ability to produce engaging ad copy that communicates the benefits of signing up for Stitch Fix’s service. All copy generated by AI is quality checked by human copywriters (with a 77 percent pass rate at the time of writing).
Generative AI also helps Stitch Fix create informative product descriptions that give clients details about an item’s features, specifications, and benefits. Writing descriptions for thousands of items is, as you can imagine, a time-consuming task. But having trained OpenAI’s GPT-3 on previous product descriptions (written by copywriters), plus feedback from clients, the model can now quickly create descriptions for copywriters and merchandisers to review. Stitch Fix says the model can generate 10,000 product descriptions every 30 minutes, with each description only needing a quick one-minute review by an expert before approval.
Automatically Styling Outfits
Another interesting use is Stitch Fix’s Outfit Creation Model (OCM), which uses generative AI to generate millions of new outfit combinations per day. OCM, which was trained on millions of outfits created by stylists, picks items from Stitch Fix’s current inventory, as well as from customers’ previous purchases, to compile personalized outfit suggestions for clients. This shows clients how to style items they might be interested in purchasing (or already own) with other items available from Stitch Fix. This is done through personalized emails and ads and through the customer’s personalized shopping feed.
Key Takeaways
In short, Stitch Fix uses generative AI to better understand what customers want – and, importantly, to strike a balance between automation and human skills. By letting AI systems automate the time-consuming, repetitive tasks, Stitch Fix frees up human experts to focus on their uniquely human capabilities like creativity, judgment, and building awesome relationships with clients. This is why I think all organizations can learn from Stitch Fix's approach.

Hiring AI-skilled talent is a priority for nearly four in five employers in the region, but 75% are struggling to find the AI talent they need.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the workforce in Asia-Pacific (APAC)—from how organisations operate to how work gets done. Despite the varying levels of AI adoption across countries in the region, the technology will be a game-changer over the next five years.AI taps into the power of computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. As smart algorithms and automation sweep through industries, the APAC employment landscape is evolving, with humans and machines collaborating like never before. AI is pushing both employers and workers to adapt for a more dynamic workforce and greater productivity.

To better understand emerging AI usage trends and where workplaces might be headed, Amazon Web Services (AWS) commissioned global research firm, Access Partnership, to conduct an Asia-Pacific AI skills survey. Almost 15,000 employees and nearly 5,000 employers were surveyed across Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand.The study, titled Accelerating AI Skills: Preparing the Asia-Pacific Workforce for Jobs of the Future, shows that AI transformation is happening at a rapid pace, with the majority of APAC employers expecting to use AI solutions and tools in their organisations by 2028.Here are the five key takeaways:1.  AI skills could boost pay and accelerate career growth for workers







With considerable potential to improve operational efficiency, worker productivity, and decision-making, surveyed employers in APAC indicated that they are willing to pay higher salaries to workers with AI skills and expertise beyond the IT department. While employers are willing to pay 44% more for IT workers with AI skills on average across the nine APAC countries, they would also pay a salary premium to skilled workers in research and development (41%), sales and marketing (39%), business operations (39%), finance (37%), legal (33%), and human resources (33%).On top of significant salary bumps, four in five (83%) surveyed APAC workers indicated an interest in developing AI skills to accelerate their careers, and the study found that this interest transcends generations. While 87% of Generation Z, 88% of millennial, and 79% of Generation X workers want to get equipped with AI skills, 68% of baby boomers—a demographic usually contemplating retirement—say they would enroll in an AI upskilling course if employers offered it. Overall, 93% of workers anticipate that having AI skills would have a positive impact on their careers, including increased efficiency, higher job satisfaction, and faster career progression.2.  The productivity payoff from an AI-skilled workforce could be immense







The productivity payoff refers to the tangible benefits the APAC region stands to gain from the full adoption and integration of AI tools by workers.Surveyed employers expect their organisation’s productivity to increase by 51% as AI technology automates repetitive tasks (64%), improves workflow and outcomes (60%), and enhances communication (59%). Workers believe AI could raise their productivity by as much as 50%.3. Most organisations will be AI-enabled by 2028 and expect to benefit from it







Over the next five years, the speed of AI transformation across APAC will be remarkable, with 92% of employers envisioning their organisations to be AI-driven by 2028. While most employers (91%) believe their IT departments will be the biggest beneficiary, they also expect business operations (89%), finance (88%), research and development (88%), sales and marketing (87%), legal (82%), and human resources (81%) to benefit too.Delving into key industries in the region, the research shows the IT and Telecommunications sector is leading the charge on AI adoption, with 97% expecting to use AI tools by 2028, followed closely by the Banking & Financial Services industry (95%), and the Public Sector (91%).4.  Generative AI tools will become commonplace at work over the next five years







Generative AI—a type of AI that can create new content and ideas quickly, including conversations, stories, images, videos, music, and more—has captured the attention of the general public in the past year, and will transform how people work. So, it’s not surprising that nine in 10 APAC employers (93%) and workers (90%) expect to use generative AI tools on the job within the next five years. 67% of employers highlighted increasing innovation and creativity as the top benefit of generative AI, followed by automating repetitive tasks (61%), improving outcomes (58%), and supporting learning (56%).  5.  Bridging the AI skills gap through training is mission-critical







Hiring talent with AI skills and expertise is a priority for 79% of surveyed APAC employers, of which 75% can’t find the AI talent they need. The research also uncovered a training awareness gap, whereby 79% of employers indicated that they don’t know how to implement an AI workforce training program.On the workers’ side, 71% don’t know what AI skills they need, 74% lack knowledge about available training programs, and 74% aren’t sure about the relevant career paths where AI skills would be useful.While employers consider technical skills essential for using AI, they also rank creative thinking (57%), critical thinking (53%), and ethics (36%) as important soft skills for working with AI. Ethics and risk management are vital for guarding against potential AI risks, including algorithmic bias, lack of accountability, compliance challenges, and the need for transparency and safety measures.Building an AI-ready workforce is everyone’s responsibility for future prosperity across APACOverall, this important research on AI and the future of work reveals a looming AI skills gap across APAC that must be bridged so the region is well-positioned to unlock the full benefits of AI. This calls for greater collaboration between governments, industries, and educators to help employers implement AI training programs and guide workers in matching their AI skillsets to the right roles to harness their newly acquired AI capabilities, and make the most of this evolving technology.In November 2023, Amazon launched the ‘AI Ready’ initiative that complements AWS’s commitment to provide free cloud computing skills training to 29 million individuals globally by 2025. Through ‘AI Ready,’ we now offer a suite of free AI and generative AI training courses, aligned to both technical and non-technical roles, so that anyone can build AI skills.AWS also announced new generative AI innovations at AWS re:Invent 2023, including Amazon Q—a new generative AI assistant designed for work that can be tailored to businesses. This highlights the need for workers to be equipped with AI skills, in order to unleash the full potential of generative AI innovations.AWS is proud to have trained more than 8.3 million people across Asia-Pacific and Japan with cloud skills since 2017. With the rapid adoption of cloud-enabled technologies like generative AI, more work needs to be done to build an AI-skilled workforce to unleash a culture of innovation and drive productivity in this dynamic region of the world.Learn more about the Accelerating AI Skills: Preparing the Asia-Pacific Workforce for Jobs of the Future report.
