Here are 10 of the best ways artificial intelligence is used for good.
10 Wonderful Examples Of Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) For Good Adobe Stock

Cancer Screening

Artificial intelligence, powered by deep-learning algorithms, is already in use in healthcare. Specifically, AI’s imaging capabilities are promising for cancer identification and screening, including breast cancer. Artificial intelligence is also used to predict the development of diseases across a healthcare network. A group at Mount Sinai used deep learning-based AI algorithms to predict the development of diseases with 94% accuracy, including cancers of liver, rectum, and prostate. Thanks to published cancer research, clinical trials, and drug development, there's a plethora of data that AI can help to review and then guide healthcare decision-making.  

Save the Bees

Did you know The World Bee Project is using artificial intelligence to save the bees? The global bee population is in decline, and that's bad news for our planet and our food supply. In a partnership with Oracle, The World Bee Project hopes to learn how to help bees survive and thrive by gathering data through internet-of-things sensors, microphones, and cameras on hives. The data is then uploaded to the cloud and analyzed by artificial intelligence to identify patterns or trends that could direct early interventions to help bees survive. Ultimately, artificial intelligence makes it easier to share real-time information on a global scale and take action to save the bees.

Tools for People with Disabilities
Another way artificial intelligence is used for good is to help people with disabilities overcome them. Huawei used AI and augmented reality to create StorySign, a free mobile app that helps deaf children learn to read by translating the text into sign language. The company also created Track.Ai, an easy-to-use, affordable device that can identify visual disorders in children so treatment can begin before the disorders cause blindness. Facing Emotions, another AI app created by Huawei, translates emotion into short and simple sounds. The app assesses the emotion it sees on another's face to help blind people ""see"" the emotion of the person they are talking with. The app uses the rear camera on the phone to evaluate the nose, mouth, eyebrows and eyes, and artificial intelligence to analyze the expression on these facial features and what emotion they convey—contempt, anger, fear, disgust, sadness, happiness and surprise.
Climate Change
We can make tremendous progress in solving one of the world’s biggest issues with the support of artificial intelligence. Climate change is a gargantuan problem, but several thought leaders in AI and machine learning believe technology might be able to tackle it. Machine learning can improve climate informatics—machine learning algorithms power approximately 30 climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Artificial intelligence can also help educate and predict the impacts of climate change on different regions. Researchers from the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) use GANs (generative adversarial networks) to simulate the damage of severe storms and rising sea levels.

Wildlife Conservation
Another way AI is put to work for the planet is in conservation efforts and allows underfunded conservationists an opportunity to analyze data inexpensively. A team from the University of Hawaii’s Kauai Endangered Seabird Recovery Project used AI to analyze 600 hours of audio to detect the number of collisions between birds and power lines. In another effort to halt the decline of endangered species by using AI, the University of Southern California Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society uses an unmanned aerial vehicle to spot poachers and locate animals. The data collected by the drone is sent back to be analyzed by machine learning tools that use game theory to help predict poacher and animal activity. AI is also used by Wild Me and Microsoft to automatically recognize, log, and track endangered animals like whale sharks by analyzing photos people upload to the internet.

Combat World Hunger
One of the most viable tools in the fight to end the world hunger crisis is artificial intelligence. It can analyze millions of data points to help determine the perfect crop, develop seeds, maximize current output, and control herbicide application precisely. Many applications are in use already, but one we'll highlight here is the Nutrition Early Warning System (NEWS) that uses machine learning and big data to identify regions that are at increased risk of food shortages due to crop failure, rising food prices and drought.

Reduce Inequality and Poverty
Although one of the criticisms with AI algorithms is the human bias that can be introduced via skewed algorithms or training data sets, AI can actually help reduce inequalities. The Center for Data Science and Public Policy of the University of Chicago’s project Aequitas and IBM’s AI Fairness 360 are open source toolkits that can track and correct bias. Smart text editor Textio, that makes job descriptions more inclusive, helped one publisher grow its percentage of women recruits to 57 percent, from just 10% previously. Imperial College of London is training AI to Identify inequality based on street images of living conditions in cities, with the aim to ultimately use this information to improve the situations. Similarly, AI analyzes satellite imagery in a Stanford University project to predict regions of poverty, which can then influence economic aid. Another way AI/machine learning is working to end poverty is through IBM's Science for Social Good directive Simpler Voice to overcome illiteracy.
Spot “Fake News”
It's true: AI is the engine that pushes ""fake news"" out to the masses, but Google, Microsoft, and grassroots effort Fake News Challenge are using AI (machine learning and natural language processing) to assess the truth of articles automatically. Due to the trillions of posts, Facebook must monitor and the impossibility of manually doing it, the company also uses artificial intelligence to find words and patterns that could indicate fake news. Other tools that rely on AI to analyze content include Spike, Snopes, Hoaxy, and more.
Assess Medical Images
In general, artificial intelligence is leveraged in many ways to improve healthcare systems. German-based Siemens Healthineers is a leading medical technology company that integrates AI into many of its innovative technologies. One of these technologies is the AI-Rad Companion.4, a radiologist assistant that supports routine reading and measurement tasks on medical imaging. AI augments the review of medical imaging to help alleviate some of the workloads for over-taxed radiologists. Another innovation is the AI-Pathway Companion5. This tool integrates insights from pathology, imaging, lab and genetics for each patient to provide status and suggest the next steps based on the data.
Prioritize Upgrades
At the USC Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society (CAIS), AI is deployed to figure out how to maintain Los Angeles' water supply in the event of an earthquake. Since the city's utility infrastructure is aging, the project aims to identify strategic areas for improvement in the network of pipes, so that critical infrastructure (those that serve hospitals, evacuation centers, fire and police centers) is prioritized for upgrades to earthquake-resistant pipes. This is a problem AI is adept at solving by simulating many different scenarios to find the best solution.

More children are being vaccinated around the world today than ever before, and the prevalence of many vaccine-preventable diseases has dropped over the last decade. Despite these encouraging signs, however, the availability of essential vaccines has stagnated globally in recent years, according the World Health Organization.
One problem, particularly in low-resource settings, is the difficulty of predicting how many children will show up for vaccinations at each health clinic. This leads to vaccine shortages, leaving children without critical immunizations, or to surpluses that can’t be used.
The startup macro-eyes is seeking to solve that problem with a vaccine forecasting tool that leverages a unique combination of real-time data sources, including new insights from front-line health workers. The company says the tool, named the Connected Health AI Network (CHAIN), was able to reduce vaccine wastage by 96 percent across three regions of Tanzania. Now it is working to scale that success across Tanzania and Mozambique.
“Health care is complex, and to be invited to the table, you need to deal with missing data,” says macro-eyes Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Fels, who co-founded the company with Suvrit Sra, the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Associate Professor at MIT. “If your system needs age, gender, and weight to make predictions, but for one population you don’t have weight or age, you can’t just say, ‘This system doesn’t work.’ Our feeling is it has to be able to work in any setting.”
The company’s approach to prediction is already the basis for another product, the patient scheduling platform Sibyl, which has analyzed over 6 million hospital appointments and reduced wait times by more than 75 percent at one of the largest heart hospitals in the U.S. Sibyl’s predictions work as part of CHAIN’s broader forecasts.
Both products represent steps toward macro-eyes’ larger goal of transforming health care through artificial intelligence. And by getting their solutions to work in the regions with the least amount of data, they’re also advancing the field of AI.
“The state of the art in machine learning will result from confronting fundamental challenges in the most difficult environments in the world,” Fels says. “Engage where the problems are hardest, and AI too will benefit: [It will become] smarter, faster, cheaper, and more resilient.”
Defining an approach
Sra and Fels first met about 10 years ago when Fels was working as an algorithmic trader for a hedge fund and Sra was a visiting faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley. The pair’s experience crunching numbers in different industries alerted them to a shortcoming in health care.
“A question that became an obsession to me was, ‘Why were financial markets almost entirely determined by machines — by algorithms — and health care the world over is probably the least algorithmic part of anybody’s life?’” Fels recalls. “Why is health care not more data-driven?”
Around 2013, the co-founders began building machine-learning algorithms that measured similarities between patients to better inform treatment plans at Stanford School of Medicine and another large academic medical center in New York. It was during that early work that the founders laid the foundation of the company’s approach.
“There are themes we established at Stanford that remain today,” Fels says. “One is [building systems with] humans in the loop: We’re not just learning from the data, we’re also learning from the experts. The other is multidimensionality. We’re not just looking at one type of data; we’re looking at 10 or 15 types, [including] images, time series, information about medication, dosage, financial information, how much it costs the patient or hospital.”
Around the time the founders began working with Stanford, Sra joined MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) as a principal research scientist. He would go on to become a faculty member in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and MIT’s Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS). The mission of IDSS, to advance fields including data science and to use those advances to improve society, aligned well with Sra’s mission at macro-eyes.
“Because of that focus [on impact] within IDSS, I find it my focus to try to do AI for social good,’ Sra says. “The true judgment of success is how many people did we help? How could we improve access to care for people, wherever they may be?”
In 2017, macro-eyes received a small grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to explore the possibility of using data from front-line health workers to build a predictive supply chain for vaccines. It was the beginning of a relationship with the Gates Foundation that has steadily expanded as the company has reached new milestones, from building accurate vaccine utilization models in Tanzania and Mozambique to integrating with supply chains to make vaccine supplies more proactive. To help with the latter mission, Prashant Yadav recently joined the board of directors; Yadav worked as a professor of supply chain management with the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program for seven years and is now a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a nonprofit thinktank.
In conjunction with their work on CHAIN, the company has deployed another product, Sibyl, which uses machine learning to determine when patients are most likely to show up for appointments, to help front-desk workers at health clinics build schedules. Fels says the system has allowed hospitals to improve the efficiency of their operations so much they’ve reduced the average time patients wait to see a doctor from 55 days to 13 days.
As a part of CHAIN, Sibyl similarly uses a range of data points to optimize schedules, allowing it to accurately predict behavior in environments where other machine learning models might struggle.
The founders are also exploring ways to apply that approach to help direct Covid-19 patients to health clinics with sufficient capacity. That work is being developed with Sierra Leone Chief Innovation Officer David Sengeh SM ’12 PhD ’16.
Pushing frontiers
Building solutions for some of the most underdeveloped health care systems in the world might seem like a difficult way for a young company to establish itself, but the approach is an extension of macro-eyes’ founding mission of building health care solutions that can benefit people around the world equally.
“As an organization, we can never assume data will be waiting for us,” Fels says. “We’ve learned that we need to think strategically and be thoughtful about how to access or generate the data we need to fulfill our mandate: Make the delivery of health care predictive, everywhere.”
The approach is also a good way to explore innovations in mathematical fields the founders have spent their careers working in.
“Necessity is absolutely the mother of invention,” Sra says. “This is innovation driven by need.”
And going forward, the company’s work in difficult environments should only make scaling easier.
“We think every day about how to make our technology more rapidly deployable, more generalizable, more highly scalable,” Sra says. “How do we get to the immense power of bringing true machine learning to the world’s most important problems without first spending decades and billions of dollars in building digital infrastructure? How do we leap into the future?”

TEMPE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--What’s New: Intel is partnering with Maricopa County Community College District (MCCCD) to launch the first Intel-designed artificial intelligence (AI) associate degree program in the United States. The Arizona Commerce Authority will also provide a workforce grant of $100,000 to support the program. It will enable tens of thousands of students to land careers in high-tech, healthcare, automotive, industrial and aerospace fields.


“We strongly believe AI technology should be shaped by many voices representing different experiences and backgrounds. Community colleges offer the opportunity to expand and diversify AI since they attract a diverse array of students with a variety of backgrounds and expertise. Intel is committed to partnering with educational institutions to expand access to technology skills needed for current and future jobs.”


– Gregory Bryant, Intel executive vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group


Whom It Helps: Based in Tempe, Arizona, MCCCD is the largest community college district in the U.S. with an estimated enrollment of more than 100,000 students across 10 campuses and 10,000 faculty and staff members.


How It Helps: The AI program consists of courses that have been developed by MCCCD’s faculty and Intel leaders based on Intel software and tools such as the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit and Intel Python. Intel will also contribute technical advice, faculty training, summer internships and Intel mentors for both students and faculty members. Students will learn fundamental skills such as data collection, AI model training, coding and exploration of AI technology’s societal impact. The program includes a social impact AI project that is developed with guidance from teachers and Intel mentors. Upon completion, MCCCD will offer an associate degree in artificial intelligence that can be transferred to a four-year college.


Why It’s Important: AI technology is rapidly accelerating with new tools, technology and applications requiring workers to learn new skills. Recent studies show the demand for artificial intelligence skills is expected to grow exponentially. A 2020 LinkedIn report notes that AI skills are one of the top five most in-demand hard skills. Research by MCCCD Workforce and Economic Development Office estimates an increase of 22.4 percent for these roles by 2029.


As of early June 2020, more than 43 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits. Furthermore, a recent McKinsey study estimates that over 57 million jobs are vulnerable, meaning they are subject to furloughs, layoffs or being rendered unproductive.

More than a century ago, the automobile ushered in a new age that fundamentally remade the practice of veterinary medicine. Will artificial intelligence do the same?
Virtually every area of life is somehow touched by AI, enhancing our understanding of complex issues and making better outcomes more likely. In the human health care industry, AI is being used in image interpretation, disease diagnosis, patient monitoring, drug development, and even robotic surgery. Google and IBM have invested heavily in the AI health care sector, which is projected to hit $150 billion over the next decade.
Veterinary medicine and pet owners are also using AI technologies, most notably in the areas of radiography, triage, and diagnosis.

Science fact versus fiction
Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science dealing with the simulation of human intelligence through the use of computers.
AI technology rapidly analyzes massive amounts of data according to a set of instructions known as algorithms to accomplish a specific task. These tasks run the gamut, from making an online book or movie recommendation to identifying a person based on their facial features.
And yet, the technology is nowhere near replicating human cognition or creativity. AI can only do what it’s instructed to do, meaning that the algorithms used to sniff out tax fraud can’t also forecast tomorrow’s weather.
Thomas Strohmer, PhD, is a mathematics professor and director of the Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research at the University of California-Davis. The center promotes interdisciplinary collaborations that use data science and AI to find solutions to some of the world’s most pressing problems, such as climate change and affordable health care for everyone. Dr. Strohmer says there are two types of AI.
“One is a general, very high view of AI that can think and read like humans. This is a grand vision of AI that doesn’t exist yet, right? It’s science fiction and doesn’t exist, not even close,” he explained. “Then you have the more narrow AI that you use for driving cars, language translation, and other really impressive applications. This is what we usually mean when we talk about AI: task-specific AI.
“But I should make it very clear, there is no ‘I’ in AI, not yet. The people who write these algorithms are very intelligent, but the algorithms themselves are not intelligent in a way that they can reason.”
In a 2019 report, the National Academy of Medicine wrote, “AI has the potential to revolutionize health care” and “offers unprecedented opportunities to improve patient and clinical team outcomes, reduce costs, and impact population health.”
The academy also sought to temper expectations about what AI could achieve, however. “One of the greatest near-term risks in the current development of AI tools in medicine is not that it will cause serious unintended harm, but that it simply cannot meet the incredible expectations stoked by excessive hype. Indeed, so-called AI technologies such as deep learning and machine learning are riding atop the utmost peak of inflated expectations for emerging technologies.”
Data analysis
Dr. Krystle Reagan makes it clear that she isn’t a computer scientist. Rather, she’s a veterinary internist at the UC-Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital and an advocate of AI. She helped develop an algorithm to detect Addison disease with an accuracy rate greater than 99%.
“We call Addison’s disease ‘the great pretender’ because dogs come in with very vague clinical signs. The blood work can look like intestinal disease, it can look like kidney disease, it can look like liver disease. So it’s one of those conditions that you really have to be on your toes,” Dr. Reagan said.
Blood work results from more than 1,000 dogs previously treated at the teaching hospital were used to train an AI program to detect complex patterns suggestive of the disease. The computer program was then able to use these patterns to determine whether a new patient has Addison disease. Dr. Reagan and her team published their findings in the July 2020 issue of the journal Domestic Animal Endocrinology.
Now Dr. Reagan is coding data from canine patients seen at the UC-Davis teaching hospital over the past decade in which leptospirosis was diagnosed or suspected but later ruled out. The project is a collaboration among Drs. Reagan and Strohmer and the center for data science and AI.
“Then we’re using machine learning algorithms to try to identify subtle patterns in the blood work of these dogs that might help us categorize them as having leptospirosis or not earlier than we can with traditional diagnostics,” Dr. Reagan explained.
Timing is important when diagnosing leptospirosis, Dr Reagan said, because the disease can cause serious kidney problems that can become so severe as to require dialysis. “Unfortunately, the gold standard testing for leptospirosis requires two antibody tests about 10 days apart,” she continued.
“The gold standard tells us that I can’t make a diagnosis until at least 10 days after illness. And we really need some sort of tool to help us give owners some guidance in terms of prognosis when we’re looking at this ill dog and deciding whether or not to move forward with dialysis.
“We’re hopeful that we can find patterns in the data that will help us classify our canine patients as having leptospirosis or not—or at least to help us say we think there is an 80% chance that your dog has leptospirosis or we think it’s very unlikely that your dog has leptospirosis.”

X-ray vision
Radiography is another area where AI is being used with great success. Complex algorithms have been shown to be highly accurate in recognizing patterns in imaging data.
The National Academy of Medicine estimates that about 100 scientific reports dealing with AI in radiology were published in 2005, but the number of publications had increased to more than 800 in 2017.
“Tasks for which current AI technology seems well suited include prioritizing and tracking findings that mandate early attention, comparing current and prior images, and high-throughput screenings that enable radiologists to concentrate on images most likely to be abnormal,” the academy wrote in its 2019 report. “Over time, however, it is likely that interpretation of routine imaging will be increasingly performed using AI applications.”
The company Vetology has provided traditional veterinary teleradiology services since 2010. Two years ago, the company began offering the option of AI analysis of radiographs of the thorax, heart, and lungs in dogs. Results are ready within five minutes and promise an accuracy rate on par with that of a live veterinary radiologist, said Vetology founder and CEO Dr. Seth Wallack, a board-certified veterinary radiologist.
“Studies of MD radiologists have shown that, on average, they’re correct about 70% to 75% of the time. I always tell people I would love to get the diagnosis right 80% of the time,” Dr. Wallack said.
“A feedback loop is crucial to AI improvement. When we catch a problem, we can ask, ‘What did the AI report say, and why did AI interpret it that way?’ Then we tweak things a little bit to help the machine learn, improving future AI results.”
Dr. Wallack recalled a recent case involving a referring veterinarian who thought a dog might be in left-sided heart failure. The owners were contemplating euthanasia. After receiving the Vetology AI radiology report stating there was no evidence of heart disease or heart failure, the referring veterinarian asked Vetology to have a board-certified veterinary radiologist examine the images. Dr. Wallack said, “I received that submission, and there was just enough rotation and fluid in the caudal thoracic esophagus that I thought to myself, ‘I totally see how this could be interpreted as pulmonary edema.’ It wasn’t, and the Vetology AI system read it correctly. I think AI just saved a dog’s life.”
He added, “Our belief has always been that receiving a Vetology AI radiograph report within five minutes or less after taking the radiographs will positively impact patient outcomes. That said, every day I’m blown away by what Vetology AI does.”
Future perfect?
Dr. Rolan Tripp is interested in the future of the veterinary profession. He’s been talking about it for 30 years and even founded the Veterinary Future Society. Dr. Tripp believes AI is the future of veterinary medicine.
“I think most people don’t understand how huge of an effect this is going to have, any more than when a hundred years ago veterinarians saw that first tractor out in the field and laughed when it broke down. Many veterinarians today think AI is a fad, but it isn’t. It will revolutionize how we practice veterinary medicine, mostly in a good way,” Dr. Tripp said.
As president-elect of the Veterinary Medical Ethics Society, Dr. Tripp is acutely concerned about the ethical considerations of using AI in veterinary medicine. “This is an almost virgin territory because very little has been written on it and addressed it,” he said.
Dr. Tripp wants the AVMA to work with various stakeholder groups in taking a lead role in anticipating and accommodating the impacts AI technologies will have on the veterinary profession. “We should have a plan to try to steer this machine intelligence because it’s coming in a big way, and most people don’t understand that.”

Digital marketers have to deploy AI. They also have to defeat it
In October 2017, Facebook altered the Instagram API to make it harder for users to search its giant database of photos. The change was a small element of the company’s response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but it was a significant problem for parts of the digital marketing industry.


Not long before, New York-based influencer marketing agency Amra & Elma had developed a platform that ingested data from Instagram, and allowed its client to use AI image classifiers to find very specific influencers. For instance, they could find an influencer with, say, between 10,000 and 50,000 followers who had posted photos of themselves in a Jeep. Facebook’s move killed this capability in a keystroke. Another day in the digital duel between the AIs deployed by digital marketers, and those deployed by the social media platforms.

Analytics is all
Once upon a time, successful advertising was a question of artistic creativity and financial muscle. Hire a hot agency to produce a 30-second ad, spend a lot of money with TV and newspaper owners, and you were bound to make a splash. The Mad Men of Madison Avenue were about sizzle and silver, not science.

PROMOTED
The internet has changed all that. Today it is all about data, analytics, and algorithms. Google and Facebook have made off with much of Rupert Murdoch’s ad revenue, by the simple method of making adspend accountable, and much, much more targeted. With Google Ads you only pay when a consumer clicks on your ad. With Facebook ads you know far more about the type of people your ads are being served to. It is no longer “spray and pray”.

Digital marketing is now the sexy part of the advertising industry, and its currency is data. The ability to obtain and analyse data is the core skill, not a good line in patter and a generous expense account. It is more important to understand the mechanics of the social media platforms than to know the maitre d’ at the latest trendy restaurant.

Elma Beganovich, co-founder of Amra & Elma, says “AI is a game changer in digital marketing, especially influencer marketing. Brands are now able to pinpoint their target demographic precisely, and speak to them directly. Technologies like voice recognition allow us to identify what topics influencers are talking about on YouTube and Instagram TV.""

Influencer marketing is a significant and fast-growing section of the digital marketing industry. The big agency networks (WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, and Interpublic) have their players, and there are hundreds of independent outfits. The industry is currently valued at $8bn, and before COVID-19 came along, was forecast to double in the next two years. Jessy Grossman, founder of Women In Influencer Marketing (WIIM), thinks that the virus might accelerate growth: “Brands have been hit hard. We are going to see them pinch every penny and demand the most ROI. Digital marketing is far more efficient, data driven and quick. It’s also the most economical way to get production quality content and large-scale distribution at a fraction of the price.”

Data tames the Wild West
In its early days, when Instagram was new, influencer marketing was a lawless, wild west environment – the least data-driven part of the digital marketing industry. Clients were eager to benefit from the adulation that influencers can inspire, but they had no way to measure the return on their investment, and unscrupulous influencers were buying fake followers by the thousand.
But analytics are taking over, even here. Clients want to know what they are getting for their money, and consumers want to know when they are receiving sponsored messages. Analytics are critical in understanding the level of engagement between influencers and their followers. And regulators have corralled influencers into using hashtags to indicate when a post has been paid for.
Influencer marketing is still mainly a B2C (business to consumer) activity, with the big three client categories being beauty, food, and fashion. But B2B (business to business) usage is taking off too, with influencers becoming important in financial services, pharmaceuticals, and technology.
The big money still goes to TV celebrities and footballers, with hundreds of millions of Instagram followers - Kylie Jenner charges $1m for a single post. But as the industry matures, it is finding roles for more modest players, and a hierarchy has evolved. Macro influencers have more than half a million followers, the mid-tier has 100,000 plus, the micro influencers have 10,000 plus, and last but not least are the nano influencers, with 1,000 to 10,000 followers. Clients can bundle influencers with more modest followings, allowing more precisely targeted marketing. And influencers with smaller followings often generate more engagement with, and attention from, their followers.
Platform evolution
Influencer marketing has been around in various forms for centuries, and its monetisation gathered pace with the rise of reality TV shows in the noughties. But it was the arrival of social media platforms which made it an industry. These platforms are evolving fast; they wield great power, but they are always at risk of being superseded by the latest trend. Millennials declined to use the platform favoured by their parents, so Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1bn (and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19bn). SnapChat refused to be acquired by Facebook, but Zuckerberg managed to overtake it by making Instagram Stories more user-friendly.
Alongside Instagram, YouTube is the other great influencer platform. Videos allow YouTubers to form more emotional bonds with their audiences. Facebook launched Instagram TV (IGTV) in June 2018, but so far it has failed to repeat the success against Google-owned YouTube that Instagram Stories achieved against Snapchat.
The new kid on the block is TikTok. Jessy Grossman says, “TikTok is all that everyone is talking about. The virality of it is like YouTube years ago. While it seems to attract a young audience, I’ve also seen all kinds of content perform well on there. The tools it provides its users directly in the platform are fairly complex, and really encourage interesting content.”
Clients, agencies and the influencers themselves are engaged in a constant battle with the platforms. They desperately want to maximise the attention secured by their posts, and they are constantly innovating, and refining their techniques, to raise their ranking on the platforms. The platforms, on the other hand, want great content to keep their audiences engaged, but if anyone is going to pay to promote a piece of content, they want it to be their own ads, not an agency. Artificial intelligence is the most powerful weapon in both sides’ armouries.
Darwin plus data
The platforms actively court the influencers, and welcome the highly curated and creative content they produce. They use machine learning and other AI techniques to help influencers raise their game still further. But they also deploy AI, and continually evolve their algorithms, to prevent influencers and agencies from gaming the system using their own data and AIs. It is a constant struggle: Darwin plus data.
AI is also helping the agencies manage the bewildering growth in the number of influencers. OMD and GroupM, the media agencies of the ad networks Omnicom and WPP, both launched AI tools in early 2018 to match influencers to brands, and assess the performance of campaigns they run together.
Virtual influencers
Influencers are often accused of being fake: fake followers, fake tans, fake lifestyles. A single photo can take a day to set up, with an army of stylists and make-up artists as well as the photographer and the lighting team. And then there is the photoshop team.
As well as working hard to get the right image, influencers have to strike the right tone. Quite a few of them have struggled with this since the murder of George Floyd and the return of the black Lives Matter movement. Influencers have been harshly criticised for using protest events as a backdrop for a fashion-related shoot. But even before the pandemic, the fakery went to an extreme: meet the virtual influencers.
Lil Miquela is a freckly Brazilian 19 year-old who lives in Los Angeles. 80,000 people stream her songs on Spotify each month, and she counts Prada among her clients. She has 2.2m followers on Instagram, and many of them know that she is entirely fictional. She was created in 2016 by Brud, a startup in LA which specialises in CGI, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Until 2018, Brud allowed Lil’s followers to believe she was real, and then they staged her “kidnap”, using another avatar, called Bermuda. A Trump-supporting “robot supremacist”, Bermuda accused Lil of being a “fake ass person” and said she could not have her account back until she told the world the truth. Brud is now said to be worth $125m.
The virtual influencer story took another turn after the virus lockdown, when the WHO contracted with Influential, another LA-based studio, to obtain the services of Knox Frost, a CGI rendering of a 20 year-old from Atlanta, with a million followers on Instagram. Frost posts about the need to observe the lockdown, and to wash hands frequently. Elma Beganovich of Amra & Elma claims these virtual influencers are not a fad, but “a genuine game-changer, with millions and followers and A-list clients.”
Like the rest of digital marketing, influencers – and the agencies which monetise them - are here to stay. The constant sparring of their AIs, their algorithms and their data, with those of the social media platforms, will continue to improve their effectiveness and their efficiency.

As the Air Force works to modernize its cybersecurity practices, it wants to deploy artificial intelligence to better support its networks’ defensive measures so airmen get more time to do white-hat hacking and other higher-level tasks.
The plan is to automate and leverage algorithms that can learn from data to fix small issues, especially those that can easily be missed by a human. Fixing bugs and sifting through reams of threat reports are assignments better left to AI instead of overloaded human workforces, Lauren Knausenberger, chief innovation officer for the Air Force, said Wednesday during CrowdStrike’s Fal.Con for Public Sector Conference, produced by FedScoop and CyberScoop.
“We are just going to miss things the more we do manually,” Knausenberger said.
The Air Force would prefer its human cyber workforce to be “creative in an evil way” by spending more time simulating real-world hacks on the service’s technology.

She envisions human analysts being able to “team” with AI systems to identify where human brain power can apply the type of complex problem solving-skills that computers can’t apply on their own.
Using AI-enabled systems to recognize the most important cyberthreat information and then alert airmen is the goal, Knausenberger said.
“Until you get that right … you will be drowning” in reams of data, she said.
Another reason for the Air Force to promote AI: The cybersecurity workforce shortage has been acute in the government. Employers like the DOD often lag behind the private sector in benefits and pay. Adding AI-powered systems to the defensive workforce ultimately will lead to stronger security, Knausenberger said.
There are also ways to attract outside help, too. The Air Force has recently expanding its bug bounty programs, including new “Hack-a-Sat” events for ethical hackers to target satellites. The department even paid out $150,000 to a teenager in recent bug bounties, and the computer whiz was later offered a job in the Defense Department, Knausenberger said.

A humanoid actress named Erica will appear in b, a sci-fi flick that eerily mirrors the android's own origin story.The roboticist who created Erica actually taught her method acting through one-on-one sessions.Professional acting involves having some close encounters on set. Whether that means talking in tight quarters, rubbing shoulders, or sharing a kiss, none of these scenarios are safe amid the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Naturally, filming movies is extraordinarily difficult at the moment.But that isn't stopping Hollywood from trying.Say hello to Erica (seen above), a special kind of thespian who is immune to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. How's that? Because she's a humanoid robot. Erica will soon be the first artificially intelligent actor to take on the lead role in a film, according to The Hollywood Reporter.Erica will star in the forthcoming sci-fi movie b, the $70 million story of a scientist who has come up with a program to ""perfect"" human DNA (a la eugenics), which glitches and becomes dangerous, according to THR. So the scientist must help Erica, the AI organism that he's created, escape the lab.  This story aligns with Erica's real-world origin tale. Japanese scientists Hiroshi Ishiguro and Kohei Ogawa designed the humanoid robot to study human-computer interaction. Ishiguro is so embedded in this stuff that he's even created an android of his own daughter in the past, which Alex Mar describes beautifully in a 2017 WIRED profile of his ingenious, yet haunting work. For her performance in b, Ishiguro and Ogawa have taught Erica to act by applying method acting principles to artificial intelligence.""In other methods of acting, actors involve their own life experiences in the role,"" Sam Khoze, a producer involved with the film, told THR. ""But Erica has no life experiences. She was created from scratch to play the role. We had to simulate her motions and emotions through one-on-one sessions, such as controlling the speed of her movements, talking through her feelings and coaching character development and body language.""This isn't the first time Hollywood has gotten creative with its casting. Last year, MOI Worldwide and Image Engine announced they'll be using James Dean in Finding Jack, a live-action film about the Vietnam War. The twist, of course, is that James Dean has been dead for 65 years.The visual effects wizards at those studios are recreating Dean using a technique called ""full body"" CGI, which means the team will use actual footage of the actor, including photos and video. A separate actor, still unnamed, will provide his voice. Finding Jack is supposed to come out this Veteran's Day, but it's unclear if COVID-19 has impacted that timeline.You won't be able to see Erica's performance in b, meanwhile, until at least sometime in late 2021. Producers are still looking for a director and Erica's human co-stars, though Erica did complete some scenes in Japan back in 2019. The team behind the flick expects to finish shooting in Europe sometime in June 2021.

AI fuels boom in innovation, investment and jobs in Canada: U of T report





Thanks to the pioneering work of researchers like U of T’s Geoffrey Hinton, Toronto has emerged as a hub of AI innovation in a range of fields, including the global fight against COVID-19 (photo by Johnny Guatto)

Canada’s artificial intelligence sector is fuelling innovation, job creation and private sector investment – and University of Toronto researchers and entrepreneurs are playing a central role in that success, according to a report based on data compiled by Ottawa’s Global Advantage Consulting Group.
The report, prepared by U of T, found that Canada’s unique combination of public investment, private capital, research capacity and talent has generated over 50,000 jobs and attracted nearly $3 billion in investment since 2010, with the number of active AI firms in Canada doubling to more than 670 since 2015.
U of T alone has produced 81 active AI startups, according to Global Advantage, a research and analytics firm that provides ecosystem mapping and analysis services to private and public sector clients. In total, AI-powered startups connected to U of T have raised $183 million in funding and created over 600 jobs in the last five years, the report says.
Vivek Goel, U of T’s vice-president, research and innovation, and strategic initiatives, says the report offers further evidence of the success of the federal government’s Pan-Canadian AI Strategy, launched in 2017 with a $125-million commitment over five years.
“Canada, and Toronto in particular, have long been recognized as global hubs of AI research thanks to the pioneering work of people like [U of T University Professor Emeritus] Geoffrey Hinton, but in the past many people trained in U of T’s machine learning group ended up going abroad to work for big tech companies,” says Goel.
“This report shows that the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy has helped create the conditions necessary to retain that talent in Canada – presenting opportunities to be involved in further research and training – so we can have the talent supply needed to fuel Canadian research, innovation and application in business sectors.”
As an example, Goel cites the impact of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, launched three years ago with $50 million in support from the government of Ontario and another $80 million from industry partners, in “taking what was happening in the university, connecting it with the business community and getting it out into the marketplace before people in other countries could do it.”
The investment in Canada’s AI research foundation is now yielding important applications and advances in the fight to contain and treat the COVID-19 virus. A few of the research projects detailed in the report – titled Canada’s AI Ecosystem: Government Investment Propels Private Sector Growth – include:

At the Vector Institute, researchers are working on tools to treat the virus and help governments manage the public health impacts. Alán Aspuru-Guzik, a professor in U of T’s departments of chemistry and computer science, is using AI to identify molecules that can be used therapeutically to target SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
U of T startup DNAstack adopted its biomedical research software to create COVID Cloud, a tool for scientists to share and track the genetic development of the virus. 
BenchSci, co-founded by U of T PhD students and developed at U of T through the Entrepreneurship Hatchery, H2i (Health Innovation Hub) and the Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) uses machine learning to help scientists find and purchase antibodies for their experiments, saving time and money.  BenchSci is now using their technology to identify novel reagents to study the COVID-19 virus.

Health-related AI applications have drawn particular interest from private sector investors, with over 15 per cent of AI-related private investment between 2015 and 2019 going to companies operating in health care and related areas like cloud computing and cybersecurity.
Deep Genomics, an AI-powered drug discovery startup co-founded by U of T Professor Brendan Frey of the Edward S. Rogers Sr. department of electrical and computer engineering in the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering, is one of many AI startups in the health-care space. The company has so far raised $61 million, including a recent $40-million Series B financing, as it works to develop a drug candidate for Wilson disease, a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder, based on calculations performed by its systems.

U of T startups are also applying AI to a variety of other problems, from medical imaging to quantum computing and consumer research. The report underlines that Canada is an innovation leader in the AI sector, producing the most AI patents per million people among the G7 countries and China, while Toronto “has attracted the densest cluster of AI startups in the world.”
Blue J Legal, a Toronto startup co-founded by three members of U of T’s Faculty of Law, uses AI to predict the outcomes of tax and employment law cases. The company launched its Canadian tax law product in 2017 and employment law offering in 2018. In 2019, it expanded into the U.S. tax law market, where it has already secured more than a dozen law firms as clients.
Both Blue J Legal and Deep Genomics emerged from U of T’s expansive entrepreneurship ecosystem, having received early support from CDL and UTEST – two of U of T’s many startup accelerators.
Several of U of T’s AI startups will be in focus this week during Collision at Home, the online edition of one of the world’s fastest-growing tech conferences, which draws speakers, entrepreneurs, inventors, investors and business leaders from around the world. The event is being held virtually this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But U of T entrepreneurs, researchers and students will still have a major presence, with more than two dozen U of T startups scheduled to participate.

In all, U of T’s AI programs attracted $244 million in research funding between 2015 and 2019 – a period that saw substantial increases in funding for AI research from the federal government. This, in turn, has allowed Canada to outperform many countries in two key metrics: field-weighted citation impact of AI research publications and academic-corporate collaborations, the report says.
The report also notes that the expanding AI ecosystem around U of T is attracting philanthropists in addition to investors. That includes a $100-million gift to U of T from business leaders Heather Reisman and Gerald Schwartz. The money is being used to construct the Schwartz Reisman Innovation Centre, a 750,000 square foot complex that will anchor U of T’s cluster of AI and biomedical researchers, as well as entrepreneurs and their startups. It will also be home to the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society, which will explore the social implications of AI and other emerging technologies.
“If you look at the most successful innovation ecosystems, they always have an anchor academic institution – a leading global university; they always have anchor multinational corporations and they have a thriving startup ecosystem,” Goel says.
“We have all those pieces coming together around the AI and tech sector here.”

We listen to music with our ears, but also our eyes, watching with appreciation as the pianist’s fingers fly over the keys and the violinist’s bow rocks across the ridge of strings. When the ear fails to tell two instruments apart, the eye often pitches in by matching each musician’s movements to the beat of each part. 
A new artificial intelligence tool developed by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab leverages the virtual eyes and ears of a computer to separate similar sounds that are tricky even for humans to differentiate. The tool improves on earlier iterations by matching the movements of individual musicians, via their skeletal keypoints, to the tempo of individual parts, allowing listeners to isolate a single flute or violin among multiple flutes or violins. 
Potential applications for the work range from sound mixing, and turning up the volume of an instrument in a recording, to reducing the confusion that leads people to talk over one another on a video-conference calls. The work will be presented at the virtual Computer Vision Pattern Recognition conference this month.
“Body keypoints provide powerful structural information,” says the study’s lead author, Chuang Gan, an IBM researcher at the lab. “We use that here to improve the AI’s ability to listen and separate sound.” 
In this project, and in others like it, the researchers have capitalized on synchronized audio-video tracks to recreate the way that humans learn. An AI system that learns through multiple sense modalities may be able to learn faster, with fewer data, and without humans having to add pesky labels to each real-world representation. “We learn from all of our senses,” says Antonio Torralba, an MIT professor and co-senior author of the study. “Multi-sensory processing is the precursor to embodied intelligence and AI systems that can perform more complicated tasks.”
The current tool, which uses body gestures to separate sounds, builds on earlier work that harnessed motion cues in sequences of images. Its earliest incarnation, PixelPlayer, let you click on an instrument in a concert video to make it louder or softer. An update to PixelPlayer allowed you to distinguish between two violins in a duet by matching each musician’s movements with the tempo of their part. This newest version adds keypoint data, favored by sports analysts to track athlete performance, to extract finer grained motion data to tell nearly identical sounds apart.
The work highlights the importance of visual cues in training computers to have a better ear, and using sound cues to give them sharper eyes. Just as the current study uses musician pose information to isolate similar-sounding instruments, previous work has leveraged sounds to isolate similar-looking animals and objects. 
Torralba and his colleagues have shown that deep learning models trained on paired audio-video data can learn to recognize natural sounds like birds singing or waves crashing. They can also pinpoint the geographic coordinates of a moving car from the sound of its engine and tires rolling toward, or away from, a microphone. 
The latter study suggests that sound-tracking tools might be a useful addition in self-driving cars, complementing their cameras in poor driving conditions. “Sound trackers could be especially helpful at night, or in bad weather, by helping to flag cars that might otherwise be missed,” says Hang Zhao, PhD ’19, who contributed to both the motion and sound-tracking studies.
Other authors of the CVPR music gesture study are Deng Huang and Joshua Tenenbaum at MIT.

While scientists have succeeded at restoring some coral reefs, humans alone can’t save all the reefs that are dying across the globe, a NOAA reef restoration manager said this month.

Even in the best of conditions, human divers can spend only three or four hours per day working under water, said Tom Moore, coral reef restoration program manager for the National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration. And those best conditions are rare.


That’s not enough to halt the collapse of one of the planet’s most crucial ecosystems, Moore said at the EarthxOcean conference: half the world’s coral reefs have died and the rest are expected to perish in this century. That vanishing coral hosts 25 percent of the ocean’s biodiversity, Moore said, and supports fisheries that feed hundreds of millions of people and contribute billions of dollars to the global economy.

“We have to stop having coral biologists trying to stop this problem with PVC pipe and zip ties the way they’ve done it for a long time,” Moore said. “We have to challenge the assumption that coral-reef restoration has to be performed by snorkelers and scuba divers.”

PROMOTED
Even if human divers improved their efficiency tenfold, it wouldn’t be enough to halt the collapse of reef ecosystems, he said.
“We need to harness the power of automation, robotics and artificial intelligence to allow us to work at the scales that will be necessary to truly address this global challenge. Those solutions will not be available overnight, but we need to start inventing them now so that they’re available when we need them, while at the same time working hard with the tools that we have available today to make the change that we can make and begin to stabilize the system.”
Moore has his eye on the underwater robotics technology used by the offshore oil and gas industry. It involves heavy equipment operating at great depths and would have to be modified, he said, to work closer to the surface with delicate corals.

“A lot of these pieces are out there but they’re not being focused in this particular way,” Moore said.
“This is why I believe all the tech exists to solve this problem, it’s literally just a matter of getting all the right people in the right place at the same time,” he said.

“As you can imagine, doing those on the reef is going to be really complicated. You’ve got to have an underwater robot that’s able to navigate in and around coral heads, make a decision using AI to kind of put something in one place or another. ”
To do that, NOAA may host competitions for innovators to propose coral restoration technologies.
“Those of us who have looked closely firmly believe that the tech exists to solve the problem,” Moore said. “The challenge is huge, the goal is audacious, but saving coral reefs might just help to save the world.”Robotic engineer Tobias Kaupp prepares to launch a new robot submarine into Sydney Harbour, which is ...

Is artificial intelligence ready to move out of the labs and proofs of concept and into the mainstreams of enterprises? Leading industry observers say yes, it’s ready — but organizations may still need some preparation. “We’ve moved beyond the phase of ‘Is AI a shiny object?’ toward broader mainstream adoption and actual value creation,” says Bryce Hall, associate partner with McKinsey, noting that data from a survey of 2,300 executives shows a nearly 25% year-over-year increase in the use of AI in standard business processes.


Hall joined McKinsey colleague Michael Chui in a recent podcast Q&A, in which they note that while AI is being widely adopted, much of the work is confined to specific narrow use cases, versus more strategic enterprise-centric adoption. “We’re very early in this trend,” says Chui. “As much as we’re seeing this growth in adoption, less than a third of the companies that we surveyed have deployed AI in multiple businesses or functions.” Popular use cases in these initial stages of AI include improving logistics functions, reducing inventory, increasing inventory turns, and increasing overall equipment effectiveness, he adds.

These individual use cases are delivering positive results, Chui adds, estimating improvements — either for the top line or bottom line — of at least one percent to 10%.

At the same time, moving AI out of narrow use cases into wider deployments is “hard work,” Chui says, “not only because the technology problems are hard but also because the change management is really hard. There’s a reason why this doesn’t happen faster.”

PROMOTED
Part of the challenge is finding business requirements that can be satisfied through the use of AI — bringing to mind the old adage of a solution in search of a problem. Many of the emerging technologies around AI are fascinating, but it’s still unclear how businesses can capitalizing on these technologies. “For example, reinforcement learning is terrifically good at being able to train machines to play all kinds of games better, but not as obvious is how much value that can create in the world,” says Chui.
Another major industry survey concurs that AI is still in exploratory stages. Just five percent of 2,200 executives surveyed by MIT Sloan Management Review and underwritten by SAS are implementing AI widely across the organization, while 18% have implemented it in a few processes, and 19% are running pilot projects.

The MIT Sloan survey authors also outlined the work ahead to move AI deeper into the enterprise. CIOs and CTOs, for example, “will need to prioritize developing foundational technology capabilities, from infrastructure and cybersecurity to data management and development processes — areas in which those with more advanced AI implementations are already taking the lead.” AI also requires “significant changes to software development and deployment processes,” along with formal data governance efforts.

In addition, the MIT Sloan report points out, AI will require an increased focus on risk management and ethics. The survey “shows a broad awareness of the risks inherent in using AI, but few practitioners have taken action to create policies and processes to manage risks, including ethical, legal, reputational, and financial risks.”
Having the right combination of skills and competency is also essential. “It’s never just a technology challenge,” says McKinsey’s Hall. When looking at successful enterprise AI implementations, they are always aligned to business goals, and these enterprises are “doubling down on investing in current employees and upskilling and training them by creating analytics and AI academies.” Another common element is “internal collaboration and having processes in place to bring business leaders, technologists, and data scientists together to identify where there are collaboration opportunities, making it far more likely that the AI technologies actually generate business value.”

Content production helps connect brands with customers, governments with citizens and organizations with their supporters. But, while important, content production can also be a labor- and time-intensive task.







Producing articles, infographics, videos and a variety of other content requires a significant amount of work from writers and editors. With organizations producing and managing content daily, many have begun to turn to various technologies to help.
One of the more capable of these technologies is AI. The use of artificial intelligence content writing systems can help create, manage and analyze content across the production lifecycle and ease the burden that organizations feel.

Natural language and content production
One of the strengths of modern AI technology is its ability to understand, process and even generate human-readable content. One aspect of natural language processing is natural language generation (NLG), which uses machine learning to enable computers to transform structured data into natural language.
These systems take data from a variety of sources, including databases and quantitative sources, and turn it into narrative text. NLG-powered content generation systems are used to produce items such as reports, social media text, chatbot conversations, and custom content for web or mobile applications.
Advanced NLG systems can then take the text that has been generated and process it through content design systems that can give a human-like personality to the content.


Use cases and voice content creation
With NLG systems, large quantities of content can be generated in a short amount of time, thus helping an organization to save time while still reaching its content goals. Artificial intelligence content writing also enables brands to keep a consistent message and tone even if different departments produce content.
Content production outlets such as the Associated Press use AI to generate thousands of quarterly earnings reports and sports articles. Yahoo! Sports uses AI to produce weekly fantasy football reports, while the Orlando Magic basketball team uses AI to personalize in-app and email messaging to its fans.
Organizations are also turning to voice-based applications to reach their audience. The major voice assistant companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, are introducing NLG-powered offerings that enable companies to deliver original content to users without having to spend time crafting those messages.
Through the power of AI-enabled content production, organizations can integrate voice assistants with their back-end NLG platform to provide the voice assistant with subject matter expertise and industry-specific knowledge.
The traditional writing process takes time and needs to be edited and refined before being published. Because computers can work far faster than their human counterparts, artificial intelligence content writing systems can create thousands of pieces in a relatively short amount of time.
But humans aren't fully removed from this process. Rather than publishing the AI-generated pieces directly to the audience, they are instead sent to human editors for moderation, filtering and further editing.


Intelligent monitoring tools
Creating content is just one part of the content production process. Monitoring and measuring the content and how readers engage with it is equally important. Intelligent monitoring tools help companies track a variety of different metrics to make sure content companies produce effective and attractive content.
Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest want to keep users on their site. To do this, they must provide content to keep them engaged.
To assist with this, these companies are increasingly employing AI systems to show relevant and personalized content to each user. By continuously monitoring users, these platforms can improve their machine learning models, provide real-time feedback to advertisers and tweak their messaging for improved performance.
Additionally, AI is getting better at translating content into different languages. This is particularly important for multinational companies who want to reuse content but don't have writers that are fluent in multiple languages.
AI can accurately translate content, thus saving time, resources and money. Humans may still be the original content creator, but the AI-enabled system can take that work and replicate it across multiple languages and with culturally relevant content. This enables content developers to increase their reach.
Organizations are looking for ways to gain a competitive advantage over their competition while also delivering meaningful content and value to customers. Over the last few years, great strides have been made in using computers for content production and we see this trend continuing for years to come.

This article is part of our reviews of AI research papers, a series of posts that explore the latest findings in artificial intelligence.
Should you feel bad about pulling the plug on a robot or switch off an artificial intelligence algorithm? Not for the moment. But how about when our computers become as smart—or smarter—than us?
Debates about the consequences of artificial general intelligence (AGI) are almost as old as the history of AI itself. Most discussions depict the future of artificial intelligence as either Terminator-like apocalypse or Wall-E-like utopia. But what’s less discussed is how we will perceive, interact with, and accept artificial intelligence agents when they develop traits of life, intelligence, and consciousness.
Guide to Deep Learning Basics – by Springer
In a recently published essay, Borna Jalsenjak, scientist at Zagreb School of Economics and Management, discusses super-intelligent AI and analogies between biological and artificial life. Titled “The Artificial Intelligence Singularity: What It Is and What It Is Not,” his work appears in Guide to Deep Learning Basics, a collection of papers and treatises that explore various historic, scientific, and philosophical aspects of artificial intelligence.
Jalsenjak takes us through the philosophical anthropological view of life and how it applies to AI systems that can evolve through their own manipulations. He argues that “thinking machines” will emerge when AI develops its own version of “life,” and leaves us with some food for thought about the more obscure and vague aspects of the future of artificial intelligence.
AI singularity
Singularity is a term that comes up often in discussions about general AI. And as is wont with everything that has to do with AGI, there’s a lot of confusion and disagreement on what the singularity is. But a key thing that most scientists and philosophers agree that it is a turning point where our AI systems become smarter than ourselves. Another important aspect of the singularity is time and speed: AI systems will reach a point where they can self-improve in a recurring and accelerating fashion.
“Said in a more succinct way, once there is an AI which is at the level of human beings and that AI can create a slightly more intelligent AI, and then that one can create an even more intelligent AI, and then the next one creates even more intelligent one and it continues like that until there is an AI which is remarkably more advanced than what humans can achieve,” Jalsenjak writes.
To be clear, the artificial intelligence technology we have today, known as narrow AI, is nowhere near achieving such feat. Jalšenjak describes current AI systems as “domain-specific” such as “AI which is great at making hamburgers but is not good at anything else.” On the other hand, the kind of algorithms that is the discussion of AI singularity is “AI that is not subject-specific, or for the lack of a better word, it is domainless and as such it is capable of acting in any domain,” Jalsenjak writes.
This is not a discussion about how and when we’ll reach AGI. That’s a different topic, and also a focus of much debate, with most scientists in the belief that human-level artificial intelligence is at least decades away. Jalsenjack rather speculates of how the identity of AI (and humans) will be defined when we actually get there, whether it be tomorrow or in a century.
Is artificial intelligence alive?

There’s great tendency in the AI community to view machines as humans, especially as they develop capabilities that show signs of intelligence. While that is clearly an overestimation of today’s technology, Jasenjak also reminds us that artificial general intelligence does not necessarily have to be a replication of the human mind.
“That there is no reason to think that advanced AI will have the same structure as human intelligence if it even ever happens, but since it is in human nature to present states of the world in a way that is closest to us, a certain degree of anthropomorphizing is hard to avoid,” he writes in his essay’s footnote.
One of the greatest differences between humans and current artificial intelligence technology is that while humans are “alive” (and we’ll get to what that means in a moment), AI algorithms are not.
“The state of technology today leaves no doubt that technology is not alive,” Jalsenjak writes, to which he adds, “What we can be curious about is if there ever appears a superintelligence such like it is being predicted in discussions on singularity it might be worthwhile to try and see if we can also consider it to be alive.”
Albeit not organic, such artificial life would have tremendous repercussions on how we perceive AI and act toward it.
What would it take for AI to come alive?
Drawing from concepts of philosophical anthropology, Jalsenjak notes that living beings can act autonomously and take care of themselves and their species, what is known as “immanent activity.”
“Now at least, no matter how advanced machines are, they in that regard always serve in their purpose only as extensions of humans,” Jalsenjak observes.
There are different levels to life, and as the trend shows, AI is slowly making its way toward becoming alive. According to philosophical anthropology, the first signs of life take shape when organisms develop toward a purpose, which is present in today’s goal-oriented AI. The fact that the AI is not “aware” of its goal and mindlessly crunches numbers toward reaching it seems to be irrelevant, Jalsenjak says, because we consider plants and trees as being alive even though they too do not have that sense of awareness.
Another key factor for being considered alive is a being’s ability to repair and improve itself, to the degree that its organism allows. It should also produce and take care of its offspring. This is something we see in trees, insects, birds, mammals, fish, and practically anything we consider alive. The laws of natural selection and evolution have forced every organism to develop mechanisms that allow it to learn and develop skills to adapt to its environment, survive, and ensure the survival of its species.
On child-rearing, Jalsenjak posits that AI reproduction does not necessarily run in parallel to that of other living beings. “Machines do not need offspring to ensure the survival of the species. AI could solve material deterioration problems with merely having enough replacement parts on hand to swap the malfunctioned (dead) parts with the new ones,” he writes. “Live beings reproduce in many ways, so the actual method is not essential.”
When it comes to self-improvement, things get a bit more subtle. Jalsenjak points out that there is already software that is capable of self-modification, even though the degree of self-modification varies between different software.

Today’s machine learning algorithms are, to a degree, capable of adapting their behavior to their environment. They tune their many parameters to the data collected from the real-world, and as the world changes, they can be retrained on new information. For instance, the coronavirus pandemic disrupted may AI systems that had been trained on our normal behavior. Among them are facial recognition algorithms that can no longer detect faces because people are wearing masks. These algorithms can now retune their parameters by training on images of mask-wearing faces. Clearly, this level of adaptation is very small when compared to the broad capabilities of humans and higher-level animals, but it would be comparable to, say, trees that adapt by growing deeper roots when they can’t find water at the surface of the ground.
An ideal self-improving AI, however, would be one that could create totally new algorithms that would bring fundamental improvements. This is called “recursive self-improvement” and would lead to an endless and accelerating cycle of ever-smarter AI. It could be the digital equivalent of the genetic mutations organisms go through over the span of many many generations, though the AI would be able to perform it at a much faster pace.
Today, we have some mechanisms such as genetic algorithms and grid-search that can improve the non-trainable components of machine learning algorithms (also known as hyperparameters). But the scope of change they can bring is very limited and still requires a degree of manual work from a human developer. For instance, you can’t expect a recursive neural network to turn into a Transformer through many mutations.
Recursive self-improvement, however, will give AI the “possibility to replace the algorithm that is being used altogether,” Jalsenjak notes. “This last point is what is needed for the singularity to occur.”
By analogy, looking at determined characteristics, superintelligent AIs can be considered alive, Jalsenjak concludes, invalidating the claim that AI is an extension of human beings. “They will have their own goals, and probably their rights as well,” he says, “Humans will, for the first time, share Earth with an entity which is at least as smart as they are and probably a lot smarter.”
Would you still be able to unplug the robot without feeling guilt?
Being alive is not enough
At the end of his essay, Jalsenjak acknowledges that the reflection on artificial life leaves many more questions. “Are characteristics described here regarding live beings enough for something to be considered alive or are they just necessary but not sufficient?” He asks.
Having just read I Am a Strange Loop by philosopher and scientist Douglas Hofstadter, I can definitely say no. Identity, self-awareness, and consciousness are other concepts that discriminate living beings from one another. For instance, is a mindless paperclip-builder robot that is constantly improving its algorithms to turn the entire universe into paperclips alive and deserving of its own rights?
Free will is also an open question. “Humans are co-creators of themselves in a sense that they do not entirely give themselves existence but do make their existence purposeful and do fulfill that purpose,” Jalsenjak writes. “It is not clear will future AIs have the possibility of a free will.”
And finally, there is the problem of the ethics of superintelligent AI. This is a broad topic that includes the kinds of moral principles AI should have, the moral principles humans should have toward AI, and how AIs should view their relations with humans.
The AI community often dismisses such topics, pointing out to the clear limits of current deep learning systems and the far-fetched notion of achieving general AI.

But like many other scientists, Jalsenjak reminds us that the time to discuss these topics is today, not when it’s too late. “These topics cannot be ignored because all that we know at the moment about the future seems to point out that human society faces unprecedented change,” he writes.
In the full essay, available at Springer, Jalsenjak provides in-depth details of artificial intelligence singularity and the laws of life. The complete book, Guide to Deep Learning Basics, provides more in-depth material about the philosophy of artificial intelligence.

On 25 June this year, a first virtual mission was organised in Paris between Nadine Girault, Minister for International Relations and the Francophonie and Minister for Immigration, Francization and Integration, and Cédric O, Secretary of State to the Minister for the Economy and Finance and the Minister for Action and Public Accounts, in charge of the Digital Agenda. They took this opportunity to take stock of the work undertaken by Quebec and France in the digital field and more specifically in artificial intelligence.

The Minister and the Secretary of State welcomed the establishment of the Montreal International Centre of Expertise in Artificial Intelligence (MICIA), one of the two centres of expertise, along with the one in Paris, of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPIA), whose secretariat is provided by the OECD.
They also wished to reiterate their willingness to contribute, together with the founding partners of the PMIA, to the responsible development and human-centred use of artificial intelligence, while respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms and their common democratic values. They welcomed the organization, by CIEIMIC, of the first international meeting of the PMIA multi-stakeholder expert group in Montreal in December 2020. Québec will participate actively in this new international partnership through a Canada-Québec Memorandum of Understanding, modelled on the UNESCO agreement.
At the end of the meeting, the ministers highlighted the three-year agreement between Université Laval (more specifically the Observatoire sur les impacts sociétaux de l’intelligence artificielle-OBVIA), the ENS and the Abeona Foundation, which allows for the invitation of a professor from OBVIA to lead the Abeona-ENS-OBVIA Visiting Research Chair in Artificial Intelligence and Social Justice, more specifically through the prism of equity, diversity and inclusion.
For one year, he will be able to develop work on artificial intelligence and social justice and interact with researchers from the Paris and Quebec ecosystems in the fields of artificial intelligence, human and social sciences and health.
Quebec-France cooperation


During their meeting, Mr. O. and Ms. Girault discussed possibilities for cooperation between the Paris and Montreal centres of expertise of the PMIA.
OBVIA and the ENS offer a research ecosystem bringing together a vast network of teaching and research institutions, various non-governmental organizations, businesses, government players and various groups from Quebec, Canada, France and internationally.
The guest chair will allow the selected professor to participate in various seminars and symposiums, both in France and in Quebec, including the Semaine numériQC.
Digital technology is at the heart of several Franco-Quebec initiatives in various fields, such as :

France-Quebec digital pathway for incubators and accelerators for startups;
Seminars on pedagogical innovation in education ;
Work on the online discoverability of French-language cultural content under the responsibility of the Ministries of Culture in France and Quebec;
Exchanges on government digital transition, telework and
digital literacy in the public service.


Québec and its metropolis, recognized as a world innovation pole, now has an ecosystem of more than 300 researchers and doctoral students, 15,000 experts and more than 11,000 students in fields related to artificial intelligence. This constitutes one of the world’s largest concentrations of researchers in deep learning.
More broadly, Quebec has a pool of 91,000 information and communications technology specialists working in nearly 5,000 organizations.
The next alternating First Ministers’ Meeting (FMM) is scheduled to take place in Quebec City in 2021.

The country-wide lockdown to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic in India resulted in an unprecedented drop in air pollution levels across cities. As people practise social distancing and marvel at the positive impact of the lack of human mobility on the environment, this is an opportune time to curate and run an effective air pollution campaign so that the new normal might be brighter.
Air pollution causes nearly two million deaths in India every year. As many as 21 out of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are in India. Yet, public outrage and civic action towards air pollution are sporadic and scattered, peaking during Diwali but remaining low-key for the rest of the year.
In light of this trend, Clean Air Fund and Quilt.AI studied the history and impact of 30 major environmental and public health campaigns in India since 2015. We sought to answer some key questions: What makes a campaign effective? What are the communication cues adopted by them? What is the role of timing and semiotics?
We analysed 21 million data points on online search behaviour for air pollution, more than 7,000 tweets, over 5,000 images and 63 Facebook pages using Quilt’s Culture A.I. tools, including emotion and linguistic analysis. We found that the nature of the air pollution campaigns in India range from the raw to the curated.
While the former represents an unvarnished truth via unfiltered images and dense rhetoric, the latter uses animated or highly edited images and sophisticated media strategies to tie local truths to global discourse.
Campaigns also differ based on the types of information they share. While some of them target informed citizens by highlighting facts and accurate information, others target passionate advocates with poignant images and moving tales to inspire individuals to act together.
Based on this understanding, we observed five broad profiles of air pollution campaigners. They are candid scientists, bridge builders, local crusaders, global activists and fearmongers.

Candid scientists
These are typically research-based organisations consisting of scientists and knowledge seekers. Their campaign strategy is to raise accurate awareness about the issue and work with various stakeholders and politicians to change policies.
They seek to convince their target audience using statistics and academic or technical jargon to precisely frame the issue and provide a glimpse into formal knowledge-sharing events. The most common phrases identified by our artificial intelligence (A.I.) include capacity building, adverse health effects and sustainable development.
This section believes that the challenges of air pollution can be solved by establishing collective mechanisms informed by fact. These campaigns use unpolished images, showing researchers and knowledge seekers hard at work during workshops and symposiums on their social media channels. The top A.I.-detected emotion from their posts is collective bonding.
Bridge builders
Bridge builders range from corporations to grassroots organisations. They are flexible communicators seeking to raise awareness on climate change. Using a spectrum of messaging, they aim to have a message that can appeal to a broad range of stakeholders.
They highlight connections between their main issue and popular issues with wide appeal. Bridge builder campaigns typically use mainstream phrases like world, climate change, mental health, and clean energy.
To them, air pollution can be solved by having a more informed society that has a strong sense of community. Almost 10% of their tweets contained the word we, while the top A.I.-detected emotion is collective bonding at 50%.
From plenary sessions and infographics to protest marches, these movements find campaign processes, messages and actions that appeal to multiple sectors and audiences.
Local crusaders
Local crusaders are grassroots organisations and local advocacy initiatives that seek to inspire the everyday citizen to act. They use simple but emotive messages in native languages. Images uploaded on social media are unfiltered, symbolic pictures of fierce demonstrations and successful community projects, invoking feelings of success and community, whilst collectively fighting the good fight.
These initiatives are highly localised, often in rural settings, in order to spur communities to join the movement. The top detected emotion is collective bonding. Local crusader campaigns differentiate themselves with the second top AI-detected emotion, which is emotional. Terms like rich soil, abundant water, lungs, beating heart and dream dominate the list of commonly used phrases.
Global activists
Global activists are the organisations inhabiting the archetype of activist-driven NGOs aiming for collective action. They reference global movements, politicised issues, startling facts, and create eye-catching infographics to inspire individual change and community action.
The top AI-detected emotions in this case are collective bonding (55%) and emotional (26%). This cluster also has the highest percentage of detected detached reality (4.3% higher than average) and the campaigns have a polarising effect due to the use of politicised perspectives.
While this creates a strong sense of community and results in greater reach, they also inadvertently cause an ‘us versus them’ sentiment, hindering the effectiveness of cross-sector partnerships.
Fearmonger
The fearmonger is not explicitly found in climate campaigns but could be an effective strategy to bring stronger attention to air pollution. Major political parties use this style of campaigning and tend to have strong, nationalistic undertones.

Multimedia uploads are a mixture of highly curated and highly raw, emphasizing the message of diversity and inclusion. The majority of messages are about specific issues that should be changed. However, for every 4-5 progressive messages, there is one repeat message about nationalism and ‘the enemy’ who we must fight against. This strategy could be effective for air pollution campaigns, especially if it is framed as a war that needs to be fought.
Each profile of campaigners has their own unique strengths; collaboration and strategic partnerships are likely to make air pollution campaigns more effective.
What makes a campaign effective?
After understanding existing and past digital air pollution campaigns in India and the counter-narratives they are faced with, we developed an online effectiveness framework that gave us insight into which campaigns have the greatest online reach and effectiveness. However, this is not a reflection of their overall impact, as offline interventions and impact are not taken into consideration.
Timing and usage of certain words are important elements of any effective campaign. We found that both the search volume and rate of change for the following air pollution-related words rise significantly between the months of October and January each year and can be used more: air pollution, causes of air pollution, air purifier, effects of pollution, PM 2.5, Diwali pollution, and anti-pollution mask.
The majority of campaigns we analysed launch in May. However, based on search behaviour, it is more strategic to launch in October and finish by February of the following year.

But as Black Lives Matter protests spread and corporations faced pressure to address systemic racism, Francis has seen his workload explode this month, from offering emotional support to the group’s 450 members to meeting with top executives to ensure the company responds in a meaningful way.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeFrancis says he’s grateful to have the ear of the chief executive officer Hans Vestberg, who has been open to the group’s request for Juneteenth and Election Day to be paid holidays and for additional transparency on workforce demographics. But pushing for black representation in the midst of police violence and protests has turned what he said was once a “fun second job” into a heavy obligation that competes with the demands of his real work, without additional time or pay“You’re called to do this work in one sense,” Francis said, “but it’s almost like if you don’t, your voice won’t be heard.”Black tech founders say venture capital needs to move past ‘diversity theater’Black employee groups are facing such tensions as corporate America grapples with concerns about racism. In the tech industry, which is still largely white, Asian, and male, the tensions have been particularly pronounced in recent weeks as companies have leaned heavily on these groups to host panels on race, vet company statements, allocate donations to racial justice nonprofits, and shepherd new diversity initiatives.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSeventeen current and former leaders of “employee resource groups” (ERGs) — for black, Latino, LGBTQ and women workers — said in interviews they welcome the visibility and access to upper management. But they worry these programs can give business leaders a pass on diversity by allowing them to demonstrate support for minority groups without diversifying the people in charge. And some say pushing for change can hurt their careers.💻Follow TechnologyFollow“The dependence on ERGs has stifled the industry because it gives a false sense of progress,” by saddling volunteers with a small budget and disproportionate responsibilities, said Dominique Hollins, a veteran of Google and eBay who helped launch an annual summit of black and Latino groups in the Bay Area.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextThe Republicans are here.

Some are starting to acknowledge the burden it puts on employees.In the past year, Twitter has incorporated group leadership into performance reviews, which is tied to compensation.Francesca Fontenot, Twitter’s head of global business resource groups, said in a statement that Twitter’s employee groups “are blazing a trail on our journey to becoming the world’s most inclusive and diverse tech company. They play a central role in promoting a culture where everyone can bring their full authentic selves to work and belong.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementVerizon declined to comment for this story but pointed to a June 1 statement by Vestberg that the company donated $10 million to social justice groups and that diversity “makes us and the world better.”Tech companies also note that these employee-run groups are one facet of a larger strategy to diversify their ranks. Firms have also opted to hire executives whose sole focus is on equity and inclusion, train employees about unconscious racial bias, and increase the pipeline of talent by partnering with schools and donating to skill-training programs.Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, after meeting with Google’s black employee resource group, this month committed to a 30 percent improvement on the number of executives from underrepresented groups at Google’s senior level by 2025.Story continues below advertisementDespite these efforts, most tech companies have not significantly increased the percent of black and Latino employees in the past six years, according to public diversity reports.AdvertisementThe idea of workplace affinity groups entered corporate America more than 50 years ago with Xerox, as a response to anti-black prejudice following the 1964 riots in Rochester, N.Y., where Xerox was founded.Today, group leaders said their duties stretched beyond offering members a sense of belonging. They were frequently asked to serve as brand ambassadors, diversity strategists, recruiters, event planners and focus groups for policies and features affecting users from their community. The annual budgets for these services ranged from $1,000 to $20,000 a year. Members are sent to conferences such as AfroTech and Grace Hopper to help recruit.Story continues below advertisementGroup leaders said the impact this work had on their careers depended on their manager’s view of diversity. Many said their managers saw time spent leading employee groups as a distraction, even when it did not impact job performance. Others said they were advised to stop participating. Some felt it was the reason they were held back from expected raises and promotions.Advertisement“It may appear to the outside as though the black ERGs are listened to the most, but it is often when leadership is looking to leverage them,” said a former leader of a black employee group at a social networking company.At Microsoft, chief diversity officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre says input from employee groups brings “tremendous impact and influence to the work we do as a company in many areas.” For instance, groups helped shape how Microsoft approached Juneteenth, offering paid time off while being careful not to frame it as a holiday “but instead to ask all employees, including those who are not members of the Black and African American community, to dedicate time and space to accelerate individual learning and engagement on the issues.” Groups also helped Microsoft curate a list of related books, podcasts and films.As big corporations say ‘black lives matter,’ their track records raise skepticismOutside of the biggest tech companies, most tech firms don’t have an executive focused on diversity and inclusion. And leaders of employee-run groups say there is high turnover for that role, which often reports to human resources rather than the CEO. This leaves driven but untrained employees to pick up the slack, which has been the case as companies try to find the right way to respond to demands for racial justice.With protests, silence is ‘not an option’ for Corporate AmericaAt Foursquare, which does not have a designated role responsible for diversity and inclusion, two black employees who are members of Fourmation, a multicultural employee resource group, volunteered to participate in a panel on race with two speakers who have publicly shown strong support for the Black Lives Matter movement, including co-founder Dennis Crowley, said director of communications Jennifer Yu, one of Fourmation’s leaders.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn an all-hands meeting at SoFi, CEO Anthony Noto told everyone to listen to a recording of a meeting held for members of black employee group SoulFi on coping with trauma, according to two employees. Early this month, Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson announced that the video game company’s black employee group would organize a day of forums and virtual activities to celebrate Juneteenth.Facebook employees said they were ‘caught in an abusive relationship’ with Trump as internal debates ragedIn recent weeks, the groups have also had to keep an eye on backlash from co-workers who are uncomfortable with growing support of the Black Lives Matter movement and attention on racial inequality in the workplace.Nicole Sanchez, the former vice president of social impact at GitHub and founder of Vaya Consulting, a Berkeley, Calif., firm that helps companies improve diversity, said a black employee group at a tech company recently asked for her help when company conversations on Slack got out of hand after a white co-worker raised questions about George Floyd’s “rap sheet.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We learned that leadership was waiting for the black ERG to say something, which first and foremost is not their job,” Sanchez said. She declined to name the company.Sanchez said tech companies could do much more to fix underlying disparities in their organizations if they approached diversity like any other business initiative.“They can send a freaking rocket out to space but can’t figure out how to how to project manage [diversity, equity and inclusion],” Sanchez said. “Just do it the same way. Put smart people who are experts on it, put the resources behind, give it goals, give it room to breathe, give it room to innovate, and rewarded it accordingly.”'Make the hire. Send the wire' has emerged as a rallying cry for Silicon Valley's black leadersJustworks, a New York-based software start-up, decided to start paying ERGs. Spokesperson Elliot Stephenson said he could not share details about the program, which was put into place this month, but Justworks plans to have if for a year and then measure the results.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Compensating ERGs for the additional work they do for the company is only fair,” he said.Sanchez suggested a different route. If employers are depending on the group to implement their diversity strategy, “then people need to be released from their 9-to-5 jobs to do it,” she said. “And if you’ve got people being released from their 9-to-5 jobs, you clearly have a job function for which you need to hire.”Silicon Valley’s two-tiered system for white-collar workers is under pressure as coronavirus spreadsScrutiny of how the tech industry uses employee resource groups intensified this month after black tech workers who previously led employee groups at Twitter and Slack questioned tech leaders’ claims to support the black community.Raki Wane, who previously led Twitter’s employee resource group, Blackbirds, and now works in policy communications at Instagram, urged companies to rethink the way they use black employees to defend their reputation.“If you, an employer have deferred the work of supporting the black community to the black employees without recognizing them beyond empty platitudes, or pointed to your black employees to absolve yourselves, maybe reassess that?” Wane wrote on Twitter.Engineer Duretti Hirpa, who helped start and run Earth Tones, Slack’s employee group for people of color, tweeted, “Running an ERG hurt my career but it helped my soul.”After her manager told her the effort she invested in the group was “extracurricular,” Hirpa stepped down from the role. In retrospect, she wonders if the additional labor mainly served to bolster Slack’s reputation. (Slack declined to comment.)“The best thing I did there was making a whole group of people feel important and that somebody cared what happened to them,” she said, but, “I don’t think I would organize one again myself. It’s a little too much of my heart.""Correction: An earlier version of this story suggested the name of Slack’s employee resource group for black employees is “Earth Tones.” The name of the black employee group is “Mahogany,” while “Earth Tones” is the employee group for people of color more broadly.

Web scraping has been around almost as long as there has been a web to scrape. The technology forms the cornerstone of search services like Google and Bing and can extract large amounts of data.







Data collection on the web tends to be at the mercy of how it is presented, and many sites actively discourage web scraping. However, developers can create web scraping applications in languages such as Python or Java to help bring data into a variety of AI applications. It is crucial for developers to carefully think about pipelines they use for acquiring their data. Each step of this process -- getting the right data, cleaning it and then organizing it into the appropriate format for their needs -- must be reviewed.
These pipelines are a continual work in progress. The perfect web scraping pipeline for today may have to be completely revamped for tomorrow. Knowing this, there are a variety of tools and best practices that can help automate and refine these pipelines and keep organizations on the right path.

Web scraping applications and AI
Web scraping involves writing a software robot that can automatically collect data from various webpages. Simple bots might get the job done, but more sophisticated bots use AI to find the appropriate data on a page and copy it to the appropriate data field to be processed by an analytics application.
AI web scraping-based use cases include e-commerce, labor research, supply chain analytics, enterprise data capture and market research, said Sarah Petrova, co-founder at Techtestreport. These kinds of applications rely heavily on data and the syndication of data from different parties. Commercial applications use web scraping to do sentiment analysis about new product launches, curate structured data sets about companies and products, simplify business process integration and predictively gather data.
One specific web scraping project includes curating language data for non-English natural language processing (NLP) models or capturing sports statistics for building new AI models for fantasy sports analysis. Burak Özdemir, a web developer based in Turkey, used web scraping to build a neural network model for NLP tasks in Turkish.



Though web scraping has existed for a long time, the use of AI for web extraction has become a game changer.


Sayid ShabeerChief product officer, HighRadius




""Although there are so many pretrained models that can be found online for English, it's much harder to find a decent data set for other languages,"" Özdemir said. He has been experimenting with scraping Wikipedia and other platforms that have structured text to train and test his models -- and his work can provide a framework for others looking to develop and train NLP in non-English languages.


The tools of web scraping
There is a variety of tools and libraries that developers can use to jumpstart their web scraping projects. Primarily, Python has web scraping technology readily available via online libraries.
Python plays a significant role in AI development with focus on web scraping, Petrova said. She recommended considering libraries like Beautiful Soup, lxml, MechanicalSoup, Python Requests, Scrapy, Selenium and urllib.
Each tool has its own strength and they can often complement one another. For example, Scrapy is an open source and collaborative framework for extracting data that is useful for data mining, monitoring and automated testing. Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. Petrova said she deploys it for modeling scrape scripts as the library provides simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching and modifying a parse tree.


Augmenting data with web scraping
AI algorithms are often developed on the front end to learn which sections of a webpage contain fields such as product data, review or price. Petrova noted that combining web scraping with AI, the process of data augmentation can become more efficient.
""Web scraping, especially smart, AI-driven, data extraction, cleansing, normalization and aggregation solutions, can significantly reduce the amount of time and resources organizations have to invest in data gathering and preparation relative to solution development and delivery,"" said Julia Wiedmann, machine learning research engineer, at Diffbot, a structured web search service.
Petrova said common data augmentation techniques include:

extrapolation (relevant fields are updated or provided with values);
tagging (common records are tagged to a group, making it easier to understand and differentiate for the group);
aggregation (using mathematical values of averages and means -- values are estimated for relevant fields, if needed); and
probability techniques (based on heuristics and analytical statistics -- values are populated based on the probability of events).



Using AI for resilient scraping
Websites are built to be human-readable and not machine-readable, which makes it hard to extract at scale and across different page layouts. Anyone who has tried to aggregate and maintain data knows what a difficult task this can be -- whether it be a manually compiled database with typos, missing fields, and duplicates or the variability of online content publication practices, Wiedmann said.
Her team has developed AI algorithms that use the same cues as a human to detect the information that should be scraped. She has also found that it is important to integrate outputs into applied research or test environments first. There can be hidden variability tied to the publication practices of the sources. Data quality assurance routines can help minimize the manual data maintenance.
""Designing systems that minimize the amount of manual maintenance will reduce errors and data misuse,"" Wiedmann said.


Improving data structure
AI can also structure data collected with web scraping to improve the way it can be used by other applications.
""Though web scraping has existed for a long time, the use of AI for web extraction has become a game changer,"" said Sayid Shabeer, chief product officer at HighRadius, an AI software company.
Traditional web scraping can't extract structured data from unstructured documents automatically, but recent advancements built AI algorithms that work in data extraction in a similar fashion to humans and that continue to learn as well. Shabeer's team used these types of bots for extracting remittance information for cash applications from retail partners. The web aggregation engine regularly logs into retailer websites and looks for remittance information. Once the information becomes available, the virtual agents automatically capture the remittance data and provide it in a digital format.
From there, a set of rules can be applied to further enhance the quality of data and bundle it with the payment information. AI models allow the bots to master a variety of tasks rather than have them focus on just one process.
To build these bots, Shabeer's team collated the common class names and HTML tags that are used on various retailer's websites and fed these into the AI engine. This was used as training data to ensure that the AI engine could handle any new retailer portals that were being added with minimal to no manual intervention. Over time, the engine became more and more capable of extracting data without any intervention.


Limitations of web scraping
In a recent case in which LinkedIn tried to prevent HiQ Labs from scraping its data for analytics purposes, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that web scraping for analytics and AI can be legal. However, there are still a variety of ways that websites may not intentionally or accidentally break web scraping applications.
Petrova said that some of the common limitations she has encountered include:

Scraping at scale. Scraping a single page is straightforward, but there are challenges in scraping millions of websites, including managing the codebase, collecting data and maintaining a data warehouse.
Pattern changes. Each website periodically changes its user interface.
Anti-scraping technologies. Some websites use anti-scraping technologies.
JavaScript-based dynamic content. Websites that heavily rely on JavaScript and Ajax to render dynamic content makes data extraction difficult.
Honeypot traps. Some website designers put honeypot traps inside websites to detect web spiders and deliver false information. This can involve generating links that normal users can't see but crawlers can.
Quality of data. Records that do not meet the quality guidelines will affect the overall integrity of the data.



Browser vs. back end
Web scraping is generally done by a headless browser that can scour webpages independent of any human activity. However, there are AI chatbot add-ons that scrape data as a background process running in the browser that can help users find new information. These front-end programs use AI to decide how to communicate the appropriate information to a user.
Marc Sloan, co-founder and CEO at Scout, an AI web scraping chatbot, said they originally did this by using a headless browser in Python that pulled webpage content via a network of proxies. Information was extracted from the content using a variety of techniques. Sloan and his team used Spacy to extract entities and relations from unstructured text into knowledge graphs using Neo4j. Convolutional networks were used to identify features such as session type, session similarity and session endpoints.
They have since moved the processing into the user's browser itself running in JavaScript to preserve privacy. And in order to run better in the browser, they have simplified the data models. Sloan said he believes this is only the beginning. The development of different kinds of AI agents that run locally to help people automate their interactions with various sites is only going to continue in the future.

Tertiary institutions are increasingly using artificial intelligence and students' personal information to spot students who are at risk of dropping out.

The measures are part of a national push to dramatically reduce long-standing failure rates, particularly among Māori and Pasifika students.
This year University of Canterbury began using a new computer system it developed to spot struggling students before they failed papers or dropped out altogether.
The university's deputy vice-chancellor academic, Catherine Moran, said it was using machine learning to monitor what students were doing in their courses.
""We use machine learning, an artificial intelligence system, that pulls in all the data for the students as they're doing their work online,"" she said.
""So for instance, whether they're watching a lecture, or whether they're doing a discussion with their classmates or whether they're reading the notes from their lectures. Everything on the learning management platform, that information all gets pulled into the AI machine and it creates a pattern of what the students are doing for each course.
""If a student falls outside the expected amount, if they're not engaging at all, if they're not clicking on to their LEARN page, not looking at their notes, we can see that. That triggers an alert and the students get a text immediately.""
The text would remind students to log into their course, and if they did not within a couple of days, they would be sent a second text and university staff would follow up in person.
The system flagged 1000 students this year and a mixture of text messages and personal contact got most of them back on track very quickly, she said.
Twenty of the students needed intensive support or counselling, but Moran said even a single text message could make a huge difference to a student's prospects.
""For some of them, they just weren't sure how to navigate some of the systems, they got a little bit lost around logging in, they didn't like their courses and so a few of them did actually come back and say 'well thanks, I had kind of given up'.""
The move from school to first-year study was a big change that many students found difficult.
Nationally, about 20 percent of first year students dropped out and the university hoped it could dramatically reduce that.
Waikato Institute of Technology was developing its own alert system to identify students who might need help.
Its executive director of products and planning Warwick Pitts said it had already identified that personal factors played a big role in student success and during the lockdown had checked in with students every 10 days to find out how they were going.
""We're asking students around how they're coping financially, what's their learning environment at home like, how are they balancing study and home commitments.
""Those data points are then going to be plugged into the system to be able to give us that fuller version of what student need is, or risk, just beyond grades and are they attending classes.""
Pitts said the institute had also overhauled the way it provided support for students.
Students no longer had to go to a special office to access academic support - instead those staff were based in classes with students.
""We've also introduced a tuakana/teina model where students that have successfully completed the course come back and help coach and mentor other students during that semester. And we're seeing for those learners a 10 to 15 percent higher course completion rate.""
Tertiary Education Commission's deputy chief executive, learner success, Paora Ammunson said the institute's work was new and exciting.
""It's building on the work that all tertiary providers will have done around understanding their students, but what we're doing for New Zealand now is taking that to a newer level and really deeply understanding what is driving attrition, and the times attrition that occurs and how we can intervene to stop that happening,"" he said.
The commission was also supporting the University of Waikato, Te Wananga o Raukawa, and Manukau Institute of Technology to trial new ways of working with students.
""This is a key part part of our wider New Zealand goals of supporting Māori achievement, Pasifika achievement, supporting the achievement of New Zealanders with disabilities,"" he said.
The biggest disparity in the tertiary education system was in degree completion, where the gap between Māori and Pasifika students and other learners was about 16-18 percent, Ammunson said.
It was clear that students who were the first in their families to do tertiary study needed more support right from the start of their enrolment, he said.
""That transition from high school to tertiary and the first year experience is where the biggest gains can be made.""

  <ul>
    <li>£13.5 million of funding from government will help bolster the introduction of new and diverse talent into digital and tech roles</li>
    <li>an estimated 2,500 places will be available on new government funded <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> or data science conversion courses, with 1,000 scholarships offered to students from underrepresented backgrounds</li>
    <li>funding has been awarded to 18 universities who are working with partner providers to deliver courses in 28 universities and colleges across England</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Graduates will have the opportunity to <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/joinyouraifuture/"" class=""govuk-link"">apply</a> for a place on new artificial intelligence (<abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>) and data science masters courses starting in autumn 2020, Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden announced today (Wednesday 10 June). .</p>

<p>The move will enable 2,500 people to develop new digital skills or retrain to help find new employment in the UK’s cutting-edge <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science sectors.</p>

<p>Backed by £13.5 million of government funding, the government has joined forces with the Office for Students, universities and industry partners to increase the number of highly-skilled workers in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science roles. The cash will provide places for graduates from a range of backgrounds - both those that have  a degree in science, technology, engineering, maths or social sciences and those that have studied other subjects to date.</p>

<p>Scholarships will also be made available to support applications from diverse backgrounds.</p>

<p>Courses are open to anyone who meets a participating university’s entry requirements and details of how to apply are available on the universities’ websites. Eligible applicants can apply for a scholarship through their university. Please visit the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/for-students/planning-to-study/study-artificial-intelligence-and-data-science-as-a-postgraduate/"" class=""govuk-link"">Office for Student’s website</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Applicants could include people returning to work after a career break and looking to retrain in a new profession, under-represented groups in the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and digital workforce. 1000 scholarships will specifically target the female, black and disabled demographics.</p>

<p>Statistics from a Tech Nation and Royal Society report reveal women make up only 19 per cent of the tech workforce and people from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (<abbr title=""black, Asian and minority ethnic"">BAME</abbr>) background represent just 4 per cent of the UK tech industry.</p>

<p>Successful students can use flexible and part time study options so they can fit their studies around their daily lives. Students can also undertake paid work placements to help maximise their employment opportunities at the end of their course which could see them land roles as machine learning engineers, data scientists, research scientists or <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> architects.</p>

<p>The announcement is part of the government’s commitment to increase R&amp;D investment to 2.4% of GDP by 2027.</p>

<p>Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is vital we increase diversity across our tech sector and give everyone with the aptitude and talent the opportunity to build a successful career.</p>

  <p>This will help make sure artificial intelligence developed in the UK reflects the needs and make-up of society as a whole which will also  help mitigate the risk of biased technologies being developed.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Through these new <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science conversion courses we are working with industry and academia to develop and maintain the best <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> workforce in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science Minister Amanda Solloway said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From disease diagnosis to driverless vehicles, demand for a diverse new pipeline of talent in the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and digital workforce has never been greater.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">By working with our leading universities and industry partners, I am delighted that we are providing students from all backgrounds the chance to upskill and help tackle some of the most complex challenges of our time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Creating a more diverse future workforce will help with the design of new technology that has the potential to help tackle some of the greatest social challenges of our time - from protecting our environment to transforming the way we live and work and also saving lives by detecting signs of diseases earlier.</p>

<p>Chris Millward, director for fair access and participation at the Office for Students, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In recent years we have seen significant and increasing demand for digital skills in a range of fields. From healthcare and biosciences, to industry and transport – harnessing artificial intelligence and data science will be crucial in tackling significant global challenges for years to come.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">It is also critical that graduates from all backgrounds have equal opportunities to gain the skills that employers need. With new <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science conversion courses across the country, and scholarships available to students from underrepresented backgrounds, this programme will both help tackle skills gaps and increase choice and opportunities for all students.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Skills Champion Dame Wendy Hall quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">It is imperative that we continue to grow the pathways that supply good <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and Data Science jobs. Introducing new and diverse talent will continue to maintain the UK’s position as a global leader in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and Innovation. These conversion courses and the scholarships attached demonstrate the importance we place on diversity and talent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark Martin <abbr title=""Member of the Order of the British Empire"">MBE</abbr>, co-founder of UK BlackTech said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data science courses and scholarships will help boost uptake of these technologies across the country and prepare the next generation to tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic and social injustices.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">It’s important we encourage more homegrown talent from different backgrounds to access these opportunities so we can develop better tech tools, services and organisations that truly reflects our nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to these new conversion courses,  the Government is also supporting industry-funded <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Masters, prestigious Alan Turing Institute <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> research fellowships and 16 dedicated Centres at universities across the country to train 1000 extra <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> PhDs.</p>

<p>To boost the use of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> in the public sector the World Economic Forum has published new guidelines to help the public sector embrace the technology to help drive efficiencies and prepare for future risks.</p>

<p>The guidance will also help established companies, start-ups and new entrants to the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> sector compete on a level playing field for government contracts and drive adoption of ethical practices by tech companies.</p>

Accountants and lawyers to use AI to cannibalise their business – before someone else does
When you hear the word “automation...”, does your mind skip straight to “…destroys jobs”? If so, there should be a few stops in between. Automation is about removing friction, driving down costs, speeding processes up, and generally improving efficiency. Making goods and services better and cheaper is a good thing: it makes us all richer.


There is scope to do this in all walks of life, and not least in professional services, such as accountancy and the law. Much of the work done by the firms in these sectors is searching for and compiling data. Their work would be greatly improved and speeded up if data retrieval could be automated, if databases were compatible, and if multiple databases could be interrogated simultaneously.

Traditional databases don’t talk to each other. The questions that can be asked of each of them are fixed - designed in at the start. Big companies have thousands of them. In the 1990s, companies began installing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems which bring together all the data about a particular business process in one master database. But large companies still have many ERPs – often as many as 300. And guess what, these don’t usually talk to each other.

PROMOTED
Knowledge graphs
A newer type of database called a “knowledge graph” is more flexible. Google introduced this concept to its search operations in 2012 (coincidentally, the same year as the Big Bang in artificial intelligence, when machine learning began to make AI so powerful). Knowledge graphs link triplets of information – subject, object, and the relationship between them. This allows you to get precise answers to rich and complex questions.

The problem with knowledge graphs is that they are time-consuming and expensive to populate. This problem is being mitigated by the rapid improvements in an aspect of AI called natural language processing. NLP systems such as Google’s BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, since you asked) enable knowledge graphs to be populated automatically, by furtling around in giant corpuses of text and tables, hunting down and extracting relevant but unstructured data.

Using BERT to populate knowledge graphs in professional services
A startup called Engine B is looking to capitalise on this emerging capability in the professional services industry. It employs only nine people today, and has only raised £3.5m so far. But founder and CEO Shamus Rae says that the company’s partners and backers are what makes it promising: they include all four large accountancy firms, plus several of the next tier and challenger firms. Plus the accountants’ UK trade body, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). It is also working with a number of leading law firms.

If Engine B succeeds, it will operate as a platform, charging users micro-payments as they process data. The data belongs to the customer, and it stays where it is – inside the company’s servers (whether in a cloud service, or owner-hosted). Engine B’s knowledge graphs will be applied to the data in the form of an API. Shamus Rae says that “we will not anonymise anyone’s data and resell insights from it, and our code is open source”.
A single source of truth
The result, Rae claims, is a “single source of truth”, where questions can be asked of a company’s knowledge base which were never envisaged when the data was collected. For instance, the knowledge graph for a property company could be interrogated to find out which buildings in the portfolio have the kind of cladding which caused the Grenfell Tower tragedy, and which of those were installed by the same contractor. It becomes much easier to check the integrity of a company’s data lakes, and to check for fraud and defend against cyber attacks.
If this approach is successful, it will automate a lot of the work which is currently done by accounting firms. The big firms employ thousands of people to do “ticking and bashing” - obtaining financial information about the client’s activities, and checking it for consistency against other sources. This work will increasingly be automated, which means less boredom for junior accountants - but probably also means fewer junior accountants. The same goes for lawyers and their disclosure and discover processes. Due diligence - the investigation and evaluation of a target company - will become much easier and faster, and mergers, acquisitions, and investment should be speeded up dramatically.
""Enabling people to do what they know good would look like, if only it were possible""
Dan Wright, a partner at international law firm, Osborne Clarke, shares Rae’s hopes for the initiative. “By systemically unearthing the connections between data, we open up entirely new ways of executing legal processes. The knowledge graph approach is all about technology enabling people to do what they know good would look like, if only it were possible. We'll hopefully show it is possible.""
Since knowledge graphs will eliminate a lot of the work that accountants and lawyers do today – and charge for – you might think they would resist it rather than back it. But the people running these firms recognise that automation is coming. They know that if they do not cannibalise their own businesses and adopt the coming business models, then someone else will. They are using this sort of initiative to force through the digitisation of their businesses, and retain a degree of control over the process as it happens.
As Rae puts it, “In reality jobs will go and jobs will change. The firms that prosper will be the ones that grab the opportunity first to re-skill their technology and their people. The future is not about number-crunching transactions, but about judgement and wisdom.”

ENISA working group on Artificial Intelligence cybersecurity kick-off
Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is kicking off the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence, marking another milestone in the Agency’s work on emerging technologies.

    Published on June 10, 2020
  






Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer in the realm of science fiction and futuristic scenarios. It is already changing everyday life, improving the provision of services by automating procedures and systems, and rapidly processing large amounts of data. AI has the potential to lead the digital transformation paradigm shift, and, in many ways, is already doing so.
The benefits of Artificial Intelligence may only be attained if AI itself can be trustworthy and cybersecure. We are already witnessing attacks against AI systems that aim to negatively manipulate their behaviour and lead to unintentional operations by adversaries. The European Commission has highlighted the importance of AI in society and the economy; and, most recently, in its White Paper on Artificial Intelligence, the Commission has underlined the need for AI to be secure. This white paper is the frontrunner to forthcoming policy initiatives in the area that will shape the future of AI deployment and its wide adoption by the public.
Recognizing the significance of cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence, ENISA has set up an Ad-Hoc Working Group in line with the European Commission’s directions and policies.
The main objectives of the group include:

Advise ENISA in matters related to AI cybersecurity.
Assist ENISA in the development of an AI Threat Landscape.
Support ENISA in providing risk-proportionate cybersecurity guidelines for AI.

The working group is composed of 15 members, representing stakeholders from small and large companies, the public sector, academia, associations, and more, as well as seven observers from European bodies, including the DG for Communications Networks, Content and Technology, the DG Joint Research Centre, Europol, the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).
The list of members and observers is available on the webpage of the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Artificial Intelligence cybersecurity.

       In this talk, Daniel will explore the future of work in the Age of Covid-19. Drawing on his best-selling books, The Future of the Professions (OUP, 2015), and A World Without Work (Allen Lane, 2020), he will explore the relationship between the Covid-19 crisis and the challenge of automation, set out the five stages that individuals and companies are likely to go through in recovering from this crisis, and provide advice on how to think about the months ahead.
      

       Dr Daniel Susskind explores the impact of technology, particularly artificial intelligence, on work and society and is a Fellow in Economics at Balliol College, Oxford University, where he teaches and researches. Previously he worked in the British Government – as a policy adviser in the Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit, as a policy analyst in the Policy Unit in 10 Downing Street, and as a senior policy adviser in the Cabinet Office. He was a Kennedy Scholar at Harvard University.
      

       WSI Executive Director and WFRC Founding Director, Professor Pauline Leonard says:
       
        “I’m very excited that Daniel Susskind has agreed to be the first speaker to give a WSI Distinguished Lecture online. As a leading commentator on the impact of technology on working lives, this couldn’t be more fitting, or timely. I encourage everyone interested in the impacts of Covid19, technology, and how the world of work will move on from these challenging times, to ‘join the debate.”

Today, technology is unlocking the power to help us tell stories, better than we've ever before. With the rise of virtual and augmented reality, technologies are being given a new opportunity to bridge those communication gaps, even further, through direct experience. We are experiencing a change, which futurist long theorized about a coming age where creativity and imagination will become the primary creator of economic value.Working culture and trends have witnessed a pragmatic shift over a time. What seemed to be the &ldquo;Future of Work&rdquo; has turned out to be the &ldquo;Present for Work&rdquo; due to these unavoidable and unprecedented times. What used to be perceived as a job eater is now being used to augment the day-to-day operational tasks for work, worker and workplace.While AI can handle mundane tasks freeing up people to focus more on gaining competitive advantage, being innovative and think out of the box; it&rsquo;s the VR which is turning out to be game changer by creating a virtual world which is no degree less than the real world. These two technology terms now seem to be inevitable at work &amp; workplace and the worker&rsquo;s life is visualized revolving around them. Let&rsquo;s try to uncover what this paradigm shift holds in for the work, worker and workplace:Work (Anywhere Anytime Accessibility)Collaboration is a key to virtual connect: VR can give a boost to remote-working trend in the current scenario as virtual connect has been the prime focus. Telepresence and telecommunication are something that organizations need to look at for fuelling up collaboration. Meetings with showcase of product/service can be simulated virtually thereby leading to an enhanced experience.Virtual Chum @ Work: Chatbots are the buzzword in the market today. Imagine them as your friend and taking care of you from the time you start your day. Bots can increase the happiness index by driving balance between both personal and professional lives of the employee. During late working hours, the bot ensures that you are being taken care of by nudging you for your meals, cab booking, or even delivering necessity items at destination, etc.WorkerEmpathy &ndash; a skill to be acquired: VR &amp; AR can help inculcate empathy in employees by helping them synthesize the customer expectations by evaluating them in a closed environment surrounded by real-life situation thereby developing a solution centric approach.Skill enrichment: VR along with AI can sharpen the learning curves of employees by offering them an opportunity to explore and experience the real-life situations. VR can help employees to upskill themselves and fly high just like pilots during their simulation trainings.Personalized experience: Who wants to step out of home amidst the heat of COVID? Time isn&rsquo;t far when people can experience the same with the help of virtual &amp; augmented reality which will enhance the shopping experience in a different space altogether with AI assisting in appropriate suggestions knowing your likes and d&eacute;cor.WorkplaceTransformed recruitment &amp; onboarding: AI &amp; VR can anytime stimulate the hiring &amp; onboarding process. AI powered profile matching and screening can help in creating a pool of potential candidates and enhance the probability of job fitment. Assessment centres can be converted into virtual cohorts to gauge the performance of the candidate along with gauging the body language to augment the hiring decision. Onboarding &amp; induction will be about creating an unbeatable experience for the new hire. AI-enabled chatbots will be the talk of the town to help new hire settle in the new role. With the introduction of VR, virtual tours can be created to make the incumbent familiar with the workplace and thereby boosting up the morale.Creating smarter workplace: How about creating a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; factor for people visiting your workplace by easing out their entry process? Employees no longer need to go to the reception to receive the visitor and yet the visitor would be guided for his way. Meeting notes are automatically getting converted into transcripts and sent to the attendees; language is no longer a barrier as the chat bot manages the translation and life becomes easy.Fast paced development cycle: Organizations can significantly reduce their cycle time by leveraging the cognitive model of virtual reality which is less costly as you do not have to spent hefty amount on developing prototypes. One can experience and experiment the exact model via virtual designs.Security Workplace: AI &amp; VR act as security shields by installing stronger access control points. AI &amp; VR together can help us in analysing the entry &amp; exit patterns by uncovering the mood of an employee or a visitor, which can again help us in developing insights about any potential physical or emotional threat.AI &amp; VR have already changed the way we consume information around us, and we are increasingly getting dependent on our virtual friends in our personal lives. As one of the corners in our homes turns out to be our workstation, virtual reality has become an inexorable part of our lives. &ldquo;Future of work&rdquo; is about creating happy organizations by helping employees integrate their personal priorities with professional priorities. Thus it&rsquo;s of high importance that we embrace this change wholeheartedly, instead of being sceptical about it. We need to &ldquo;get comfortable with experimentation.&rdquo;(Dakshdeep Singh is Associate Vice President - Customer Onboarding at PeopleStrong.

In Estonia, there are around 30 Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions deployed in the Estonian public sector that were identified as active as of the beginning of June 2020. The Baltic nation aims to have at least 50 AI use cases by the end of 2020.
And that is just the beginning. Estonia’s AI strategy is the next stage of digital public services, all part of e-Estonia. What is most interesting about it, is that its vision sounds as if it was taken from a science fiction script. Yet, it is all almost around the corner. In 2020, Estonia is working toward realizing its AI Strategy vision, called KrattAI. 
Estonian companies widely use AI solutions in several business areas for optimizing business processes, automating customer service, in product quality control, and in risk mitigation to name just a few. 
Indeed, Estonia’s efficient, secure, and transparent ecosystem has earned the nation the title of the world’s most advanced digital society.
But, how did Estonia, a small Baltic nation in Northern Europe, led by a female president, managed to be recognized as the most advanced digital society on the planet?

Estonia borders the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland. Estonia includes more than 1,500 islands featuring a diverse terrain which spans rocky beaches, old-growth forests, and many lakes. 
Formerly part of the Soviet Union (officially The Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR), also referred to as Soviet Russia, and today The Russian Federation), Estonia is dotted with beautiful medieval castles, old churches, and hilltop fortresses. 
The capital city, Tallinn, is known for its well preserved Old Town, museums, and the 314-meter-high Tallinn TV Tower, which has an observation deck.

Estonia creates the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy
In 2019, the Estonian government outlined the current and future usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in government and private services. The main challenge was to create the legal and strategic framework for accelerating AI development and making Estonia a trailblazer in this emerging field. 
The creation of Estonia’s National AI Strategy resulted in a detailed strategic plan for promoting the implementation of AI solutions in both public and private sectors. 
Following its successful plan, Estonia has become the world’s most digital society. Artificial Intelligence constitutes a fundamental pillar in instituting digital technologies into government and throughout the Estonian society, which Estonia refers to as e-Governance. 
The Estonian government is investing at least 10 million euros over the course of 2019 to 2021 in order to push further the full implementation of its National AI Strategy. 
From Kratt to KrattAI: How a mythological creature becomes Estonia’s AI National Strategy 
Unless you are Estonian, or are familiar with old Estonian mythology, you are probably wondering what a Kratt is. Like its Nordic neighbors, Estonia has a rich culture and some picturesque mythological creatures. Such is the case of the Kratt, pictured here below.
The Kratt is a mythological creature from old Estonian folklore. Pictured here is a version of how people view the Kratt in Estonia; the Kratt could be made of tools and metal objects, too. The Kratt was the inspiration for naming Estonia’s National AI Strategy, called KrattAI, Source: Anita/Flickr  
In Estonian mythology, a Kratt is a magical creature. A Kratt is a creature brought to life from hay or metal household objects, and it is animated by a human soul. Essentially, the Kratt was a servant made by its maker out of hay or old household items to help with tasks. The Estonian government uses this character as a metaphor for Artificial Intelligence and its complexities.
I asked Florian Marcus, Digital Transformation Adviser at the e-Estonia Briefing Centre, why the Estonian government chose the mythological Kratt to refer to its AI strategy. 
“A Kratt is a living being consisting of various objects. An interesting caveat is that you have to keep the Kratt busy. If you don’t keep it occupied, it will focus all of its ability on attacking its owner. So, giving the Kratt lots of tasks is essential, the harder the better. And to complete the parallels with reality, the only way to get rid of the Kratt in its entirety is to give it impossible tasks. A very nice series of analogies for technology, if you ask me,” Florian Marcus told me. 
To better illustrate why the Kratt needs to be fed with work, watch the short video below. It is a clip from the award-winning 2017 Estonian film November, featuring a Kratt. According to the folk stories, if the Kratt’s maker doesn’t keep the Kratt busy with work, the Kratt will kill its maker, or owner. 

KrattAI: Estonia’s National Strategy for AI implementation 
KrattAI is the vision of how public services should digitally work in the age of Artificial Intelligence. KrattAI will let people in Estonia use public information services by voice-based interaction with AI-based virtual assistants. 
The concept of KrattAI would allow people to get things done such as ordering a new passport from any device, and in the future, also from any majorly used virtual assistant. 
In the Estonian IT-sector, the Kratt is a metaphor for Artificial Intelligence. “KrattAI is the name of the overarching strategy to implement AI solutions within the public sector, usually providing services for citizens, but occasionally also making the lives of government workers easier. There are around 30 AI solutions in use right now,” Florian Marcus told me. 
Some of the AI solutions are used as both a citizen-side service and a government-side service. Marcus gives some examples: 
“For citizens and residents alike, we have Suve, a chatbot that was created in response to Covid-19. Already, Suve can interact with regular human speech (meaning, you can converse with Suve in free form). Still, the more data we input for AI systems, the better they get – so Suve will only become more helpful over time,” he said.
Suve’s main task is to make sure that everyone living in or visiting Estonia gets all their questions answered accurately and from official sources. Suve is integrated to many official public Websites. Suve is multilingual, providing information in English, Estonian, and Russian.  
“One niche solution that I like very much is the AI analysis of satellite data done by the Ministry of Agriculture,” says Marcus. “In order for farmers to receive some EU structural funds, they need to tend to their fields and cut them a certain number of times per year. In most countries (and, up until rather recently, also in Estonia) people from the ministry have to personally drive around the country to check whether farmers mow their fields with the frequency to actually qualify for those funds. This is now being done by AI image analysis. The accuracy of the AI solution lies at around 90 percent.”
Suve: The Estonian chatbot for digital public services
The Suve chatbot is a relatively new addition to Estonia’s digital services. Suve was an idea that came from the Hack the Crisis hackathon, which was organized by Garage48 and Accelerate Estonia.
The hackathon was organized to beat the global pandemic affecting Estonia. “Startup-government collaboration is in the DNA of our Estonian digital society,” President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid said. 
Hack the Crisis is a global community that centralizes all the local events and information to participate in the online hackathons. The startups believe that the power of community has the power to fight and beat the pandemic. To achieve this, and after their local success, they also organize events to help countries around the world.
Estonia counts with approximately 1,000 startups, which positions the country among the top countries with more startups per capita. According to a study by Index Ventures in late 2018, Estonia is the best in the world in terms of startup regulation.
Legal perspective: Who is responsible for AI fails? 

To answer this question, first we need to bring to our attention a basic classification of Artificial Intelligence, and understand the three different types of Artificial Intelligence.


Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), focused on one single narrow task


Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a system capable of human thinking. This kind of AGI, also called the Singularity, implies machine consciousness. According to multiple experts, AGI or the Singularity, is not expected to emerge until 2050 or 2060. Regardless of whether it is conscious or not, though, such AI could continuously improve itself, therefore, reaching far beyond human capabilities and becoming a super-intelligence 


Artificial Super-Intelligence (ASI), more capable than human


Even though most of the currently used Artificial Intelligence applications are not very complex yet, the Estonian government can already clearly see that significant changes in advancement and complexity will take place over the next few years.
According to multiple experts, AGI or the Singularity, is not expected to emerge until 2050 or 2060.
So, for now, there is no need for substantial changes in the basics of the legal system. Both now and in the foreseeable future, Kratts are and will be human tools, meaning that they perform tasks determined by humans and express the intention of humans directly or indirectly. There is always a human behind any existing AI form.  
Even if the human has granted seemingly large freedom to the Kratt, today, there are no known so-called super agents that are able to operate independently and have intentions independent of humans. This basically means that the subjects of the legal regulations are humans. 
However, Artificial Intelligence is rapidly evolving. Artificial Super Intelligence could be here sooner than expected. Yet, there is definitely no rise of the machines here. Artificial Super Intelligence is not going to take over the world simply because it does not yet exist. And it will not exist any time soon. 
The Estonian government makes it clear stating that for the sake of legal clarity, it should be ensured that when exercising public powers or performing other public tasks, the actions of a Kratt will be attributed to the state through the company or body that used the Kratt in the meaning of state liability. 
In private relationships, for both natural and legal persons, the Kratt’s actions should be considered the actions of the Kratt’s user. Matters related to criminal liability need to be expanded, for instance, to include Kratts and their use by expanding the definition of instrumental execution. 
Benefits of implementing AI and automation 
Artificial Intelligence is something that many still fear. However, mass implementation of Artificial Intelligence represents various benefits for Estonia. In the public sector, more implementation of AI would allow the government to increase the user-centric services, improve the process of data analysis, and make the country work more efficiently by achieving the goals of developing the e-Government.
Artificial Intelligence can also play an important role in the digital revolution of the industry as well as opening up the possibility to attract new investments and a plethora of innovation activity to Estonia; developers of technology are actively searching for a development and test environment that favours Artificial Intelligence solutions.
“Estonian quality of life is already very high thanks, in part, to digital solutions that mean we don’t have to ever visit a government office,” says Florian Marcus. In five years living in Estonia, Marcus explains, he has never had the need to do it. 
“That is already something that most people can currently only dream of. But there is more on the horizon: Implementing more and increasingly sophisticated AI solutions means that we can create a wholly new level of convenience for both society and government authorities. Interestingly, I believe that these solutions will compound – snowball-like – so that the benefits we draw from these solutions will grow exponentially,” Marcus says.
In Estonia, paramedics can access a person’s medical data while they’re on their way to the scene of the accident. “Another solution the government provides is a proactive service that is triggered when a child is born, so that you get an automatic notification asking you to which bank account you want the child benefits paid – no parent has to apply for these things ever again. Still, neither of these two services I described have anything to do with AI. If we bring AI into the picture, we could imagine a service that works based on the voice assistant you already have on your phone.”
Of course, Estonia is in the first place a socially advanced society. It counts with a state-of-the-art healthcare system, a system which already provided such benefits to all its citizens before Estonia reached the current level of digital transformation. What AI and digital implementation are doing is, as Marcus pointed out, facilitating and improving citizens’ life by providing added agile solutions to everyday situations. 
“Imagine you’re in a foreign country, pregnant, and you feel you’re about to go into labour. Wouldn’t it be great to just tell Siri or your Google Assistant that you’re about to have a baby, and in the background, the AI calls an ambulance to your location, forwards your medical data to the nearest hospital, alerts the Estonian embassy in that country, creates a new electronic ID for your baby, and also starts child benefit payments? Then, the voice assistant calmly informs you that everything has been sorted out and that the ambulance will reach your location in two minutes. This is amazing,” says Marcus. 
If you are thinking that the above has been taken from a science fiction book or movie, think again. Because it is exactly what the Estonian government is working on right now as you are reading this.
“As you can see,” Marcus continues, “all of the digital solutions that we have built up over the last twenty years will be revolutionized as holistic services thanks to the implementation of AI. It is very hard to overstate how beneficial this will be for the country.”RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

Mike Murray, commander of Army Futures Command, said during a June 10 webinar hosted by the Association of the United States Army that the task force has moved forward on the projects through its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, launched in late 2018 .First, the team is working on programs dedicated to unmanned-unmanned teaming, or developing the ability of air and ground unmanned vehicles to talk to one other.The other effort underway is on a DevSecOps environment to develop future algorithms to work with other Army systems, Murray said. He did not offer further detail.The task force force has fewer than 15 people, Murray said, and fiscal 2021 will be the first year that it receives appropriated funds from Congress. Much of the work the task force has done so far as been building the team.In response to an audience question, Murray said that the task force is not yet working on defending against adversarial machine learning, but added that leaders recognize that’s an area the team will need to focus on.“We’re going to have to work on how do we defend our algorithms and really, how do we defend our training data that we’re using for our algorithms,"" Murray said.In order to train effective artificial intelligence, the team needs significant amounts of data. One of the first projects for the task force was collecting data to develop advanced target recognition capabilities. For example, Murray said, being able to identify different types of combat vehicles. When the work started, the training data for target recognition didn’t exist.“If you’re training an algorithm to recognize cats, you can get on the internet and pull up hundreds of thousands of pictures of cats,” Murray said. “You can’t do that for a T-72 [a Russian tank]. You can get a bunch of pictures, but are they at the right angles, lighting conditions, vehicle sitting camouflaged to vehicle sitting open desert?”Murray also said he recognizes the Army needs to train more soldiers in data science and artificial intelligence. He told reporters in late May that the Army and CMU have created a masters program in data science that will begin in the fall. He also said that the “software factory,” a six- to 12-week course to teach soldiers basic software skills. That factory will be based in Austin, where Futures Command is located, and will work with industry’s local tech industry.“We have got to get this talent identified I’m convinced we have it in our formations,” Murray said.About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.

They are also called Knowledge-based Systems. I hope to write about what is an expert system, features of expert systems, applications of expert systems and many more things here. The importance of this topic is Expert Systems are one of the major areas of Artificial Intelligence. Expert systems come under cognitive systems. If you have not an idea about it please go through this article.What is an Expert System?In AI, an expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human experts. Human experts may be doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, scientists, carpenters, musicians and so on. The purpose of an expert system is to solve the most complex issues in a specific domain. Expert systems were the predecessor of the current day artificial intelligence, deep learning and machine learning systems.The problem solving skills of experts is based on two knowledge areas. They are subject specific knowledge(domain knowledge) and problem solving knowledge. When two medical doctors are considered their subject specific knowledge or domain knowledge are similar. But their problem solving strategies may be different. That is the reason for two doctors are not same.Features of Expert SystemsConsider a scenario when you meet a medical doctor and understand features of an expert system.Expert asks more questions than the clients — When you go to meet a doctor, he/she asks questions more than you.Experts can work on incomplete information — Doctors can predict and decide our disease before we tell everything.Experts can give not only the answers but also reasons for the answers — If we ask from doctor, what is the reason/ what are the reasons for this disease, doctor can explain it.Experts can give more than one solution(alternative solutions) — If a patient says doctor I have an allergy on this tablet, doctor can give another one.Experts know the level of assurance of their answers — Doctor can tell assurance of medicine as 80% assurance for amoxicillin and 60% assurance for penicillin.Experts operate on specific areas — There are specialist doctors in different areas such as Dermatologists, Endocrinologists, Gastroenterologists and so on.Experts give recommendations than exact answers — There is no exact medicine separate as this medicine is only given for this disease.Experts use heuristics and experiences — Doctors use their common sense, past experiences when give medicine.How Expert Systems workYou can easily understand the procedure of expert systems considering the process of consultation of doctors.Start of the dialogue — When a patient goes for a doctor, the doctor starts to ask questions.Forming conflit set — After asking questions from the patient,doctor can make a conflict set according to the patient’s complains and symptoms.eg:- When a patient complains about fever and vomiting, the doctor can form a conflict set as follows.R1 Infection- fever, headache, vomitingR2 dengue- fever, diarrhea, vomitingR3 dengue- red eyes, vomitingR4 food poisoning- vomiting, headacheConflict resolution — According to the above conflict set , the doctor can selects an order of rule.eg:- R3, R4, R1Missing Information — When R3 is being considered, the doctor might ask whether you have red eyes to conclude the patient has dengue(incomplete information).Alternate solutions — Assume that the patient said no red eyes. Then doctor should go to R4, the second conflict rule. Considering R4, the doctor asks again whether he is suffering from headache. If the answer is “yes ”, then R4 concludes there is food poisoning. Sometimes the doctor might stop at that point. If he/she is a clever doctor, the doctor might consider R1 alternative solution if possible.Uncertainty handlingExplanations — If the first diagnosis(food poisoning) was rejected by the patient, doctor should give explanation referring to vomiting and headache. But if the patient tells if not having bad meal, the doctor will have to consider another rule.Architecture of Expert Systemscomponents of an Expert SystemThere are 3 main components in an Expert System.User Interface — This component helps to non-expert users to interact with the expert system and find a solution to the problem. An interface for an expert system is more complex than a interface for other systems or software solutions. Because there should be possibilities such as providing answers for asked questions, explanations, alternative solutions, capturing missing information in an expert system. In addition, Expert Systems interfaces can also handle the interaction through the natural language(voice and text). Chatbot is a good example for natural language interface for all kind of software. Today, many Expert Systems have web based interfaces. Because web interfaces can support many media such as graphic, images, voice etc.Knowledge Base — This is a container of Expert Systems. It represents facts and rules. It consists of knowledge in a particular domain as well as rules to solve a problem, procedures and intrinsic data relevant to the domain. The knowledge may be stored in databases, web servers, file servers, or cloud. The Knowledge Base should be structured depending on requirements such as dynamic information and static information.Inference Engine — This is a distinct feature on Expert Systems. All problem solving strategies or features of Expert Systems are built into Inference Engine. Basic Artificial Intelligence techniques such as search algorithms, forward chaining, backward chaining are considered as inference techniques. Inference Engine makes the Expert Systems different from classical database system.Since the Inference Engine works on the Knowledge Base, their structure should be compatible. When we say Expert Systems are intelligent, bigger credit should go to the Inference Engine. But there is no use of Inference Engine if the Knowledge Base is empty.Applications of Expert SystemsThere are many applications of Expert Systems in real world problem. Some of most popular applications have been mentioned here.Information managementHospitals and medical facilitiesHelp desks managementEmployee performance evaluationLoan analysisVirus detectionUseful for repair and maintenance projectsWarehouse optimizationPlanning and schedulingThe configuration of manufactured objectsFinancial decision making Knowledge publishingProcess monitoring and controlSupervise the operation of the plant and controllerStock market tradingAirline scheduling & cargo schedulesMedical diagnosis and adviseEngineering designFault diagnosisCounsellingCareer guidanceTravel advisory systemLogistic planning systemsExamples of Expert SystemsThere are many examples of expert system. Some of them are written here.MYCIN: One of the earliest expert systems based on backward chaining. It can identify various bacteria that can cause severe infections and can also recommend drugs based on the person’s weight.DENDRAL: It was an artificial intelligence based expert system used for chemical analysis. It used a substance’s spectrographic data to predict it’s molecular structure.R1/XCON: It could select specific software to generate a computer system wished by the user.PXDES: It could easily determine the type and the degree of lung cancer in a patient based on the data.CaDet: It is a clinical support system that could identify cancer in its early stages in patients.DXplain: It was also a clinical support system that could suggest a variety of diseases based on the findings of the doctor.Advantages of Expert SystemsLow accessibility costFast responseLow error rateCapable of explaining how they reached a solutionLess production costReducing riskSteady responseDisadvantages of Expert SystemsExpert system have no emotionsCommon sense is the main issue of the expert systemIt is developed for a specific domainIt should be updated manually. It does not learn itselfNot capable to explain the logic behind the decisionLimitations of Expert SystemsDon’t have human-like decision making power/Unable to make a creative response in an extraordinary situationCan’t possess human capabilitiesCan’t produce correct result from less amount of knowledge/Errors in the knowledge base can lead to wrong decisionRequires excessive training/The maintenance cost of an expert system is too expensiveI think you can give a brief idea about Expert Systems through the above mentioned facts. This is not an easy or short area to discuss from only one article. The intention of this article is to give a simple idea for you. After reading this article, seek and gather more information on Expert Systems. Now time is yours.

The substitutive effect
In the future, machines will replace humans in jobs. This is not controversial: it’s what machines have done since well before the start of the industrial revolution. Petrol pump attendants were replaced by automated pumps, secretaries were replaced by Microsoft Office. This is what economists call the substitutive effect of automation: humans are substituted in jobs by machines.


The complementary effect
From time to time, fears have been expressed that humans would run out of jobs entirely. I first wrote about this concern back in 1980, and like many other people at the time, I under-estimated the resilience of what economists call the complementary effect of automation. To simplify a little, this means that when a human job is automated, the amount of wealth generated in the economy increases. That increases demand, which in turn increases employment. The new jobs that are created are done by humans, because machines can not yet do everything that we can do for money.

The complementary effect probably won’t last forever. The amount of compute power you can buy for $1,000 continues to increase exponentially: Moore’s Law is evolving, not stopping. This means that in a decade, the machines we have will be 100 times as powerful as the ones we have today. In two decades the multiple will be 8,000, and in three decades, 1,000,000. There is no straight-line correlation between compute power and the ability of AI to carry out human tasks, but the two do travel together. People who airily dismiss fears about medium-term technological unemployment are committing the Reverse Luddite Fallacy. They are making four mistakes.

PROMOTED
The Reverse Luddite Fallacy
First, they forget that we have seen technological unemployment before. In 1915 there were 22 million horses working in America, pulling vehicles and working on farms. The horse population of America today is two million. That is severe technological unemployment.

Second, they argue that because automation has not caused technological unemployment in the past, it will not do so in the future. The past is often a good guide to the future, but it is far from perfect: if it was, we would not be able to fly.

Third and fourth, they are thinking too short-term, and they are not taking into account the astonishing power of exponential growth. Machines will not be able to do everything humans can do for money in the next year, nor in the next decade. It is also true that technologies are not implemented overnight. It takes time for companies to figure out how to use them. But three decades from now, when our machines are 1,000,000 times more capable than they are today, they will probably be cheaper, faster, and better at almost everything that humans can do for money.

Creativity and consciousness will keep us employed?
Some people reply that we will endlessly create jobs which machines are unable to do, either because they are not creative, or because they are not conscious, and therefore have no empathy. These are likely to prove vain hopes: AI systems are creative already, and they can decode human emotions very effectively. They can also provide the same appearance of empathy that humans often do at work.

If technological unemployment is coming, we must transition to a very different type of economy. I call the transition the “economic singularity”, using a term from physics which was first applied to human affairs by computer pioneer John von Neumann. Back in the 1950s, he said we were “approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.”
How should policy makers respond to the challenges presented by the economic singularity? Let’s look at a few options.
Should we try to protect jobs?
In America, some truckers’ groups want to ban the introduction of self-driving lorries. Not unreasonably, they argue that the technology will put millions of them out of work, with serious knock-on effects for their families and their communities. This could be an effective strategy if they were not in a competitive market: train drivers unions in the UK have prevented efficiency measures for years. But unlike trains, trucking is a competitive market. And even if the federal government were to wave a magic wand and give the truckers their wish, the US economy would become less competitive internationally. Protecting jobs stifles competition, kills innovation, and makes everyone poorer.
Should we tax robots?
Similarly, taxing robots in order to fend off or mitigate technological unemployment would stifle both innovation and competitiveness. It also suffers from conceptual difficulties. Machines will rarely replace humans on a one-for-one basis, and most of the “robots” automating jobs in the coming years will be software, not androids. Humans will disappear from many call centres, for instance, and be replaced by AI systems running on banks of servers in big buildings with powerful air conditioning. Does the government tax one entity – namely the AI system - or each individual server? Or does it estimate the number of humans who have been laid off by the system and calculate the tax based on that?
If we are going to tax machines which automate jobs away, do we start with tractors and weaving machines? Or do we just tax new instances of replacement? Imagine two firms making the same product. One has been going for a few years, and recently replaced half its staff with machines. The other is a startup, and used machines from the outset. The former would be hit by a tax that the latter would escape. Not only is that patently unjust, it would simply mean the former would close, and the tax base would disappear anyway.
Universal Basic Income?
There are a number of problems with introducing UBI in the types of economy that exist today, which is why it has never been done, except in limited, temporary trials. The biggest problem is the little word in the middle: basic. Without spending implausible amounts, the best that UBI can do is to make its recipients poor. That is much better than being dead, if that were the alternative, but it is nowhere near good enough. As the noted economist John Kay said, “either the basic income is impossibly low, or the expenditure on it is impossibly high.”
Abundance 
Despite its failings, the proponents of UBI have hit upon a vital insight: in a post-jobs world, there are going to have to be substantial transfers of income and / or wealth from the minority who are still in paid employment, and from the owners of major assets. The problem is that if the cost of a good life remains high, then these transfers will be onerous, and therefore avoided. Wealthy people will move to jurisdictions which don’t enforce the taxes, or they will simply cease to work at all.
The solution is not to persecute the wealthy, but to reduce the cost of a good life. This means developing the economy of abundance, in which the prices of all the goods and services that you need for a very good standard of living are very low. Then the transfers from the wealthy need not be onerous – and avoided.
This does sound crazy when you first hear it, but if you think about the music industry, you can see how it could happen. Twenty years ago, not even a rich person could listen to any piece of music which took their fancy. Now it costs $10 a month, thanks to Spotify and similar services. Music, of course, is now digital, so it is dematerialised and non-rivalrous, as economists say. But more and more of what we value these days is digital, and this trend will continue. In another decade or so, many of us will probably spend hours at a time in virtual realities.
Fully Automated Luxury Capitalism
What form of economic and political governance will best suit this post-jobs world? Some have argued for a version of communism, called fully automated luxury communism. While this approach deserves credit for facing up to the exponential future, it overlooks two important facts. First, it is no coincidence that wherever communism has been tried, it has degenerated into some of the worst regimes the world has ever seen. Communism grants absolute power to a ruling elite, and we all know what absolute power does to people.
The other fact is the astonishing power of markets. Markets incentivise people and firms to provide goods and services that are genuinely valued, and to do it efficiently. Allied with technology, free markets (with appropriate welfare safety nets, and with regulation to ensure that markets are not suborned) have made this the best time ever to be a human. Technology provides potential solutions to problems, and markets provide the incentive for people to develop and invest in those solutions. This is how China has gone from backwater to superpower in a single generation.
Even in the abundance economy, it will be a very long time before we have the technology to build the matter replicators found on Star Trek’s USS Enterprise, so goods and services will impose a residual cost. And as long as we are human, we will also face shortages of things like attention, artisanal goods, and works of art. Markets are the best system we know of for resource allocation, so to start with at least, the optimal system for the economy of abundance is likely to be a form of capitalism: let’s call it “fully automated luxury capitalism”.
There's still money to be made
In fully automated luxury capitalism, people would continue to trade and innovate. Fortunes (and also more modest wealth) would continue to be made by creating art, artisanal goods, and other forms of intellectual property. Even when AIs can create objects more beautiful than the ablest human craft worker, there could well be a premium attached to items which are “made by hand”. Judiciously trading scarce assets such as beach-front properties, and original Aston Martin DB5s could remain another source of wealth and income.
But not everyone will be able to or inclined to participate in this reduced commercial world. The three central insights underpinning the idea of fully automated luxury capitalism are (1) that most humans will not have jobs, (2) that everybody must be wealthy – or at least comfortable rather than poor, and (3) that the taxes levied on wealthy people people and organisations must be affordable. The only way to achieve this is to drive prices down – to evolve the economy of abundance.
If we can achieve the economy of abundance, then we should be thankful that humans are not condemned to do jobs forever, because although some people love their jobs, plenty of research shows that most people don’t. Many people will take time to adjust, and some will need help, but a post-jobs world could be one in which humans do whatever we want to. We could have a second Renaissance. The Reverse Luddite Fallacists are not only probably wrong – they are also profoundly pessimistic.
Clothify and Constructify
Is the economy of abundance possible? Obviously, not everything is digital, like music. Can we reduce the cost of non-digital goods and services too, like housing and clothes? Can we create their Spotify equivalents, “Constructify” and “Clothify”?
We can, if we do three things. First, we must take the expensive humans out of the production process for all goods and services. That is exactly what automation does, so this is a case where the problem is also part of the cure.
Second, we must make energy very cheap. The cost of solar cells is falling fast, and battery technology is improving. Many observers think that within 20 or 30 years, electricity could not only be much cheaper to generate, store and transmit than the oil and gas we get by digging up dead dinosaurs – it could be almost too cheap to meter. This would also reduce CO2 emissions much faster than most people today think possible.
Third, we must use AI to make all production processes as efficient as possible, requiring minimal material inputs.
""Automate and redeploy""
Andrew McAfee pointed out in his recent book “More From Less” that we are already on this path, but there is much further to go. We should therefore not hold automation back; instead we should accelerate it. The mantra for companies and for countries should be: “automate and redeploy, rinse and repeat”. Companies which automate rapidly will prosper, but the outstanding ones will be those which also genuinely value their people: companies where people actively seek to work out how to automate their tasks, in the knowledge that they will be rewarded both with pay and with more interesting work in the future.
The Churn
For a decade or three before technological unemployment arrives, AI-driven automation will have an increasingly disruptive effect on the job market: the Churn. People will lose their jobs to machines, and they will have to be redeployed within companies, between companies, and between industries. With increasing frequency. Workers will have to learn how to work with machines: AI won’t replace humans in all jobs, but increasingly, humans who can work with AI will replace those who cannot. We cannot yet say what jobs people will be re-trained to do; no doubt some of them will surprise us.
This process will be disturbing and frightening for many of us. Governments will need to support their people through the Churn with enhanced welfare programmes and other methods of economic support. The experience of massive government intervention during the corona virus crisis should teach us valuable lessons about what works and what doesn’t.
Education will become ""vacational"", not ""vocational""
During the period of Churn, we will need to re-train ourselves more and more frequently, and do it faster each time. Education and training are notoriously hard industries to reform. Here again, AI will provide solutions as well as raising the challenge in the first place. Education and training will become personalised, as we all acquire learning assistants - digital coaches which know better than we do (and better than any human teacher could do) what we already know, what we need to learn next, and how to optimise that learning process. For many years, these assistants will work alongside human teachers rather than replacing them. If we manage the transition smoothly, then by the time the replacement happens, we will hardly notice, and we won’t object.
Once we arrive at the economy of abundance, some people will continue to re-train for economic activity, but for most of us, educational will become vacational, not vocational. Which is what many of us wanted it to be all along.
Plan or panic
To survive the economic singularity, we need to identify the optimal outcome in a largely post-jobs economy. If it is indeed the economy of abundance, and fully automated luxury capitalism, then we need to build a consensus about that, and a plan for how to get there without panic. Panic at the thought of racing toward technological unemployment without a plan could be almost as bad as the fact itself. But if we can manage the transition through the economic singularity successfully, the outcome will be wonderful.

In Seinajoki, Finland, metal company  Prima Power  is trialing two of the EU’s  Factory2Fit project  solutions. This €4m study explores new ways for people and machines to work together. Dr Eija Kaasinen from  technical research centre VTT  says the aim is to put people at the centre and to enable them to participate in designing their own work environment.\xa0 The fourth industrial revolution Globally, automation and robotics are transforming manufacturing as part of the fourth industrial revolution. But this doesn\'t mean the human element is removed from work. ""Of course there are manual elements - but the work is changing towards knowledge work,"" explains Kaasinen. ""It\'s more like working with the virtual counterparts of the physical things in the physical world."" A Pre-training Solution, for example, uses 3D models and cloud-based tutorials, while a so-called Knowledge Sharing solution makes the most of all the experience a worker gathers while running complex machinery, especially when something goes wrong, as Prima Power\'s Mariia Kreposna explains. ""So here the operator can open the additional dialogue box to get extra information about the situation. This is done by sharing the additional text, description, pictures or videos so the idea is in the future whenever the alarm with the same code happens, the operator will be able to learn not only the standard remedies but also other possible reasons and how to prevent this alarm happening in the future."" ""Sleep was really important for my work performance"" At the  Elekmerk  factory in Keuruu, Finland, workers have tested the Worker Feedback Dashboard - a biometric monitoring tool - like a fitbit - and an app. It charts someone\'s work achievements and their well being - such as sleep and steps taken per day - and shows how the two can be linked. ""When we interviewed factory workers during the project we heard that often they had negative feedback when something is not going well,"" says VTT\'s Päivi Heikkilä.. ""So we wanted to develop an application that would also give you positive feedback of the fluency of your work and your accomplishments, so feedback of the things that are going well."" Ville Vuarola was one of five workers who wore the wristband for the three-month pilot scheme. He was happy to take part and says he was surprised at how a good night\'s sleep had a positive impact on his job. ""I was surprised to see how sleeping well influenced my work performance. Together with leisure activities, sleep was really important for my general performance at work,"" he says. ""We always consider the ethics"" Of all the  Factory2Fit  solutions, this was the one that proved the most controversial with fears expressed over the possible misuse of workers\' data. But Päivi Heikkilä says these concerns are unfounded. ""When we are developing these kind of solutions we always consider the ethics,"" she says, ""and I want to stress and highlight that this should always be voluntary."" The data gathered is kept on a separate server, not in the factory system. Researchers expect at least some of their Factory2Fit solutions to be commercially available by the end of next year.\xa0 ', 'dateCreated': '2020-06-02 16:06:07 +02:00', 'dateModified': '2020-06-15 18:55:05 +02:00', 'datePublished': '2020-06-15 18:50:58 +02:00', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/71/86/52/1440x810_cmsv2_701d6a35-a640-51af-899f-f25165e090a5-4718652.jpg', 'width': '1440px', 'height': '810px', 'caption': 'Futuris looks at how the relationship between man and machine in modern manufacturing is evolving through the adoption of Artificial Intelligence and automation.', 'thumbnail': 'https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/71/86/52/385x202_cmsv2_701d6a35-a640-51af-899f-f25165e090a5-4718652.jpg', 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'euronews', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/website/images/euronews-logo-main-blue-403x60.png'}}, 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Julian GOMEZ', 'url': 'gomez', 'sameAs': 'https://twitter.com/euronews'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Euronews', 'legalName': 'Euronews', 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/website/images/euronews-logo-main-blue-403x60.png', 'width': '403px', 'height': '60px'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/euronews', 'https://twitter.com/euronews', 'https://flipboard.com/@euronews', 'https://www.instagram.com/euronews.tv/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/euronews']}, 'speakable': {'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xPath': ['/html/head/title', ""/html/head/meta[@name='description']/@content""], 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/next/2020/06/15/industrial-revolution-4-0-how-man-and-machine-are-increasingly-working-as-one'}}, {'@type': 'WebSite', 'name': 'Euronews.com', 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/', 'potentialAction': {'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://www.euronews.com/search?query={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/euronews', 'https://twitter.com/euronews', 'https://flipboard.com/@euronews', 'https://www.instagram.com/euronews.tv/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/euronews']}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When company leaders talk about democratizing artificial intelligence (AI), it’s easy to imagine what they have in mind. The more people with access to the raw materials of the knowledge, tools, and data required to build an AI system, the more innovations are bound to emerge. Efficiency improves and engagement increases. Faced with a shortage of technical talent? Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have all released premade drag-and-drop or no-code AI tools that allow people to integrate AI into applications without needing to know how to build machine learning (ML) models.

What is fair when it comes to AI bias?
by Anand Rao and Ilana Golbin


But as companies move toward democratization, a cautionary tale is emerging. Even the most sophisticated AI systems, designed by highly qualified engineers, can fall victim to bias and can be difficult to explain. An AI system that was built by someone without proper training or that is operated without appropriate controls could create something outright dangerous, introducing discrimination or serious errors. Worse, the problems might not become evident until after a system has been implemented, leaving companies scrambling to reassure stakeholders, undo the damage, and fix the tech.
This is not to say that the democratization of AI is valueless. Making these new technologies more accessible and affordable expands the possibilities of what businesses and governments can accomplish and fuels competition. For example, data sets, models, and research related to the fight against the novel coronavirus have been open source, enabling a large global community to collaborate. The key for company leaders is to avoid getting carried away by the hype and instead focus on clearly identifying exactly what they are going to democratize (will it be something simple, such as data visualization, or something complex, such as model development?), who the users will be, and how their organization can both maximize the benefits and manage the risks with proper training and governance.
The technology spectrum
The technology vendors releasing AI and ML products need to start by determining which part or parts of the value chain their tool or platform will be democratizing. Here, it is helpful to think of a spectrum across which the tools and models grow more sophisticated and result in greater value generation.
At one end of the spectrum is data, and the ingestion of data into data warehouses and data lakes. AI systems, and in particular ML, run on large volumes of structured and unstructured data — it is the material from which organizations can generate insights, decisions, and outcomes. In its raw form, it is easy to democratize, enabling people to perform basic analyses. Already, a number of technology providers have created data explorers to help users search and visualize openly available data sets.
Next along the spectrum come the algorithms into which the data is fed. Here the value and complexity increase, as the data is put to work. At this point, democratization is still relatively easy to achieve, and algorithms are widely accessible; open source code repositories such as GitHub (purchased by Microsoft in 2018) have been growing significantly over the past decade. But understanding algorithms requires a basic grasp of computer science and a mathematics or statistics background.
As we continue to move along the spectrum to storage and computing platforms, the complexity increases. During the past five years, the technology platform for AI has moved to the cloud with three major AI/ML providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine. This has made central processing units and graphics processing units — essential for training reasonably large deep learning models — accessible to end-users on a pay-as-you-go basis, substantially reducing the barrier to entry. However, whereas algorithms are hardware agnostic (for example, they typically can run on any hardware or cloud platform), the cloud storage and computing platforms require users to have specific training and to be certified by the technology vendors.

Now we come to model development. Models solve specific problems: Some become recommendation engines, some become facial recognition systems, and so on. Here we are seeing democratization with automated machine learning (AutoML) platforms and tools. For example, automating the ability to ingest a variety of data formats — structured, semi-structured, and unstructured — and to run a number of algorithms on the same data set and select the best ensemble of algorithms is making the model development process more accessible and faster. But if the users are not appropriately trained, the potential is high for building bias into the model, being unable to explain the results of the model, and even making wrong decisions.
Finally, at the far end of the spectrum, we are in the early stages of creating a marketplace for data, algorithms, and models. A marketplace is also emerging for problems and talent that can solve these problems. Kaggle, created in 2010 and acquired by Google in 2017, is one of the best-known examples of a data science or AI marketplace. Its data science challenges (with significant prize money) allow people anywhere in the world to compete and demonstrate their skills. Yet as we curate data, algorithms, and models in these marketplaces, the risk of misinterpreting them and applying them in the wrong context increases significantly. The danger of systemic misuse of models will rise.
Know your users
Designing an AI system requires extensive technical know-how and a firm grasp of data science. Just as you would want to be sure a surgeon was qualified, trained, and experienced in the operating room before engaging in important surgery, you should ensure that people with solid tech chops, an understanding of the key components of an AI system, and a commitment to responsible AI are designing, testing, and maintaining the AI system.
Vendors often make sweeping statements, saying they have democratized data ingestion, data cleansing, and data mining by creating drag-and-drop tools. Or they claim that they have democratized complex statistical and computational model development by automating the entire machine learning or data science process. But who is accessing these tools and models? Have those users been appropriately trained — not just in the tool, but also in the underlying concepts?
In one example, a business user at an organization that had made drag-and-drop tools widely available built a machine learning model without setting aside a sample of the data for validation and testing. Instead, the training data was assumed to be representative of the operational data. Because the model was overfit to this training data, if it had been deployed across the organization it would have produced highly inaccurate results — leading to significant financial losses. 
The beneficiaries of AI democratization exist in three broad categories: casual users, power users, and specialist developers. Casual users and specialist developers are at opposite extremes, and power users somewhere in between; power users are more knowledgeable and well-trained than casual users, but are not working at an expert level. Business users are typically casual users; they have received extensive training neither in the statistical and mathematical concepts underlying the models nor in the specific processes required to build models. Specialist developers or data scientists generally have strong qualifications and the appropriate certifications.
Companies need to determine which of these three categories they are targeting with various initiatives. For example, when we democratize data visualization, we are enabling all three types of users to quickly create a variety of visualizations with little or no programming — which is a low-risk proposition. However, when we say we are democratizing model development, are we doing it for just specialist data scientists, to enable them to run different algorithms, evaluate them, and choose the right ensemble of models? Or are we attempting to democratize it for casual and power users as well? If the latter, extreme caution is required.
Training and governance
Organizations that have defined what they want to democratize and who will be using the tools can then determine the how — that is, how to democratize AI while avoiding misuse, abuse, bias, and other problems. There are five areas in which leaders need to take action.
1. Training. Lack of adequate training in AI development and implementation could be calamitous — especially when it comes to systems that deal with people’s health or financial well-being. For example, if casual or untrained users don’t understand the importance of splitting data into buckets for training, validation, and testing, they could easily end up with AI that produces inaccurate or unintended results (as in the example above). If we want to move from just providing access to stimulating the safe use of these AI tools, training the casual or power users with the appropriate foundations of data science is critical.
2. Data governance. Company leaders need to establish clarity on the ownership and control of data that is fed into AI-powered platforms, and on how rights relate to the insights generated. When data is collected for a specific AI/ML program, then used for other applications (which can be the case with open source data lakes), it’s easy to lose visibility into the data’s origins, the purpose of the data collection, how the data has been modified, and how it is or isn’t being safeguarded. “Shadow AI” — AI created using data not governed by teams within an organization whose job is to ensure data integrity — is also a concern. To minimize risk, AI/ML models should be built using data that is monitored, secured, and understood.
3. Model governance. Organizations often have data governance as part of corporate compliance activity, but few are monitoring the other elements involved in an AI system as closely as they should. Controls need to be in place to ensure that the models are being developed with the appropriate success or validation metrics (a balance of accuracy, fairness, and the ability to be explained) to avoid the development and deployment of AI models whose results are biased or can’t be easily explained or understood.

4. Intellectual property (IP) rights. The perceived benefits of democratization may not be achieved without decisions about who owns the IP rights. A number of companies have refused to use cloud platforms for image or audio processing out of fear that confidential information will be processed outside their four walls, and that the cloud solution provider will use and benefit from the significant insights generated from their data. As more and more companies realize that the full power of democratization comes from their data (and that of their competitors), and not from the tools and platforms themselves, they will likely demand some level of IP rights.
5. Open sourcing. Closing the loop on the enablers of democratization requires all parties to make what they have done open source, to the extent that it does not infringe on privacy, confidentiality, and competitive dynamics. Failure to close the loop from ownership to access will essentially create a one-way flow wherein some players — typically larger companies or governments with ample funding — will benefit from democratization in the short term, and those with fewer resources will be left behind.
By acknowledging the possible downsides of the democratization of AI, industry can explore the standards and guidelines needed to ensure that innovation goes hand in hand with safe implementation. And by making AI transparent and establishing governance, organizations can remove it from its “black box” and can engender trust.

Artificial intelligence has been one of the hottest areas of tech and the economy in the last few years, and AI job growth has reflected that: AI roles ranked at the top of LinkedIn's Job Of Tomorrow report in December, and the World Economic Forum estimated in January that 16% of new jobs would be in AI. Then came the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding economic downturn, which led to up to 40 million US jobs disappearing. How is the ""job of tomorrow"" faring now? New data from job boards shows that while the number of AI jobs is still growing, that growth has slowed dramatically during the coronavirus crisis.

On Monday, LinkedIn released new research showing that growth in the number of AI jobs openings has slowed, and the growth in applications for available jobs has dropped even more sharply. ""Our analysis shows that no sector of the labor market is fully immune to the impact of downturns, but some have proven to be more resilient than others — the AI specialist role is a key example,"" sai d Guy Berger, principal economist at LinkedIn. ""Scarcity of these workers continues to give them bargaining power.""

Between January 6 and March 15, before the realities of COVID-19 had fully settled in, AI job listings on LinkedIn were growing 14% year-over-year. Then, from March 16 to May 24, as US shelter-in-place orders started to take effect, AI job growth slowed to 4.6% year-over-year. AI job applications slowed too: Applications were growing 50.8% year-over-year before the pandemic, and only 30.2% after. The more dramatic slow-down in applications ""suggests that candidates in that job market may be playing it safe during a period of uncertainty,"" wrote Jenny Ying, a senior data scientist at LinkedIn, on the company's blog.The jobs that LinkedIn studied – which had AI or ML (for machine learning) in the title – typically have ""a very high bar for candidates,"" Ying wrote, adding that most new hires transition from existing, in-demand tech jobs, such as software engineering jobs or data science roles, Ying says.

Some employers believe that the coronavirus will actually lead to increased applicants, as some AI startups crumble during the crisis. ""C3.ai continues to hire exceptional data scientists and AI professionals,"" says Tom Siebel, CEO of C3.ai, which posted billboards on Bay Area highways late last year advertising its hiring. ""We expect to see the current trend of increased applicant interest accelerate as the recession and market uncertainty shake out second and third-tier AI startups and larger corporations continue to defund internally developed AI projects.""As Siebel mentions, some companies that planned AI expansion may pause those goals. ""The experimental long-term stuff will have to wait,"" says Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter, an online job board. ""The goal for businesses right now is survival, not exploring new markets, new products, and new technologies.""

ZipRecruiter saw AI job postings drop to 582 the week of April 26, from 1,798 the week of January 19. As of last week, new job AI job postings have crept back up to 810. Both LinkedIn and ZipRecruiter believe AI job growth will bounce back.""In the long term, however, COVID-19 could actually boost the adoption of AI,"" says Pollak. ""With more shopping, working, learning, exercising, and entertainment taking place online, companies will have even more user data at their fingertips. The companies that figure out how best to use it will be at a distinct advantage in the future."" Similarly, LinkedIn's Ying wrote that AI is increasingly becoming ""a tool in the toolbox for solving business problems, with expertise spread throughout people in many different roles at a company.""

With that in mind, AI skills could be useful for anyone that wants to make their resume more marketable. Online training site deeplearning.ai said that interest in its courses is booming. ""Over the past few months, we've seen a large influx of students trying to up-skill and adapt ahead of the curve,"" said Ortal Arel, the company's director of partnerships.Here are other resources for job-seekers interested in picking up AI expertise or skills during the quarantine: Take a free, seven-week machine learning course at Harvard, or pay $200 to get a certificate upon completion. Take a $50 introduction to AI online from deeplearning.ai. Many more advanced classes and a forum for students are also available. Take a six-week course on using AI in business strategy and earn a certificate from the business school of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Put AI to work for you as a job-seeker by understanding how tech companies use algorithms to find applicants. Look into AI jobs in the five states where the industry is booming fastest. Take AI classes on LinkedIn where you can also build your network and apply for openings. Learn how to apply artificial intelligence in the Salesforce system by taking any of 100 AI classes on Trailhead, the company's free online learning academy. Apply to DataRobot's online learning academy, which provides an applied data science certification, use of the DataRobot platform, and access to job placement services.

What is the acceptable failure rate of an airplane? Well, it is not zero… no matter what how hard we want to believe otherwise. There is a number, and it is a very low number. When it comes to machines, computers, artificial intelligence, etc., they are perfectly imperfect. Mistakes will be made. Poor recommendations will occur. AI will never be perfect. That does not mean they do not provide value. People need to understand why machines may mistakes and set their beliefs accordingly. This means understanding the three key areas on why AI fails: implicit bias, poor data, and expectations.




The first challenge is implicit bias, which are the unconscious perceptions people have that cloud thoughts and actions. Consider, the recent protests on racial justice and police brutality and the powerful message that Black Lives Matter. The Forbes article AI Taking A Knee: Action To Improve Equal Treatment Under The Law is a great example of how implicit bias has played a role in the discrimination  and just how hard (but not impossible) it is to use AI to reduce prejudice in our law enforcement and judicial systems. AI learns from people. If implicit bias is in the training, then the AI will learn this bias. Moreover, when the AI performs work, that work will reflect this bias… even if the work is for social good.



Take for example the Allegheny Family Screening Tool. It is meant to predict which welfare children might be at risk from foster parent abuse. The initial rollout of this solution had some challenges though. The local Department of Human Services acknowledged that the tool might have racial and income bias.  Triggers like neglect were often confused or misconstrued by associating foster parents who lived in poverty with inattention or mistreatment. Since learning of these problems, tremendous steps were taken to reduce the implicit bias in the screening tool. Elimination is much harder. When it comes to bias, how do people manage the unknown unknowns? How is social context addressed? What does “right” or “fair” behavior mean? If people cannot identify, define, and resolve these questions, then how will they teach the machine? This is a major driver AI will be perfectly imperfect because of implicit bias.

The second challenge is data. Data is the fuel for AI. The machine trains through ground truth (i.e. rules on how to make decisions, not the decisions themselves) and from lots of big data to learn the patterns and relationships within the data. If our data is incomplete or flawed, then AI cannot learn well. Consider COVID-19. John Hopkins, The COVID Tracking Project, U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the World Health Organization all report different numbers. With such variation, it is very difficult for an AI to gleam meaningful patterns from the data let alone find those hidden insights. More challenging, what about incomplete or erroneous data? Imagine teaching an AI about healthcare but only providing data on women’s health. That impedes how we can use AI in healthcare.

Then there is a challenge in that people may provide too much data. It could be irrelevant, unmeaningful, or even a distraction. Consider when IBM had Watson read the Urban Dictionary, and then it could not distinguish when to use normal language or to use slang and curse words. The problem got so bad that IBM had to erase the Urban Dictionary from Watson’s memory. Similarly, an AI system needs to hear about 100 million words to become fluent in a language. However, a human child only seems to need around 15 million words to become fluent. This implies that we may not know what data is meaningful. Thus, AI trainers may actually focus on superfluous information that could lead the AI to waste time, or even worse, identify false patterns.

The third challenge is expectations. Even though humans make mistakes, people still expect machines to be perfect. In healthcare, experts have estimated that the misdiagnosis rate may be as high as 20%, which means potentially one out of five patients are misdiagnosed. Given this data as well as a scenario where an AI assisted diagnosis may have an error rate of one out of one hundred thousand, most people still prefer to see only the human doctor. Why? One of the most common reasons given is that the misdiagnosis rate of the AI is too high (even though it is much lower than a human doctor.) People expect AI to be perfect. Potentially even worse, people expect the human AI trainers to be perfect too.

On March 23, 2016, Microsoft launched Tay (Thinking About You), a Twitter bot. Microsoft had trained its AI to the level of language and interaction of a 19-year-old, American girl. In a grand social experiment, Tay was released to the world. 96,000 tweets later, Microsoft had to shut Tay down about 16 hours after launch because it had turned sexist, racist, and promoted Nazism. Regrettably, some individuals decided to teach Tay about seditious language to corrupt it. In conjunction, Microsoft did not think to teach Tay about inappropriate behavior so it had no basis (or reason) to know that something like inappropriate behavior and malicious intent might exist. The grand social experiment resulted in failure, and sadly, was probably a testament more about human society than the limitations of AI.

Implicit bias, poor data, and people expectations show that AI will never be perfect. It is not the magic bullet solution many people hope to have. AI can still do some extraordinary things for humans like restore mobility to a lost limb or improve food production while using less resources. People should not discount the value we can get. We should always remember: AI is perfectly imperfect, just like us.

Communication in the World of Artificial Intelligence Alumni Spotlight: Sara Wagner '17
June 11, 2020



Sara Wagner graduated in 2017 with a B.A. in Strategic and Corporate Communication and a B.A. in Psychology. We caught up with Sara to hear about her Chapman experience and how her communication degree prepared her prepare for life after college. If you want to connect with Sara, you can find her on LinkedIn.
Where do you work and what is your job title?
I work at NVIDIA as a Deep Learning Institute Training Programs Manager
What does your job entail?
I Coordinate logistics to train developers, data scientists, and researchers in Artificial Intelligence and Accelerated Computing at events, trade shows, customer sites, and public workshops. We have trained over 200,000 unique individuals worldwide.
Tell us about your job search process.
I had a family friend that had a job opening on her team at NVIDIA. The team needed help immediately, I was graduating a semester early and could move there quickly to start, so they hired me as a contractor. About six months later, they created a full-time position for me and signed me as a full-time employee.
Tell us about your internship experience while at Chapman.
I found two of my internships through the Chapman job fair, which I think is one of the most valuable resources Chapman offers for its students and alumni. I had the opportunity to explore two avenues- writing for an online magazine and helping rebrand a 501c non-profit organization by creating a website and more. It gave me such great hands-on experience that helped me decide marketing was not my thing!
Why did you choose Chapman University and the School of Communication?
I chose Chapman because I wanted to be an athlete and receive an excellent education. I loved the size of the classrooms and how you could have a personal relationship with all of your professors.
How has your School of Communication degree benefited you in your career?
My Strategic and Corporate Communication senior seminar class prepared me so well for job hunting, equipping us with interview tips, resume workshops, and knowledge on researching companies before interviewing. Generally, I got experience in marketing, economics, cross-cultural communication, and more. The program was everything in one.
What advice do you have for undergraduate students or recent graduates?
Do as much hands-on, application-focused work as you can. I know this sounds clichè, but the more you put into your work, the more you will learn and grow. At Chapman, I accidentally signed up for a huge role in a big campaign project. I was not happy at first, but in the end, it turned out to be the most beneficial for me and my skill set, especially in job interviewing.

Apart from lip-syncing it also caters to short dance, comedy, and talent videos. A closer analogy would be Vine, Twitter’s still sorely missed short-form video app whose content lives on as YouTube compilations.TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Beijing based technology company found in 2012. ByteDance first launched Douyin for the China market, then it was gradually launched for the market outside China. ByteDance owns two social media platforms:- TikTok(Duoyin) for China(censored by their protocols), and a TikTok for the rest of the world. Later, TikTok merged with Musical.ly, the venture grown enormously and it was one of the most downloaded apps in the US for Q3 2018.ByteDance is the world’s most successful startup with a valuation of $100 Billion in private markets. The linchpin can be regarded as AI, the company uses powerful AI tools that are more extreme to any competitor in the west. It also developed an AI tool that can read news from 5000 sources and can generate a custom article of 400 words in 2 seconds. The company holds a firm grip over AI and have great potential to replace other social media platforms.What makes TikTok unique from other Social Media Platforms?From Susan Wojcicki to Mark Zuckerberg, all have expressed their concern over the market snatched by TikTok in recent years and are crazed by the success, it is achieving amongst users, ranging from elders to teenagers.But that explains only a part of the unprecedented success story of TikTok. It went from a “lip-syncing” feature in a small fan base to a viral feature in 2020 with almost 800 million active monthly users in less than 2 years. Within such a short period, it is comparable to old-guard social medial platforms with over 10 years in the market!TikTok monthly active users. Source : WeAreSocialTalking of numbers, TikTok has over 800 million active users worldwide that make TikTok 7th in terms of social network sites, ahead of well-known platforms such as Twitter, Pinterest, and Snapchat.Comparing with adversaries, Instagram took six years, Facebook took nearly four years from its launch to gain the same amount of monthly active users that TikTok achieved under three years.TikTok is the most downloaded app in US for May 2020. (Source: SensorTower)TikTok is the most downloaded app worldwide (non-game) for May 2020 with more than 111.9 million downloads including China’s Douyin, a 2x YOY increase from May 2019.Jumping back to the question, What makes it unique?It uses an advanced and cyclic recommendation system, Unlike old schools entertaining platforms like Netflix and YouTube, it doesn’t recommend you videos rather it dictates you what to watch?As quoted by Connie Chan, a renowned Chinese investor :“TikTok is the first mainstream consumer app where artificial intelligence IS the product. It’s representative of a broader shift.”Contradictory to Instagram and YouTube, you don’t need a single view or followers to be viral. It uses an AI-powered feed that works on the motto “the more you use it, the more it learns you”.It heavily relies on the user’s personal information(location, characteristic, traits, internet searches) to make the feed more personalized and thus often been part of information leak and misuse controversies.The basic aim of any social media platform is to keep its users engaged, and surprisingly, TikTok can engage its average new users up to 10 minutes that is three times the capability of Instagram.It lowers the barriers of entry and doesn’t even require you to sign up, once you install the app it starts tracking you from that moment and starts recommending you videos based on those factors.For illustration, if you’re new on the application and TikTok showed you a video, and you don’t watch the entire video, you will get less recommendation of those types of videos and vice-versa.Furthermore, it allows you to showcase your talent unlike other social media giants that promote status over talent; Anyone can be a creator on TikTok which is it USP!Several TheoriesThere is not a lot of transparency about algorithms, but still there are several theories based on user experiences and experts analysis.Batch Theory :According to this, when a video is uploaded, it is shown to a pool of batches with different ideologies or in simple words, based on several distinguishing factors such as their watching history, location, personal preferences. The fate of your content is based on those different batches; Re-watching, Liking, Sharing, and comments, these are the little inputs that the algorithm takes to escalate the score of your content.If your content is liked by the batches then it is pushed to a larger audience of the same thought-process and thus making it viral!Coping up with this theory, it might take a few days for you to be a celeb.And a bonus point:- The more you engage yourself in trending challenges, the more it promotes you.Authority Ranking :In the light of this principle, your fate of going viral depends upon your first few videos. If those garner some views and likes, then it sets a stage for you as a creator and your only job will be to engage with the audience as much as possible.Once you get authority ranking, you will be in limelight and will stand some levels above novice users although you’re still a novice.Delay Momentum :Following this principle, some users have advised not to delete any piece of content no matter how crap that is!Some users have experienced that, if their content does no good and they start being less active on the platform, the platform will try to boost their content on its own after a while, thus encouraging them to create more for their audience.Possible TikTok recommendation systemThere is no confirmed workflow for the TikTok’s algorithm but based on the data posted by the company, and trails found by nerds. I made up the accompanying determination.How does the TikTok algorithm work for a content creator?Once a video is uploaded to TikTok, the highly capable AI algorithm uses NLP and computer vision to analyze the video.SourceIt will analyze every part of your video including audio, captions and metadata(hashtags) to build up an understanding of the content and context of the videos.“Artificial intelligence powers all of Bytedance’s content platforms,” the spokesperson says. “We build intelligent machines that are capable of understanding and analyzing text, images and videos using natural language processing and computer vision technology. This enables us to serve users with the content that they find most interesting, and empower creators to share moments that matter in everyday life to a global audience.”How TikTok uses AI to analyze the content, Created By Daksh Trehan, All Rights ReservedAfter being checked upon its rules and regulations, the content will be pushed to a small batch of the audience and, an evaluation will happen based on how the sample set of users reacted to that piece of content. Each metric that is tracked has a possible associated score.Re-watch rate = 10 PointsCompletion rate = 8 PointsShares = 6 PointsComments = 4 PointsLikes = 2 PointsBut looping your video over and again won’t make you viral, because this algorithm can distinguish redundant entries.Once the aggregate score for your content is decent, it will push it to a wider audience sharing same thoughts and dogma.TikTok workflow for Content Creators, Designed by Daksh Trehan, All Rights ReservedAnd don’t be disheartened if your content doesn’t go viral, because the cycle isn’t ended but rather just paused and according to Delay Momentum theory, it might roll back once you start leaving a shorter footprint on the application.This is a chain reaction, that will going to continue, engaging more content creators and thus more audience. This is the essence of this platform, that can hooks its users for a long time.How does TikTok learn about you as a user?As discussed earlier, TikTok lowers its barrier of entry by not forcing its users to sign up. Rather the app starts learning as much as it can about you. The first sequence of videos you consume helps it to decide your taste.The first task is to keep you in the app for as long as possible. It will only show you videos that are liked by wider range of audience thus trying to keep your exit rate low.Once you are in their ecosystem, they will track each of your metrics and create a score for your profile for each genre.Every time you re-watch a video or consume the entire duration of the video, the algorithm takes note suggesting some more videos of similar type for your profile. Here is the detailed possible metrics system:Re-watch rate = 10 PointsCompletion rate = 8 PointsShares = 6 PointsComments = 4 PointsLikes = 2 PointsTikTok workflow for New Users, Designed by Daksh Trehan, All Rights ReservedAlong with your metrics data, it will also collect your personal information such as your location, your internet history, your age to create a more accurate personalized feed, thus keeping you in their ecosystem as long as possible.The wonder of such algorithm is, it can engage user all around world from different age group with its exceptional content recommendation system!Recommendation workflow in a NutshellTikTok algorithm possible workflow, Designed by Daksh Trehan, All Rights ReservedAt TikTok, there are millions of contents uploaded by users daily. It is not practically possible to monitor each content manually, so a review is done by the machine and if the content is tagged insensitive to company’s protocols it is passed for a human review.After passing human review, the content is checked for duplication, after passing that stage, the content is passed to a small batch of users for initial feedback; based on metrics system the score for the content is evaluated, the score decides the fate of content; if the score is above some threshold then the content is pushed to a wider audience but is cooled down in a week or so, to keep its users experiencing new content.But if the feedback is low, the cycle doesn’t stop right here, but rather it is paused and the application observes user’s behavior and its active time, if it experiences a high exit rate then the cycle will become active again and boosting the content thus encouraging the creator to create more and engage more on the platform.This cycle is the main reason, it makes its users obsessive as doesn’t let its users get bored, if you’re a user it will keep dictating you and recommending you highly personalized feeds and if you’re a creator it will try to distribute you some attention thus keeping your morale high and encouraging to you create more!If you like this article, please consider subscribing to my newsletter: Daksh Trehan’s Weekly Newsletter.ConclusionHopefully, this article has given you How TikTok is using AI and how its recommendation workflow can hook its users for a longer time with a low exit rate.As always, thank you so much for reading, and please share this article if you found it useful! :)References:[1] Reverse engineering how TikTok algorithm works[2] Why TikTok made its user so obsessive?

While many opinions have been expressed on the predatory role of AI (for example, AI will ‘replace’ most of the work humans do), we offer an alternate view of the role AI can play in our lives and especially in our organizations. The famous poet, Robert Frost, once beautifully articulated that ‘Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference’. It seems that, as business leaders, we are at a similar ‘two roads diverged in a wood’ moment, and the decisions we take on the role AI will play in our organisations will probably significantly change the evolutionary trajectory of our organisations. We believe that organisations can benefit much more from following an ‘augmentation’ strategy (as compared to ‘replacement’ strategy) as it relates to AI. Our experience has shown that, if augmented effectively with unique human capabilities, AI has the potential to significantly transform the three key pillars of organisations – work, worker and workplace - and enable creation of a hyper-productive ‘HumBot’ (Human + Robot) organisation. Work Work is a fundamental and defining component of a human life. While technology advancements have impacted the way work is done, humans still spend a lot of time doing work that can be best done by a machine (‘Bot’). By freeing up humans to focus more on those tasks (for example, empathy and inspiration) that maximises their potential, we are likely to significantly increase organisational productivity. However, to achieve this, we will need to redesign work to optimally utilise and integrate the best of both ‘human’ and ‘bot’ capabilities. For example, we can leverage the bot’s ability to do high-volume, complex data collation task (for example, download bulk data from multiple systems at different times and do pattern and anomaly detection) and augment that with uniquely human skills (for example, deep enquiry, crisp articulation) to create a ‘proactive insights platform’ that can significantly enhance quality of decision making throughout the organisation. Worker As work gets redesigned through infusion of AI technologies, the role of the worker (doing the work) is also likely to change significantly. While some roles may get replaced by AI, we believe AI technologies can lead to two significant benefits for workers – (a) it can create new roles that do not exist today (b) it can transform existing roles to make them more impactful. For example, while AI may automate a transactional process like ‘invoice processing’ (and hence replace the work of people processing invoices), it can create new higher value-added roles for better managing the working capital of the organisation and to enhance the quality of relationship the organisation has with its ecosystem of vendors and partners. Additionally, AI has the potential to further increase the effectiveness of these new roles by acting as ‘personalised digital augmenters’ (for example, alert the ‘vendor relationship manager’ on a significant news about an important vendor and proactively perform quick customised correlation analysis to provide ‘next best moves’ for consideration). By embracing (rather than fearing and resisting) AI, we have the opportunity to enhance the quality of work and provide human workers more opportunities to find joy, meaning and fulfilment in their work. Also Read: Automation and AI in a changing business landscape Workplace As the work gets redesigned and the role of worker gets enhanced, the workplace is also expected to change significantly. COVID-19 has taught us that humans are resilient enough to change their behaviours and attitudes quickly and dramatically. As ‘work from anywhere’ becomes more common, the definition of ‘workplace’ may become more fluid. While this increased fluidity may lead to increased productivity and better worker morale, organisations will need to consider creating a more secure, responsive and collaborative hybrid (‘virtual’ and ‘physical’) workplace. AI technologies (for example, virtual whiteboards that convert speech to text and vice versa) can help create these hybrid workplaces to help human workers achieve better outcomes in a faster, smarter and more secure manner. As business leaders navigate the proverbial ‘two-roads-diverged-in-a-wood’ moment as it relates to defining the right AI strategy for their organisations, we suggest also considering the ‘augmentation’ strategy (as compared to the ‘replacement’ strategy we hear most about). Defining and implementing the right AI strategy can help organisations to create a hyper-productive HumBot organisation in which a new type of work is performed by a new type of worker in a new type of (hybrid) workplace.

INTRODUCTION 
MEANING OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a term which was coined by the father of AI – John McCarthy. The Oxford Dictionary defines Artificial Intelligence as “ the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception ,speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages[1]” Simply put, AI is a broad branch of computer science wherein the goal is to create systems which can function independently and intelligently One can say that it is an intelligent machine which has the ability to think, understand and act on its own and also has the skill to replicate certain human behaviour. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence is a machine which has the capability and ability to solve problems that are usually tackled by us humans with our natural intelligence. To elaborate further, the purpose behind the development of AI is the requirement as well as the demand for automation in this high paced life of humans. The monotonous tasks or even complex tasks and are now being performed by utilizing the AI technology. 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INDIAN LEGAL PROFESSION 
From using the typewriters to now using a computer, from using only libraries for legal research to using online portals for finding relevant case laws, from fax machines to emails, each advancement has been transformative in the field of law. Now it’s time for AI to enter the field of law. The legal services market is one of the largest in the world, but at the same time it is also said to be under-digitized in its working. The field of law is very traditional in its approach and slow in adapting to new tools. It’s time that we acknowledge the fact that Artificial Intelligence possess the capabilities to change the manner in which lawyers currently operate and the way law is looked at in India. Technology is of relevance in so far as it promotes- efficiency, transparency and objectivity in public governance – as humbly stated by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, he threw light upon the idea that AI is not there to replace the judges or the human mind but it is present in order to provide a facilitative tool to the judges in order to recheck or reassess the work, the process and the judgements. The prime goal being to ultimately provide a wider access to justice to the common people.
The primary step taken for India’s Artificial Intelligence framework was the AI Task Force Report, in order to study artificial intelligence in depth. This task force was set up by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry headed by the Chairman of Tata Sons N. Chandrasekaran for analyzing the financial advantages of using AI and to see how it will benefit India.[2] The Task force stated its vision “To embed AI in our Economic, Political and Legal thought processes so that there is systematic capability to support the goal of India becoming one of the leaders of AI-rich economies”.
The Indian legal profession is such that the whole process is manually done as the nature of the legal industry is still said to be tilted towards being labour intensive. Hence, AI is at its early stages as most of the older generation advocates are of the opinion that technology should not be used extensively as it might take over man and thus shy away from the idea of AI in law. Having said that, there are many tech-savvy lawyers, as well as big law firms which are utilizing the advancements in the field of technology to the fullest in order to have an edge over others. We all know that the Indian legal system is vast, our Constitution alone being the lengthiest in the whole world, hence with changing times it’s essential to cope with the dynamic environment with the usage of AI in law. Using machine learning technology by lawyers in the field of legal research can help them to get an unparalleled insight into the legal domain within a few seconds. One such firm being Cyril Armarchand and Mangaldas who has acknowledged the AI powers and is also embracing it with enthusiasm. CAM has made history by being the first Indian law firm to give license to “Kira”, which is a Canada based machine learning software built by Kira Systems. This AI based software is capable of doing many things and thus saves the long man-hours. “Kira” system is being used for analyzing legal documents, identifying and spotting any risk areas and it also used for extracting clauses from various legal documents.
 
USES AND ADVANTAGES OF AI IN LEGAL PROFESSION 
With the advancement in the field of AI technology, it has reduced the long man-hours which were earlier required to do the tiresome work of going through hefty paperwork which is required to be done by lawyers. There are various ways by which the legal industry can benefit by using the AI technology to its advantage in order to reap out the maximum benefits.
Some highlights of the ways in which AI technology is helping out law firms and lawyers and proving to be a boon for the legal industry are discussed below:

Legal Research Work: 

Legal research requires long hours and can also get monotonous due to its complex nature, and keeping in mind the tight deadlines most law firms require to meet they need a quick and accurate legal research work. This challenge is met by using AI software which can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy; it reduces time as with one click AI provides relevant case laws which can be beneficial for assisting judges in order to deliver speedy judgements. ROSS Intelligence is one such company which employs machine run software to review contract documents quickly and also reviews them; the software also highlights relevant documents. Therefore, with the usage of correct software legal research can be optimized and can greatly improve the efficiency as well.

Due Diligence: 

Due diligence process requires long number of working hours by legal practitioners as they are required to review multiple legal documents. Converting and organization of all such important documents is surely a cumbersome process and takes in a long time. However, with the availability of AI solutions, the tedious work of due diligence can be handled much more quickly and with more accuracy. With the help of machine learning technology, studies prove that AI systems have shown to do the work of reviewing legal documents much faster and with accuracy. Kira systems is one such company which accurately carries out the due diligence checks, it is far quicker than reviewing it manually.

Reduce Costs and Increase Productivity: 

AI can help in streamlining the legal department by automating tasks and processes. In order to fully utilize the potential of AI, the in-house lawyers should start using the software as it can be a useful tool, it can help to reduce costs, it can aid in coming up with new strategies, AI software can detect and reduce the contract risks and thus deliver a more efficient and better service. It is important to use the best AI contract review software. Company called eBrevia- developed with assistance from the Columbia University aims to apply machine learning and tools like natural language processing, software driven by AI to minimize the time spent on reviewing contracts and the goal is to speed up the research and review process.

Analysis of Legal Documents: 

The AI software can detect important patterns and can help in figuring out the correlations it can help legal practitioners in their case by furnishing judgements and also precedent law which can be used by them. AI can review bulk contracts efficiently and much faster than humans.

Electronic Billing: 

Legal software used in AI technology is used for the preparation of invoices for the lawyers according to the work carried out by them. This helps the firm and the lawyer to decipher the accurate billing of the work done by the legal practitioner.
 
CHALLENGES OF AI IN LAW

Not completely accepted by legal professionals: 

Artificial intelligence in law is still at its infant stage when we look India. Lawyers are reluctant to use this technology and fear that it will have a toll on employment. They dread that technology would take over a lawyer or a legal clerk’s bread and butter and would ultimately lead more cases of unemployment in the country. Most senior legal practitioners shy away from changing their habits and want to stick to their traditional way of practicing without using AI.

Legal Personality of AI is Not Defined: 

The legal personality of artificial intelligence is not clearly defined anywhere in our law, robots are complex in nature and thus it becomes difficult to ascertain whether ordinary laws and rules would be applicable in the same manner or not. Therefore, until the rights and obligations of AI driven machines and tools become clear it would continue to cause confusion since the current legal framework does not hold a robot responsible for its acts or omissions per se.

Lack of Proper Systems and Data:

Machine learning is based on the algorithms which are fed in the computer systems and on the basis of that the machine acts. One of the major barriers in using AI technology in the case of India is that, there is outdated technology and machines which are being used, the data is often not complete and unless huge chunk of reliable data is provided to the machine it will not be able to perform accurately.[3]

Costly: 

The AI machines are sophisticated machine systems capable of learning and acting on its own, this also calls for huge amount of investment in terms of money. Mostly such AI driven machines are produced by foreign companies, this further makes it difficult for small and midsized law firms to get their hands on the only big law firms are able to afford them.

Privacy and Protection of Personal Data: 

It is essential that the AI driven machine learning robots are developed in such a manner which keeps the private data of the parties involved safe and secure. Since machine learning works on huge amount of data it becomes all the more essential that, the legal framework is such which provides protection that the data will not be misused, confidentiality must be maintained and a fair due process needs to be followed, a security layer to check breach of privacy must be done.
NITI Ayog in 2018 released a paper called “National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence” this policy paper considered the importance of AI which can be used in various sectors in India, in the 2019 Budget it also put forward the idea of launching a national programme on AI.[4] Even though all these advancements took place in the technological fronts, there is still no effective legislation which regulates and controls the AI industry in India.
 
AI RELATED START-UPS AND THEIR IMPACT 

Spot Draft: 

This is an AI based start-up by Shashank Bijapur, who is a Harvard Law School alumni and Madhav Bhagat an ex-Google employee. This AI driven business has the ability to scrutinise legal documents and it reduces the paperwork by giving the customers an option to create business contracts. This revolutionary platform offers its clients an option to draft and sign contracts it also has features of automatic reminders and payments.

CaseMine: 

This is a legal research platform. This start-up aims at using AI technology in order to draw links between different case laws and thus makes it simpler for the legal researcher to have an in depth and comprehensive research.

CaseIQ: 

This machine learning software acts like a legal assistant in researching case laws, it also analyses the legal language and works like an assistant by pointing out any potential points of law which might be missing, suggests alternative arguments, highlights relevant judgements and case laws for a comprehensive legal research.

NearLaw: 

This Mumbai based start-up offers AI based solutions to legal practitioners and law firms. NearLaw is said to be using NLP technologies to assist in legal matters by understanding case rankings.

Practice League: 

This is a Pune based legal tech law firm which has used AI capabilities to transform the working model for more than 8,000 lawyers. Reports highlight that this firm is working with tech giants like Google and Amazon in order to weave AI abilities into its working solutions.
 
IMPACT OF AI ON INDIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM: 
When we look at the Indian judicial system, there exists judicial delays the judiciary is over burdened with more than 3 crore pending cases which leads to unwanted delays in providing justice to the people and as the saying goes- justice delayed is indeed justice denied. Therefore, various measures are being taken up to improve the current condition like reducing the vacation duration, increasing the strength of the judges but it’s time to do more than this and that is where the role of Artificial Intelligence comes into play.[5] There are various cases registered every year which are of similar nature thus, Judiciary requires data science and AI which have the ability of assisting the judges by using predictive technology which helps in availability of vital information about the ongoing cases based on previous case of similar nature. Analysis done by AI can aid judges in speedy judgement delivery. Studies show that the role of AI can be very useful at the evidence stage, as it is a vital stage of any case it also takes up a huge amount of court’s time, multiple delays are a common feature of this stage for various reasons such as delay because of Investigation in-charge, absence of witnesses etc. the role of AI technology in such cases would be of predicting potential delays and this would aid the judges as they would have knowledge beforehand about the causes for above mentioned delays in certain similar kind of cases eg; murder. This predictive technology will be useful as the judges would be able to handle the load of each case accordingly, it can also help the judges to take proactive measures to prevent the witnesses from turning hostile by granting them extra police protection.
One of the major developments which recently took place was that the Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde, recently said in an even that “We have a possibility of developing Artificial Intelligence for court system. Only for the purpose of ensuring that the undue delay in justice is prevented” He also made it clear that AI will not be replacing human discretion or judges. Sharing more insights he further stated that “It is only the repetitive, mathematical and the mechanical parts of the judgements for which help can be taken from the machine learning system…we are exploring the possibility of implementing it”.[6]
This is certainly one of the biggest highlights that the Chief Justice of India himself is of the view that using AI technology in law and judicial system will reap out benefits. Indian Judicial system will greatly benefit from it if its gets implemented with proper legal framework stating rules and regulations.
  
RECENT GROWTH OF AI IN JUDICIAL DOMAIN 

Supreme Court Vidhik Anuvaad Software (SUVAS): 

The Supreme Court of India has launched an official AI driven application which is specially created by using machine assisted translation technology trained by AI. The primary focus of this app is to translate English legal documents and Orders into 9 vernacular languages. This is the very first step taken by our judiciary to include AI in Legal domain.

Multilingual Official Mobile app. of Supreme Court of India: 

The apex court of our country with assistance of the National Informatics Centre has launched an app which would provide the citizens with the authentic access to the display board, cases, daily orders, judgements, important circulars and much other vital information with just a click.

E-courts: 

This is one of the most important developments done by the judicial reforms it has made a huge impact in terms of saving time, energy and money as all the important data regarding judgments, court orders is available online at zero cost for the users.[7]

IIT-Kharagpur developed AI system to read legal orders: 

Researchers at IIT Kharagpur have come up with an AI aided technology which can read orders and judgements and it also possess the ability to highlight the laws which are being violated, all this is being done via machine learning technology.
 
WILL AI REPLACE LAWYERS? 
Artificial Intelligence is used to facilitate the working of lawyers by reducing their load and not to replace them. There is a big misconception among many legal practitioners and firms that AI would take over the lawyers, but it is certainly not possible because even though a machine learning tool can aid in research, contract review and predicting certain aspects with desired data but it certainly cannot take over tasks like giving advice to clients, negotiating terms, arguing in front of the judges, all these essential activities will always be performed by lawyers and no machine can replace them. As correctly stated by our Chief Justice that AI is their to aid lawyers and judges for a speedy delivery of justice and can never replace them.[8]
In fact, AI has reduced the burden on lawyers so that they can focus their mind on other important aspects, thus it has made them more productive and efficient. The emergence of AI will actually create more job opportunities of data analytics, thus the notion that technology is taking away jobs is negated, rather it is actually creating new opportunities for us.
 
USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND AI DURING COVID-19 IN LAW 
The pandemic caused due to the highly infection disease coronavirus has taken a toll on the lives of people. In context of law, it has most certainly made the lawyers and judges realize the importance of technology and the need of using AI and machine learning software to get the work done. Since social distancing has led to a lockdown situation the courts are taking up only urgent matters via video conferencing methods and e- filing of legal documents as per the order passed by the Supreme Court.[9] The Apex Court in the case of Swapnil Tripathi v. Supreme Court of India has itself recognized the principle of live streaming of proceeding except certain cases like rape, matrimonial cases etc.[10]
“The wheels of justice cannot be halted because of lockdown” as correctly pointed out by Justice Sikhri, delivery of justice also comes under essential services and during the time of Covid-19 technology has played a vital role from e-filing, e-payment of court fee etc. Delhi High Court has even took a step forward by setting up e-rooms by making some court rooms entirely paperless, and one can check their case details on their online portal. Thus, given the situation we all are in, technology is the only friend who is here to stay for a long time, it’s time to embrace the advancements in technological fields including AI and move towards the path of development.
 
CONCLUSION
Advancement in technology has surely changed the outlook of the legal industry, it can be concluded that AI in the field of law proves to have many advantages, it has aided legal professionals in brisk research work, with its predictive technology it can assist judges in decision making process, it is useful for law firms for due diligence work, collection of data etc. which makes their work more efficient and quicker ,machine learning technology saves time, it is accurate and has effective results . Even though AI has multiple advantages but it cannot not replace lawyers, it can assist them in certain areas of work but AI lacks strategic thinking, it is not creative like humans, it lacks the ability to improvise in front of a judge, robots don’t possess emotional intelligence and feeling of empathy. Inclusion of AI in the legal industry has many challenges ahead of itself, some of them being- it is still prone to a lot of risks thus we need a proper legal framework in order to regulate Artificial Intelligence to prevent it from misusing their client’s data . The complete inclusion of AI in legal industry will be possible only once we have legal framework governing its actions to minimize the risks attached with it, only then we would be able to reap out maximum benefits of AI. To safeguard the inclusion of AI, we need to have a fair and balanced approach, few suggestions include- 1) A strong regulatory framework is required to be drafted which clearly states out the obligations and liabilities of this intelligent machine, 2) accountability factor needs to be paid attention to, in order to control its actions 3) stronger data protection laws are needed to protect privacy. Thus, the solution is not to take a back seat and shy away from the technological advancements but to embrace it and use AI to our advantage by having required legislations in place to safeguard the interests of its users.

This week IBM, Microsoft and Amazon announced that they would suspend the sale of their facial recognition technology to law enforcement agencies. It’s yet another sign of the dramatic impact of the protests for social justice. 


But the moves from the tech giants also illustrate the inherent risks of AI, especially when it comes to bias and the potential for invasion of privacy.  Note that there are already indications that Congress will take action to regulate the technology.  In the meantime, many cities have already instituted bans, such San Francisco.

Because of the advances of deep learning and faster systems for processing enormous amounts of data, facial recognition has certainly seen major strides over the past decade. Yet there is still much to be done. 

PROMOTED
“AI face recognition technology is damn good, but it is not very robust,” said Ken Bodnar, who is an AI researcher. “This means that the neural network is well trained and capable of amazing feats of identification, but if one little parameter is off, it mis-identifies you. The way that it works, is that everything is a probability with AI. So when it looks at a face, it has a range of proprietary algorithms and parameters it measures. The most accurate AI tools are Deep Belief Networks that winnow out features like double chins, eye distance, hair type, bushy eyebrows, fat lips, age parameters etc. But the ‘not-very-robust’ categorization means that it is easy to fool because of the intrinsic nature of the way that neural networks work.”

True, when it comes to certain applications of facial recognition, the accuracy issues may not necessarily be a big deal (such as with a cool social media app). But of course, this is a different matter when its about whether someone should be arrested.

Facial recognition has also been shown to be less effective when analyzing videos and images of minorities. “As for the issues with this technology, a study out of MIT last year found that all of the facial recognition tools had major issues when identifying people of color,” said Michal Strahilevitz, who is a professor of marketing at St. Mary's College of California. “Another study out of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology suggested facial recognition software had far more errors in attempting to recognize black and Asian faces than it had in recognizing Caucasian ones.  This means that black and brown people are more likely to be inaccurately identified, and thus unfairly targeted. This may not be intentional, but it ends up having a racial bias that is dangerous and unethical.”

Yet the debate over facial recognition can certainly get complicated and may even lead to unintended consequences. 
“The moves reflect a lack of popular understanding of the technology–the public is conflating facial recognition with body recognition and tracking, facial analysis, facial detection, gender/age/ethnicity recognition, biometric validation, etc. as well as misunderstanding the difference between the use case and the technology,” said Kjell Carlsson, who is an analyst at Forrester. “It is very unclear exactly what is being renounced and for what use cases. The result is almost certainly the worst of both worlds: Ineffectual policy to prevent misuse together with applying the breaks on valuable use cases. For example, wouldn’t we want folks to use facial recognition to help identify kidnapping victims in Nigeria? Or to help diagnose rare genetic disorders in children with facial analysis for genetic phenotyping? Or to help catch the Boston Marathon bombers? Or to reduce the false positives in the techniques that the police use to match faces to mugshots that they have been using for decades?”

It's interesting to note that facial recognition technology will likely continue to see more innovation and development. regardless of the bans and regulatory actions. Just take a look at GitHub and you’ll find sophisticated systems…for free.
So if anything, when it comes to companies like IBM, Microsoft and Amazon, it’s important for them to do more than ban the technology. “I do hope that they come back with a better-designed system that respects the user's privacy and allows for usage in times of need and with conscious protection for users and their data,” said Lovelesh Chhabra, who is the Vice President of Membership Platforms at Verizon Media.
This should then be backed up with a strong set of principles and ethical standards that the industry can follow. The result will likely be a stronger foundation for AI. 
“The good news is that bias-free identification at all levels of a device is possible, but every player involved–for apps, hardware and OS providers—has to be willing to commit to it,” said André Ferraz, who is the founder and CEO of Incognia.

Professional Go player Ke Jie played against DeepMind's AI program AlphaGo in 2016. The program won by displaying human-like creativity when it made a new and unexpected move that went beyond the data on which it was trained

“It was nine seventeen in the morning, and the house was heavy.” Thus begins the 2018 novel 1 the Road. Not a bad opening sentence – certainly no worse than many others that have been committed to posterity. The main difference, however, is that this particular sentence has no author – not in the conventional sense of the word, anyway.
This is because 1 the Road was written entirely by artificial intelligence (AI). Its prose was conjured up by a long short-term memory recurrent neural network, which took input – or inspiration, if you prefer – from surveillance cameras and other sensors mounted on a truck travelling from New York to New Orleans. The end result was an AI-penned version of Jack Kerouac’s On the Road.
This new novel is just one example of AI being used for creative endeavours. Those employed in jobs that are deemed ‘low skill’ have long known that automation poses a threat to their livelihood, but musicians, artists and writers have largely assumed that a machine could never replicate their work. Perhaps this confidence was misplaced.

Musicians, artists and writers have largely assumed that a machine could never replicate their work. Perhaps this confidence was misplaced

Not so smart
Every year since 2015, AI has featured as part of Gartner’s top 10 strategic technology trends in one form or another. The technology and the huge impact that it could have on the business world has long been appreciated, but sifting through the hype is difficult. Science fiction has conjured up images of AI that range from benevolent robot housekeepers to apocalyptic supercomputers. Clearly, the technology is not quite at this stage yet.
Nevertheless, AI is no longer something that needs to be discussed in the future tense – it is already here. When customers have an issue with a product or service, their first port of call is often the website of the respective business. Once there, they might join an online chat to help resolve their problem. Increasingly, this dialogue will be between the customer and a chatbot or virtual assistant. They may have a friendly-looking avatar and surprisingly human-like responses, but they are in fact nothing more than multiple lines of code.
In the manufacturing sector, companies like BMW, Airbus and LG are using AI to deliver greater levels of efficiency, safety and reliability on the factory floor. In the home, meanwhile, developments in AI mean that vacuum cleaners can scan rooms for size and obstacles, determine the most efficient cleaning route and then get to work – all without any human input.
These are all impressive feats – ones that would have been scarcely believable just a few decades ago. However, whether they truly represent AI is debatable. In the aforementioned examples, what is termed AI only works within clearly defined parameters: a robot designed to manufacture car parts cannot employ its skills to help put bikes together, and autonomous vacuum cleaners are powerless when confronted by a humble set of stairs.
Artificial general intelligence refers to a machine that can apply knowledge and skills within different contexts – in short, one that can learn by itself and work out problems like a human
“At present, many examples of AI still represent what has been called ‘narrow AI’, working only within clearly defined parameters,” said Arthur I Miller, author of The Artist in the Machine: The World of AI-Powered Creativity. “There is, however, research being done on developing multipurpose machines. DeepMind in London is working on a version of [computer program] AlphaZero, which started out playing games, to work on medical research – specifically, to look into protein folding, the process whereby an embryo begins to generate organs by folding protein chains.”
Self-driving cars, digital personal assistants like Alexa and even automated spam filters fall within what can be termed ‘narrow AI’. Conversely, artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to a machine that can apply knowledge and skills within different contexts – in short, one that can learn by itself and work out problems like a human. But even as artificial intelligence improves, the number of applications that can be classified as AGI remain few and far between.
Getting creative
One major stumbling block that must be overcome before a machine can claim to possess AGI is the issue of creativity. Humans find it easy to reach beyond the limits of their own knowledge and create something new – it might not be any good (however ‘good’ may be determined), but all of us can write poetry, draw, decorate and cook. These are creative processes, even if we don’t consciously appreciate them as such. Machines, on the other hand, largely do as they’re told.
Increasingly, though, machines are showing their creative side. As well as novels like 1 the Road, an AI bot named Benjamin wrote a short science fiction film called Sunspring in 2016, which was subsequently acted out and played during the SCI-FI-LONDON film festival. It remains available on YouTube.
Journalists, too, have reasons to be concerned. A number of media outlets including Forbes, The Washington Post and Reuters use machine learning tools to help them produce content. Bloomberg uses a computer system known as Cyborg to instantly turn financial reports into mini articles; according to the New York Times, it is now responsible for around a third of all the content produced by Bloomberg News.

Sceptics would say the written word is among the easier creative fields to mimic – after all, it does have clear grammatical rules to follow and there is an almost limitless vault of content for machines to learn from. But AI creativity has extended into other media as well. “Other examples of AI creativity include AlphaGo, an artificial neural network created at DeepMind, which defeated a top-flight Go master in 2016,” Miller told The New Economy. “It did so by making a totally new and unexpected move which went beyond the data on which it was trained – an amazing display of creativity.”
Sony, meanwhile, has used a machine learning platform called Flow Machines to create a song in the style of the Beatles, while in 2019, Warner Music Group signed a deal with an app called Endel for the distribution of 600 algorithm-created tracks to put on streaming services. Similarly, Google’s Deep Dream Generator has been used to create otherworldly pieces of art, some of which have fetched thousands of dollars at auction. The buyers evidently thought the creativity on show was worth paying for.
Machines have even shown an aptitude for thinking on their feet, something previously thought beyond them. Last year, IBM’s Project Debater took on Harish Natarajan, a 2016 World Debating Championship finalist, in a debate over whether preschools should receive government subsidies. Although Natarajan won, IBM’s AI system made a number of convincing arguments, created its own rebuttals to Natarajan’s points and formulated a closing argument.
All work and no play
No discussion of AI would be complete without some consideration of the apocalyptic future that it is destined to bring about – according to some, anyway. Such fears seem hyperbolic at the moment, but that is because there is not much reason to suspect a customer service chatbot is going to take over the world. However, as AI develops further – as it starts to display creativity and emotions – concerns become more justifiable. If AI can do everything better than we can, what is the point of humans even existing?

This replacement fear often manifests itself through the prism of job losses. However, Miller believes a creative machine may be able to collaborate with humans more effectively, rather than replace them: “AIs have hugely more information in their memories than humans and can deal with it in ways beyond our powers. They can therefore work with humans to develop new products, which might not be found without their help.”
Still, there is no doubt that creative AI poses a new threat to the workforce. According to a 2018 report by PwC, as many as 30 percent of existing jobs could face automation by the mid-2030s. However, not all industries and job roles would be affected equally.
“Industries follow different paths of automation over time, and data-driven industries… may be most automatable in the short term,” the report read. “In contrast, relatively low automatability sectors such as human health, social work and education have more focus on social skills, empathy and creativity, which are more difficult to directly replace by a machine, even allowing for potential technological advances over the next 10 to 20 years.”
As the ability of AI solutions to work creatively improves, however, even the jobs once considered safe from automation may find themselves at risk. It will likely take a long time before writers, musicians, chefs and artists are replaced, but they should no longer think it impossible. For employers and patrons, the appeal is obvious: AI will never miss a deadline, complain about having to alter its work or ask for more money.
Finding inspiration
The scientific progress that has enabled machines to display elements of human creativity is astounding – so much so that the scientists behind it are themselves not entirely sure what is involved. Developments are generally focused on neural networks – these were involved in the writing of 1 the Road, the development of Google’s AlphaGo, and were used to craft Project Debater’s arguments.
“Artificial neural networks are loosely inspired by the way the brain is wired,” Miller explained. “They are made up of layers of artificial neurons and, like the human brain, require data in order to respond to what they see and hear. They can learn without being specifically programmed to do so. Deep neural networks have many layers of neurons.”

Although often compared with one another, the human brain and a traditional computer actually operate in contrasting ways. In a computer, transistors are connected to one another in relatively simple arrangements, or chains. Conversely, in the brain, neurons are interconnected with each other in complex, densely packed layers. This makes computers great for storing huge amounts of information and retrieving it in set, pre-programmed ways. But the brain, while it may take a long time to learn complex information, can reorganise and repurpose it into something new – in other words, it can behave creatively.
In an effort to mimic this creativity, computer scientists have been working on artificial neural networks (ANNs) inspired by the brain. They perform tasks by learning from examples without being given task-specific rules. This approach has shown particular success in pattern recognition, facial recognition, translating between languages and speech recognition.
Importantly, however, there is no physical difference between an ANN and a more traditional computer. Machines built on ANNs still have transistors connected in much the same way as a standard consumer PC, but will be running software that mimics the connections seen in a human brain.
But despite the fact that ANNs are designed by programmers, just like any other piece of computing software, how they work is not always understood. AI suffers from what is known as the ‘black box’ problem: while we have clear visibility of the inputs and outputs of any such system, we cannot see how the algorithms take the former and come up with the latter. How exactly did Google’s AlphaGo platform come up with the playing moves it chose? Why does 1 the Road start the way it does and not with any number of other grammatically correct sentences? We cannot see inside the black box to answer these questions, which means a lot of AI’s achievements stem from guesswork.
Everyone’s a critic
There are many who will say that the examples of creativity that machines have displayed so far are still operating within fixed parameters. When a computer crafts a song, it may be impossible for a human to determine in advance exactly what it will sound like, but there are unlikely to be any other surprises. The machine is only creating music because it has been told to do so – this seems a long way from the spark of inspiration felt by the likes of Mozart or McCartney.
“Machines have shown glimmers of creativity, but we will not be able to say that they are truly creative until they have developed emotions, volition and consciousness and actually desire to create,” Miller said. “They will also need to be able to assess their work. One day, however, machines will certainly be truly creative. There is no reason why only humans can be called creative. Many people who deny that machines will ever be creative do so out of fear of dystopian worlds that are more sci-fi than reality.”
To determine whether machines will ever truly reach this standard, a definition of creativity will need to be agreed upon. This in itself seems like an impossible undertaking. Art is subjective, and whether a machine can be called an artist is likely to remain so as well – at least, until the point when (or if) AI starts to recreate a wider range of human characteristics.

While we have clear visibility of the inputs and outputs of any AI system, we cannot see how the algorithms take the former and come up with the latter

But ultimately, whether a machine is being truly creative may not matter outside of philosophical debates. The artistic results that computers will be able to produce, whether in the fields of music, art or literature, are only going to get better and better. If audiences approve of the output, will many people care whether art is produced by a troubled genius or lines of software code?
That is a question for another day. For now, neurologists will continue studying the mysteries of the human brain and computer scientists will continue in their efforts to recreate them in software form. Even if true creativity has not been achieved yet, we can still marvel at the dream-like scenes created by Google’s Deep Dream Generator, enjoy software-crafted songs and grow frustrated in our efforts to beat a computer at chess.
The pace at which AI is developing is impressive regardless of its shortcomings. And it is easy to see where these remain most pronounced: a machine does not yet seem able to tell whether what it has produced is any good, or, indeed, have any concept at all of what it has created.
“The table is black to be seen, the bus crossed in a corner,” begins another section of 1 the Road. “Part of a white line of stairs and a street light was standing in the street, and it was a deep parking lot.” Gibberish? Perhaps – or maybe the avant-garde musings of a literary genius. After all, the opening of James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake is arguably even less coherent, starting mid-sentence: “riverrun, past Eve and Adam’s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.”
Art will always be open to interpretation, discussion, praise and ridicule. No one can say precisely what creative works will be produced in the future, but it’s looking increasingly likely that they will be made by both man and machine.

Private and public entities around the world, particularly in the health care and governance sectors, are developing and deploying a range of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in emergency response to COVID-19. Some of these systems work to track and predict its spread; others support medical response or help maintain social control. Indeed, AI systems can reduce strain on overwhelmed health care systems; help save lives by quickly diagnosing patients, and assessing health declines or progress; and limit the virus’s spread.
But there’s a problem: The algorithms driving these systems are human creations, and as such, they are subject to biases that can deepen societal inequities and pose risks to businesses and society more broadly. In this article, we look at data on the pandemic, share two recent applications of AI, and suggest a number of ways nonprofit and business leaders can help ensure that they develop, manage, and use transformative AI equitably and responsibly.

The Problem With COVID-19 Data
Using techinical frameworks, such as machine learning, AI systems use algorithms to make inferences from data about people. This includes demographic attributes, preferences, and likely future behaviors. To effectively serve a range of populations, AI systems must learn to make associations based on massive amounts of data that accurately reflect information across identities. However, the data they rely on is often rife with social and cultural biases. Data might not exist for certain populations, may exist but be poor quality for certain groups, and/or reflect inequities in society. As a result, algorithms can make inaccurate predictions and perpetuate social stereotypes and biases.
Unfortunately, much of the data about COVID-19 that the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others are collecting and tracking is incomplete and biased. COVID-19 infection rates, for example, have been subject to a “vast undercount,” by a factor of 50 or more. Medical data is reflecting only a subset of the population—in many cases, the affluent, white communities who have ready access to limited tests and expensive medical procedures. But there are other important data gaps too:

Data on risk and mortality is not sufficiently disaggregated by sex, race, or ethnicity. The CDC didn’t release a race and sex breakdown of COVID-19 cases and deaths until early April, and even then, it only pulled from parts of 14 states. Today, many states have data that shares cases and mortality by race, but gender is still limited, and there is no available sex-disaggregated mortality data.
Data for racial and ethnic groups is incomplete, and terms and labels are inconsistent. Infection and mortality data released by the CDC, while still infrequent and incomplete, paints a bleak picture around how COVID-19 disproportionately kills certain racial and ethnic groups. Alarming rates among black Americans are rooted in longstanding economic and health care inequalities, and the ambiguous racial/ethnic categorization of existing data further obscures disparities.
COVID-19 data tracking systems aren’t capturing data on immigrants and other marginalized populations. Immigrants are one of many communities of color hard-hit by COVID-19. Many are filling service positions in essential businesses that require them to interact with a large number of people daily, and are already at increased risk of complications or death from COVID-19 due to high rates of underlying chronic illnesses. Despite this, many are not getting tested for fear of getting deported. Sufficient data for transgender and non-binary individuals does not exist either—most state health officials are not collecting data on whether patients identify as LGBTQ—and transgender individuals are at greater risk given economic and social vulnerabilities. This lack of data on the most vulnerable isn’t just a problem in the United States—it’s often even greater in poorer countries.

AI for COVID-19 Medical Response
Some of the AI systems created to support COVID-19 medical response help diagnose and detect COVID-19 through basic online screening or analyzing chest images. Others, such as the forthcoming version of eCART, can help predict COVID-specific outcomes and inform clinical decisions. This is particularly useful for medical volunteers without pulmonary training, who must assess patients’ conditions and decide who needs help first. AI tech may also prove helpful in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine and other therapies. 
However, the data gaps we mentioned earlier have major implications for medical AI systems and AI-enhanced vaccine trials. People react differently to viruses, vaccines, and treatments, as previous outbreaks like SARS and Ebola have illustrated. Data available on COVID-19 outside the United States, for example, shows that men and women face different fatality rates, and a recent research paper found that women patients admitted to the Wuhan Union Hospital had higher levels of COVID-19 antibodies than men. Given systemic inequities that worsen health outcomes for certain racial and ethnic groups, it’s equally important to understand COVID-19 health outcomes for different identities, as well as the intersectional implications.
Algorithms that don’t account for existing inequities risk making inaccurate predictions—or worse. In 2019, a study found that the widely used Optum algorithm, which used health-care spending as a proxy to measure need, was biased against black Americans. It didn’t account for discrimination or lack of access, both of which lead to lower spending on health care by black Americans. Amid the COVID-19 crisis, AI systems that inform limited-resource allocations (such as who to put on a ventilator) must be careful not to inadvertently prioritize certain identities over others. While developers aim to make algorithms race-blind by excluding race as a metric, this can ignore or hide— rather than prevent—discrimination. For example, algorithms that inform clinical decisions may use proxies such as preexisting conditions. Diabetes is a preexisting condition linked to higher rates of COVID-19, and it has a higher incidence for black Americans. If an algorithm uses preexisting conditions but is blind to race, it can result in disproportionately prioritizing white Americans over black Americans.
While some firms adhere to rigorous testing—conducting large validation studies prior to releasing products, for example—not all firms are thorough. Further, the decision-making processes of most AI algorithms are not transparent. This opens the door to inaccurate or discriminatory predictions for certain demographics, and thus poses immense risks to the individuals and practitioners using them.
AI for COVID-19 Social Control
Another recent application of AI is contact tracing, or tracking people who have come into contact with the virus to help contain it. By tracking user information such as health and location, and using AI-powered facial recognition, these tools can enforce social distancing and inform citizens of contact with positive cases. In China, users are assigned a coronavirus score, which impacts their access to public transportation, work, and school. And US government officials have begun raising the possibility of mass surveillance, collecting “anonymized, aggregate” user location data from tech giants like Facebook and Google to map the spread of COVID-19.
But surveillance tools have ethical implications—again, particularly for marginalized populations. Using AI to decide who leaves their home could lead to a form of COVID-19 redlining, subjecting certain communities to greater enforcements. This calls to mind another AI model that results in higher surveillance of poor communities of color: predictive policing. In the United States, risk-assessment algorithms use criminal history information, but don’t take into account deep-rooted racial bias in the policing system, that black Americans are arrested more often for smaller crimes and that neighborhoods with high concentration of black Americans are more heavily patrolled. Black Americans end up overrepresented in the data, which then links to racially biased policing outcomes. Similarly, communities impacted by proposed surveillance systems would likely be poorer communities of color harder hit by COVID-19 for a variety of reasons linked to historical inequities and discrimination.
It is not clear how or how long government agencies or other entities will use these types of AI tools. In China, tracking could stick around after the crisis, allowing Beijing authorities to monitor religious minorities, political dissidents, and other marginalized communities with a history of being over-surveilled. And although data collection in the United States will initially be anonymized and aggregated, there’s potential for misuse and de-anonymization in the future.
Five Things Nonprofit and Business Leaders Can Do
Various AI systems are proving incredibly valuable to tackling the pandemic, and others hold immense promise. But leaders must take care to develop, manage, and use this technology responsibly and equitably; the risks of discrimination and deepening inequality are simply unacceptable. Here are five actions to take now:
1. Demand transparency and explanation of the AI system. First and foremost, leaders need to hold themselves accountable. Particularly with AI systems targeting medical response, it’s important that decision makers understand which groups are represented in the datasets and what the quality of that data is across different groups. Tools such as Datasheets for Datasets are useful for tracking information on dataset creators; the composition, sampling, and labeling process; and intended uses. Leaders whose organizations develop AI systems should also ask questions like: Whose opinions, priorities, and expertise are included in development, and whose are left out?
2. Join and promote multidisciplinary ethics working groups or councils to inform response to COVID-19. This is already happening in Germany and can provide useful insights into how to respond to COVID-19, including using AI. Working groups are a way to bring together social scientists, philosophers, community leaders, and technical teams to discuss potential bias concerns and fairness tradeoffs, as well as solutions.
3. Build partnerships to fill health-data gaps in ways that protect and empower local communities. Nonprofits and universities are especially well-positioned to work with disenfranchised communities and form community research partnerships. In San Francisco, for example, a coalition of citywide Latinx organizations partnered with UCSF to form a COVID-19 task force. The coalition launched a project that tested nearly 3,000 residents in predominantly Latinx neighborhoods to better understand how the virus spreads. The task force and its local volunteers integrated concerns of community members and provided extensive support services to people who tested positive.
4. Advance research and innovation while emphasizing diversity and inclusion. Only a handful of tech companies and elite university labs develop most large-scale AI systems, and developers tend to be white, affluent, technically oriented, and male. Given that AI isn’t neutral and that technologies are a product of the context in which they are created, these systems often fail to meet the needs of different communities. Research initiatives like the recently launched Digital Transformation Institute, a collaborative effort to bring together tech companies and US research universities to fight COVID-19, must emphasize inclusion and justice (alongside innovation and efficiency), and prioritize multi-disciplinary and diverse teams. They can and should take advantage of tools like an AI Fairness Checklist in designing solutions.
5. Resist the urge to prioritize efficiency at the cost of justice and equity. Leaders should rise to the challenge of not compromising justice and equity. In some cases, the question is not how best to develop or deploy an AI system, but whether the AI system should be built or used at all.
As the pandemic continues to severely impact individuals, communities, and economies, nonprofit and business leaders must respond quickly—but not at the cost of heightening discrimination and inequality in the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. AI can help us improve medical response and minimize the spread of COVID-19, but using it wisely requires equity-fluent leadership and a long-term view. As Prashant Warier, CEO and co-founder of the AI company Qure.ai, put it, “Once people start using our algorithms, they never stop.”

The classic eye exam may be about to get an upgrade. Researchers have developed an online vision test—fueled by artificial intelligence (AI)—that produces much more accurate diagnoses than the sheet of capital letters we've been staring at since the 19th century. If perfected, the test could also help patients with eye diseases track their vision at home. ""It's an intriguing idea"" that reveals just how antiquated the classic eye test is, says Laura Green, an ophthalmologist at the Krieger Eye Institute. Green was not involved with the work, but she studies ways to use technology to improve access to health care. The classic eye exam, known as the Snellen chart, has been around since 1862. The farther down the sheet a person can read, the better their vision. The test is quick and easy to administer, but it has problems, says Chris Piech, a computer scientist at Stanford University. Patients start to guess at letters when they become blurry, he says, which means they can get different scores each time they take the test.

Piech is no stranger to the Snellen test. At age 10, doctors diagnosed him with chronic uveitis, an inflammatory eye disease. ""I was sitting through all these tests and it was pretty obvious to me that it was terribly inaccurate,"" he says. He wanted to find a way to remove human error from the Snellen exam, while improving its accuracy. So Piech and his colleagues developed an online test. Users first calibrate their screen size by adjusting a box on a web page to the size of a credit card. After entering the distance they are from the screen, the test displays an ""E"" in one of four orientations. Based on the answer, the algorithm then uses statistics to make a prediction for a vision score, similar to how AIs make a playlist based on your favorite artists, or what ads to show based on what you clicked on earlier. As the test goes on, the algorithm is able to make a more accurate prediction about the score. The test asks 20 questions per eye and takes a couple minutes to complete. When the researchers ran their ""Stanford acuity test"" (StAT) through 1000 computer simulations mimicking real patients, the diagnostic reduced error by 74% compared with the Snellen test, the team reports this month in the Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The simulations work by starting with a known acuity score and factors in the types of mistakes a human might make. It then virtually ""takes"" the different eye tests in order to compare how accurate they are. The team used this instead of actual patients because it starts with the ""true"" acuity—something unknown in a human.Advertisement You can take StAT yourself at myeyes.ai, although Piech cautions that the test isn't meant to replace doctor visits just yet. ""It's definitely helpful,"" says Mark Blecher, an ophthalmologist in Philadelphia who's written opinion articles comparing various eye tests before. Online eye tests aren't really new, but Blecher commended the clever use of AI in boosting accuracy. Blecher says for the next step it would be important to consider the circumstances in which the user takes the test. Things like room lighting or screen brightness could affect the scores, he says. Whether the StAT test will actually replace the Snellen chart is up for debate. Blecher says getting all eye care professionals to agree on a new standard would be ""daunting at best"" because the status quo can be hard to overcome. Green is more optimistic. ""I think that it would very quickly get adopted by over 80% of ophthalmology practices,"" she says. ""We really are desperate to have some good way of doing this.""

Although an increased reliance on automation may result in higher demands for jobs related to robotics science, engineering etc, the number of people rendered unemployed due to automation is highly disproportionate than those who would be employed..Further, the NITI Aayog in its report titled ‘National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence’, has exhaustively discussed the challenges, focus areas and global development of AI. It has stated therein that concerns of privacy of data, an unattractive Intellectual Property regime, low intensity of AI research, and low awareness for adopting AI in business processes, will be some of major impediments in successful deployment of AI in India..Use of AI in the legal system.The use of AI in the legal system is still in its nascent stage, but is slowly being adopted by several countries, law firms and judiciaries alike. It provides cost effective solutions to lawyers by pointing out the legal infirmities in judgments, providing assistance in drafting contractual documents, due diligence, legal analytics etc. Similarly, AI can act as catalyst in lessening the burden of the judiciary, especially in those cases that involve menial offences, leaving the complex cases to be decided by human judges..AI Ross, developed by IBM, has been adopted many law firms worldwide, particularly in the USA and is primarily used to vet legal contracts, conduct legal research, and briefly summarize case laws etc. Likewise, Linklaters LLP, a multinational law firm, is also developing an AI programme, Nakhoda, with the objective of providing effective contract management and structured legal data..The Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada has formulated directives on the use of automated decision-making. These state that the decisions made by the AI should be in consonance with basic tenets of fairness, transparency and legal principles..Amongst all these aforesaid developments in the AI related field, several core issues have emerged such as:a) What is the legal personality of AI? Can it be accorded the status of a ‘person’ or ‘citizen’?b) Who would be responsible if any loss occurs due to the negligence of an AI? Will the principle of absolute or vicarious liability apply in such a scenario? In the latter case, what punishment can be attributed to an artificial personality?c) How far can AI be used in the legal profession?d) Whether a person who avails the services of AI can be termed as a ‘Consumer’ under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 etc..Much like its potential, the legal issues surrounding AI also seem to be endless. Though AI may seem to be attractive at first blush, it is fraught with many dangers that have been highlighted by several eminent scientists like Stephen Hawking, who said, ""…The primitive forms of artificial intelligence we already have proved very useful. But I fear the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete and would be superseded."".Recent developments in the Indian legal profession.The growth of AI in the Indian legal field has been subdued. According to a study, only about 4% of lawyers in India make use of AI for their work. Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas is perhaps the first law firm in India to adopt AI which is primarily used to analyse and improvise contractual and other legal documents..I, Lawbot? Cyril Amarchand first Indian law firm to adopt artificial intelligence.The impact of AI on the legal profession and its consequent viability has aptly been described by former Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra while addressing a conference. He said,""...the future of any new-age technology lies in the regulations that govern them. Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a high growth potential in a number of sectors… AI needs a strong legal framework around it to explore maximum benefits. AI today is growing multifold and we still do not know all the advantages or pitfalls…India has the right talent and technological resources. With a powerful legal directive, the country can set many milestones with a strong command over AI…But India currently does not have specific regulations that govern AI…"".Similarly, current CJI SA Bobde also spoke on similar lines and has advocated for greater use of AI in the legal system, especially in the field of docket management and decision making. At an the event organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), he opined,“…We must increasingly focus on harnessing IT and IT enabled services (ITES) for providing more efficient and cost-effective access to and delivery of justice. This must also include undertaking serious study concerning future of Artificial Intelligence in law, especially how Artificial Intelligence can assist in judicial decision making. I believe exploring this interface would be immensely beneficial for many reasons. For instance, it would allow us to streamline courts caseloads through enabling better court management. This would be a low hanging fruit. On the other end of the spectrum, it will allow us to shift the judicial time from routine-simple-straightforward matters (e.g. cases which are non-rivalrous) and apply them to more complex-intricate matters that require more human attention and involvement...Therefore, in India identification of such matters and developing relevant technology ought to be our next focus."".Justice DY Chandrachud has also spoken on similar lines, In an interview, he said, ""The idea of Artificial Intelligence is not to supplant the human brain or the human mind or the presence of judges but to provide a facilitative tool to judges to reassess the processes which they follow, to reassess the work which they do and to ensure that their outcome are more predictable and consistent and ultimately provide wider access to justice to the common citizens."".However, in developing countries like India, the usage of AI may not be regularized because of reluctance to adapt to this new change. There is also an apprehension that AI may cause serious ramifications in a labour surplus economy like India, with majority of people being uneducated and poverty stricken.In this context, Justice Dominique Hascher, judge at the Supreme Court of France, has rightly said that, ""Each nation today aims to become a global leader in Artificial Intelligence. Hence, countries such as the US, the UK, China and Germany are increasing investments to leverage this technology. However, private technology companies are acing the field…India’s approach towards AI strategy has to be balanced for both local needs and the greater good. A strong regulatory system around this can ensure long-term benefits and growth..The author is an advocate currently working in AUA Legal LLP, and practicing before the Delhi High Court and subordinate courts in the capital.

So are movies. In Yesterday’s Future, we revisit a movie about the future and consider the things it tells us about today, tomorrow, and yesterday.The movie: A.I. Artificial IntelligenceThe future: A.I. begins with a brief summary of the sorry state of the world: climate change has melted the polar ice caps, wiping out coastal cities and severely reducing the human population. With regulations in place for reproduction on a resource-starved planet, corporations developed Mecha — androids that appear human but lack emotions. They’re seen as objects — useful for labor or sex work, just human enough to not be strange but machine enough to not mistake them for people. The story kicks into gear when Professor Allen Hobby (William Hurt) pitches taking Mecha to the next level: a machine that can love. That Mecha becomes David (Haley Joel Osment), an experimental Mecha designed to imprint on his owners and love them unconditionally, forever. And it works — David is given to a grieving couple whose son is in suspended animation due to a rare disease. After some hijinks, he’s accepted, until Martin, the boy he’s filling in for, comes back. Unfortunately Martin is cruel, and thanks to his manipulation, David is forced from home into a Pinocchio-esque journey to find a “Blue Fairy” and become a real boy. Through his eyes, we see a nihilistic theme-park vision of the future, where little is done to solve the still-looming climate apocalypse but neon cities and their pleasures boom. The past: A.I. was released in 2001, but was originally going to come out long before that. Based on Brian Aldiss’ 1969 short story “Supertoys Last All Summer Long,” the film began as a Stanley Kubrick project in the ’70s, languishing in development hell until the famed director’s death in 1999. Steven Spielberg then took over, reportedly hewing closely to the plans Kubrick had for the film. This meant that, at the time, the critical reception of A.I. largely revolved around its status as a strange hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg’s sensibilities, the last work of an idiosyncratic master carried out by one of his most prominent — and stylistically different — admirers. Most, like Roger Ebert, felt that the result was a frustrating film, attempting to parse where one man’s vision ended and the other’s began. But A.I. was an extremely fitting film for 2001, a year characterized by cinematic restlessness. Unsettling arthouse classics Donnie Darko and Mulholland Drive premiered. Shrek, which skewered Disney-style fairy tales with pop culture cynicism, also arrived, unwittingly laying the groundwork for surreal internet memes a decade later. Films that would spawn, extend, or hope to begin franchises floundered in every direction, with understated hits like Ocean’s Eleven arriving alongside strange blockbusters like Jurassic Park III and showstoppers like The Fellowship of the Ring. No one knew what the 21st century would mean for movies, and a sad sci-fi fairytale about a robot boy created to stand in the void between a bleak future and an idyllic past could not have been a better match for the times.The present: At first glance, the hedonistic carnival of A.I.’s cities do not seem to hew terribly close to our current moment. Like a lot of cinematic futures, this one seems too loud, too garish, to ever be real. Jude Law as Gigolo Joe? The horrific robot bloodsport of the Flesh Fair, where obsolete robots battle to the “death?” We don’t really have anything like that yet, right?Only we do. The seeds of this future have already bloomed in our present. Its subtext is our subtext, a world formed by people with all the power afforded them by technology but none of the will to dream or love. The former would demand a clear-eyed response to shared crises looming ahead both at home and abroad; the latter would lead us to wield our innovations compassionately. Instead we have a world where algorithms reinforce biases and outrage is commodified, where every innovation is part and parcel with a new indignity. A lack of humanity that at every turn denies the option of a better future for all in favor of a more extravagant present for a few. In A.I.’s final 20 minutes, it’s revealed that this is the end of the world. In 2,000 more years, climate change will claim the last habitable portion of the Earth, and David will be the only one left who remembers humanity. Still a child, all David wants to remember is the human mother he imprinted on, but the viewer remembers everything else — that the world was doomed by rage at the pending self-imposed disaster that humanity refused to face and instead directed toward the Mecha they created, the Mecha that would outlast them. “They made us too smart, too quick, and too many,” Gigolo Joe, the Mecha sexbot that becomes David’s unlikely companion, says in one of his final scenes. “In the end, all that will be left is us. That’s why they hate us”A.I. is refreshing because it is not interested in the question of whether or not we should create self-aware synthetic life, but instead asks what our responsibility toward it would be. If you can create a robot to love a human, one character asks early in the film, how do you get a human to love them back? In the end it doesn’t matter. Humanity doesn’t even love itself enough to ensure its own survival.Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeNew chips, new screens, new gadgets | The Vergecast

The past: A.I. was released in 2001, but was originally going to come out long before that. Based on Brian Aldiss’ 1969 short story “Supertoys Last All Summer Long,” the film began as a Stanley Kubrick project in the ’70s, languishing in development hell until the famed director’s death in 1999. Steven Spielberg then took over, reportedly hewing closely to the plans Kubrick had for the film. 

This meant that, at the time, the critical reception of A.I. largely revolved around its status as a strange hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg’s sensibilities, the last work of an idiosyncratic master carried out by one of his most prominent — and stylistically different — admirers. Most, like Roger Ebert, felt that the result was a frustrating film, attempting to parse where one man’s vision ended and the other’s began. 

But A.I. was an extremely fitting film for 2001, a year characterized by cinematic restlessness. Unsettling arthouse classics Donnie Darko and Mulholland Drive premiered. Shrek, which skewered Disney-style fairy tales with pop culture cynicism, also arrived, unwittingly laying the groundwork for surreal internet memes a decade later. Films that would spawn, extend, or hope to begin franchises floundered in every direction, with understated hits like Ocean’s Eleven arriving alongside strange blockbusters like Jurassic Park III and showstoppers like The Fellowship of the Ring. 

No one knew what the 21st century would mean for movies, and a sad sci-fi fairytale about a robot boy created to stand in the void between a bleak future and an idyllic past could not have been a better match for the times.

The present: At first glance, the hedonistic carnival of A.I.’s cities do not seem to hew terribly close to our current moment. Like a lot of cinematic futures, this one seems too loud, too garish, to ever be real. Jude Law as Gigolo Joe? The horrific robot bloodsport of the Flesh Fair, where obsolete robots battle to the “death?” We don’t really have anything like that yet, right?

Only we do. The seeds of this future have already bloomed in our present. Its subtext is our subtext, a world formed by people with all the power afforded them by technology but none of the will to dream or love. The former would demand a clear-eyed response to shared crises looming ahead both at home and abroad; the latter would lead us to wield our innovations compassionately. Instead we have a world where algorithms reinforce biases and outrage is commodified, where every innovation is part and parcel with a new indignity. A lack of humanity that at every turn denies the option of a better future for all in favor of a more extravagant present for a few. 

In A.I.’s final 20 minutes, it’s revealed that this is the end of the world. In 2,000 more years, climate change will claim the last habitable portion of the Earth, and David will be the only one left who remembers humanity. Still a child, all David wants to remember is the human mother he imprinted on, but the viewer remembers everything else — that the world was doomed by rage at the pending self-imposed disaster that humanity refused to face and instead directed toward the Mecha they created, the Mecha that would outlast them. 

“They made us too smart, too quick, and too many,” Gigolo Joe, the Mecha sexbot that becomes David’s unlikely companion, says in one of his final scenes. “In the end, all that will be left is us. That’s why they hate us”

A.I. is refreshing because it is not interested in the question of whether or not we should create self-aware synthetic life, but instead asks what our responsibility toward it would be. If you can create a robot to love a human, one character asks early in the film, how do you get a human to love them back? 

In the end it doesn’t matter. Humanity doesn’t even love itself enough to ensure its own survival.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and smart devices are gaining more and more traction in the manufacturing market. 
AI can be used to automate multiple things, and the technologies behind it keep getting better, and smarter. And combining AI with the IoT means fewer people will be required to take decisions and to execute those decisions.
If things keep evolving as they have been so far, one thing is certain: the manufacturing industry will never be the same.
But, how can AI and IoT affect the manufacturing job market? How can they improve it? Will we run out of manufacturing jobs?
5 Ways AI and IoT Can Revolutionize Manufacturing Jobs
Here’s how AI and IoT are already revolutionizing manufacturing jobs:

Cost Optimization

Cost optimization is one of the main benefits that AI and IoT offer, starting with fewer human hours. AI can organize machines that work all day, every day. 
And it’s not just about machines. Through predictive analysis, AI can forecast the amount of resources needed according to the amount of sales expected. AI and IoT can also work together through sensors to keep track of the manufacturing process as well as finding, solving and preventing bottlenecks.
Once everything is set up, these machines can work independently, without any need of continuous human input.

Predictive maintenance

Predictive maintenance is another way an AI’s predictive analysis directly impacts manufacturing jobs. Through complex machine learning, AI can predict when and how a part may fail. The more data you feed to it, the better it’ll become at predicting failure.
This doesn’t just immediately reduce costs by preventing larger failures through maintenance, it also reduces losses caused by unexpected failures. You don’t need to stop a machine for days (or weeks) due to a failure, because your AI would’ve already prepared you for it. 
This also increases the effectiveness of your repairs team, since they can focus on preventive, scheduled repairs instead of fixing machines as they fail.
Predictive maintenance is so lucrative that it not only pays for itself, but has been shown to have up to a 545% ROI.

Production Optimization

With production optimization, you can optimize production and increase efficiency. You can use it with both IoT and human operators.
This is achieved through machine learning algorithms, that learn both from your operators and your machines’ sensors to establish relations between them and identify production improvements. 
Through this insight, AI can give your operators recommendations in real-time to improve production.

Robots

Industrial robots have been a part of the manufacturing industry long before they became part of the Internet of Things. Although they can be a huge investment, industrial robots can do more than any human can, and usually work along them to optimize production. 
Nowadays, we have collaborative robots, or cobots, to work along with humans or even fully replace them in repetitive tasks. These robots aren’t as huge of an investment as industrial robots, and are more flexible and adaptable too.
With AI, cobots can easily be supervised and easily reprogrammed. Due to the repetitive nature of the production line, cobots are usually a great option to replace humans, preventing injuries and increasing production speed.

Machine vision

Computer vision is one of the most futuristic-looking ways AI and IoT can directly impact manufacturing jobs. And it’s one of the cheapest ways too!
HD cameras can be used with punch-in systems to validate employee work time. Through machine vision, your AI can spot machine defects, handle quality control and keep track of production.
Machine vision can also be used to prevent health and safety issues. It can identify workers without the right safety equipment and prevent contamination risks. When it identifies an issue, the AI can block access to individuals, and even stop production altogether.
You can also use machine vision to read text and barcodes and keep track of your parts and raw materials. This can help you in multiple ways, from automating your warehouse inventory, to helping your operators use the right parts and guide them through complex processes.
Are AI and IoT Creating Jobs Or Destroying Them?
While AI and IoT are replacing humans in the manufacturing job market, they’re also creating new jobs in their production, supervision and maintenance. So, which way is the scale tipping?
During the sixties, over 10% of the United States population worked in factories. Today, that number is down to 4%. Through AI and IoT, factories are slowly but systematically replacing humans with machines, and this trend will continue going up.
According to a study done by McKinsey & Co., up to 45% of tasks done by humans today could be done by machines. A survey done at Oxford found that 20 million jobs will be lost to robots in the next ten years alone.
So, how does that translate to the job market?
There’s still a long way to go to make the Internet of Things effective. There’s a lot of code to be written, data to be scraped and programs to be designed so IoT becomes as usable as it can be. And then we need humans to design and build the robots. In the UK alone, robotics specialists are expected to double jobs in the next five years. And while the items that form part of the IoT may be increasingly produced by machines, it will be IT professionals, like developers and scrapers, who will need to build the frame for both AI and IoT.
Conclusion
As we’ve seen, AI and IoT will create more jobs than they destroy in the manufacturing market. However, these jobs will be very different from the jobs people hold today.
Through automation, goods will become cheaper and better produced, which will allow companies to hire more people for areas where AI and IoT can’t be used. These jobs will focus on high-skilled people in design, marketing, and, most importantly, in IT.
That’s why you shouldn’t be worried about losing your job to robots. You should instead be preparing for the future by expanding your skillset, improving your money management and betting on companies rather than working for them.
The future of the manufacturing job market isn’t in production, but in the creation and automation of the IoT and AI.

DARPA is exploring complementing AI systems that would identify available combat support assets and quickly plan their route to the area.Throughout all of the development work, experts from the military and from academia stressed that human involvement and experimentation was critical to ensuring that artificial intelligence assets are trustworthy. The department has released a document of five artificial intelligence ethical principles, but the challenge remains implementing those principles into projects across a department with disparate services working on separate artificial intelligence projects.“We want safe, reliable and robust systems deployed to our warfighters,” said Heather Roff, senior research analyst at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. “We want to be able to trust those systems. We want to have some sort of measure of predictability even if those systems act unpredictably.”Brig. Gen. Matt Easley, director of the artificial intelligence task force at Army Futures Command, said the service is grappling with those exact challenges, trying to understand how the service can insert “checks and balances” as it trains systems and soldiers.Easley added that the unmanned systems under development by the Army will have to be adaptable to different environments, such as an urban or desert scenarios. In order to ensure that the systems and soldiers are ready for those scenarios, the Army has to complete a series of tests, just like the autonomous vehicle industry.“We don’t think these systems are going to be 100 percent capable right out of the box,” Easley said on the webinar. “If you look at a lot of the evolution of the self-driving cars throughout our society today, they’re doing a lot of experimentation. They’re doing lots of testing, lots of learning every day. We in the Army have to learn how to go from doing one to two to three vehicle experiments to have many experiments going on every day across all our camp posts and stations.”Increasingly autonomous systems also mean that there needs to a cultural shift in among all levels of military personnel who will need to better understand how artificial intelligence is used. Roff said that operators, commanders and judge advocate generals will need to better understand how systems are supposed “to ensure that the human responsibility and governability is there.”“We need to make sure that we have training, tactics, procedures, as well as policies, ensuring where we know the human decision maker is,” Roff said.About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.

Data scientists have foundations in cutting edge math and statistics, advanced analytics, and machine learning and AI. In an organization, data scientists extract helpful data from an ocean of information. In analyzing the information, they make inferences and accumulate insights and use them to support the business..In recent years, the requirement for data scientists has increased by 35%. This unexpected increment in the demand of data scientists has prompted the talent crunch that we're seeing across numerous companies and enterprises. Shockingly, however, the needs are clear (i.e., a computer science degree, good experience in coding), the job of a data scientist is approximately characterized across the job market and sets of responsibilities can change broadly.

But will the job market, in general, provide more jobs if you have these skills? While we are on the cusp of a paradigm shift in not just education but also the type of jobs, will the future be driven by AI and the likes? Dr K L Vasudev an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, and Dr A Padmavathi, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science Engineering at the institute answer our questions with insight and patience..Excerpts:So we have been hearing these terms Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Machine Learning for a while now. But we don't exactly know what courses students should do to get into doing these fields? Could you elaborate on that?KLV: Essentially, there is no particular stream of engineering students have to follow to study Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences and Big Data. A choice-based credit system encourages everyone to opt for courses from different streams like electives. Universities are also encouraging interdisciplinary research activities, for example, a person who is working with medical robotics should also know the human anatomy very well. Computer science and IT students will have an advantage in these subjects.AP: Any person with computer knowledge and some mathematical skills can go into these fields. They must have some degree. It might not be an engineering degree, it might be a BCA or it might be an MCA or BSC Computer Science. If they want to have a career in Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning, A master's degree is preferred..In the current pandemic scenario, AI and ML have been helping a lot. We have seen solutions like drones, robots that are being used. How can it help even more?KLV: There are many ways robots can help combat the Coronavirus disease. Spraying robots can be used to disinfect places and drones can monitor people during a lockdown. AI-based robots have the potential to be developed to deliver essential goods like food items and medicines. In the containment zones where people are not allowed to trespass, it's always better to have a robot serving the people. Such robots are available in the market.AP: By using a deep learning algorithm and a machine learning algorithm, they can diagnose a patient, they can identify the spread of the virus and they can map who is the most susceptible patient and so on. Also, one of the applications of artificial intelligence is a chatbot. It can be used to create awareness among the people about the virus spread and how they must be careful at home or at workplaces..A recent healthcare report says that there's a 50 per cent increase in the use of Robotics for medical and healthcare delivery services. Where do you think India will be by 2030 in terms of robotics in healthcare?KLV: I think even before 2030, we will be making a mark in the industry. For example, you can see that many hospitals like AIIMS in Delhi, Apollo Hospitals, Fortis Hospitals and Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Kochi already utilising this Da Vinci Surgery machine robots. Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences has already conducted 1300 operations with the assistance of these Da Vinci robots. If you consider the whole of India, it might be significantly more..What are the future job opportunities like for prospective students?.KLV: The transformation to AI-based Industries is undisputable. It is going to create a transformation in each and every industry. There are a number of fields from software to even mechanical engineering and manufacturing where automation is required these days. Robotics is already in each and every field of our day-to-day life. We can do jobs using these robots and that is going to be the future.AP: They can become data analysts, software developers, machine learning analysts, cloud content managers, robot engineers, manufacturing engineers, machine learning engineers, people who can handle the drones, electricians who can work with the aviation control and military.We came across a study that was done in the US which showed that a lot of robotic engineering positions are in the pipeline. Do you think India can also match up to that?KLV: India is a country with the youngest population and stands in third place with regard to AI research. With regard to the COVID situation, our IT strengths are going to go up. Our Indian brains that had migrated to other countries may return to the homeland and bring plenty of applications in the job market for providing remote services..We came across another study conducted by Oxford University, which says that 47 per cent of the US jobs can be automated by the next 20 years. Which sectors in India do you think will have more jobs?AP: In India, by 2030, around 9-13 per cent of the human workforce will be replaced by robots or automated machines. So, the Oxford Economic Report says most of the 20 million manufacturing jobs will be replaced by a robot. Another study by McKinsey says that by 2030, 44 million jobs will be replaced with robots. There will be more job opportunities in the health sector like doctors, physiotherapists, nurses, drug developers and so on. By 2030, there will be no outdoor games, almost everyone will sit inside their homes and there is a possibility that people will develop a lot of diseases. So healthcare will have a lot more opportunities, as will logistics and automation specialists.KLV:  In all fields, manufacturing included, AI and robotics will leave its mark and the whole world is going to look towards India.What do you think are good online courses that can be taken up by students who want to learn machine learning, artificial intelligence?KLV: Basic mathematical knowledge is a must along with coding knowledge. Basic linear algebra and calculus also help.AP: Any student with some computer knowledge and mathematical knowledge can go for the Python Programming. If they want to specialise in Machine Language, they have to go for R programming. If they want to write some ML or Deep Learning algorithms, either they can go for a Java or Python course..We have seen a lot of online learning courses coming up right now on several digital platforms like Udemy and Unacademy. Will these courses act as an advantage for students when they apply for a degree?KLV: These courses are going to differentiate them from the rest. A majority of people attending these courses are working professionals and they join to enhance their skills and find themselves suitable for a job change or a hike. We in Amrita encourage students to take up online courses, and we provide credits to students who have done extra courses.After the lockdown ends how will the college follow social distancing norms inside the classroom and also while on transport?AP: Our Chennai campus has limited students around 150 students in the first year. Only 11 students are travelling on the college bus. We can make them sit away from each other and insist that they wear a mask and use sanitisers. With that, we can maintain social distancing on transport and also we can split the classes. Common canteen rules have to change.KLV: Social distancing in class is the most difficult task which needs to be very keenly addressed with utmost care and precautions. Our management is very sensitive to this issue. We abide by the government advisory from MHRD, UGC, AICTE and other regulatory bodies. We are already using smartboards on our campus and online learning platforms to supplement classroom teaching. So I think we will try new strategies, which is giving us fruitful results based upon that will go for a choice..Do you think digital learning is the way to go?AP: Before COVID-19, we were already conducting online learning classes and quiz assignments on Google classroom. But after the pandemic hit us it has become mandatory. So nowadays, we are able to complete our portions on time. We are more confident and handling online classes pretty well. Students are also gaining more interest in digital learning platforms..KLV: Actually COVID-19 has given us an opportunity to get rid of the fear of poor quality online teaching and teachers' hesitation to use online portals. It is heartening to know that teachers have taken up online teaching with great interest digitally proficient students are going for online learning with great excitement. Even before COVID-19 in 2019, if you see the statistical data, approximately 19 billion dollars has been spent on education technology with online education and it is going to be 350 billion dollars by 2025. That is the expectation. Online learning apps have seen a significant surge in usage since COVID-19. So I think this is going to last and now every person needs to learn new things and keep updating themselves. .Careers After Corona is a series that has been curated and produced by EdexLive in partnership with Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham and Amrita School of Engineering",,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.edexlive.com/news/2020/Jun/20/will-ai-big-data-dominate-the-job-market-in-2030-heres-how-indian-students-can-get-on-board-now-12759.html', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://media.assettype.com/edexlive/import/2020/6/20/original/kl_vasudev_tm1.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Professor Giselle Rampersad undertook the study to investigate key factors that drive innovation among Worker Integrated Learning students. Professor Rampersad says that “while there is some fear that robots and artificial intelligence may replace some occupations, workers will remain relevant in a fast-changing career landscape if they are innovative, able to spot opportunities that can transform industries and provide creative solutions to meet global challenges”. To develop such capabilities, Work Integrated Learning (WIL) has emerged as an important approach, which Professor Rampersad has investigated with a quantitative, longitudinal study that measures student capabilities before and after participation in a WIL placement at a business. The study found that critical thinking, problem solving, communication and teamwork have significant impacts on the development of innovation, which is the “vital ingredient for workers in the era of artificial intelligence”. The study also identifies which areas of WIL programs have been most beneficial, and what areas need more attention to nurture greater innovation. “Reaping the benefits of industry 4.0 requires a focus on the human factors,” says Professor Rampersad. “Innovation is needed to transition the workforce effectively. This will not only ensure that workers can effectively and confidently use the new technologies but also that they survive and thrive in a quickly changing workplace.” To measure the effectiveness of current upskilling of workers, Professor Rampersad analysed responses to a questionnaire of more than 100 students (both before and after their placement), who participated in the WIL program. The paper - &#039;Robot will take your job: Innovation for an era of artificial intelligence&#039; - has been published in the Journal of Business Research. The study was funded by the Australian Collaborative Education Network (ACEN) in collaboration with Dr Vlatka Zivotic-Kukolj. The University says Professor Rampersad is pleased that the study has been able to produce a validated tool that quantitatively measures the development of innovation and its drivers. “Results from this tool can feed back into WIL program development to enhance student preparation and support for skill development,” she says. “It will also be useful in offering feedback to students on their career progression, self-awareness and empowerment for their development. “For industry and a community looking for innovative solutions to address challenges facing the areas of health, food, environment, manufacturing and the economy, the interaction of talented students with industries and businesses will prove highly beneficial. “The well-researched and well-developed tool to measure the development of innovation provided by this study can be used to enhance collaboration and innovation between university and industry. “In an era increasingly characterized by artificial intelligence, rather than fearing the robot, attention is needed on equipping the workforce with innovation skills for the future of work,” Professor Rampersad concluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Educators

must help students to develop skills for a changing world through continuously adapting programming to create future-ready graduates








Students    Employers    Educators








Waterloo's Future Ready Talent Framework


So how can you prepare for this future we can’t yet predict? What skills are essential to be “future ready”?
Enter the University of Waterloo’s Future Ready Talent Framework (FRTF). The FRTF is a research-backed tool to help students, employers and educators understand the key competencies we all need to navigate the future of work and learning.
Waterloo has programs to support all learners, at any stage of a lifelong-learning journey. Our programs are designed to build resilience and adaptability. We help learners acknowledge what they’re good at and what kinds of challenges they want to solve, all within a richly-supported environment.
How do we know what skills are essential?
We developed this competency framework through conducting extensive research into existing frameworks, studies and reports, and validated our findings with our network of employers, students and fellow educators.
The FRTF profiles four clusters of competencies with a total of 12 competencies that are expected to be in demand in the emerging global workplace. By understanding these competencies and how to cultivate them, you can take a fresh look at your career direction, hiring practices, management structures and educational programs through a future-oriented lens.

A person with an innovation mindset can:
demonstrate curiosity in the workplace
identify opportunities for improvement
take measured risks


























CRITICAL THINKING
With the world becoming increasingly complex, critical thinking will be needed to solve problems both thoughtfully and creatively in a way that considers multiple perspectives and potential implications. Individuals and organizations will need to understand the “big picture” to make sustainable, evidence-based recommendations in a world laden with synapses.






A person with critical thinking can:
identify multiple feasible options or solutions to problems
make evidence-based decisions and/or recommendations
seek to understand the “big picture” root problem or purpose for actions
explore the implications of proposed solutions to problems


























IMPLEMENTATION
An idea is just an idea without thoughtful execution. Can you design, adapt and implement solutions in a way that gets work done and builds trust with the people around you?






A person that practices implementation can:
identify concrete steps necessary to complete projects
manage their own deadlines
fulfill responsibilities
