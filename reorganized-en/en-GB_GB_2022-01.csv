Amid widespread anxiety about automation and machines displacing workers, the idea that technological advances aren’t necessarily driving us toward a jobless future is good news.
At the same time, “many in our country are failing to thrive in a labor market that generates plenty of jobs but little economic security,” MIT professors David Autor and David Mindell and principal research scientist Elisabeth Reynolds write in their new book “The Work of the Future: Building Better Jobs in an Age of Intelligent Machines.”

The authors lay out findings from their work chairing the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future, which MIT president L. Rafael Reif commissioned in 2018. The task force was charged with understanding the relationships between emerging technologies and work, helping shape realistic expectations of technology, and exploring strategies for a future of shared prosperity. Autor, Mindell, and Reynolds worked with 20 faculty members and 20 graduate students who contributed research.
Beyond looking at labor markets and job growth and how technologies and innovation affect workers, the task force makes several recommendations for how employers, schools, and the government should think about the way forward. These include investing and innovating in skills and training, improving job quality, including modernizing unemployment insurance and labor laws, and enhancing and shaping innovation by increasing federal research and development spending, rebalancing taxes on capital and labor, and applying corporate income taxes equally.
The first step toward preparing for the future is understanding emerging technologies. In the following excerpt, Autor, an economist, Mindell, a professor of aeronautics, and Reynolds, now the special assistant to the president for manufacturing and economic development, look at artificial intelligence, which is at the heart of both concern and excitement about the future of work. Understanding its capabilities and limitations is essential — especially if, as the authors write, “The future of AI is the future of work.”

To address the time to develop and deploy AI and robotic applications, it is worth considering the nature of technological change over time. When people think of new technologies, they often think of Moore’s Law, the apparently miraculous doubling of power of microprocessors, or phenomena like the astonishing proliferation of smartphones and apps in the past decades, and their profound social implications. It has become common practice among techno-pundits to describe these changes as “accelerating,” though with little agreement on the measures.
But when researchers look at historical patterns, they often find long gestation periods before these apparent accelerations, often three or four decades. Interchangeable parts production enabled the massive gun manufacturing of the Civil War, for example, but it was the culmination of four decades of development and experimentation. After that war, four more decades would pass before those manufacturing techniques matured to enable the innovations of assembly-line production. The Wright Brothers first flew in 1903, but despite the military application of World War I, it was the 1930s before aviation saw the beginnings of profitable commercial transport, and another few decades before aviation matured to the point that ordinary people could fly regularly and safely. Moreover, the expected natural evolution toward supersonic passenger flight hardly materialized, while the technology evolved toward automation, efficiency, and safety at subsonic speeds — dramatic progress, but along other axes than the raw measure of speed.


The ability to adapt to novel situations is still a challenge for AI and robotics and a key reason why companies continue to rely on human workers for a variety of tasks.

More recently, the basic technologies of the internet began in the 1960s and 1970s, then exploded into the commercial world in the mid-1990s. Even so, it is only in the past decade that most businesses have truly embraced networked computing as a transformation of their businesses and processes. Task Force member Erik Brynjolfsson calls this phenomenon a “J-curve,” suggesting that the path of technological acceptance is slow and incremental at first, then accelerates to break through into broad acceptance, at least for general-purpose technologies like computing. A timeline of this sort reflects a combination of perfecting and maturing new technologies, the costs of integration and managerial adoption, and then fundamental transformations.
While approximate, four decades is a useful time period to keep in mind as we evaluate the relationship of technological change to the future of work. As the science fiction writer William Gibson famously said, “The future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed.” Gibson’s idea profoundly links the slow evolution of mass adoption to what we see in the world today. Rather than simply making predictions, with their inevitable bias and poor results, we can look for places in today’s world that are leading technological change and extrapolate to broader adoption. Today’s automated warehouses likely offer a good glimpse of the future, though they will take time for widespread adoption (and likely will not be representative of all warehouses). The same can be said for today’s most automated manufacturing lines, and for the advanced production of high-value parts. Autonomous cars are already 15 years into their development cycle but just beginning to achieve initial deployment. We can look at those initial deployments for clues about their likely adoption at scale. Therefore, rather than do research on the future, the task force took a rigorous, empirical look at technology and work today to make some educated extrapolations.
AI today, and the general intelligence of work 
Most of the AI systems deployed today, while novel and impressive, still fall into the category of what task force member, AI pioneer, and director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Daniela Rus calls “specialized AI.” That is, they are systems that can solve a limited number of specific problems. They look at vast amounts of data, extract patterns, and make predictions to guide future actions. “Narrow AI solutions exist for a wide range of specific problems,” write Rus, MIT Sloan School professorThomas Malone,and Robert Laubacher of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, “and can do a lot to improve efficiency and productivity within the work world.” Such systems include IBM’s Watson system, which beat human players on the American TV game show “Jeopardy!” and its descendants in health care, or Google’s AlphaGo program, which also bests human players in the game of Go. The systems we explore in insurance and health care all belong to this class of narrow AI, though they vary in different classes of machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, or others. Other systems in use today also include more traditional “classic AI” systems, which represent and reason about the world with formalized logic. AI is no single thing but rather a variety of different AIs, in the plural, each with different characteristics, that do not necessarily replicate human intelligence.
Specialized AI systems, through their reliance on largely human-generated data, excel at producing behaviors that mimic human behavior on well-known tasks. They also incorporate human biases. They still have problems with robustness, the ability to perform consistently under changing circumstances (including intentionally introduced noise in the data), and trust, the human belief that an assigned task will be performed correctly every single time. “Because of their lack of robustness,” write Malone, Rus, and Laubacher, “many deep neural nets work ‘most of the time’ which is not acceptable in critical applications.” The trust problem is exacerbated by the problem of explainability because today’s specialized AI systems are not able to reveal to humans how they reach decisions.

The ability to adapt to entirely novel situations is still an enormous challenge for AI and robotics and a key reason why companies continue to rely on human workers for a variety of tasks. Humans still excel at social interaction, unpredictable physical skills, common sense, and, of course, general intelligence.
From a work perspective, specialized AI systems tend to be task-oriented; that is, they execute limited sets of tasks, more than the full set of activities constituting an occupation. Still, all occupations have some exposure. For example, reading radiographs is a key part of radiologists’ jobs, but just one of the dozens of tasks they perform. AI in this case can allow doctors to spend more time on other tasks, such as conducting physical examinations or developing customized treatment plans. In aviation, humans have long relied on automatic pilots to augment their manual control of the plane; these systems have become so sophisticated at automating major phases of flight, however, that pilots can lose their manual touch for the controls, leading in extreme cases to fatal accidents. AI systems have not yet been certified to fly commercial aircraft.
Artificial general intelligence, the idea of a truly artificial human-like brain, remains a topic of deep research interest but a goal that experts agree is far in the future. A current point of debate around AGI highlights its relevance for work. MIT professor emeritus, robotics pioneer, and Task Force Research Advisory Board member Rodney Brooks argues that the traditional “Turing test” for AI should be updated. The old standard was a computer behind a wall with which a human could hold a textual conversation and find it indistinguishable from another person. This goal was achieved long ago with simple chatbots, which few argue represent AGI.
In a world of robotics, as the digital world increasingly mixes with the physical world, Brooks argues for a new standard for AGI: the ability to do complex work tasks that require other types of interaction with the world. One example might be the work of a home health aide. These tasks include providing physical assistance to a fragile human, observing their behavior, and communicating with family and doctors. Brooks’ idea, whether embodied in this particular job, a warehouse worker’s job, or other kinds of work, captures the sense that today’s intelligence challenges are problems of physical dexterity, social interaction, and judgment as much as they are of symbolic data processing. These dimensions remain out of reach for current AI, which has significant implications for work. Pushing Brooks’ idea further, we might say that the future of AI is the future of work.

Efforts should be undertaken to create AI curricula, and build AI literacy and skills of future generations.A 2019 study conducted by DataChildFutures found that 46% of participating Italian households had AI-powered speakers, while 40% of toys were connected to the internet. More recent research suggests that by 2023 more than 275 million intelligent voice assistants, such as Amazon Echo or Google Home, will be installed in homes worldwide.

A worker's guide to predictions, decisions and collaborationThis is the state of AI in 2022, according to three expertsAs younger generations grow up interacting with AI-enabled devices, more consideration should be given to the impact of this technology on children, their rights and wellbeing.Unlocking the potential of AIAI-powered learning tools and approaches are often regarded as critical drivers of innovation in the education sector. Often recognized for its ability to improve the quality of learning and teaching, artificial intelligence is being used to monitor students' level of knowledge and learning habits, such as rereading and task prioritization, and ultimately to provide a personalized approach to learning.Knewton is one example of AI-enabled learning software that identifies knowledge gaps and curates education content in line with user needs. Algorithms are also behind Microsoft`s Presentation Translator that provides real-time translation in 60 different languages as a presentation is being delivered. This software helps increase access to learning, in particular for students who have a hearing impairment. AI, though not always successfully, is also increasingly used to automate grading and feedback activities.

In recent years, progress in research on the role of AI in the early detection of autism, signs of depression from children's speech and rare genetic disorders has made headlines. There are also growing examples of the deployment of AI to ensure child safety by identifying online predators and practices such as grooming and child exploitation. Challenges to child welfareDespite the positive applications of AI, there is still a lot of hesitation towards the technology in certain regions. A 2019 survey conducted by IEEE revealed that 43% of US and 33% of UK millennial parents respectively would be comfortable with leaving their children in the care of an AI-powered nurse during hospitalization. In contrast, millennial parents in China, India and Brazil are more receptive to artificial intelligence where 88%, 83% and 63% respectively would be comfortable with a virtual nurse caring for their child in hospital. Similar findings were found for the use of AI-powered robots in paediatric surgery. Scepticism on the widespread use of AI is also present in discussions on children`s privacy and safety. Children's information including sensitive and biometric data is captured and processed by intelligent devices including virtual assistants and smart toys. In the wrong hands, such data could put children's safety at risk. For example, amid security fears, in 2017 CloudPets teddy bears were withdrawn from the shelves following a data breach that exposed private information including photos and recordings of more than two million children's voice messages.DiscoverWhat is the World Economic Forum doing to improve digital intelligence in children? Show moreThe latest figures show that 56% of 8-12-year-olds across 29 countries are involved in at least one of the world's major cyber-risks: cyberbullying, video-game addiction, online sexual behaviour or meeting with strangers encountered on the web. Using the Forum's platform to accelerate its work globally, #DQEveryChild, an initiative to increase the digital intelligence quotient (DQ) of children aged 8-12, has reduced cyber-risk exposure by 15%.In March 2019, the DQ Global Standards Report 2019 was launched – the first attempt to define a global standard for digital literacy, skills and readiness across the education and technology sectors.The 8 Digital Citizenship Skills every child needs Image: DQ InstituteOur System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Media, Information and Entertainment has brought together key stakeholders to ensure better digital intelligence for children worldwide. Find our more about DQ Citizenship in our Impact Story.Serious concerns have also been raised over the use of children's data, such as juvenile records in AI systems, to predict future criminal behaviour and recidivism. Other than posing a threat to privacy, civil society representatives and activists have warned against possible discrimination, bias and unfair treatment.The path towards child-centred AITo ensure that AI is child-centred, decision-makers and tech innovators must prioritize children's rights and wellbeing when designing and developing AI systems. UNICEF and OHCHR have been particularly vocal in this regard. As part of its AI for Children project, UNICEF has worked closely with the World Economic Forum to develop policy guidance on artificial intelligence for children featuring a set of recommendations for building AI policies and systems that, among other things, uphold children's rights to privacy and data protection. As part of its Generation AI initiative and conversations on global standards for children and AI, the World Economic Forum is also spearheading the “Smart Toys Awards” to maximize the learning opportunities of smart toys and minimize the risks posed to safety and children.Rate of automation in the workforce. Image: World Economic ForumEstimates suggest that, by 2065, 65% of children in primary school today will work in positions that have not yet been created. From a practical standpoint, AI should be incorporated into school curricula to equip future generations with coding skills and provide them with adequate AI training. At the same time, children should be taught to think critically about the technology and to inform their judgements about related threats and opportunities. Such efforts should be inclusive of all children and therefore should seek to bridge the digital literacy gap between the Global North and Global South. More global action will be needed to ensure that children's best interests are reflected and implemented in national and international policies, design and development of AI technologies. There is no doubt that artificial intelligence will change the way children interact with their surroundings including their learning, play and development environment. However, it is our responsibility to ensure that this change becomes a force for good.

Call360, a Doncaster-based provider of artificial intelligence analytics to business, has secured its largest ever contract win.
It has been hired by Dyno-Rod, following a competitive tender process. The five-year contract covers the digital channels for Dyno-Rod, which provides plumbing and drains services to millions of households across the UK.
For customers, the data collected will be used to improve service levels, while for Dyno-Rod the data will improve the efficiency of its marketing spend, by highlighting its most and least successful media channels and key words for advertising.
The AI technology works by tracking incoming calls to Dyno-Rod in real time, with the capability of reporting up to 97% accuracy on up to 10,000 calls in just 0.2 seconds.
The algorithms classify the calls into multiple categories, including customer enquiry, booking, customer complaint and job enquiries and they also report on the outcome of every call.
Alastair Donson, franchise improvement manager at Dyno-Rod, said: “The data provided enables us to make commercial decisions backed by the right insight, reducing risk and increasing revenue.
“Customer satisfaction is also improved through a deeper understanding of their journey and adapting our platform to deliver what our customers want.
“Not only does this work for both a national brand and customer but also provides our franchise network flexibility and control at a local level to manage and understand their own local market.”
In the last 12 months Automated Analytics Ltd – which Call360 is part of – has created 10 jobs in technology, business development and sales and marketing at its Doncaster head office.
Following £1.65m funding secured from Maven Equity Finance as part of the Northern Powerhouse Investment Funds – alongside the Dyno-Rod contract – the company is now in a position to accelerate its growth and create a further six jobs.
Mark Taylor, CEO and founder of Call360, said: “This is a major win for us and puts Yorkshire on the map as a hub for excellence in artificial intelligence.
“We have been investing heavily in building out the teams across the business over the last year and with the security that this contract and recent Northern Powerhouse funds bring we are on-course to triple the size of our Doncaster-based workforce within three years.”

If I were to ask someone why they chose a career in information technology, I doubt they would respond with “I love data entry!”, “I could debug code all day long!”, or “Handling tickets is so much fun, I’d do it even if I didn’t get paid for it.”
3 IT tasks that can be automated with AI
Fortunately, AI can help. Here are the top three ways AI can help automate manual IT tasks, thereby freeing up precious resources and benefiting your teams, businesses, and customers.
1. Debugging software
Grace Murray Hopper was a Navy rear admiral and computer programming pioneer who worked on the Mark II computer at Harvard in the 1940s. On September 9, 1947, Hopper traced an error with the Mark II to – of all things – a dead moth in the relay. The insect’s remains were taped in the team’s logbook with the caption, “First actual case of a bug being found.”
While Hopper and her team weren’t the first to use the term “bug” to describe a system glitch, they certainly helped popularize it. Of course, software bugs are decidedly unpopular. IT departments and software engineers have all felt the pain of toiling over lines of code trying to reproduce and locate problems.

To be as good as human engineers, an AI tool would need to possess levels of reasoning and creativity it simply hasn’t yet reached. But AI can still be tremendously effective in exception and anomaly detection. You train it on normal usage and it detects when something is off.
Another advantage AI has over humans is its pattern detection. Let’s say a system is crashing at the same time every week or after memory usage hits a certain level. An AI tool could easily connect the dots. AI can learn which behaviors of your developers and which code patterns that are checked into your repo are correlated to bugs. This can be used to notify developers that they have done something that is likely to break and ask them to check again.
If you had a moth infestation in your home, you could certainly go around swatting them one by one. But wouldn’t it be a lot easier to discover where they hide and put out traps?
2. Predicting future issues
The adage “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” is as true in IT as it is in medicine. Monitoring operations and taking proactive action instead of just reacting to problems as they arise can prevent unexpected downtime and expensive failures.
CIOs and IT professionals are familiar with the value of preventative maintenance to some degree, whether it’s installing software updates or creating backups. That kind of maintenance is done after a certain amount of time has elapsed or usage has been logged. It’s like eating vegetables or getting exercise – they’re sound practices for a company.

Predictive maintenance, on the other hand, is individualized and custom-tailored. It monitors the equipment and its environment, performs tests, and receives equipment feedback to generate individualized predictions. It’s like having a blood test show that you’re pre-diabetic and in response, you design a low-sugar diet.
People may be uncomfortable with the idea of machines watching them all day. But with AI-enabled predictive maintenance, you watch the machines – with other machines.
 Dealing with IT tickets can feel like playing a perpetual game of Whack-A-Mole, but with all of the exhaustion and none of the fun carnival music and prizes.
3. Filtering lower-tier incidents
Dealing with IT tickets can feel like playing a perpetual game of Whack-A-Mole, but with all of the exhaustion and none of the fun carnival music and prizes.
As we all know, some incidents are worth your attention and others aren’t at all. And without a proper way to triage incidents, IT departments become overwhelmed. Enter intelligent filters. They’ve been around for years in search engines and email inboxes, distinguishing between good and bad, important and unimportant. For IT departments, they can distinguish between real incidents and noise.

Using AI techniques like case-based reasoning can help decide which solution to explore first or what additional information to request from a customer to make a diagnosis quickly and accurately. Case-based reasoning systems learn from success and failure, apply sophisticated probabilistic reasoning to identify promising solutions, and create a valuable knowledge base.
With intelligent filters and case-based reasoning, IT managers can better allocate resources for incidents that require human intervention.
While there are numerous existing AI applications that help IT departments – and many more yet to be discovered – debugging, predictive maintenance, and intelligent filtering are three applications of AI that are essential for any great IT department today.
As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our work, any organization that is not actively exploring automating its more manual IT tasks is wasting valuable financial and human capital – and may eventually fall behind.

AI’s J-curve and upcoming productivity boom

This article is part of our series that explores the business of artificial intelligence
Digital technologies, and at their forefront artificial intelligence, are triggering fundamental shifts in society, politics, education, economy, and other fundamental aspects of life. These changes provide opportunities for unprecedented growth across different sectors of the economy. But at the same time, they entail challenges that organizations must overcome before they can tap into their full potential.
In a recent talk at an online conference organized by Stanford Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), Stanford professor Erik Brynjolfsson discussed some of these opportunities and challenges.
Brynjolfsson, who directs Stanford’s Digital Economy Lab, believes that in the coming decade, the use of artificial intelligence will be much more widespread than it is today. But its adoption will also face a period of lull, also known as the J-curve.
“There’s a growing gap between what the technology is capable of and what it is already doing versus how we are responding to that,” Brynjolfsson says. “And that’s where a lot of our society’s biggest challenges and problems and some of our biggest opportunities lie.”

Machine learning and higher productivity

According to Brynjolfsson, the next decade will see significantly higher productivity thanks to a wave of powerful technologies—especially machine learning—that are finding their way into every computing device and application.
Advances in computer vision have been tremendous, especially in areas such as image recognition and medical imaging. Talking to phones, watches, and smart speakers has become commonplace thanks to advances in natural language processing and speech recognition. Product recommendation, ad placement, insurance underwriting, loan approval, and many other applications have benefited immensely from advances in machine learning.
In many areas, machine learning is reducing costs and accelerating production. For example, the application of large language models in programming can help software developers become much more productive and achieve more in less time.
In other areas, machine learning can help create applications that did not exist before. For example, generative deep learning models are creating new applications for arts, music, and other creative work. In areas such as online shopping, advances in machine learning can create major shifts in business models, such as moving from “shopping-then-shipping” to “shipping-then-shopping.”
The lockdowns and urgency caused by the covid-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of these technologies in different sectors, including remote work tools, robotic process automation, powered drug research, and factory automation.
“The pandemic has been horrific in so many ways, but another thing it’s done is it’s accelerated the digitization of the economy, compressing in about 20 weeks what would have taken maybe 20 years of digitization,” Brynjolfsson says. “We’ve all invested in technologies that are allowing us to adapt to a more digital world. We’re not going to stay as remote as we are now, but we’re not going all the way back either. And that increased digitization of business processes and skills compresses the timeframe for us to adopt these new ways of working and ultimately drive higher productivity.”
The J-curve

The productivity potential of machine learning technologies has one big caveat.
“Historically, when these new technologies become available, they don’t immediately translate into productivity growth. Often there’s a period where productivity declines, where there’s a lull,” Brynjolfsson says. “And the reason there’s this lull is that you need to reinvent your organizations, you need to develop new business processes.”
Brynjolfsson calls this the “Productivity J-Curve” and has documented it in a paper published in the American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics. Basically, the great potential caused by new general-purpose technologies like the steam engine, electricity, and more recently machine learning requires fundamental changes in business processes and workflows, the co-invention of new products and business models, and investment in human capital.
These investments and changes often take several years, and during this period, they don’t yield tangible results. During this phase, the companies are creating “intangible assets,” according to Brynjolfsson. For example, they might be training and reskilling their workforce to employ these new technologies. They might be redesigning their factories or instrumenting them with new sensor technologies to take advantage of machine learning models. They might need to revamp their data infrastructure and create data lakes on which they can train and run ML models.
These efforts might cost millions of dollars (or billions in the case of large corporations) and make no change in the company’s output in the short term. At first glance, it seems that costs are increasing without any return on investment. When these changes reach their turning point, they result in a sudden increase in productivity.
The J-curve: There will be a period of lull before AI manifests its productivity potential. (Source: “The Productivity J-Curve: How Intangibles Complement General Purpose Technologies” by Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock, and Chad Syverson)
“We’re in this period right now where we’re making a lot of that painful transition, restructuring work, and there’s a lot of companies that are struggling with that,” Brynjolfsson says. “But we’re working through that, and these J-curves will lead to higher productivity—according to our research, we’re near the bottom and turning up.”
Making the transition to AI
Unfortunately, adapting to AI and other new digital technologies does not run on a predictable path. Most firms aren’t making the transition correctly or lack the creativity and understanding to make the transition. Various studies show that most applied machine learning projects fail. 
“Only about the top 10-15 percent of firms are doing most of the investment in these intangibles. The other 85-90 percent of firms are lagging behind and are hardly making any of these restructuring needed,” Brynjolfsson says. “This is not just the big tech firms. This is within every industry, manufacturing, retail, finance, resources. In each category, we’re seeing the leading firms pulling away from the rest. There’s a growing performance gap.”
But while adopting new technologies is going to be difficult, it is happening at a much faster pace in comparison to previous cycles of technological advances because we are better prepared to make the transition.
“I think what is becoming clear is that it’s going to happen a lot faster in part because we have a much more professional class of people trying to study what works and what doesn’t work,” Brynjolfsson says. “Some of them are in business schools and academia. A lot of them are in consulting companies. Some of them are journalists. And there are people who are describing which practices work and which don’t.”
Another element that can help immensely is the availability of machine learning and data science tools to process and study the huge amounts of data available on organizations, people, and the economy.
For example, Brynjolfsson and his colleagues are working on a big dataset of 200 million job postings, which include the full text of the job description along with other information. Using different machine learning models and natural language processing techniques, they can transform the job posts into numerical vectors that can then be used for various tasks.
“We think of all the jobs as this mathematical space. We can understand how they can relate to each other,” Brynjolfsson says.

For example, they can make simple inferences such as how similar or different two or more job posts are based on their text descriptions. They can use other techniques such as clustering and graph neural networks to draw more important conclusions such as what kind of skills are more in demand, or how would the characteristics of a job post change if you modified the description to add AI skills such as Python or TensorFlow. Companies can use these models to find holes in their hiring strategies or to analyze the hiring decisions of their competitors and leading organizations.
“Those kinds of tools just didn’t exist as recently as five years ago, and I think it’s a revolution that is just as important as the microscope or some of the other revolutions in science,” Brynjolfsson says. “We now have them for social sciences and business to have this kind of visibility. That’s allowing us to make a transition a lot more rapidly than before.”
However, Brynjolfsson warns that not many companies are using these kinds of tools. This is perhaps further testament to his previous point that companies have not yet figured out the right transition strategy and are relying on old methods to restructure and adapt themselves to the age of AI. And at the center of this strategy should be the correct use of human capital.
“You have hundreds of billions of dollars of human capital, of skills walking out the door, and then the company tries to hire back people with the skills that they need. What they don’t realize is that the workers that they let go often had skills that were very adjacent to the ones they’re hiring for,” Brynjolfsson says.
With the help of machine learning, they will have better visibility and knowledge of their “skill adjacencies,” Brynjolfsson says. For example, a company might discover that instead of laying off a bunch of people and looking to hire new talent, perhaps all they need to do is a little bit of retraining and repurposing of their workforce.
“It’s much more expensive to hire somebody fresh than would have been for them to take some of those people who are already in the company and say, if we teach you Python or customer service skills or other skills, you can be doing this job that we’re looking to hire people for,” Brynjolfsson says. “My hope is that, in the coming decade, workers will be in a much better position to take full advantage of their capabilities and skills. And it will be good for the companies too to understand all the assets that they have in there, and machine learning can help a lot with understanding those relationships.”

This is our opportunity to edit out the age-old stereotypes, sexism and discrimination of the labour market, and to create a modern reality that serves the needs of both women and men.”Challenging ideas of ‘women’s work’, providing limited flexibility, risking skills lossThe EU’s body dedicated exclusively to gender equality interviewed almost 5,000 platform workers to understand who they are, why they do platform work, and what challenges they face.   A higher share of women than men told EIGE they do platform work as they can combine it with household chores and family commitments (women: 36%, men: 28%).Yet this flexibility is limited practice, with many working at night, at the weekend, and at hours they cannot choose. Platform workers can also be observed using time-tracking software, which deducts ‘low productivity time’ from pay. Such software can poses a particular threat to those caring for small children.   In platform work, there is a higher share of men doing jobs usually done by women than there is in the traditional labour market. This includes housework (women: 54%, men: 46%), childcare (women: 61%, men: 39%) and data entry (women: 47%, men: 53%).While this can help challenge stereotypes about the type of work done by women and men, EIGE’s survey shows that highly educated women are more likely to do jobs that do not match their level of education, which puts them at greater risk of losing their skills.“New proposed EU legislation to improve the working conditions of platform workers should help bring more of them into formal employment, which will bring rights such as a minimum wage, limits to working time and paid leave.”But in the meantime, EIGE said, EU Member States need to protect the many platform workers whose lack of status as formal employees has made them ineligible for government support during Covid-19, despite the fact that many have faced serious financial difficulties.Artificial intelligence: More women needed   In the EU and the UK, just 16% of those working on AI are women. The share gets smaller with career progression: women with 10+ years’ experience make up just 12% of AI professionals. Male-dominated environments and lack of access to funding may contribute to women leaving the industry.  Algorithms can also replicate bias and discrimination from the ‘real world’. One example is algorithms being trained with biased data to perpetuate discriminatory hiring practices. This can lead to women’s CVs being automatically discarded because their profile doesn’t fit that of people who were hired before – a problem in an organisation mainly made up of men.But AI can also help tackle problems such as gender-based violence. One example is facial recognition that detects photos of human trafficking victims in adverts for sexual services, EIGE said.“To make sure AI works for both women and men, the EU and Member States should conduct gender impact assessments of new technologies, require publicly funded projects to have balanced numbers of women and men, and train engineers and computer scientists in how to avoid bias.” It added that the EU’s proposed ‘Artificial Intelligence Act’ shows promise when it comes to minimising the risk of bias and discrimination in AI.“The EU’s commitment to train more specialists in AI, especially women and people from diverse backgrounds, is also a positive sign.”

Designed in 1770 by the inventor Wolfgang von Kempelen, the machine appeared to be able to defeat any human player.
It later turned out the Turk was in fact a mechanical illusion. A puppet dressed in oriental garb, it concealed under its fez and robes a human chess master. The American poet Edgar Allen Poe was so convinced of the Turk’s fraudulence that he wrote an essay to draw attention to the hoax.
A predetermined mechanism beating a human mind at chess was impossible, Poe claimed, for ""no one move in chess necessarily follows upon any one other. From no particular disposition of the men at one period of a game can we predicate their disposition at a different period.""
Today, artificial intelligence allows computers to make just such predictions, so it might be fair to assume that such naive illusions are behind us. After all, computers now exist that can beat any human at chess.
But a similar illusion characterises the artificial intelligence industry. On Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online platform owned and operated by Amazon since 2005, human activity is supposed to take the appearance of mechanical activity. The premise of Amazon Mechanical Turk is simple. The site hosts contractors, often large tech companies, which outsource short data tasks to a crowd of workers.
The workers fulfil the tasks that machine learning algorithms are not yet able to complete. Because the work is supposed to appear as if artificial intelligence is doing it, the former Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, referred to the platform as ""artificial artificial intelligence"". The contractors tend to interact only with the platform, which hosts the tasks and sources the workers. Having little to no direct contact with the workers, contractors experience the process as if it were entirely fulfilled by computers.

Machine learning, the most common branch of AI training, relies on large data sets to train models which are then used to make predictions. Integrated into this process are algorithms that analyse data to extract patterns and make further predictions, which then use those predictions to generate further algorithms.
The richer the data these technologies are exposed to, the more comprehensive their training and the more sophisticated their capacities become, enhancing their performance in tasks as varied as image categorisation, text classification and speech recognition. In many areas, such developments have bestowed machines with capacities that frequently match or surpass those of humans. AI diagnosticians are already at least as proficient as doctors at identifying certain types of cancer.
But to find patterns and make predictions, the algorithm needs the input data to be labelled or categorised. An algorithm for an autonomous car, for instance, must be exposed to detailed, annotated images of urban areas before it can safely navigate a vehicle around a city centre. Artificial intelligence is not yet capable of annotating these images itself, so instead humans have to label them. For a task that supports the training of autonomous vehicles, this might involve labelling an image of a junction with the tags ‘pedestrian’, ‘traffic lights’ and ‘car’.
This kind of work, often known as ‘microwork’ – due to the brevity of the tasks – is becoming increasingly popular. Growing numbers of sites such as Clickworker, Appen and Playment now host large crowds of workers who undertake these short data tasks, often for very little payment. One study found that the average wage of a worker on Mechanical Turk is less than $2 an hour, with only 4 per cent of workers earning over $7.25 per hour, the US minimum wage. Tasks are very short, running from around 30 seconds to 30 minutes and often pay as little as a few cents.
The tasks can be very repetitive and are often opaque to the point of being impossible to relate to a larger project. A 2020 study by academics found that contractors often offer very little detailed information on their tasks and on the purposes they serve. This means that workers have little idea of what they are precisely working on. This is of particular concern when workers might be supporting a technology such as facial recognition software, which has serious ethical implications.
The work is also highly insecure. Workers are usually categorised as ‘independent contractors’, so they do not enjoy the rights and benefits afforded full-time employees working for the companies that contract them. This means that workers will usually work for multiple contractors over the course of a single day, which in turn means that workers must continually search for new tasks. A significant portion of the day must be given over to finding work, rather than actually doing work that pays.
The majority of this work is currently done in countries in the Global South such as India, Kenya and Venezuela. But some studies suggest that this kind of digital work is also on the rise in countries such as the UK.

Does Artificial Intelligence Really Reduce Jobs? A Historic Perspective
By Bronwyn Howell
RealClearPolicy
January 07, 2022



FacebookTwitterLinkedIn
Anxiety about a dystopian “future of work” caused by advances in artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest outbreak of a remarkably persistent meme with a very long history. Before rushing to panic, or intervening to minimize anticipated harms, it is helpful to pause, take a deep breath, and consider what we already know about the effects of technological change on labor markets, and how this might influence the current response.
First, human beings are terrible at predicting the future. While John Maynard Keynes may have had a lot to say about monetary policy, his 1930 predictions about technological unemployment arising from “our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour” proved wide of the mark. Had he been correct, we would now be struggling with how to purposefully deploy all our newfound leisure time created by technological change rather than stressing about it taking away our jobs — not to mention working on average as many, if not more, hours per week as in 1930.
A more recent example of misleading forecasts comes in the form of autonomous vehicles. Heroic predictions in the early 2010s suggested that by the mid-2020s, truck driving would be consigned to the dustbin of history, alongside blacksmithing and other professions annihilated by the industrial revolution. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted in 2016 that the company’s cars would be capable of a cross-country automated drive by “next year.” In 2019, he tweeted that “everyone with Tesla Full Self-Driving” would be able to do the same. Yet as 2022 dawns, it seems we are no nearer to ubiquitous autonomous vehicle nirvana than in 2012. Rather, the optimistic forecasts are now being downplayed, with one now suggesting that driverless vehicles will not be common and affordable until the 2050s or 2060s.
Second, we need to be aware of the manifest biases and fallacies that magnify the weight humans put on potential losses compared to potential future gains. As a result of these biases, humans often seek to preserve the status quo over pursuing activities that lead to future changes, even when the expected (but risky) gains from the latter may outweigh those of maintaining the status quo. The preference for the status quo, and neat narratives that oversimplify complex scenarios, can lead to overlooking (or ignoring) important information that is not consistent with the current generally accepted meme — illustrated, perhaps, in Musk’s continued optimism for autonomous vehicles despite the evidence leading to others downscaling their forecasts.
The first and second points together lead to the third important consideration: the importance of independently verified data over forecasts and opinion in determining the need for and appropriateness of policy interventions. And data is historical by nature. Pausing to collect it rather than rushing to respond is recommended.
To that end, we can use available data to analyze whether increasing use of AI is demonstrably affecting key labor market performance indicators: labor productivity and multifactor productivity growth. If, as Keynes suggests, AI-driven technological change is increasing the potential for new means of economizing the use of labor to outrun the pace of finding new ways to use it, we would expect to see both statistics rising in the era dominated by AI. Yet as Figures 1 and 2 show, the exact opposite appears true for a wide range of OECD countries. Neither does the data suggest that other key labor market indicators have changed negatively with the advent of AI. As with the computer industry, we see the effects of AI everywhere but in the productivity statistics.

Figure 2. Multifactor productivity: average annual growth rates, selected OECD countries, 1985–2019
Source: New Zealand Productivity Commission, OECD  
Indeed, the computer industry example provides perhaps a cogent explanation for these observations: the lump of labor fallacy. Proposed in 1891 by David Schloss, this is the misconception that both the amount of work to be done in an economy (and hence job supply) and the number of people who want work (and demand for jobs from workers) are inflexible. Yet the evidence shows this is far from the case. The introduction of spreadsheets dropped the price of running what-if accounting scenarios, and the demand for those scenarios was very responsive to price. Rather than decimating the market for accountants, spreadsheet software actually expanded it. The resources freed from calculating simple cases were deployed in accountants developing more complex scenarios to test.
The lesson from history is clear. While trying to get ahead of the game and protect workers’ interests is laudable, acting on predictions and pleadings rather than data risks harming the interests of those one seeks to protect.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is arguably the most exciting field in robotics. It's certainly the most controversial: Everybody agrees that a robot can work in an assembly line, but there's no consensus on whether a robot can ever be intelligent.
Like the term ""robot"" itself, artificial intelligence is hard to define. Ultimate AI would be a recreation of the human thought process — a human-made machine with our intellectual abilities. This would include the ability to learn just about anything, the ability to reason, the ability to use language and the ability to formulate original ideas. Roboticists are nowhere near achieving this level of artificial intelligence, but they have made a lot of progress with more limited AI. Today's AI machines can replicate some specific elements of intellectual ability.

Computers can already solve problems in limited realms. The basic idea of AI problem-solving is simple, though its execution is complicated. First, the AI robot or computer gathers facts about a situation through sensors or human input. The computer compares this information to stored data and decides what the information signifies. The computer runs through various possible actions and predicts which action will be most successful based on the collected information. For the most part, the computer can only solve problems it's programmed to solve — it doesn't have any generalized analytical ability. Chess computers are one example of this sort of machine.
Some modern robots also can learn in a limited capacity. Learning robots recognize if a certain action (moving its legs in a certain way, for instance) achieves a desired result (navigating an obstacle). The robot stores this information and attempts the successful action the next time it encounters the same situation. Robotic vacuums learn the layout of a room, but they're built for vacuuming and nothing else.
Some robots can interact socially. Kismet, a robot created in 1998 at M.I.T.'s Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), recognized human body language and voice inflection and responded appropriately. Since then, interactive robots have become available commercially, and some are being used as companions for senior citizens. Although the robots are helpful for cleaning and mobility assistance, adding interactivity helps reduce seniors' social isolation.
The real challenge of AI is to understand how natural intelligence works. Developing AI isn't like building an artificial heart — scientists don't have a simple, concrete model to work from. We do know that the brain contains billions and billions of neurons, and that we think and learn by establishing electrical connections between different neurons. But we don't know exactly how all of these connections add up to higher reasoning, or even low-level operations. The complex circuitry seems incomprehensible.
Because of this, AI research is largely theoretical. Scientists hypothesize on how and why we learn and think, and they experiment with their ideas using robots. M.I.T. CSAIL researchers focus on humanoid robots because they feel that being able to experience the world like a human is essential to developing human-like intelligence. It also makes it easier for people to interact with the robots, which potentially makes it easier for the robot to learn.
Just as physical robotic design is a handy tool for understanding animal and human anatomy, AI research is useful for understanding how natural intelligence works. For some roboticists, this insight is the ultimate goal of designing robots. Others envision a world where we live side by side with intelligent machines and use a variety of lesser robots for manual labor, health care and communication. Some robotics experts predict that robotic evolution will ultimately turn us into cyborgs — humans integrated with machines. Conceivably, people in the future could load their minds into a sturdy robot and live for thousands of years!
In any case, robots will certainly play a larger role in our daily lives in the future. In the coming decades, robots will gradually move out of the industrial and scientific worlds and into daily life, in the same way that computers spread to the home in the 1980s.

AI job automation: The debate
The debate around whether AI will automate jobs away is heating up. AI critics claim that these statistical models lack the creativity and intuition of human workers and that they are thus doomed to specific, repetitive tasks. However, this pessimism fundamentally underestimates the power of AI. While AI job automation has already replaced around 400,000 factory jobs in the U.S. from 1990 to 2007, with another 2 million on the way, AI today is automating the economy in a much more subtle way.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Robo-writers
Take the example of writing jobs. AI can easily generate text that is indistinguishable from human writing. This type of AI job automation is replacing workers in a way that is largely invisible to the naked eye.
For example, the popular AI copywriting app, Rytr, boasts over 600,000 users, and it’s growing at a brisk pace. In other words, over half a million people are using Rytr alone to fully or partially automate their writing.  It’s estimated that there are just over 1 million freelance writers around the world, who are increasingly competing with robots that don’t tire, don’t require payment, and can generate an unlimited amount of content.
The implications of this are serious: Classical projections for AI-induced job loss focused only on repetitive manual labor and blue-collar jobs. But white-collar jobs, like content writing, are just as vulnerable to AI replacement.
Robo-support
This trend is not limited to writing. AI is also automating jobs in customer service, accounting, and a host of other professions. For instance, companies like Thankful, Yext, and Forethought use AI to automate customer support. This shift is often imperceptible to the customer, who doesn’t know if they’re speaking to a biological intelligence or a machine. The rise of AI-powered customer service has big implications for the workforce. It’s estimated that 85 percent of customer interactions are already handled without human interaction.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are nearly 3 million customer service representatives employed in the United States. Many of these jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI. When jobs like these are automated away, the question is: Where do the displaced workers go?
The answer is not clear. It’s possible that many of these workers will be re-employed in other fields. But it’s also possible that they will become unemployed, and that the economy will struggle to absorb them. This is driving calls for a universal basic income, in which the government provides all citizens with a basic income to live on, to offset job losses due to automation.
Robo-translators
Translation has, of course, long been at risk of automation. However, the advent of large language models is making human translators increasingly vulnerable to replacement by AI. In a 2020 research paper, it was shown that a Transformer-based deep learning system outperforms human translators. This study is significant because it shows that AI translators are not just as good as, but often better than, human translators.advertisement
What’s more, the rise of AI translators is likely to have a negative effect on the wages of human translators. As AI translation becomes more common, the demand for human translators will decrease, and their wages will accordingly drop. While many economists once worried about the impact of outsourcing on the white-collar workforce, the coming wave of AI will have an even more serious impact, across sectors.
In fact, as Forbes reports, AI job automation has already been the primary driver in U.S. income inequality over the past 40 years.
Robo-coders
Just over a year ago, an OpenAI beta tester posited that AI may one day replace many coder jobs. At the time, OpenAI hadn’t yet released its code-generation engine, Codex, which now allows AI to autonomously write code in multiple languages. While the Codex of today is fairly primitive, one doesn’t need to be a futurist to see how this technology could be used to automate away many coder jobs in the future. As AI gets better at understanding code and writing it, it will soon come to match and ultimately exceed human skill levels.
The implications of AI job automationadvertisement
Just two years ago, the idea of AI automating jobs like creative roles was the stuff of science fiction or at least relegated to a few early-adopting businesses. But now, AI is becoming table stakes for many businesses. In other words, if you’re not using AI, you’re at a disadvantage. The major reason for this is that large language model, primarily OpenAI’s GPT-3, have become much better at understanding natural language.
The examples given so far are just the tip of the iceberg. AI is automating jobs away in virtually every sector and industry. While this might seem like cause for alarm, it’s actually long overdue news. The fact is, we’ve been living in a world where machines have been slowly replacing human workers for centuries.
What’s new is the pace of this automation. Machines are now becoming faster, better, and cheaper than humans at an alarming rate. As a result, we’re seeing a fundamental shift in the economy where machines are starting to do the creative jobs of human beings.
Amidst the opportunity to automate away jobs, a new wave of AI-focused startups has emerged, all seeking to cash in on the potential of AI. This AI gold rush is evidenced by the billions of dollars in venture funding that has flowed into AI startups in recent months. In the third quarter of 2021 alone, nearly $18 billion was invested in AI companies, a record high.
This influx of capital is a sign that investors believe in the potential of AI, and they are betting that it will eventually automate away many jobs, generating that value with machines instead. In the meantime, we should prepare ourselves for a future in which AI is quietly eating up the world’s workforce.

ImagenAI Review: Is Bulk Artificial Intelligence Editing Finally Here?





Jan 11, 2022





David Crewe






































 ImagenAI is a personalized photo editing assistant that is designed to learn individual photographer’s styles using artificial intelligence (AI) to help make applying bulk edits to entire catalogs quick and easy. So, does it work, and are we about to enter into a new age of AI editing?         Given that many photographers have reported an upswing in weddings and events again, it is worth checking in to see just how good these AI editing applications have gotten, and if this particular one is worth the investment.  It is probably safe to say that sitting in front of the computer part is the least favored task of most photographers. It is also by far the least glamorous since every hour spent behind the lens averages to four or more in front of the screen culling, editing, cropping, and fine-tuning. While this isn’t such a bad gig during the winter and off-season, spending too much time on editing can seriously eat away at the valuable time working with additional clients during peak seasons. So with the potential of new work and clients, it is time to look into ways to save us time spent in front of the computer dealing with post-processing all those images.

Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE What Does ImagenAI Do? ImagenAI is an AI-powered desktop app for Mac or PC that was developed by programmer Yoav Chai after he was waiting (too long, as he says) for his own wedding images to be delivered. The ultimate goal of the tool he built was to simply make it easier and faster for photographers to get bulk edits of their images completed, thus freeing them up to move on to other projects, and more importantly, delivering the completed images to their clients.   The software is built to work seamlessly with Adobe Lightroom Classic and learn the way a specific photographer edits to create an independent style that will be automatically applied to any files uploaded through the application. The company says the algorithm learns each user’s editing style by reviewing several catalogs worth of edited images (5,000 or more images for the best results) to build this unique profile, and it keeps learning as a photographer continues to use the app by tweaking any edits sent back by the services and reuploading them for further training. 




 Once a user has trained the system in their preferred style, they can then apply it to their own images at the same time as still granting the ability to add options like cropping and straightening. Depending on the connection speed for the upload, the system takes an average of about 20 minutes to edit 1,000 images, at which point it will send the edits back to be imported by the user.  As a note, this will be slower depending on how many users are tasking the ImagenAI system at the same time, which has me questioning the feasibility of future scalability.  In addition to learning each individual’s personal style for the work, users also have the option to select from “Talents” that ImagenAI works with, which are photographers who have shared their distinct styles. You can think of these Talents pretty much like an automatic preset pack for Lightroom.  Like other bulk editing services, it will not always get everything exactly right, but it can help save hours of editing time per shoot by providing a baseline starting point to work from. The application targets photographers who work in the wedding, product, real estate, and events markets, but can certainly benefit other disciplines. The application supports adjustments to all of the “Basics” sliders like exposure, white balance, contrast, vibrance, and texture. Additionally, the service can also make adjustments to the hue/saturation/luminance sliders as well as the sharpening and noise reduction tools. This level of granularity will theoretically leave you with a broad starting point with only the micro-adjustments left to be made with tools like spot healing, graduated filters, and so on.  The Workflow Process 




The steps have mostly been outlined above, and in practice I found the software to be gratefully as straightforward and simple as ImagenAi makes it sound.  After you install the application, the software uploads the baseline “learning” images to its server in order to train the AI on your specific style. Ideally, it will be easiest if these images are in a single catalog. After the AI trains itself, you are notified by an email that your personalized profile is ready and that you can upload your RAW files to be edited. ImagenAI will then process those images and notify you again via email when the project is ready for download once completed.  At that point, simply reopen the application and select the “Download and Update your Lightroom Catalog with edits” and select the desired project. This is when it is safe to reopen the actual Lightroom catalog to check out how the AI has done with the RAW files and make any additional adjustments before sending to your client or making further edits in another processing application like Photoshop.    Afterward, especially if you plan to continue using the service, the company recommends using the “Fine-tune” tool at the bottom of the application’s main window to re-upload the final, manually-edited images so that the system can better learn and enhance the accuracy of how it understands your particular style which the company says will make it faster and more accurate with each ensuing project.




But Does It Work? The short answer? Yes. Is it perfect? No.  With my training session, I sent the application a series of images ranging from a concert, a comic con, two modeling sessions, a few landscape images, some goofy photos of my dog, as well as a celebrity clothing line project. I did my best to give ImagenAI as many photos as I could, well more than the 5,000 photos it said would be a solid target, as a baseline for my personal Lightroom style. After a few hours, the system emailed me to let me know the learning was done, and I was ready to start processing images.  To make things interesting, I created a new catalog full of random images from several different events including shooting behind the scenes for an upcoming film, a different comic con, and a smattering of portraits and landscape images just to see how the app would react. This particular upload consisted of just over 800 images and took just about two hours to upload, process, and return to me.  What I got back was honestly quite impressive. The convention and behind-the-scenes images were shot under some pretty challenging lighting situations not to mention the bevy of non-linear angles and perspectives, but the system learned my style pretty quickly and accurately. I honestly couldn’t have been happier with what came back in this case, unless the app culled them down for me also (I’ll keep my fingers crossed that becomes a feature someday, or at least a grouping and ranking system of some sort to help speed up the fat-trimming). For a majority of the photos, it almost felt like I hit an “auto” button for the settings but with the added benefit of a personal touch. I did notice that in the portrait files, the colors were a little more muted than I would have preferred, but I imagine that would improve with each similar and ensuing file I re-upload to the system which would further train the AI. 




 For those who want to try this, I advise photographers who do more than one style of work to create multiple “profiles” within the application. In my case where I hit the AI with a smattering of very different types of photos, what came out worked great for one style but less so for another.   Granted, I only was able to test the application out using a small sample set of images, but it feels a little more accurate than some other previous services I have outsourced to in the past, and definitely much faster. I haven’t even continued to train the AI and I’m already impressed.   For my own personal work, I could see this being useful on-site for large corporate events at situations like comic conventions, fashion events, trade shows, concerts, and possibly even product and food photography. I don’t personally shoot weddings anymore, but I feel like from a dollars-per-image perspective, that would be one of the best use cases for ImagenAI as well.




What It Can’t Do While I was impressed with the application and the results it returned, that does not mean it is without issue. The first thing I noticed (and I touched on this above) is that the application does not rank/rate/group or cull the images down. While it can apply your style and level out the images (if required), it still will leave in the out of focus, lower quality, misfired, and so on photos. Yes, it saves a ton of time “editing,” but users will still be left with the task of culling the images down themselves. Perhaps this is not such a big deal in the behind-the-scenes and events market, but you definitely do not want to deliver the “bad” shots to a wedding or portrait client and because of that, photographers will still have to spend the time to reject images.  The application also cannot identify and pick out images where you would apply your “signature style” like black and white or more customized edits. Again, it might be possible to train a separate profile for things like monochrome or other stylized looks, but users will have to apply that profile to an entire upload. Unless you are incredibly organized and have already culled and sorted the images out into separate folders and categories, it will be pretty tedious to do this task even with ImagenAI’s tools helping the process. The reality is, custom and detailed edits for the “printable” images will still need to be manually chosen and worked on. This is not really a deal-breaker by any means, but worth noting to make sure readers are aware before diving into the app.  The last thing worth noting about the limitations of ImagenAI is it is currently built entirely on the Adobe Lightroom architecture. This means that any photographers using other RAW processing engines in their workflows like Capture One Pro, or even Photo Mechanic will have to use Lightroom Classic to be able to benefit from this service. AI Editing is Here ImagenAI seems to learn each photographer’s editing style from Lightroom at an impressive speed, making it much easier and faster to churn through excessive image catalogs and it will only get better each time a user adds to their catalogs with the application. As a bonus, the software offers users 1,000 edited images for free before you have to subscribe, so you can see if the platform will work for you without having to lay down a cent.   The ImagenAI platform is available to both PC and Mac users for $7 per month as part of a subscription plan, plus a per-image fee of $0.04 to $0.06 per image based on the number of images in a batch. The scale slides from $0.06 per photo at 1 to 1,000 images, $0.05 per photo at 1,001 to 5,000 images, and $0.04 per photo from 5,001 to 10,000 and more . The structure may seem a bit strange, but the $7 monthly fee gets put up against the monthly final bill for any images uploaded and edited which means it is not just a fee for access, it actually counts towards each users images and carries over if it doesn’t get used at the end of the month. 




ImagenAI allows you to cancel your memberships at any time without any penalties or additional fees as well, which is nice. If a photographer is shooting a lot of bulk images, ImagenAI’s somewhat convoluted pricing tiers do end up saving you money and time, especially when compared to a digital tech or editor for those who might want to use it on site. Others may just like the service because it saves time being stuck at your desk, even if the lack of culling capability does mean it doesn’t remove this step entirely.  After doing the math on a recent gig I worked personally where an editor was hired, I found that this app could have done the job faster and cheaper. This will obviously not always be the case, but it is definitely worth having around as a tool to have in those clutch situations. Are There Alternatives? There is definitely no shortage of outsourced image editing platforms and software on the market. One of the first to consider is ShootDotEdit, which is one of the premier wedding photography outsourcing sites. However, this particular business uses actual retouchers and has a turn-around average of five business days. Under the same umbrella is a service called Weddit which offers a similar service and turnaround time, and again, is focused almost entirely on the wedding business.  On the AI front and for a more broad coverage of genres, there are apps like Autoretouch and RetouchPro.AI, but both seem to cost a fair bit more than ImagenAI. Should You Buy It? Yes, if you are a creative that shoots a lot of high-quantity image events like weddings, trade shows, concerts, and conventions. ImagenAI is worth the investment for at least a single project and will likely only grow in its reliability over time.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
The tech world is abuzz with murmurs of the fabled 10x developer, but whether such a developer really exists is up for debate.




Have you ever heard of a 10x programmer? If you’re not in the tech world, the answer is probably no, and even if you are in some way associated with the world of coding and technology, and you might not really be familiar with this term. But within the developer community, it's become a shorthand way to talk about the skill sets that people have, and how they use them to be competitive.
Some people refer to the 10x programmer as a piece of IT ""folklore."" And in fact, the idea of it is very mythological on its face. A 10x programmer is a programmer or developer who is as productive as ten other average people in his or her field. So that very description, that idea conjures up a somewhat mythological figure, a “king geek” super-programmer with lightning-fast fingers and a great big brain.
With that said, there's a lot of debate about whether 10x programmers exist. Can someone be ten times as good as someone else in these kinds of disciplines?
Where's the Proof? The Case Against 10x Programmers
A big part of the argument of people who don't believe in 10x programmers relates to a lack of research showing these sorts of productivity disparities. Critics may contend that there is very sketchy research to support the 10x programmer idea, and that it really can't be measured in any meaningful way. For example, in this Fog Creek blog, tech expert Laurent Bossavit talks about how research on 10x programmers was only done on small groups, that a lot of the research was old, and that it used rather obsolete types of coding languages. Bossavit also talks about unknowns such as how relevant prior science would be today, and how well you can really measure programming or development capacity.
It’s an Intuitive Thing
In firing back, those who do think that 10x programmers are out there often talk about the same complexity inherent in the field to suggest that there should theoretically be people who are ten times more productive than the average.
For instance, take a look at this rather eloquent defense of the 10x programmer by Yevgeniy Brikman entitled “The 10x Developer is Not a Myth.” Here, Brikman cites someone like William Shakespeare – we can't really measure why Shakespeare was so much better than other writers of his time, but the “proof” is evident in schools and universities, on bookshelves and in libraries.Advertisements




Brikman also talks about programming and development as being based on design choices. For instance, he mentions the utility of Ruby over C for various projects. The idea that he puts forward is that by making better choices, a programmer can indeed do the work of ten people and work ten times more productively than someone else. These sorts of arguments keep the hope alive that a company could see one of these modern-day giants striding into its offices on any given day. (For more on groundbreaking tech development, see The Pioneers of Computer Programming.)
Back and Forth
For a lot more on the idea of 10x programmers, you don’t have to look any further than Quora, a social media community based precisely on answering such thorny questions.
One Quora thread (among some dozen targeted to the issue) asks about whether there are actually 100x or 1000x engineers. Some extend the reasoning for 10x programmers or engineers logically to say that in fact, some people really do add a lot more value to a project than others. However, in this thread and others, the question often comes down to what your yardstick looks like, and how you actually assign value.
Another Quora thread is possibly more helpful: it asks why 10x people are not paid ten times more than other professionals. One of the answers that you get is that these ""unicorns"" of the development world often go on to start their own companies, rather than slaving away for someone. If you accept the premise that the creative products of startups like YouTube and Dropbox are 1000 times more valuable than the salary of someone at, say, Google, then you could make a lot of the same arguments for saying that these entrepreneurs, these people who broke out of the box to create new products, were at least 100 times or even 1000 times more productive than others in their field – but you see the kind of complex logic here. It sort of breaks down, because a startup isn't like a big company, and we don't really measure people’s value just by how much money they make… or at least, it’s frowned upon in polite society.
In the end, all of this is very instructive in talking about the ways that the industry works, and the way that it compensates its people. On a very basic level, you could say that the most skilled people end up working for themselves, or that they start to command a lot of attention at larger companies, because after a while, other people start realizing how good they are at what they do. But all of this isn't to take away from anyone else who may be a little more ""average."" After all, while some of our biggest tech offerings are the brainchild of one or two people, you don’t really get anywhere in a society like this without some collaboration and group work – even if you're Steve Jobs or Bill Gates.
From a practical standpoint, companies would be well served by not worrying about finding 10x programmers, but instead putting that energy into creating productive and intelligent teams, empowering their workers to grow within the company, and unleashing each person’s inner productivity. But for those who want to engage in hero worship and chase the dream of the mythological uber-programmer, it's possible that those mega-stars might be out there. They might just be applying all of their potential to the next Facebook or iPhone. (To help prepare for your next interview, see The Craziest Tech Interview Questions – and What They Might Mean.)

3 Ways That Artificial Intelligence (AI) Will Change Your Job ForeverAdobe Stock

In fact Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai recently predicted that it will turn out to be the most profound human invention so far – more so that electricity, the internet, or even fire!

Certainly, I believe it has the potential to deeply impact everything about the way we live our lives, from how we travel, to how we connect and communicate with friends, and most definitely the way we work and do business.

Whatever job you do now, if it isn’t affected by AI already, it’s very likely that it will be at some point in the not-so-distant future. Here’s my rundown of the five most significant changes AI will make to the world of work in our lifetimes.


AI probably won’t make you redundant – yet!

It’s certainly true that machine learning – the AI technology that’s most relevant to business today – will be able to do some things so much more quickly and efficiently that it won’t be worthwhile to pay humans to do them anymore. This will include things like sensing, moving things around, scheduling, translating, and optimizing machinery. But the jury is still out over whether, in the long or short term, AI will lead to more jobs being lost or created.

One way to look at it is that AI, in theory, will lead to increased business growth and success. Often this will mean (hopefully) more customers. More customers mean more human problems that need to be solved – from complicated customer service issues requiring a human response to the challenge of consistently creating innovative products and services that meet the changing needs of humans. These are tasks that humans will be needed for, for a long time yet!

The arrival of AI is described today as the dawn of the ""fourth industrial revolution."" The first industrial revolution saw political opposition and public unrest from people who feared that agricultural and manufacturing machinery would cause widespread unemployment and even the collapse of society. That fear is still alive today. On the other hand, others believe that technology will lead us into an era that has been described as “fully automated luxury communism,"" where robots provide all our basic necessities at effectively no cost to us. Human beings are then free to spend their time on fulfilling and creative pursuits that give their lives value and meaning.
Both ideas present extreme outcomes, and we’re probably a long way yet from either. What is clear is that AI has the potential to relieve many of us of a lot of the mundane and repetitive elements of our work, so the best way to make sure we don’t become redundant is to work in jobs where our value is elsewhere!

Smart machines will augment and assist us
When we're carrying out those more human, creative, or strategic tasks that won't be automated any time soon, we can expect robots and smart machines to be there to lend a hand. Often this will mean having analytics-capable tools on-hand to make sure our decisions are underpinned by solid data. For example, HR roles will, for a long time yet, still require a human touch to solve human-specific problems. But increasingly, AI is used in recruitment to provide initial screening of the thousands of applications that many large companies attract whenever they advertise a vacancy. You might not be happy to hand over the entire responsibility of picking who will work for you to a machine, but it can greatly improve efficiency by providing early indications of who might be the most suitable applicants.
Those kinds of tasks are carried out by AI software running on machines such as PCs and tablets that we’re all used to, but we will increasingly find ourselves “working alongside” machines in a very literal sense, too. Collaborative robots (Cobots) work on the floor with humans in Amazon’s worldwide network of warehouses as well as facilities such as Ericsson’s 5G smart factory, where assembly, packing, and dispatch of its devices is carried out autonomously by machines while security drones patrol the premises to deter intruders. Online supermarket Ocado uses robots to pick and pack 50,000 customer orders per hour, navigating miles of shelves across football-pitch-sized warehouses.
Our ability and willingness to get along with our new robot colleagues is likely to play a big part in determining how successful we are in the world of work in the near future. For businesses, the challenge will be to make sure humans and robots are both spending their time on the jobs they are best at.

AI will create new types of jobs
Once again, the impact of earlier industrial revolutions is a good source of predictions on how this one might turn out. Certainly, plowmen, weavers, and smiths lost their jobs during the widespread adoption of mechanization in the early 19th century. But as the first mechanized industries emerged, populations became urbanized, and quality of life improved for many people. This led to business and human enterprise evolving to provide services needed to keep everything running and to keep people fed, happy, and entertained.
The same will undoubtedly be true of the AI revolution. Business and society are going through a period of adjustment as we come to understand the power of smart machines and automation, and the human skills needed to lead the way on this are in high demand. More roles are likely to appear involving the ability to identify areas where AI and automation resources will be most effective, for example. Another very valuable human skill right now is the ability to create “buy-in” – effectively developing trust among human workforces and bosses towards AI and smart machines because trust is essential for AI to work!
The key thing to remember here is that any job that can easily be automated is likely to be! Businesses need to ensure that their own workforce is in-tune with this forecasted future and equipped with the “human” skills that aren’t likely to be automated any time soon. These include emotional intelligence (empathy), creativity (AI can write songs but is unlikely to come up with anything that we will consider great music any time soon), and complex decision-making.

One way to think about the impact it will have, is to consider how the invention of ""non-smart"" machines (anything that can't be considered to be ""artificially intelligent"") impacted industry and commerce from the first industrial revolution to the dawn of the AI era, around ten years ago. During this time, machines took on much of the heavy lifting of our manual workload. Now we have ""smart"" machines; increasingly, they will take on the burden of managing our cerebral workload too – anything that requires thought, learning, or decision making!

Key Takeaways



                AI is poised to displace millions of jobs, both blue-collar and white-collar.            


                However, there are skills that AI cannot master: strategy, creativity, empathy-based social skills, and dexterity.            


                We need a new social contract that emphasizes the importance of proper education and collaboration with AI.

The following is an excerpt adapted from AI 2041 by Kai-Fu Lee and Chen Qiufan. Copyright © 2021 by Kai-Fu Lee. All rights reserved. No part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher.Artificial intelligence can perform many tasks better than people can, at essentially zero cost. This simple fact is poised to generate tremendous economic value but also to cause unprecedented job displacement — a wave of disruption that will hit blue- and white-collar workers alike. In the future, AI will be doing everything from underwriting our loans to building our homes, and even hiring and firing us. This transformation of how work gets done will not only result in severe unemployment, but potentially ignite a host of social problems, including depression, suicide, substance abuse, widening inequality, and social unrest.So where does that leave us? What are the jobs that AI can and cannot displace? What is the future of work? The jobs most at risk of automation by AI tend to be routine and entry-level jobs. AI’s main advantage over humans lies in its ability to detect incredibly subtle patterns within large quantities of data. Take the example of loan underwriting. While a human underwriter will look at only a handful of measures when deciding whether to approve your insurance application (your net worth, income, home, job, and so on), an AI algorithm could take in thousands of variables — ranging from public records, your purchases, your healthcare records, and what apps and devices you use (with your consent) — in milliseconds, and come up with a far more accurate assessment of your application.Such algorithms will displace routine white-collar work easily, just as software has steadily taken over routine white-collar tasks, such as bookkeeping and data entry. In “The Job Savior,” we saw examples of affected white-collar workers ranging from bookkeepers to insurance underwriters. When combined with robotics, AI will also displace increasingly complex types of blue-collar work. By 2041, warehouse pickers — who perform routine tasks — will have long been displaced; many construction workers will have been displaced, as building practices shift toward prefabricated components built by robots that are easy to assemble en masse.What AI cannot doThis begs the question: What can AI not do?These are the three capabilities where I see AI falling short, and that AI will likely still struggle to master even in 2041:Creativity. AI cannot create, conceptualize, or plan strategically. While AI is great at optimizing for a narrow objective, it is unable to choose its own goals or to think creatively. Nor can AI think across domains or apply common sense.Empathy. AI cannot feel or interact with feelings like empathy and compassion. Therefore, AI cannot make another person feel understood and cared for. Even if AI improves in this area, it will be extremely difficult to get the technology to a place where humans feel comfortable interacting with robots in situations that call for care and empathy, or what we might call “human-touch services.”Dexterity. AI and robotics cannot accomplish complex physical work that requires dexterity or precise hand-eye coordination. AI can’t deal with unknown and unstructured spaces, especially ones that it hasn’t observed.

What does all this mean for the future of jobs? Jobs that are asocial and routine, such as telemarketers or insurance adjusters, are likely to be taken over in their entirety. For jobs that are highly social but routine, humans and AI would work together, each contributing expertise. For example, in the future classroom, AI could take care of grading routine homework and exams, and even offering standardized lessons and individualized drills, while the human teacher would focus on being an empathetic mentor who teaches learning by doing, supervises group projects that develop emotional intelligence, and provides personalized coaching.For jobs that are creative but asocial, human creativity will be amplified by AI tools. For example, a scientist can use AI tools to accelerate the speed of drug discovery. Finally, the jobs that require both creativity and social skills, such as strategy-heavy executive roles, are the ones where humans will shine.While it’s clear that there are a lot of lines of work that AI will struggle to master — and thus would be safer for workers to pursue for their careers — these alone won’t prevent a disaster for the legions of workers displaced from roles that will be easier for AI. So what else can we do to help fulfill the basic human desire for a meaningful livelihood?Relearn, recalibrate, renaissanceTo create more jobs and improve the readiness of workers for the transformation on the horizon, I propose the 3 Rs — relearn, recalibrate, and renaissance — as part of a gargantuan effort to deal with the central issue of our time: the AI economic revolution.People in endangered jobs should be warned well in advance and encouraged to learn new skills. The good news is that, as discussed, there are skills that AI cannot master: strategy, creativity, empathy-based social skills, and dexterity. In addition, new AI tools will require human operators. We can help people acquire these new skills and prepare for this new world of work.Vocational schools need to redesign their curricula to promote courses for such sustainable jobs. Governments could take the lead and provide incentives and subsidies for these courses, rather than blindly pursue broad-brush economic measures, such as universal basic income. Corporations could also provide programs like Amazon’s Career Choice program, under which Amazon pays up to $48,000 for any employee to earn a degree in high-demand fields such as aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design, and nursing.Pandemic or no pandemic, the importance and number of human-centric service jobs, such as nursing, will also increase as wealth and life span increase. Society has consistently devalued such vital human-centric service roles both in terms of how they are perceived and how much they are compensated, and we need to address this oversight.In addition to relearning skills, we need to recalibrate what today’s jobs look like with the help of AI, moving toward a human-AI symbiosis. The most prevalent and basic symbioses will be found in software AI tools. Software powers a human-PC interdependence, which has already revolutionized office work. Software AI tools can devise alternatives, optimize outcomes, or perform routine work for white-collar professionals in many fields. Specific AI tools will be customized for each profession and application — for example, AI-based molecule generation for pharmaceuticals, advertising planning for marketing, or fact-checking for journalism.

A deeper interdependence between AI optimizations and “human touch” will reinvent many jobs and create new ones. AI will take care of routine tasks in tandem with humans, who will carry out the ones that require warmth and compassion. For example, the future doctor will still be the primary point of contact trusted by the patient but will rely on AI diagnostic tools to determine the best treatment. This will redirect the doctor’s role to that of a compassionate caregiver, giving them more time with their patients.Just as the mobile Internet led to roles like the Uber driver, the coming of AI will create jobs we cannot even conceive of yet. Examples today include AI engineers, data scientists, data-labelers, and robot mechanics. But we don’t yet know and cannot predict many of these new professions, just as in 2001 we couldn’t have known about Uber drivers. We should watch for the emergence of these roles, make people aware of them, and provide training for them.Finally, with the right training and the right tools, we can expect an AI-led renaissance that will enable and celebrate creativity, compassion, and humanity. From the 14th to the 17th centuries, wealthy Italian cities and merchants funded the Renaissance, which saw a flowering of artistic and scientific output. We have reason to anticipate that AI will be the catalyst for a new renaissance centered around human expression and creativity. As with the Italian Renaissance, people will follow their passions, creativity, and talents once they have more freedom and time.Painters, sculptors, and photographers will use AI tools to compose, experiment with, and refine artwork. Novelists, journalists, and poets will use new technologies for research and composition. Scientists will use AI tools to accelerate drug discovery. An AI renaissance will reinvent education, giving teachers AI tools to help each student find their own passions and talents. Education will encourage curiosity, critical thinking, and creativity. It will promote learning by doing and group activities that enhance students’ emotional intelligence — and that bring them face-to-face with one another, and not just a screen.A new social contractTurning some of the ideas above into reality would be an unprecedented undertaking for humanity. One thing is clear: We will need to retrain a massive number of displaced workers. We need to raise an astronomical amount of money to fund this transition. We need to reinvent education to produce creative, social, and multidisciplinary graduates. We need to redefine the work ethic of society, entitlements for citizens, responsibilities for corporations, and the role of governments. In short, we need a new social contract.Fortunately, we do not need to create this from scratch. Many elements already exist in different countries. Take, for example, the “gifted and talented” education programs in Korea, primary education in Scandinavia, university innovations (like massive open online courses, or MOOCs, and Minerva Schools) in the United States, the culture of craftsmanship in Switzerland, service excellence in Japan, the vibrant tradition of volunteering in Canada, caring for elders in China, and “gross national happiness” from Bhutan. We need to share our experiences and plot a way forward globally, where new technologies are balanced by new socioeconomic institutions.Where will we find the courage and audacity to take on this gargantuan task? We are the generation that will inherit the unprecedented wealth from AI, so we must also bear the responsibility of rewriting the social contract and reorienting our economies to promote human flourishing. And if that is not enough, think about our posterity — AI will liberate us from routine work, give us an opportunity to follow our hearts, and push us into thinking more deeply about what really makes us human.

From startling discoveries in the rushes to working with ambient pioneer Midori Takada, the creators tell us how it happened.18 January 2022Tokinokawa (2021)By Georgia KorossiInterviewsTokinokawa is a six-screen and multichannel audio-visual installation produced by UK-based media collective The Light Surgeons. Commissioned by the BFI, it’s part of a larger performing music and cinema collaboration, Tracing the Circle, inspired by new restorations of some of the earliest moving images of Japan, preserved at the BFI National Archive and dating back to 1902.
The installation is currently on display at BFI Southbank, accompanied by new music by Japanese composer Midori Takada, a pioneer in experimental and ambient music. The result is a mesmerising work that charts the evolution of architecture, the natural environment and the social landscape through the dual lens of early and contemporary filmmakers, working 120 years apart.

The images were then analysed by bespoke AI software and presented with an animated infographic layer alongside audio-engineered compositions. At first glance the result is an odyssey of infinite algorithms, as the footage flows through Japan’s traditions and landscapes. But the combination of the images with Takada’s euphoric percussion also suggests a warning about the rise of AI tools and how they influence our view of the world.
The creators of Tokinokawa, The Light Surgeons’ Christopher Thomas Allen and Tim Cowie, joined me for a conversation about the project.
Tim Cowie and Christopher Thomas Allen
How did you first come to work with these archive films?
Christopher Thomas Allen: Back in 2018, the BFI National Archive were looking into a lot of early archive films in Japan to coincide with the Olympics. Initially the plan was to do screenings of these films with live music. We were invited to develop a live cinema show and given about five hours of early black-and-white film material.
Christopher Thomas Allen  
How did you approach working with such a large amount of material?
Christopher: A lot of the footage was disintegrating and, to be honest, I loved it. When they started to restore it, it almost lost some of its beauty. I love stuff that’s falling apart; it’s evocative of memory. We went through the black-and-white material – we put an order to it, we structured it, and we edited about 90 minutes of thematic narrative.
Working with a Japanese producer, we tried to work out where the locations in the archive footage were, and then finally we got the budget to go there.
The window for doing this became quite intense because it was at the end of 2019 that we finally got the go ahead. I made it over there just before the lockdown kicked off in 2020. Tim was meant to join me to work with Midori on the music, but he couldn’t make it because they changed the travel restrictions.
Tim Cowie  
Tim Cowie: Between Chris going and my flight leaving, which was just a week apart, the travel laws had changed. It was crazy.

Christopher: I managed two weeks of filming and gathering all the material. There were certain places we couldn’t get into because COVID had also impacted Japan, although less so at the time.
When I came back to the UK, the project went into an indefinite pause because everything was closed, and the live show couldn’t be done. It went into this prolonged state of not knowing where it would go. We then started thinking about how it might function as a film rather than a performance. We could go back to the performance later. The concepts and ideas evolved a bit, and we started going through a lot of the footage that was shot while I was in Japan.
How did Midori Takada become involved in the project?
Christopher: I flew over to Paris to see her perform. Musicians like her and Steve Reich are influences on the stuff we’ve made. It was amazing to go and see her live performance and get a sense of the key theatrical element in her work. She had lots of interesting things to say about the archive. We discussed how the archive exists in this relationship between the past, the present and the future. And so, from there, a three-act structure started to emerge. The archive has no fixed position. It’s this constantly moving thing that we’re reassessing from the present and projecting into the future. So those ideas of circular narratives and themes were central in the piece.
Midori went away and started writing and thinking about music based on the sections and chapters that we had edited from the archive footage.
Tim: The idea was that when we got together in London for rehearsals, we would have some time to develop the music and bring the new video footage that Chris shot with the extra sound design layers to it. Unfortunately, we couldn’t collaborate closely with Midori and develop the installation, so we just worked with those pieces of music that she created. I was looking at ways that we could use the music and have the footage projected on a wall. The idea was this metaphor of time as a river running through the piece.
Tokinokawa (2021) 
We’ve got six speakers matching the video screens and the music travelling with them. Everything’s flowing left to right as if it’s a stream. As one little excerpt drifts off, another one drifts back in. There was talk of time all the way through the development of the piece – a lot of Midori’s pieces are at 60 BPM and they’re all on the second. It’s like this ticking clock with the drum pounding, so it made it easier to mix the pieces.
How does her music interact with the sound design?
Tim: I wanted to bring the sound of spaces and environment into the piece, so the sound design layer is made of a lot of film recordings and recordings from the video footage itself. That helps immerse you in the environment. There’s a drone layer that’s being driven by the actual sound in the footage, that’s been processed.

Tokinokawa (2021)
Did you make any discoveries during the experience?
Christopher: There’s a funny story about a dead body, which was affecting and made me think about the material a lot afterwards. One location in the archival footage was a waterfall, Kegon Falls, in a place called Nikko that has a very large Shinto shrine. We arrived there very late in the day, and it was very cold. I had a long 600mm zoom lens on the camera, and I was shooting stuff very quickly.
When I got back, I gave all the footage to Tim and said to him, “Can you look through the rushes and give me some feedback?” and Tim said, “Yeah, I’ve watched it, but there’s a dead person in one of the frames.” I was unaware what he was talking about. In one of the shots there was this poor guy looking directly into the lens of the camera. It was a chilling and freaky moment. It made me think about the detachment of filming, the gaze of the camera and the juxtaposition of something so horrific in such beautiful scenery. This is a famous place for suicide, apparently.
That sent me on a bit of a philosophical trip. In this interim period, when we couldn’t work on the project, I read Jacques Derrida’s book Archive Fever. In that, he talks about this idea of the death drive, and the need to film and to record. For me, a lot of those ideas are implicit in the piece, which became much more than just thinking about a single culture. That’s what led to the idea of the AI.
Tokinokawa (2021)
Can creative developments in AI change our ways of seeing?
Christopher: It’s scary when you think about how quickly this stuff is becoming used in all sorts of ways, consciously and unconsciously, and how AI models are trained, and who’s training them. In cinema, we have the same problem: whose gaze is this?
Going back to the meaning of the archive, it was western production companies going into Japan, looking at it from an orientalist perspective. In the same sense, we’ve got the same thing, neo-colonialism with AI. It’s rich, white technicians building models based on our own biases. All that stuff’s there, but it’s got the potential to be even more dangerous in a way. For example, we used this model called YOLO, which is used a lot for driverless cars. There’s a whole bunch of these models that you can explore and experiment with.
There’s an interesting website called Runway, which is accessible for artists and creative people. We worked with a company called Artists & Engineers to write some software that would utilise some existing models. These models are mad, and you think oh God, I’m never going in a driverless car. It’s spookily accurate and crazily not accurate at the same time. That’s the situation now, but who knows what it will be like in 50 years?

Tim: These models are old as well, aren’t they? I mean these are the models that are available free and to people like us, whereas I’m sure that the technology has moved on a lot since these were created.
It’s both sinister and exciting, because the technology could have dark uses and implications. At the same time, it can open lots of possibilities for freeing up some of this material. I use it on my phone, looking at photos and searching. It’s really nice when I’m going to look at some pictures of my daughter when she was small, and it just throws up all the photos. Or looking for a family member in your photo stream, which is quite a nice and positive thing. It’s about treading carefully around who’s going to write the rules.

Tokinokawa is open daily from midday to 10pm at BFI Southbank until 30 January.
The original films that were used for the Tokinokawa installation are newly restored films from the BFI’s Japan on Film archive and are available to watch for free on BFI Player.

But given it’s potential for misuse, is AI safe to use at home?",,,,"




























The smart home is now a reality. We have robots that can clean the floor, open blinds, turn on switches and open doors. We also rely on smart assistants like Siri and Alexa to answer questions, read our text messages, manage our diaries and more.
Most of these technologies are perfectly harmless – the vacuum cleans up dust, the blinds open and close and the lights go on and off. But these devices are getting smarter, using artificial intelligence to learn your habits and preferences.
Artificial intelligence – always watching, always learning
What most people don’t realize is just how much data can be collected and processed by artificial intelligence (AI). Take the Facebook smartphone app for instance – you already know that everything you share online is carefully analyzed and processed to build a marketing profile about you. But did you know the app also uses the built-in sensors in your smartphone to see where you are, who you are with and what you are doing – even if you disable location sharing?
This is where the problem with AI at home starts. Your devices may be collecting quite sensitive information that you would not normally share. Because these devices are always present, we quickly forget what they are capable of. Which means that we often do and say things without remembering they may be being recorded.
Consider Alexa, built into smart speakers and streaming devices from Amazon. As well as listening for the ‘Alexa’ keyword, these devices are known to record private conversations which may later be reviewed or analyzed by Amazon.

The reason for recording conversations is relatively harmless – Amazon uses them to improve and personalize their service for you. But what if the AI is being operated by a less reputable provider? Cheap devices will often upload data to AI data centers in China where personal privacy is not guaranteed – and where you have far fewer protections against personal data misuse.
As useful as AI is, we all need to be a bit smarter about how it is used at home. Especially when so many companies are collecting data that is not directly related to the service they offer.
Artificial Intelligence used correctly 
Obviously there are some problems with AI – but that’s not to say it is not helpful when applied to specific situations. Panda Dome uses artificial intelligence to monitor how your computer works under normal circumstances.
Panda Dome doesn’t read your personal files or keep any of your personal data, but the AI can detect when something unusual happens. It can then block suspicious activity that may indicate malware at work – even if the app has never “seen” that type of infection before.
The AI approach is safer, faster and more secure than traditional antivirus techniques. And because it is finely targeted on a single activity, you can trust the AI to behave responsibly.
AI will undoubtedly become more and more common – but as we have shown, users will need to be much more careful about the information they share with their smart homes. Next time you’re in the same room as your Alexa, take a minute to consider what you are saying – and how that may be being collected and used by artificial intelligence systems.

The use of Artificial Intelligence in marine biology research

Marine biologist at the University of Agder (UiA), Kim Tallaksen Halvorsen, labels the marine biology research being done using sonar, camera and Artificial Intelligence along the coast of southern Norway revolutionary.
Scientists from the field of marine biology have previously manually monitored plankton and fish stocks along the Skagerrak coast. However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now being used in marine biology research to observe marine life. Cameras, sonar, sensors and other equipment are laden with AI. The algorithms count the fish and plankton, monitor the size of the fish, and can even distinguish one fish from another.
“This is an interdisciplinary success story and a revolution within marine research,” commented Kim Tallaksen Halvorsen, marine biologist at the Institute of Marine Research at Flødevigen. “Artificial Intelligence frees up time for the researcher, but also provides more observations and more information. In addition, the observations are more certain. Artificial intelligence cameras do not get tired, they are attentive all the time.”
In collaboration with scientists from the University of Agder (UiA) and the Institute of Marine Research, Halvorsen is publishing a new study on AI, marine research and mechatronics. The article is accepted for publication in the ICES Journal of Marine Science. The article aims to provide an introduction to AI. In addition, it demonstrates how interdisciplinary collaboration, and the use of artificial intelligence, can open up new research fields in the future.
Artificial intelligence in marine biology research
The use of AI is new to marine biologists, yet Halvorsen considers what he and his colleagues are doing with the help of AI along the coast of southern Norway a ‘revolution’.
“Observing and counting fish used to be manual tasks, where we had to comb through hours of film footage to find the information we were looking for,” explained Halvorsen. “Just measuring the length of a cod requires a picture where the front and back parts of the fish are clearly visible. The work is very time consuming. With artificial intelligence, taking observations is automated. We get the number of different fish species, sizes and other observations immediately.”
AI is applied to distinguish and recognise different fish species, but also to recognise individual fish. This is possible because several species have distinct patterns that are unique to each individual. This is true for species such as corkwring wrasse, ballan wrasse, salmon and cod.
“We use the same technology that is found in mobile phones. When we can monitor fish on an individual level over several years, it will give us new and more certain insight into how the fish live,” said Halvorsen.
New research method using AI
AI is more gentle than traditional research methods according to the researcher. The traditional method utilised by marine scientists is to capture, then sedate and tag the fish. Halvorsen estimates that he has caught and tagged 3000 to 5000 fish a year in this way.
“With Artificial Intelligence, we avoid having to catch, sedate and microchip the fish. This means that we can be less intrusive to marine life, and still obtain more information,” described Halvorsen. In the Coast Vision project, the researchers have monitored the growth and behaviour of individuals over time using only camera observations and AI. This has not been done with natural fish stocks before.
Halvorsen believes that in the future, AI will help us monitor and understand changes in the ocean when they occur. “We can get information about the health of the Skagerrak in real time, and thus be able to initiate immediate measures if something is urgent,” Halvorsen commented.
Interpreting large amounts of data
“Marine ecosystems are large and complex, and so is the amount of data needed to understand the system,” explained Rebekah Alice Oomen, marine biologist at UiA and the University of Oslo. The challenge is not to discover, but to analyse the enormous amounts of data.
“While we used to spend an awful lot of time reviewing and interpreting data, we can now leave that task to artificial intelligence,” Oomen said. “The work has focused on new applications of mechatronics and artificial intelligence to collect and interpret big data.”
The main aim of the new study is to make artificial intelligence tools available to marine biologists.

artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting jobs across all strata of business and IT. 
AI is being incorporated into customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), business intelligence (BI), analytics, cybersecurity, marketing, sales, management, and more. 
Here are five major trends in AI jobs the market is seeing: 
See more: The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Market
1. AI Shifts All Roles
AI is shifting all other roles or at least a great many of them.
“There isn’t a shift in AI jobs as much as AI is causing a shift in other roles,” said Patrick Conte, chief commercial officer at Opsani. 
Conte gave the example of cloud application optimization, where AI is allowing DevOps engineers to focus on development and testing and not as much on the size of workloads. 
AI can find the right size, or the service-level objectives, of an application, where a DevOps engineer or team might just request a large footprint that will hold the app, without worrying about over-provisioning and overspending. In this case, AI and its branch technology machine learning (ML) can suggest with high accuracy the size of the workload (CPU, memory, replicas, etc.) and allow the DevOps team to build, test, and send the workload to the site reliability engineering (SRE) team.  
2. Site Reliability Engineering Roles 
AI and ML are bringing about big changes in SRE roles. By using ML to find an optimal set of performance settings in the production phase, the SRE team does not have to take time away from preparing apps for production to worry about tuning them. 
Since the number of permutations of settings for an app or microservice with just three parameters (CPU, memory, replicas) is in the trillions, it requires a system that can operate at machine speed to do the testing and experiments necessary to actually find the optimal combination of values for those parameters.  
“Humans can only guess at the optimal, whereas AI and ML can find it at a faster speed and more reliably,” Conte said. “This doesn’t replace humans but frees them up to do their higher-value jobs.”

3. Cybersecurity and AI 
Cybersecurity engineers scored highest in salary growth in 2020 according to the “Tech Salary Report” from jobs website Dice. The report highlights skills like cloud, AI, ML, and cybersecurity as being in high demand. 
While tech salaries overall grew by 3.6% in 2020, cybersecurity analyst salaries surged by 16.3%. Rates have risen again in 2021. And roles are evolving that harness AI in tandem with standard cybersecurity tools.
“The widespread adoption of remote work led to increased vulnerabilities, providing hackers with unprecedented opportunities to attack and breach defenses,” said Art Zeile, CEO of DHI Group, a provider of AI-powered career marketplaces that focus on technology roles. 
“In response, the need for skilled technologists to identify and plug these security holes saw cybersecurity analysts enjoy the largest growth in salary of any occupation.”  
4. AI in Manufacturing 
Many different verticals are big on AI. And manufacturing is moving into the forefront. 
An MIT survey revealed that about 60% of manufacturers are already using AI. The two most common use cases for AI in manufacturing are maintenance and quality control. 
For instance, instead of people going around equipment and assembly lines at certain time intervals, AI is used to process data coming in from sensors to monitor factors like oil levels, debris on filters, equipment health, performance, vibration, emissions, and more. AI then points maintenance personnel toward the equipment and components that need attention. This saves time and money. And people who can combine the AI and maintenance disciplines should find their services wanted in many quarters. 
“Manufacturing data is a good fit for AI/machine learning,” said Cem Dilmegani, founder of AI Multiple, an AI analyst firm. “Manufacturing is full of analytical data, which is easier for machines to analyze.” 
Similarly, AI in quality control can help inspectors know what to inspect, where to inspect, and how to trace QC issues back to their root cause. 
5. AI in Robotics 
Robotics is another hot market. And it is making heavy use of AI. 
Rob Enderle, an analyst at Enderle Group, said the autonomous robotic market alone is worth around $103 billion this year. He predicts that it will more than double by 2025 to $210 billion. 
Where jobs will be plentiful will be in areas such as robotic process automation (RPA). When integrated with AI, RBA helps companies deal with high-volume, repeatable tasks far more efficiently. 
Yes, some tasks will be lost to robots. But plenty of people will be needed to service the robots, harness AI to increase performance, reduce robotic errors, and write software that can incorporate AI, RBA, and plant systems.

	This crumb-sized camera uses artificial intelligence to get big results

	Its unique lens and approach to image processing are behind its great photos




 


The new, miniaturized camera lens sits on the tip of a finger (left). It bends light with 1.6 million tiny metal rods instead of curved glass. The pattern formed by the rods is visible in a magnified image of the lens (right).

Say cheese! Researchers have developed a tiny camera that takes amazingly clear photos. Just don’t sneeze while it’s in your hand. At the size of a coarse grain of salt, you may never find it again.
Smaller cameras could mean lighter smartphones and new James Bond–style gadgets. But that’s not all. Cameras on this scale could swim through the body, hitch a ride on an insect, scope out your brain or monitor hostile environments. And those are just a few of the possibilities.
How do you pack that much picture-taking power into something the size of a crumb? It takes a “radically different approach” to making a camera lens, says Felix Heide. He’s a computer scientist at Princeton University in New Jersey. His lab developed the camera with colleagues from the University of Washington in Seattle. The team shared its work in Nature Communications in November.

Cameras have two main parts: a lens and a sensor. The lens bends incoming light onto the sensor, where the image is recorded. Over the last few decades, sensors have gotten smaller and smaller. But lenses are another story. “Lenses haven’t been miniaturized at all,” Heide says. Most are designed little different today than they were in the 1800s.
Lenses are traditionally made by stacking curved pieces of glass or plastic. A curved surface bends light passing through. How the light bends depends on the curvature. A lens can be a single piece of glass. To bend light in more ways, you can stack several of them together.
Heide’s team took a totally different approach. They made a lens from a metasurface. These surfaces are super thin, human-made materials patterned with tiny structures. The structures are so small they’re measured in billionths of a meter (nanometers). Similar but slightly thicker materials are called metamaterials.

Pictures taken with other mini cameras have been fuzzy and distorted (left). The new camera takes crisp, full-color pictures (right). They’re on par with pictures taken by conventional cameras.Princeton University
“Metamaterials interact with light in entirely new ways not found in nature,” explains Natalia Litchinitser. She’s an electrical engineer at Duke University in Durham, N.C. How they interact depends on the structures ― their shape, density, pattern and what they’re made from. This is also true of metasurfaces.
With the right design, metasurfaces can become miniature lenses or mirrors. That means they can squeeze into tiny spaces and reveal things people haven’t seen before. Another plus? They can be made for pennies. That’s because you can make them using the process developed for producing computer chips.
Still, Litchinitser cautions, this technology is relatively new and has its limits. For example, metasurface lenses often produce fuzzy pictures or pictures with colored halos around the edges. Litchinitser credits the new camera’s creators for developing computer programs to overcome those problems. For these programs, the researchers turned to artificial intelligence, or AI.
‘Learning’ to get better pictures
When TikTok or Snapchat recognizes your face in a photo and applies a filter, that’s AI at work. The more you use these features, the better their machine learning gets at identifying you. That’s because these programs learn from their mistakes.
With a similar approach, Heide’s team tackled two key challenges for metasurface cameras: lens design and image quality. To get a high-quality image they needed a metasurface with more than 1.5 million metal structures. But how should the structures be arranged to get the best picture? It would take far too much time and computing power to explore every possibility.
Machine learning includes deep learning and neural nets
Luckily, there’s a shortcut. The team wrote a computer program that simulated light traveling through a lens and the picture it created. Then the program tweaked the lens design and ran the simulation again. It compared the new picture to the previous one and judged which was better. As the program cycled through different possibilities, it learned a bit each time about how best to tweak the design and get the best picture.
But even a perfect lens design won’t deliver crisp, clear pictures unless you tackle another challenge. No metasurface lens can perfectly focus all the light rays passing through. That introduces blurriness. To deal with this, the team wrote a second computer program. This one looked at images of a simulated scene. The images were blurry in different ways. By cycling through the images and comparing them to the original scene, the program learned to correct for each type of blurriness. The result: An image-processing program that made pictures sharp and in full focus.
A lens just 0.5 cubic millimeters (a 300-millionth of a cubic inch) in size now rivals the quality of a traditional camera lens 550,000 times that volume. Just like its much bulkier predecessor, the new camera’s pictures are crisp, colorful and capture a wide field of view. You could even take a selfie with it. For now, however, the team is being extra careful and keeping it away from noses.
Ethan Tseng is a computer-science graduate student in Heide’s lab. He co-led the project with a student from the University of Washington. “We’re living in very exciting times,” Tseng says. “We’re seeing all kinds of cool tech that can completely change the way we originally thought of building things.”

artificial intelligence: A type of knowledge-based decision-making exhibited by machines or computers. The term also refers to the field of study in which scientists try to create machines or computer software capable of intelligent behavior.


colleague: Someone who works with another; a co-worker or team member.


computer chip: (also integrated circuit) The computer component that processes and stores information.


computer program: A set of instructions that a computer uses to perform some analysis or computation. The writing of these instructions is known as computer programming.


density: The measure of how condensed some object is, found by dividing its mass by its volume.


electrical engineer: An engineer who designs, builds or analyzes electrical equipment.


engineer: A person who uses science to solve problems. As a verb, to engineer means to design a device, material or process that will solve some problem or unmet need. (v.) To perform these tasks, or the name for a person who performs such tasks.


environment: The sum of all of the things that exist around some organism or the process and the condition those things create. Environment may refer to the weather and ecosystem in which some animal lives, or, perhaps, the temperature and humidity (or even the placement of things in the vicinity of an item of interest).


field: An area of study, as in: Her field of research is biology. Also a term to describe a real-world environment in which some research is conducted, such as at sea, in a forest, on a mountaintop or on a city street. It is the opposite of an artificial setting, such as a research laboratory. (in physics) A region in space where certain physical effects operate, such as magnetism (created by a magnetic field), gravity (by a gravitational field), mass (by a Higgs field) or electricity (by an electrical field).


filter: (n.) Something that allows some materials to pass through but not others, based on their size or some other feature. (v.) The process of screening some things out on the basis of traits such as size, density, electric charge. (in physics) A screen, plate or layer of a substance that absorbs light or other radiation or selectively prevents the transmission of some of its components.


graduate student: Someone working toward an advanced degree by taking classes and performing research. This work is done after the student has already graduated from college (usually with a four-year degree).


lens: (in optics) A curved piece of transparent material (such as glass) that bends incoming light in such a way as to focus it at a particular point in space. Or something, such as gravity, that can mimic some of the light bending attributes of a physical lens.


machine learning: A technique in computer science that allows computers to learn from examples or experience. Machine learning is the basis of some forms of artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, a machine-learning system might compare X-rays of lung tissue in people with cancer and then compare these to whether and how long a patient survived after being given a particular treatment. In future, that AI system might be able to look at a new patient’s lung scans and predict how well they will respond to a treatment.

Pentagon Experts Call for More Practical AI to Manage Mundane Tasks

              A pair of chief information officers for Pentagon organizations argued for a more practical approach to artificial intelligence focused on things like streamlining organizational tasks across the Defense Department.

Loftus, MD, with the University of Florida Health’s Department of Surgery and colleagues, outlined their six important characteristics in an opinion piece published Jan. 18 in PLOS Digital Health.“Patients and clinicians face shared clinical decision-making tasks while under time constraints and high cognitive loads from high volumes of information,” the authors explained. “To this end, we propose a framework for ideal algorithms consisting of six desired data,” they added later. In order for an algorithm to operate clinically, they must be:1. Explainable: Many algorithms are unable to ""show their work,"" commonly known as the black box problem. But quality tools must clarify the traits of a patient and their medical condition while making a diagnosis. Separating association from causation is also crucial. 2. Dynamic: Digital tools should capture and adjust to patients in real-time. For example, intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressure can shift quickly after a head injury, not recognizing these changes can prove deadly. 3. Precise: The average person generates more than 1 million gigabytes of healthcare data during their lifetime or nearly 300 million books, the authors noted. Algorithms must utilize and distill this information to diagnose complex diseases and changing conditions.4. Autonomous: After training and testing periods, AI should be able to learn and offer results with little input from providers or developers. 5. Fair: Implicit bias and social inequities must be accounted for. Prior to including demographic or socioeconomic factors into a prediction model, developers must determine whether that factor has a proven association with a clinical outcome.6. Reproducible: These tools are validated externally and prospectively, and shared among multiple academic communities and institutions. Federated learning uses a decentralized, online infrastructure to train algorithms and presents a good opportunity for developing reproducible tools.  Related AI content:VIDEO: Getting cardiologist buy-in on artificial intelligenceHow machine learning models can predict if patients will show up for appointmentsAI-based system affords physicians more flexible schedules, minimizes burnout triggersAI-based mammo screening protocol reduces radiologist workload by 62%Explainable AI model accurately auto-labels chest X-rays from open access datasets6 features of the ideal healthcare artificial intelligence algorithmMatt O'ConnorMatt joined Chicago’s TriMed team in 2018 covering all areas of health imaging after two years reporting on the hospital field.

The HealthAxis Group, a Tampa company that provides technology for healthcare payers, has received a new investment to help the firm continue to digitalize data in the health care system. 
Revelstoke Capital Partners announced Wednesday it invested in HealthAxis Group. The financial terms of the investment were not disclosed, but a news release states it was a significant amount. 
“HealthAxis and Revelstoke understand there is an urgent need to digitalize and promote efficiency within our healthcare system. We will use this significant new capital to drive growth through targeted product innovation and investment in our team, all while maintaining focus on our customers, who, through their loyalty and partnership, have positioned us for this transformative growth opportunity. We are excited by this new partnership, and I am deeply grateful to our employees for their years of hard work and dedication,” Shilen Patel, Founder & CEO of HealthAxis, said in a statement. 
Patel was not immediately available to provide further comments on the new investment. 
McGuireWoods LLP acted as legal counsel to Revelstoke. Shumaker, Loop and Kendrick LLP acted as legal advisors to HealthAxis. 
“Revelstoke is excited to work alongside Shilen and the HealthAxis management team to pursue complementary acquisitions to broaden the company’s solution suite and better serve its customers,” Cy Barton-Dobenin, principal at Revelstoke, said in a statement. “This investment will allow the company to enrich and extend its care management, payment integrity and AI-driven automation capabilities for HealthAxis customers.”
HealthAxis works with payers, providers and third parties by providing electronic health records, practice management systems, billing, benefits administration platforms and application management. 
Over the years, HealthAxis has been on a growth track, acquiring several companies. In 2019, it acquired Analytics Partners, a Jacksonville-based health care analytics company, and Beacon Health Solutions, a Tampa services company.

The motto is to make any work less laborious and less time-consuming. Among so many gadgets, there are some that are based on artificial intelligence. Here are the top 10 coolest AI-based Gadgets that you can use this year..Self-operating Drones.Drones need to have some level of autonomy to stop them from falling out of the sky or ramming straight into a tree, and it's all thanks to AI that drones like the DJI Phantom 4 Advanced can pilot themselves as and when needed. The Phantom 4 Advanced, similar to several other models, is smart enough to pick you out from a crowd and take a selfie of you without you having to do anything laborious. The same kind of intelligent tech enables it to identify a quickly approaching obstacle, so it can swerve to avoid it – all thanks to the onboard image processing AI..Google Home.All of that high-level programming and engineering filters its way down to the Google Assistant, which comes built into the Google Home as well as a growing number of other devices. When your speaker recognizes your voice, that's AI at work – machine learning identifying the characteristics of your speech even if you're saying words that it hasn't heard you say before. A different kind of artificial intelligence is deployed to make sense of what you're actually saying, to work out which words in which order and which context should prompt which responses. You can't yet chat to a smart speaker quite as easily as a human being, but when you can, it'll be because of AI engineering..KODA AI Robot Dog.If you can't have a real dog, you can always go for the KODA AI Robot Dog. It interacts with people the same way a real puppy does. This self-evolutional robot dog has a decentralized platform, acts as an emotional companion, and can even provide physical support..Nobi Smart Lamp.If you have a family member who lives independently, the Nobi Smart Lamp can give them peace of mind. This practical gadget looks like a ceiling lamp and automatically detects falls. It then notifies emergency contacts, getting your loved ones the help they need at the right time..Morebot Scout: AI-Powered Smart Home Robot.Great for home security, the Morebot Scout AI-Powered Smart Home Robot, has enough sensors and AI algorithms to eliminate blind spots. Even better, you can control it via Alexa and Amazon..Zmirror All-in-One Smart Mirror.The Zmirror All-in-One Smart Mirror is smart enough to analyze your skin health and improve your productivity. And that's exactly why you want to have it on your nightstand or by your bathroom sink. Plus, you'll get superb audio for all your YouTube videos, Kindle books, and more with the Harmon Kardon speakers..Square Off Grand Kingdom Set Smart AI Chessboard.The Square Off Grand Kingdom Set Smart AI Chessboard is a smart game. It uses robotics, sensors, and artificial intelligence to move the chess pieces on its own. And it even lets you play chess with anyone in the world. With 20 different levels of difficulty, it allows you to play at your own competitiveness..Tempo Studio AI Home Gym.With the Tempo Studio AI Home Gym, AI gets you into shape. It lets you access live and on-demand workouts for personalized guidance. It's just like having a personal trainer who's available 24/7. It also comes with all the equipment you need like two dumbbells, a barbell, a recovery roller, plates, and more..PowerVisionPowerEgg X Explorer AI Personal Camera.The PowerVisionPowerEgg X Explorer AI Personal Camera has the technology to recognize faces and objects. It learns from you and knows what to zoom in on. So, while you waterski, this drone focuses on you and not the seagull floating next to you..Samsung JetBot 90 AI+ Robotic Vacuum.With its AI-based sensors and navigation, the Samsung JetBot 90 AI+ Robotic Vacuum may be the smartest vacuum you've ever met. It has a LiDAR sensor that detects distance and location, while a 3D sensor recognizes small and fragile objects. Finally, an object recognition algorithm maps the best cleaning route..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

  <li>The Alan Turing Institute selected to lead pilot of a new AI Standards Hub supported by the  British Standards Institution and National Physical Laboratory</li>
  <li>Hub is part of the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy/national-ai-strategy-html-version"" class=""govuk-link"">National AI Strategy</a> and will aim to increase UK contribution to development of global AI technical standards </li>
  <li>Comes as new research finds more than 1.3 million UK businesses will use AI by 2040 and spending on AI is expected to reach more than £200 billion by the same date</li>
</ul>

<p>The new AI Standard Hub will create practical tools for businesses, bring the UK’s AI community together through a new online platform, and develop educational materials to help organisations develop and benefit from global standards. This will help put the UK at the forefront of this rapidly developing area.</p>

<p>The Hub will work to improve the governance of AI, complement pro-innovation regulation and unlock the huge economic potential of these technologies to boost investment and employment now the UK has left the European Union.</p>

<p>BSI, the UK National Standards Body, and NPL, the country’s national metrology institute, will share their world-class expertise in developing standards and research to deliver the pilot with The Alan Turing Institute, the national institute for data science and AI. The hub is backed by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Office for AI (OAI). </p>

<p>The move kicks off one part of the UK’s new <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">National AI Strategy</a>, a ten-year plan to strengthen the country’s position as a global science superpower and “harness AI to transform the economy and society while leading governance and standards to ensure everyone benefits”.</p>

<p>DCMS Minister for Tech and the Digital Economy Chris Philp said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s imperative the UK remains at the forefront of this transformative technology which is already improving our lives and has huge potential to create new jobs and wealth. </p>

  <p>Today I’m confirming that the renowned Alan Turing Institute will lead the trial of a new UK programme with support from the British Standards Institution and National Physical Laboratory to help shape and improve the global standards for artificial intelligence. </p>

  <p class=""last-child"">It marks the first step in delivering our new National AI Strategy and will develop the tools needed so organisations and consumers can benefit from all the opportunities of AI. We want the UK to lead the world in developing AI standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-activity-in-uk-businesses"" class=""govuk-link"">research</a> published today predicts that the use of AI by businesses will more than double in the next twenty years, with more than 1.3 million UK businesses using artificial intelligence by 2040. </p>

<p>It shows that in 2020, UK businesses spent around £63 billion on AI technology and AI related-labour and this is expected to reach more than £200 billion by 2040. </p>

<p>The UK is already successful in this field. According to <a rel=""external"" href=""https://technation.io/news/talent-key-to-helping-ai-sector-unlock-huge-opportunity/"" class=""govuk-link"">Tech Nation</a>, the UK now has more than 1,300 AI companies – a 600 per cent increase in the number of firms over the last decade. In the same period, venture capital investment rocketed from $120 million to more than $3.4 billion in 2020.
 
The huge potential of AI technologies to power new firms and revolutionise old ones with improved productivity and more flexible ways of working demonstrates the need for tools to govern its development, ethics and use, including through globally developed technical standards. </p>

<p>In its pilot phase, the new hub will focus on: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Growing UK engagement to develop global AI standards by bringing together information about technical standards and development initiatives in an accessible, user-friendly and inclusive way. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bringing the AI community together through workshops, events and a new online platform to encourage more coordinated engagement in the development of standards around the world.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating tools and guidance for education, training and professional development to help businesses and other organisations engage with creating AI technical standards, and collaborate globally to develop these standards. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exploring international collaboration with similar initiatives to ensure the development of technical standards are shaped by a wide range of AI experts, in line with shared values. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ahead of the pilot’s launch, there will be a series of roundtables with a wide range of organisations led by The Alan Turing Institute to shape the Hub’s activities. </p>

<p>The move follows the launch of the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation’s (CDEI) ‘<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-roadmap-to-an-effective-ai-assurance-ecosystem"" class=""govuk-link"">roadmap to an effective AI assurance ecosystem</a>’, which is also part of the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">National AI Strategy</a>. The roadmap sets out the steps needed to develop world-leading products and services to verify AI systems and accelerate AI adoption. Technical standards are vital for enabling effective AI assurance because they give organisations a common basis for verifying AI.</p>

<p>George Freeman, BEIS Minister for Science, Research and Innovation said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The transformative impact of AI is quickly becoming central to our economy and society, already playing a key role in everything from climate science and medical diagnostics to factory robotics and climate change mapping.</p>

  <p>The UK is one of the world’s most advanced developers and users of AI.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">The key to building on this is maintaining public trust through leading in global regulation and standards. That’s why I am thrilled to see the esteemed Alan Turing Institute selected to lead the pilot of our AI Standards Hub, helping to shape and strengthen the governance of AI globally while reinforcing the UK’s position at the forefront of AI technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adrian Smith, Director and Chief Executive of The Alan Turing Institute said, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>International standards are set to play an increasingly crucial enabling role in the adoption and effective governance of AI technologies. Given our place at the heart of the UK’s thriving AI ecosystem, I am delighted to see the Turing identified as the home of this important new initiative. </p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We look forward to working closely with our partners in establishing the AI Standards Hub, leveraging our expertise and networks to build and engage an inclusive, multi-stakeholder community around AI standardisation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scott Steedman CBE FREng, Director-General, Standards at BSI said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>International standards are a vital tool to help unlock the economic potential of AI, including establishing a common language for all to use. BSI, as the National Standards Body is ideally placed to convene the AI community in the UK to identify and develop good practices for the development, governance and use of AI technologies that will be internationally recognized. </p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We look forward to working closely with government, industry, academia, consumer interest groups and our international standards network to ensure that UK-led, globally relevant standards, will underpin and foster the future of AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Peter Thompson FREng, CEO, NPL said </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted that, following the recommendations made in the National AI Strategy last year, we are now launching the UK’s International AI Standards hub pilot. This coordinated UK effort will strengthen our world leading position and is an important step in supporting research and innovators in this area as well as providing a layer of confidence to those using and interacting with AI. </p>

  <p class=""last-child"">As digital technology standards develop at pace it is critical that NPL, as the UK’s National Metrology Institute, applies its expertise to ensure confidence across technologies and the associated data to support a safe and secure digital world. We look forward to working with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), the Office for AI (OAI), BSI and the Alan Turing Institute, to accomplish this.</p>

<p>AI is playing an increasing role in both technical innovation and artistic creativity. Legislatures are starting to examine how patents and copyright can incentivize AI development and innovation, while continuing to promote human creativity and innovation. As AI adoption continues, this issue is becoming front and center; for example, we recently <a href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/blogs/sourcingatmorganlewis/2021/10/us-court-rules-artificial-intelligence-systems-are-not-inventors"">wrote</a> about a US court&rsquo;s decision on whether an AI system could be listed as an inventor on a patent. </p>
<p>The UK IPO consultation sought to understand the evidence and views on the intellectual property rights associated with inventions and creative works developed by AI. Specifically, the consultation looked into the following three areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Copyright protection for computer-generated works without a human author. If work is created by AI, should the work be protected, and if so, how? The United Kingdom is one of the few countries that protect works generated by a computer where there is no human creator. Currently, this protection lasts for 50 years from the date the work is made. </li>
    <li>Licensing or exceptions to copyright for text and data mining. Text and data mining is the use of automated computational techniques to analyze large amounts of information to identify patterns, trends, and other information. To data mine, it is often necessary to acquire a copyright license or to rely on a copyright exception, which the United Kingdom introduced in 2014. </li>
    <li>Patent protection for AI-devised inventions. Should the IPO protect inventions made by AI, and if so, how? The IPO has already received two patent applications which name an AI system as the inventor. However, the Court of Appeal has confirmed that UK patent applicants must name a human inventor or inventors. </li>
</ul>
<p>According to the IPO, any measures it implements should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>encourage innovation in AI technology and promote its use for the public good, </li>
    <li>preserve the central role of intellectual property in promoting human creativity and innovation, and</li>
    <li>be based on the best available economic evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some argue that protection for AI-generated works will incentivize investment in AI technology. Others advocate that protecting AI-generated works may promote these works at the expense of human-created works, and such protection could reduce innovation and competition. For example, reduced innovation costs associated with AI-devised inventions could result in a larger volume of patents held by a smaller number of persons or entities.</p>
<p>The UK government is now in the process of assessing responses to the consultation, and the information obtained will inform a government decision on any changes to legislation. We will keep you updated on any announcements. </p>",,,,,,,,,

Across the country, it’s quitting time. Hiring continues to sputter, with payrolls rising by only 199,000 across the United States. While the December Jobs Report shows that unemployment fell to just 3.9%, a more troubling statistic lurks beneath these results. A record number of people quit their jobs in 2021 - over 40 million, when you factor in the 4.5 million that clocked out in December. For the workers that remain, the nature of work - and the resolution to that restless nature - is transforming the job market.


For many employees - over 50 million, in fact - low hourly wages and scant benefits are the only option. (For perspective, consider that the US labor force is about 162 million in total). The US Private Sector Job Quality Index (JQI) shows that the quality of jobs has significantly declined in quality, as reported by Jack Kelly in Forbes. An increase in lower-level jobs, and a decrease in those willing to apply for them, is creating a powerful (and potentially troubling) decision matrix - tipping the scales in favor of automation, robotics and AI (artificial intelligence). A disinterested labor force, a proliferation of lousy jobs, and improvements in automation: these factors are creating a perfect storm for making smart machines. Is the economy tilted towards building the workforce it needs, because it can’t hire the workforce it wants?

“We’re Not Gonna Take It”
In The Work of the Future: Building Better Jobs in an Age of Intelligent Machines, (Coming soon from MIT Press) there are two faces of technological change: task automation and new work creation. What happens when people don’t want to do the work that’s being created? Authors David Autor, David Mindell and Elizabeth Reynolds offer a sobering assessment: “The US has allowed traditional channels of worker voice to atrophy without fostering new institutions or buttressing existing ones. It has permitted the federal minimum wage to recede to near irrelevance.” With the disappearance of meaningful work, will our sense of identity and fulfillment also suffer? “Work is a way that we can learn, exercise our powers of perception, imagination and judgment, collaborate socially and make constructive social contributions,” writes MIT Advisory Board Member Josh Cohen. “Not simply a source of income.”

PROMOTED
Bullish on Bots
Global X, a $40 billion dollar investment firm with an appetite for automation, says that 2022 is a key turning point for robotics. The disruption in the supply chain - including the supply of labor - is setting up “a huge surge in spending on robotics and artificial intelligence,” says Jay Jacobs, Senior VP for the fund. “We think we’re going to be in the golden era of robotics adoption for the United States,” he tells CNBC. Global X’s Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (an exhange-traded fund that focuses on bots in business) is up 140% since its 2016 launch. The 10-year growth forecast for industrial robots has more than doubled, from $16 billion to $37 billion, according to Jacobs.

Even with the prevalence of low-paying jobs, labor costs are rising. The laws of supply and demand are at work: reducing the labor supply increases the price of labor. The pains of the pandemic continue to stress the job market, from front-line healthcare workers to hospitality and beyond. Many workers are out sick, dealing with the onslaught of the Omicron variant - while everyone wonders how long it will be until this new wave subsides.

Economic Factors: Balancing Quality and Quantity
While unemployment may be low, the nature of the work hasn’t changed. Quantity is not the same as quality, and workers are seeking a greater quality of life. “Workers aren’t just quitting; they’re rethinking what they want out of work - and shifting their expectations about professional life,” writes Forbes editor, Jena McGregor.

Seems workers are hungry for other options. And so are employers.
Without a willing and compliant labor market, the trend towards automation is a business necessity. Consider an unmasked robot, with no childcare concerns and no need for rest: that robot has a skillset that’s attractive to many employers. Dataquest predicts the following trends for robotics in 2022, in an article outlining the “robot revolution”:

The Advancement of “Cobots” - according to Dataquest, these robots are designed to work alongside people in a safe and effective manner. Equipped with sensors and software, these robots detect changes in their work environment in real-time - with an emphasis on keeping people safe. No word on how or if these machines will protect your job, however.
AI (Artificial Intelligence) Creating Contact-free Experiences - as the pandemic changes with each new variant, the need for social distancing remains. In retail and B2B environments, making transactions seamless and contactless is the goal here.
Smart Factories - manned by robots, featuring low-cost sensors and an unstoppable immunity to COVID, Dataquest says “previously impossible things may become extremely realistic.”
The Rise of RPA (robot-process-automation): “In the healthcare industry, for example, RPA is utilized to automate many activities like as billing, inventory management, and appointment scheduling. The organization established an RPA technique to improve employee experience by relieving them of tedious work and allowing them to focus on what they do best,” Dataquest says.


Finding a Way for AI, Robotics and Automation
It was Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Malcolm) in Jurassic Park who said, “Nature finds a way.” From dinosaurs to the data-driven economy, the rules are the same. If people won’t do certain jobs, those jobs still need to get done. Nature, in this case, is the nature of capitalism. Capitalism finds a way, when certain resources are blocked, indisposed, or unwilling. While the search for personal freedom has led many to rethink what work really means, businesses around the globe are still working to get things done.
With or without human resources, the needs of society (and the demands of the marketplace) will continue to drive investment in automation, robotics and AI. In this golden age of worker defections, are we opening the door to the greater influence of machines? Maybe it’s only nature finding a way, given the state of the labor market - and the ongoing appetite for automated solutions.

Some of the companies working on the newest advances in artificial intelligence are becoming focused on quantifying the progress that they've achieved, and benchmarking some aspects of how artificial intelligence has evolved over time. There are numerous reasons why companies are pursuing these types of analysis. In general, they are trying to figure out how far artificial intelligence has come, how it applies to our lives, and how it will affect markets.
Some companies are brainstorming and monitoring their artificial intelligence progress to figure out how new technologies may affect civil liberties, or how they might create new economic realities. Depending on the company's approach, these types of analysis may take the form of trying to figure out how user data may flow through systems, understanding how interfaces will work, or figuring out what capabilities artificial intelligence entities have and how they might use those capabilities.
When it comes to methods, companies that are trying to benchmark artificial intelligence may focus on breaking down abstract information – for instance, a Wired article cites the AI Index project, where researchers like Ray Perrault, who works at nonprofit lab SRI International, are working on a detailed snapshot of what's going on in the artificial intelligence field.
“This is something that needs to be done, in part because there's so much craziness out there about where AI is going,” Perrault says in the article, commenting on the motivation for taking on this type of project.
In explaining how benchmarking artificial intelligence works, some experts are explaining that engineers or other parties may be trying to pursue “hard testing” for artificial intelligence projects, for instance, trying to “trick” or “defeat” artificial intelligence systems. This kind of description really goes to the heart of how companies can truly monitor and evaluate artificial intelligence. One way to think about this is to apply the same kinds of ideas that programmers used in past times to debug linear code systems.
Debugging linear code systems was all about finding the spots where the system would work well – where a program would crash, where it would freeze, where it would run slow, etc. It was about finding where logical errors would halt or confound a project, where a function wouldn't work correctly, or where there might be some unintended user event.
When you think about it, modern testing of artificial intelligence may be a similar endeavor on a very different plane – because the artificial intelligence technologies are more cognitive than linear, that testing takes a much different form, but humans are still looking for “the bugs” – ways that these programs may have unintended consequences, ways that they might act out and harm human institutions, etc. With that in mind, although there are many different divergent methods of creating a speedometer or benchmark for artificial intelligence progress, the types of hard testing described above will generally give the humans unique insight into how far artificial intelligence has come, and what has to be done to keep it delivering more positives without developing more negatives.

In his article for the Digital Journal, Saratendu Sethi argues that to build a sustainable global supply chain requires the humanization of AI. This technological revolution, he says, includes “truly autonomous and self-correcting supply chains” that will replace the flawed capital-driven decision making of humans. Sethi defines this utilitarian mission of serving the “greater good” through what he calls a “sustainable, ethical and responsible world that puts equity for all at the center.” 
His motive of helping everyone while protecting the environment is commendable, yet the larger question remains, whose ethic will drive the logic used by this AI? When resources are limited, how will this AI decide who gets food and who gets medicine? Based on my own study, Sethi’s proposal for an ethical decision-making AI sounds eerily familiar to the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and there is a lesson we can learn here.
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
Eric Steinhart considers Pierre Teilhard de Chardin the first transhumanist thinker to give “serious consideration to the future of human evolution” through the use of genetic engineering and technologies to achieve a new cosmic-intelligence that would transcend humanity itself.[1] Teilhard crafted a new theology that was wholly dependent on Darwin’s evolutionary narrative that the cosmos — birthed in chaos — was steadily evolving toward eternal perfection. This perfection could only be achieved by tethering the current state of imperfect anthropology to the future hope of a perfect cosmic singularity. It must not be overlooked, however, that Teilhard’s method of transforming humanity was grounded in his commitment to eugenics. 
The eugenics movement in the early twentieth century employed techniques of population control such as oral contraception, social isolation, forced sterilization, welfare, abortion, and family planning to achieve the goal of genetic fitness for a superior human race. But for Teilhard, “eugenics applied to individuals leads to eugenics applied to society.”[2] Therefore Teilhard, like Sethi, reasoned that the future of human existence must be guided by the reasonable organization of the world’s limited resources.
Teilhard believed that industrialization had forced an overpopulation of the earth. On the brink of famine and suffocation, steps must be taken to ensure that the best of humanity survived. The challenge to build a better mankind, wrote Teilhard, demanded the use of, “individual eugenics (breeding and education designed to produce only the best individual types) and racial eugenics (the grouping or intermixing of different ethnic types being not left to chance but effected as a controlled process in the proportions most beneficial to humanity as a whole).”[3] While these methods involved both technological and psychological challenges, Teilhard believed that science, alongside his theology, would guide human evolution toward a better future. Yet, the moral duty of Teilhard’s transhumanism required a repudiation of the traditional Christian ethic that valued every individual human as created in the image of God. Society, he believed, must be willing to sacrifice the individual for the greater good of humanity and sustainability of nature.
I have no way of knowing if Sethi and Teilhard share the same ethic or anthropology, but without a doubt they share the utilitarian goal of a ‘sustainable’ future. This potential for disagreement on such basic questions about morality and human dignity, however, illustrates the problem with Sethi’s “greater good” AI. 
Whose ethic will drive the AI’s decision-making algorithms?When resources are limited, will atheist technicians decide who gets food and who does not?In the next pandemic when supplies run short, will agnostic philosophers decide who gets vaccinated and who does not? Will the AI control human populations based upon projections of biological survivability, statistical calculations of racial equity, or the nebulous criteria of sustainability?Will the “humanized AI” allow itself to be guided by religious moral codes, and if so, which ones will it choose? Or will religion, and maybe human existence itself, be rendered obsolete by these autonomous and self-correcting algorithms?
In contrast to Sethi’s utopian supply chain AI, I realize these questions sound alarmist. But this brief look at Teilhard’s willingness to sacrifice the weak for the greater good illustrates the importance of addressing these moral concerns. A clearly defined ethic that protects every human, and protects humans above animals, is fundamental to measuring the practicality of any AI tasked with the mission of replacing human intelligence, human morality, and human compassion.

Here are all five short essays in the series by J. R. Miller:
With transhumanism, what happens to human rights? The transhumanist accepts suffering for the individual if suffering can advance the evolution of the species toward immortality and singularity. If humans can redefine what it means to be human, what prevents us from eliminating anyone opposed to this grand vision? (January 1, 2022)
Eugenics, transhumanism, and artificial intelligence If we were to succeed at creating an ethical decision-making AI, whose ethics would it abide by? The utilitarian goal of a “sustainable future” must be guided by a higher ethic in order to avoid grave mistakes of the past. (January 13, 2022)
The deadly dream of Human+ Look at the price tag… Some are prepared to sacrifice actual humans now for the hope of future immortality. Without a fixed and final definition of human personhood, there is no foundation for a fixed and final ethic of “human” rights. (January 20, 2022)
Can Christian ethics save transhumanism? J. R. Miller looks at the idea that the mission to self-evolve through technology is “the definitive Christian commitment.” In Miller’s view, Christian transhumanists do not provide a stable and persistent definition of human personhood, thus cannot ground human rights. (February 27, 2022)
and
Why the imago Dei (Image of God) shuts the door on transhumanism. As the belief that technology promises us a glorious post-human future advances among scholar who profess Christianity, we must ask some hard questions. The mission to self-evolve beyond humanity begs the question, how is humanity “saved” through technological advancement designed to eliminate humanity? (March 20, 2022)

      U-Test harnesses social media, artificial intelligence, and geo-mapping to connect youth with  HIV information and services
  

UNICEF





 









UNICEF/UN0484580/Diarassouba

















12 January 2022







UNICEF’s U-Test initiative is re-imagining traditional approaches to HIV prevention. It uses the latest technology to provide young people with easy-to-understand information about HIV and AIDS while also linking them with support and care. The goal is to connect at-risk youth with testing and services that prevent the spread of HIV.
So how does it work? The U-Test initiative uses a combination of technology, artificial intelligence, and social media to inform and engage young people. By operating within the digital sphere, U-Test makes quick inroads with adolescents, who are encouraged to get tested for HIV. If needed, U-Test also connects them with support.
Specifically, algorithmic look-alike modelling—a form of artificial intelligence—identifies priority groups based on their characteristics. For example, the platform can group together young people from similar areas, with similar behaviours, or with similar interests. Social media is then used as a mitigation tool—WhatsApp, SMS, and Facebook campaigns deliver HIV prevention ads and messaging to the most at-risk groups. U-Test also gives these young people direct access to HIV information via an online portal.
In addition to sharing information and messaging, U-Test allows users to complete a straightforward, confidential self-screen questionnaire about HIV. This reduces stigma and allows young people to begin this journey in privacy. Those who are at the highest risk for HIV are linked with testing and encouraged to learn their HIV status. When appropriate, geolocalisation technology accurately maps healthcare options around them, connecting youth to the closest services. U-Test’s technology can also connect users with youth-friendly counseling and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, or PrEP, which has been shown to reduce HIV acquisition by up to 90 percent.
This targeted, technology-backed approach accurately finds and reaches young people at the most risk, improving efficiency when compared with traditional HIV outreach and engagement. The programme then takes these young people through a proven risk-reduction pathway, which follows an evidence-based package of combined prevention techniques. At the same time, U-Test provides UNICEF with custom, actionable insights—a valuable tool for health practitioners. It collects data in real time, enabling health interventions to become more closely tailored to users' specific needs and locations. This gives U-Test a distinct advantage, making it a powerful resource for precise, targeted programming.
U-Test is already creating impact in Côte d'Ivoire, where it has reached more than a million young people online  and  via  health facilitites. UNICEF worked with the government of Côte d’Ivoire to roll out the U-Test platform and, in total, 171 health providers were taught how to use digital technologies to link young people with HIV self-testing kits and PrEP. In just one year, more than 10,000 young Ivorians self-tested for HIV thanks to U-Test. The initiative had high uptake with first-time testers, likely because U-Test gave them confidentiality and flexibility regarding when and where they tested.

The government of Cote d’Ivoire is adopting U-Test approaches and integrating this innovation into strategy and policy documents across the country—another sign of the initiative’s success. Côte d'Ivoire, where only 50 percent of people living with HIV know their HIV status, was a logical place to pilot the U-Test model. But HIV reaches far beyond Côte d'Ivoire. In fact, more than 2.8 million children and adolescents were living with HIV in 2020. West and Central Africa bear the second highest global burden of HIV infections among adolescents at 25 percent. Many countries in the region—including Nigeria and Cameroon, which have similar statistics as Côte d’Ivoire—would be natural candidates for the U-Test platform. Both countries have the systems in place to quickly replicate the U-Test model and roll out UNICEF’s new approach to HIV prevention.
U-Test’s unique model—combining social media, digital outreach, and traditional HIV prevention methods—has the potential to reach millions. In addition to its youth-friendly approach, U-Test also adds accuracy and precision to HIV programming—targeting those at the highest risk. Through U-Test, UNICEF can help youth around the world learn about HIV and discover their HIV status.
U-test is part of the Maternal and Child Health Portfolio at UNICEF. The Global Innovation Portfolios align technical and financial resources to promising projects that can accelerate results for children in key focus areas, including Learning, Water and Sanitation, Climate Change, Gender Equality, Youth, Mental Health and Psychosocial Support, and Immunization. By bringing these proven solutions to more countries, UNICEF’s Office of Innovation strives to strategically and efficiently address some of the biggest challenges facing children.

Artificial intelligence (AI) computer scientist, Timnit Gebru, has just opened her own firm. This is particularly interesting because she made headlines for dramatically getting fired from Google, despite being one of their top researchers. The Verge reported that Google let go of Gebru following her publishing academic papers that denounced their AI work on large language models designed to help retrieve answers to controversial search inquiries. 
The situation became even more controversial due to the sustained campaign of aggressive tweets and emails that were launched her way after the termination. 
Now, her bittersweet story is hitting a high note. 
Her firm, DAIR (Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute), received $3.7 million in funding from the MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, Kapor Center, Open Society Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation.


“I’ve been frustrated for a long time about the incentive structures that we have in place and how none of them seem to be appropriate for the kind of work I want to do,” Gebru shared with the Washington Post.
The company’s focus will be recognizing harmful outcomes technology has on marginalized groups who encounter inordinate effects from AI structures but lack the access to governing its development, The Washington Post reported.  
She plans to partner with other independent firms like Data and Society, Algorithmic Justice League, and Data for Black Lives.
Gebru said she launched DAIR  to aim to “document harms and develop a vision for AI applications that can have a positive impact on the same groups.” The overall goal is to  influence AI policies and practices of Google and the like, while leaning on her expertise to alter AI facial recognition software that has been extremely biased toward BIPOC.

How do Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google, YouTube, and other platforms keep up with the millions upon millions of posts, comments, videos, and photos posted to their sites on a daily basis? It takes a partnership between artificial intelligence and human content moderators. 
In recent years, however, content moderators have begun to reveal that their work is often traumatizing. Moderators for Facebook and TikTok have gone so far as to sue for the psychological harm they have experienced at their workplaces, regularly reviewing images and videos that you and I never have to see depicting rape, murder, child trafficking, and other violent and graphic content.
Subjecting workers to violent and graphic imagery is an unsustainable way of keeping the internet free of such material. Will artificial intelligence reach a point where they can completely replace human content moderators?
According to Sarah T. Roberts, Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Studies at UCLA and the author of Behind the Screen: Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media, the answer is No:   
…if you talk to actual industry insiders who will speak candidly and who are actually working directly in this area, they will tell you that there is no time that they can envision taking humans entirely out of this loop. And I believe that to be true. …[W]e need human intelligence to train the machines right.Zachary Mack, “Why AI can’t fix content moderation” at The Verge
Facebook boasted in 2019 that its AI moderation systems successfully spotted 99.9% of spam, 99.3% of terrorist propaganda, 99.2% of child nudity and sexual exploitation, 98.9% of violent and graphic content, and 96.8% of adult nudity and sexual activity.
However, when it came to content involving drugs, firearms, hate speech, and bullying and harassment, Facebook’s AI performed far lower (at 83.3%, 69.9%, 65.4%, and 14.1%, respectively). 
Even with the content AI succeeds at spotting and removing, there are still questions of nuance. AI may be able to spot and remove nudity, but can it distinguish between lewd content to be removed and historical content to be preserved? (There’s a vast difference, for instance, between pornography and a Michelangelo painting).
The Transatlantic Working Group (TWG), a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, published a report in 2020 explaining the limits of artificial intelligence when it comes to content moderation. 
“Automation in content moderation,” they wrote, “…is neither reliable nor effective.”
TWG explained that AI fails to grasp the importance of context, that its system can be biased by the programmers who design it, and that it lacks the ability to comprehend the differences in languages and cultures.
Artificial intelligence has the potential to mistake an inappropriate post for an appropriate one, and vice versa. Humans are still necessary in the content moderation process to parse apart those nuanced and subjective images, videos, and posts that artificial intelligence might miss due to its lack of true human understanding.
Human content moderators are called upon to employ an array of very high level cognitive functions and cultural competencies to make decisions about the appropriateness of such content for a site or platform. So in order to do this, they must:be experts in matters of taste of the site’s presumed audience; have cultural knowledge about the location of origin of the platform and of the audience, both of which may be very far removed geographically and culturally from where the screening is actually taking place;have linguistic competency in the language of the UGC (that may be a learned or second language for the content moderator him or herself);steeped in the relevant laws governing the site’s location of origin and be experts in the user guidelines and other platform-level specifics concerning what is or what is not allowed all while being exposed constantly to the very material that mainstream sites disallow.re:publica 2016 – Sarah T. Roberts: Behind the Screen, May 3, 2016 on YouTube
And Brendan Dixon further points out that, 
Machine Learning-based AI is far, far from ready to successfully moderate content in an age of single point failure risks. As we’ve often discussed here at Mind Matters News, for example, image recognition AI is easily fooled. Language recognition systems get confused by statements that children understand. Systems intended to assist health care personnel don’t grasp or convey the significance of information when, in an emergency room, for example, there may be little time to lose.Brendan Dixon, “AI Is Not Ready to Moderate Content!” at Mind Matters News
Another notable concern is that artificial intelligence is unable to act as a whistleblower. Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen alerted the world this past summer that Facebook has been hiding blatant problems with its platforms. These problems include the proliferation of criminal activity on Facebook, declining teenage mental health due to the use of Instagram, and an algorithm that promotes incendiary content. Unethical practices and policies that need to change within Big Tech organizations like Facebook could easily be carried on without interference if humans were replaced by machines. Human workers offer a certain amount of accountability that cannot be found in robotic alternatives.
Artificial intelligence still works best as a tool working alongside humanity rather than as humanity’s replacement. To replace humans with artificial intelligence, especially in this particular sector, is still a long way off.

In case you missed it:
Social Media Content Moderator Sues TikTok for PTSD. Social media moderators protect users from graphic content, but who protects the moderators? Social media platforms hope that one day, AI will take the place of humans removing disturbing content from the internet. (Caitlin Bassett)
AI Is Not Ready to Moderate Content! In the face of COVID-19 quarantines for human moderators, some look to AI to keep the bad stuff off social media. Big social media companies have long wanted to replace human content moderators with AI. COVID-19 quarantines have only intensified that discussion. (Brendan Dixon)

New methods of artificial intelligence science are helping researchers to understand more about how the brain works – and in some cases, these scientists can actually intervene and push the brain to work differently.
If it sounds complicated, that's because it is. A Wired story introducing a University of Pennsylvania research project starts out by pointing out that the human brain is largely an unknown “black box” to scientists, and that there are significant barriers to affecting brain activity.
However, UPenn psychologist Michael Kahana and a team of scientists were able to utilize electrodes going into the brains of 25 epilepsy patients in order to start learning about how the brain works during memory.
It's significant that the team was able to do this by “piggybacking” on already existing infrastructure. (From the wording, it’s assumed that the group was able to use subjects who were already hooked up for more prosaic medical reasons.) As the article points out, it's pretty difficult to get buy-in from research subjects to put invasive technology into the brain.
The researchers started out by simply reading brain activity – specifically, in precise calculation of electrical activity inside the brain while people were in the process of learning and memorizing words.
After doing this for a while, and building up a substantial training set, the researchers were able to predict certain kinds of learning.
After the foundational research, scientists were eventually able to send electrical stimulation to the brain to assist in the process of memory.
When you talk about the use of electrical stimulation to help with memory, it sounds simple – but when you look more closely, everything is predicated on very high-tech methodologies and quite a lot of guesswork.
Without the initial machine learning that identified memory activity, the scientists wouldn't have had as good of an idea of how to electrically stimulate brains to promote good memory function.
Also, it's clear from reading about the study that the team doesn't know how the electrical stimulation is working – they just know that it is. In other words, the scientists are using the results of machine learning to fine-tune the system, without actually understanding the ins and outs of the brain function itself.
This intriguing example is perhaps one of the best examples of “hands-on” machine learning – here, the data is not just put into training sets to model more data. Here, the training set actually acts as a catalyst for specific experiments in bioinformatics, and the results are based on the calculations that machine learning programs made. It's a very interesting look into the synergy between artificial intelligence and our own human biological brains, and how the two are intersecting as we make rapid progress toward the “singularity” of Ray Kurzweil and other future outcomes.

Has Alexa replaced your kitchen timer? Do you rely on your car’s driver-assist features to regulate your distance from the car in front of you? Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have impacted us all, and the acceleration of digital transformation as a result of the pandemic is expected to continue.
McKinsey’s Global Institute predicts that while AI is being applied to business problems across nearly every sector of the global economy, the effects of AI applications will be felt most in marketing and sales. The research firm notes that AI could unlock as much as $2.6 trillion in business value within the sales and marketing sector.
Starbucks is a good example. Earlier this year, CEO Kevin Johnson, told analysts that the company is relying on AI technology predictions to determine how vaccination rates will impact sales growth.

As retailers like Starbucks begin to feel and assess the impact of AI in the marketplace, so will consumers and, by extension, PR and marketing.
We already use AI-powered tools like Google Analytics and Cision to make our work more efficient and effective. Ideally, technological innovation should reduce the burden of drudgery and elevate people’s work, enabling creativity. AI technologies have the ability to free PR professionals to focus more on creative pursuits like crafting compelling messaging or planning strategic media outreach.
Advances in sentiment analysis, predictive analytics, chatbots and natural language generation (NLG) are already having a direct impact on our industry. According to a recent blog published by Public Relations Today, here are some ways that AI is either helping support public relations activity now or will be in the near future:

Speech-to-text technology – This can assist with media interview transcripts and searching within podcasts or press conferences using speech-to-text technology.
AI-assisted contact recommendations – Though they haven’t been perfected yet, tools exist to proactively identify reporters who are writing about your industry, enabling you to target media most likely to cover your news, rather than manually building traditional media lists on categories and keyword searches.
Predictive analytics – Two PR tech startups focused on predictive analytics offer tools that help you customize story angles for journalists based on interests, past coverage, personalities and trends and predicting the probability of a journalist covering your story.
Video authenticity monitoring – There are even tools that can be used to monitor for “deepfake” videos that could negatively impact your client’s brand reputation.
Natural language generation – As evidenced by the first press release written by AI, machines can produce content using NLG, and translate it into multiple languages for broader distribution. These technologies require refinement, but they are developing quickly.
Sentiment analysis – Tools are also being developed to carry out advanced sentiment analysis on social media posts, media clippings and more.
Attribution for earned media – PR tech tools, like Cision Impact and Onclusive, even promise to attribute sales outcomes to earned media coverage if, for example, a prospective buyer reads an article about your client and then downloads a white paper. This technology is still in its infancy but could be a game changer for an industry hungry for an objective way to prove ROI.

All this potential is wildly exciting, but talk of digital transformation and machine learning inevitably leads to questions of obsolescence: Will AI eventually replace PR pros? A simple mindset shift can alleviate the worry. If we look for the ways technology can make us more effective by freeing us to come up with better ideas and affording us opportunities to explore those ideas, then we will rise with this wave of innovation rather than letting it overpower us.
Is your organization already utilizing AI? How do you plan to incorporate new technologies in the new year?

One Response to “7 ways artificial intelligence will change the game for PR pros”







 Ronald N Levy says: January 5, 2022 at 11:22 am

Artificial Intelligence in PR may never adequately neutralize Genuine Stupidity.
Even ultrabright CEOs can make genuinely stupid assumptions about PR.
ASSUMPTION:  The public’s top interest in Washington controversies about punishing a company is which outcome will be more fair.
PR WISDOM:  The public’s top consideration is likely to be not fairness for the company but which outcome will be better for the public.  If a proposal is to tax a big company more, millions of people may think good, we can use the money.   A proposal to break up a big company is more likely to win if the company allows the advantages of breakup to get more media coverage than “the peril of the alternative,” how the public would suffer.    
ASSUMPTION:  A congressional committee hearing is likely to be an unbiased inquiry.
PR WISDOM:  The majority party prefers an outcome good for that party.  Questions will aim at showing that a company or industry being investigated is guilty and the party in power is heroically trying to protect the public.  Legislators of each party know it’s great for fund-raising and re-election to look like a hero.
ASSUMPTION:  A CEO should feel safe in assuming the media will be satisfied by the answer, “I don’t know but we’re trying to gather the facts.”
PR WISDOM:  “A journalist may skeptically ask “you’re the CEO and you claim you don’t KNOW?”
ASSUMPTION:  A glib CEO is as safe a spokesman as an equally glib PR firm SVP.
PR WISDOM:  When a spokesman blunders as may happen to almost anyone,
it’s easier and often less damaging to fire the PR firm than to fire  the CEO.
ASSUMPTION:  When accused it makes sense to apologize early and emphatically.
PR WISDOM:  Millions of people may see an apology as an admission of guilt
so it may be better to point out that just the opposite is true, that the company is in many ways making things BETTER for the public, not worse.
ASSUMPTION:  The outcome of a controversy will depend mainly on which side makes the more persuasive case to the public.
PR WISDOM:  The outcome will depend largely on the “magnitude of peril” principle of PR—the side likely to win is the side that that credibly forecasts the bigger or sooner damage to the public.  In the coming election, one side may credibly argue which party was more responsible for the January 6th riot.  But if the other party credibly argues “we’re better for your safety, your standard of living and your freedoms,” PR experts can guess which side is more likely to win.  
ASSUMPTION:  The #1 question in PR is “what should we say?”
PR WISDOM:  The #1 question is “what should we BE?”  If you get 100 million or more Americans to see the company correctly as not only beneficial but damn near a blessing to the public, the company is likely to be safer in Washington and to have higher sales.  
“What’s love got to do with it” sang hugely popular Tina Turner.  PR wisdom is “almost everything.”

“Our consciousness is everything. You become what you think about.” Buddha
In the few minutes that you are reading this article, I will tell you about a completely new type of artificial intelligence, I will name the design features and advantages, I will outline the immediate prospects and possible long-term consequences of the introduction of this technology into real life. Together we will touch the future.
This article is the fourth in a series on the nature of human intelligence and the future of artificial intelligence systems. In the previous article, “The secret of human intelligence,” we found out that human intelligence can work as a classical binary system-symbiosis, functioning due to the structural features of transmembrane proteins in ion channels of brain synapses.
At first glance, it might seem that this new and generally extraordinary neurophysiological concept is of interest only to doctors and biologists. But in fact, this idea from the world of neurophysiology opens the opportunity for us to create a very unusual artificial intelligence.

A new type of AI: technological symbiosis against traditional electronic systems
The existing systems of artificial intelligence, with all their features, have one thing in common: they are all built as single vertically controlled electronic complexes that operate using algorithms of varying complexity. Centralized control is an irresistible property of any man-made electronic computing system. We simply do not know how to build otherwise.
But what if we replicate the maneuver of nature and instead of the next modernization of the vertically integrated electronic system, we follow the path of unification to create a technological symbiosis of the human brain and the computer system?
If nature, the creation of our mind went along the path of symbiosis (combining the reflexive and intellectual components). And perhaps this is the shortest and most effective method of modernizing intelligent systems.
New AI system for one user
A new type of artificial intelligence will become a bioelectronic hybrid, in which a living human brain and a machine will work together in a dual complementary system. Both components will complement and reinforce each other, creating something completely new that neither nature nor designers of fully electronic systems have encountered before.
We will get acquainted with a new type of artificial intelligence of an individual type, built around a neurocomputer interface that directly connects the neurons of the human brain and a computer.
The heart of the system, or how will the neurocomputer interface work?
Despite the mesmerizing prospects of this direction, there have been only a few attempts in the world to create an interface connecting the human brain and a computer directly. One of the most famous was Elon Musk’s Neuralink. The weakness of these projects is that they follow the traditional surgical pathway and, as a result, fail to overcome two fundamental obstacles.
The first obstacle is the inaccuracy of individual interpretation of local foci of brain activity. Simply put, the brain of each of us is to a certain extent unique, if we talk about which groups of neurons are responsible for specific functions. But this is still half the trouble. Worse is that, thanks to plasticity, the detailed picture of brain activity is constantly changing.
The second, and truth be told, the main obstacle is the signal crossover point. Basically, this is where the artificial electronic signal becomes a biological nerve impulse and vice versa.
New circuit or how to get rid of wires and surgeons

In the new artificial intelligence system, the transmitting and receiving parts of the neurocomputer interface will be completely separated and, in fact, will be two completely different communication mechanisms.
From biological tissue to computer
The receiving part (responsible for receiving a signal from biological tissue) will be a network of inactive marker objects (ultra-small nano-sized beacons integrated into living tissue) whose state will be remotely monitored by an active external component of the system (scanner). A marker object is a biologically neutral molecular structure (in the field of view of an external scanner), which changes its conformational state in the presence of a nearby weak electrical charge (a neuron at the stage of pulse generation). This technological technique will allow replacing the direct transmission of a signal from living neurons to a computer system for the transmission of information about the existence of such a signal. This will turn the receiving part of the neurocomputer interface into a non-invasive (non-traumatic) mechanism. In such a scheme, there is no need to do expensive surgical procedures, and molecular markers can be injected into the body using a simple intravenous injection.
From machine to biological tissue
The transmitting part (on the way from the computer to the biological tissue) will remotely transmit the signal only to synapses, and not to neurons, as they are trying to do now. The transmitting part of the interface will use marker objects (beacons of the receiving part) as points of orientation in space (addresses of neurons) and sources of feedback.
Interestingly, the signal that will only be transmitted to synapses must be of a non-electrical nature. This will allow us to generate an artificial signal (nerve impulse) in the neurons of the brain that is completely identical to the physiological one. As a result, the neurons of the human brain will experience stimulation of synaptic plasticity and, as a result, they themselves will actively participate in the formation of lines of dynamic interaction with the transmitting part of the neurocomputer interface. The brain tissue itself will build a connection with the transmitting structure of the interface.
In addition, to install such an interface, a person will not need to use the services of highly qualified medical personnel, which will make the system convenient for most users.
What does the movie Matrix have in common with the new AI
It is important to understand that the described scheme will allow controlled excitation and monitoring of the response of a single neuron. This discreteness means that the bandwidth of the interface will be enough to transmit directly to the human brain an artificial reality that is completely indistinguishable from physiological. You will be able not only to see, hear and feel the artificial reality but also actively move in it in the same way as in the real physical world.
Instead of words and letters – only a nervous impulse
Thanks to the new type of neurocomputer interface, the brain and the computer will be able to exchange data directly, without using intermediate communication protocols like sound commands or letter symbols. The brain and the computer will exchange information using a set of impulses of immediate meaning, without symbolic interpretation. As a result, interacting with a machine will feel more like working with intuition than interacting with an electronic device. Mutual adaptation of components (brain and machine) will take quite a long time (from several months to a year), but it will allow ignoring the language barrier and even literacy. Unlike modern computers, even a person who cannot read and write can use the new personal AI system.
Not just an interface
The neurocomputer interface, although the most important part of the complex, is not the only feature of the new artificial intelligence system. When we say a machine or an electronic component of symbiosis, we are talking about a software package that bears little resemblance to traditional artificial intelligence systems.
The core of the electronic part of the new system will be a rather unusual program that works based on direct streaming communication of templates (pre-prepared answers). Since this program will not actually do any calculations, the core of the system will be able to maintain tremendous performance that allows it to create a gigantic volume of data exchange required for synaptic discreteness. Other components of the software package will be enhanced deep learning utilities that do not directly participate in the dialogue with the biological tissue of the brain but provide service and individual adaptation of the core streaming program.
Artificial intelligence of a new type will be individual not only because it will be designed to work with one user, but also because it itself will be the result of direct adaptive interaction of the learning software package with the living brain of a particular person.
In fact, the machine, gradually adopting the behavioral habits of a particular person, will become its artificial reflex (unconscious) part, while the biological brain getting used to the machine (with the help of synaptic plasticity) will increasingly rely on the strength and capabilities of the computer system. In general, thanks to the imperceptible, but constant work of the neurocomputer interface, we will see how a biotechnological neurocomputer symbiosis is formed: a new type of artificial intelligence.
The magic of emergence

Creating artificial intelligence by combining fundamentally different elements (biological tissues and an electronic system), we will be able to achieve the maximum effect of emergence (the birth of new properties that are not inherent in the combined elements separately).
Biotechnological symbiosis will have properties unattainable for a biological brain and a computer system separately.
The human brain is very slow and frankly weak in terms of information processing, an intelligent mechanism, but the biological system has plasticity, creativity, and energy efficiency unattainable for electronic systems. Plus, the living brain is a very experienced tactician who knows very well how the reality of the surrounding three-dimensional space works.
On the other hand, computer systems not only process information faster than us, in fact, in terms of signal transmission speed, they exceed biological tissue by 3 million times! Add to this a digital memory capable of clearly and without failures to manipulate an unimaginable amount of digital data and the ability to easily enter direct communication with any technical device or the Internet.
All this suggests that combining the human brain and computer system into a single complex of artificial intelligence will not only increase their overall efficiency but will create a completely new unusual system: a new type of artificial intelligence.
By combining the brain and the machine, we will see how the real magic of new properties is born: the magic of emergence.
Why is such a system needed right now?
The main reason is the monstrous information explosion. Today, the amount of digital data on the Internet is doubling every 18 months. During the period from 1997 to 2002, mankind produced more information than in the entire previous history.
Now the same amount of data is generated in just a few months. Humanity as a consumer of information is catastrophically lagging itself, and this imbalance is growing literally every minute.
In fact, a person now needs no new information as a product but help in the conditional “digestion” of this product
It is this fact that opens a window of opportunity for new technology. Your personal artificial intelligence system will give you the ability to analyze the entire array of information available on the Internet, and not just what is on the first page of Google search results.
The growing volume of information that humanity creates will make it possible to create millions of IAIs (individual artificial intelligence systems) with ever-increasing performance.
The information consumption of a person equipped with his own AI will be thousands of times greater than the traditional information consumption based on biological (sign or acoustic) communication systems.
Your own artificial intelligence—not only new opportunities for searching the web…
This article is not just about a new system, we are talking about a fundamentally different concept of artificial intelligence (AI). Your individual artificial intelligence system will know you, your personality, your requests, and preferences more accurately and clearly than you, it will be a part of you and at the same time your creation and extension: your digital shadow.
Man will become a living being of a new type
After 5-10 years of coexistence, the complementarity of AI components (brain and computer system) will reach such a level that several complex behavioral and communicative complexes (such as mechanical work or driving a car) can be carried out by the system reflexively (automatically). As a result, a person will be able to perform a huge number of routine actions without straining at all.
The economic business landscape is changing beyond recognition
A personal artificial intelligence system will replace a computer, smartphone, autopilot in a car, and much more. Any human skill and knowledge will become available for purchase or sale in a few minutes on the Internet. The painstaking and exhausting training we are accustomed to will gradually become unnecessary. Most disabilities will lose their limiting component.
Instead of an epilogue
Describing the properties of the new system, I understand that many people find it difficult to believe in the reality of such a technology. But in fact, behind this concept is a huge amount of scientific work done at the end of the last century. Over the past two decades, I have been able to piece together all the details of this extremely complex interdisciplinary project and, based on new data, find solutions for previously unrealizable structural elements.
I understand that the traditional model of neurocomputer interface based on surgical implantation is simpler and more understandable than the idea of ​​using molecular beacons and transmembrane proteins at synapses. But I do not lose hope and continue to look for an opportunity to translate the unthinkable into reality.
Everyone expects a strong AI to be built by an engineer, but in reality, a doctor might be standing at the cradle of real AI.

 Previous articleHow open data servers help optimize performance in fintech?Next articleReinforcement learning for the real world Alex KostikovI am a doctor and an independent researcher. For almost 30 years I have been creating the concept of individual artificial intelligence based on the integration of the human brain and a computer system into a single functional complex united using a scanning-type brain-computer interface. The concept of individual artificial intelligence developed by me is based on the hypothesis of the existence of a dual system of initiation of nerve impulses in the synapses of the human neocortex and the dynamic concept of quantum spin in a new relativistic or high-speed model of our three-dimensional space.
To be honest, I've been doing this all my life.
This is not just a new invention or a new scientific idea. In fact, this is a new reality that is already on our doorstep and will soon change the life of every person.

The tiny android performs when a handler (who must also hold the mic) presses a button, then tells the same jokes in the same order, like a grizzled veteran comic at a down-market Vegas casino.But the robot’s act is more human than it might first appear. Jon is learning how to respond to its audience—it can now vary the timing of its delivery based on the length of the audience’s laughter, and append different responses to jokes based on the level of noise in the room. It can deliver one line if a joke gets a roar of laughter (“Please tell the booking agents how funny that joke was”) and another if there are crickets (“Sorry about that. I think I got caught in a loop. Please tell the booking agents that you like me … that you like me … that you like me”).The prospect of an AI that understands why we are laughing, and that can generate its own genuinely funny material, is sort of a holy grail for a subset of AI researchers. Artificial intelligence can diagnose tumors, read maps and play games, often faster and with more accuracy than humans can.For the moment, however, linguistic humor is still primarily a people thing. Jon can work blue, with a whole bit on robot dating that involves cryptic texts, encrypted text, and the eggplant emoji—but only because a human has written and programmed a set list for it. Finding a way to teach machines to be funny on their own would be a major breakthrough—one that could fundamentally reshape the way we relate to the devices around us. To understand a person’s humor is to know what they like, how they think and how they see the world. An AI that understands all that has the power to do a lot more than just crack jokes.The first step is to attempt to break down the nuts and bolts of human humor. Machines learn by taking vast amounts of data and feeding it through algorithms—in other words, formulas or detailed sets of instructions—in search of patterns or unique features. This process works when it comes to, say, identifying the difference between photos of dogs and photos of cars, but it can effectively destroy a joke, deconstructing it in a painfully unfunny operation. “Explanations are to jokes what autopsies are to bodies: if the subject isn’t already dead, it soon will be,” wrote University College Dublin associate professor Tony Veale in his recent book Your Wit Is My Command: Building AIs With a Sense of Humor.Humans have vast mental libraries of cultural references and linguistic nuances to draw upon when hearing or telling a joke. AI has access only to the information that humans choose to give it, which means that if we want an AI to make us laugh, we have to be clear about the kind of humor we want to teach it.More from TIMETIME Covers of 2021: The Year Inside the Red BorderMore Videos0 seconds of 6 minutes, 44 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9

Live00:0006:4406:44 Read more: An Artificial Intelligence Helped Write This Play. It May Contain RacismOne theory of humor is that the degree to which we find something funny matches the degree to which a joke’s punch line deviates from the listener’s unconscious expectation. Thomas Winters, a doctoral student in artificial intelligence at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, uses this one as a case study: Two fish are in a tank. Says one to the other: “You man the guns, I’ll drive.”“In the beginning, you see this aquarium, this water tank. But then you hear ‘You man the guns, I’ll drive,’ and you’re like, Well, aquariums generally don’t have weaponry or wheels or drivability,” Winters says, in a heroic effort to parse the mechanics of a fish joke. “This mental jump from one interpretation to another one is something that most jokes or things we find funny have.”Jon the Robot and Naomi Fitter perform onstage at the Majestic Theater in Corvallis, Ore., in October 2019Courtesy Naomi FitterFollowing a formula is something AI is exceptionally good at. So are a lot of successful comedy writers.Joe Toplyn broke into comedy in the 1980s, when a friend from the Harvard Lampoon tipped him off that a writing job was opening up at David Letterman’s late-night show. He sent in some jokes—a bit about a periscope–enabled refrigerator made it onto the air—and landed the job. He spent the better part of the next two decades writing for comedy and talk shows, racking up four Emmy awards and head-writer credits at both The Late Show With David Letterman and The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.In 2014 Toplyn published Comedy Writing for Late-Night TV: How to Write Monologue Jokes, Desk Pieces, Sketches, Parodies, Audience Pieces, Remotes, and Other Short-Form Comedy. The book is a distillation of a course he taught in New York City after scrutinizing decades of monologues and reverse engineering the most successful jokes.Toplyn isn’t precious about comedy writing: it’s a job, one that a person can learn to do well if given the right inputs. The jokes that got the biggest laughs for Leno and Letterman follow identifiable formulas populated with “handles”—people, places, things and other references—each with a variety of related associations that can be combined to form a punch line. Given enough time and data, he realized, a computer could potentially learn to make these jokes too.Earlier this year, at the International Conference on Computational Creativity, Toplyn presented a research paper outlining Witscript, a joke–generation system trained on a data set of TV–monologue jokes that detects keywords in entered text and creates a relevant punch line. Unlike other forms of robot comedy, the system—which Toplyn has patented—can generate contextually relevant jokes on the spot in response to a user’s text. A chatbot or voice assistant enabled with the software can respond with humor to users’ queries (when appropriate) without derailing the interaction.Toplyn sees Witscript as an extension of the work he did for decades in late-night TV: making people laugh, and therefore making them feel less alone.“That’s basically the goal,” Toplyn says. “It’s to make chatbots more humanlike, so people will be less lonely.”Very few professionals love the idea that a computer can reliably do their jobs. Comedy writers are no different. When Winters posted a joke—writing software prototype to a Reddit forum for stand-up comics, he got some colorfully worded responses insisting that no machine could replicate the nuance of human comedy.Toplyn counters that critics overlook how much communication follows simple formulas, even the funny kind. “Rodney Dangerfield: ‘I get no respect.’ That’s a formula. Or Jeff Foxworthy: ‘You may be a redneck if.’ There are plenty of formulas in comedy, and some of them are right on the surface,” Toplyn says.There are, obviously, people who do not laugh at the comedy of Jeff Foxworthy, or the light topical banter of a late-night talk show. A separate camp argues that the better use of artificial intelligence in comedy and the arts is as sort of an infinite idea generator freed from the blinders and biases of human thinking, one that can toss up endless themes and potential associations that human writers and performers can run with themselves.Read more: Artificial Intelligence Has a Problem With Gender and Racial Bias. Here’s How to Solve ItPiotr Mirowski was working as a search engineer at Bing when he noticed the similarities between his day job and his personal passion, improv. The principle of search engineering is to teach the computer how to identify the best result for a given query. In improv, Mirowski says, performers are also trained to follow their instincts and do what feels best in that scene. It’s not always perfect, and the results sometimes have a hilarious absurdity, as anyone who has started typing a Google query with the predictive search feature on knows. Mirowski co-founded Improbotics, an international improv troupe that works alongside an AI that tosses out prompts and lines that human performers have to work into the show.“I don’t think it’s really possible to build a true AI-based comedy that relies on understanding the emotions of another person or the context,” he says. “What we can do is to bring that into life ourselves.”Improv comedians often draw upon cues shouted out from the audience. An AI can draw upon ideas from all over the world and across history. The goal isn’t to build a thing that will make the laughs for us, Mirowski says, but instead one that can help humans find new things to laugh about. As with any new technology, its power will come from the way users choose to interact with it, with results that no one may yet have imagined.“I see what we’re doing as kind of like building the electric guitar. It’s not very clear how to play it or what it’s going to do, and it sounds really weird and distorted and there are enough acoustic guitars anyway,” says Kory Mathewson, Improbotics co-founder and cast member and a Montreal-based research scientist with DeepMind. “Then Jimi Hendrix gets an electric guitar, and it’s like, ‘Oh. That’s what this is about.’”On the flip side, of course, a tool with the power to influence and entertain can also be used to exploit. Understanding someone’s sense of humor is a window into how they see the world, what their preferences are, maybe even where they are vulnerable. It’s not a power that people are entirely comfortable with computers having.In one 2019 study, researchers recruited pairs of people who already knew each other as friends, romantic partners or family members. They gave participants a list of jokes and asked them to choose which ones their friend or partner would find funny, based on a limited sample of the person’s responses to other jokes. They had computers guess the same thing, based on the same data, then showed the list to the buddy so that they could verify which gags they liked. The machines predicted people’s favorite jokes more accurately than their friends or partners did.The computers performed better than humans at guessing which jokes a participant would like in a second experiment as well. But in this one, people liked the recommended jokes less if they thought they came from a machine. They didn’t trust them. Other studies have also found that people rate humor as one of the tasks they trust humans with far more than AI, along with writing news articles, composing songs and driving trucks (all of which AI has some success in doing). Jokes are about a shared view of the world, a willingness to violate the same norms and laugh at the same things. We know what it means when a friend sends something along and says, “I thought you’d find this funny.” What’s a robot getting at when it does the same thing? And who ultimately benefits if its humor wins us over?There’s a common saying that robots should do the jobs that are too dirty, dangerous or dull for humans. Comedy can be all of those things, but we still want it for ourselves.As for Jon the Robot, its live appearances have so far been limited to a series of pre-pandemic shows. The act is not at the point where it might threaten the livelihood of Netflix-special-level comedians—yet. Before powering down, Jon always signs off with the same line: “If you like me, please book me and help me take your jobs.”",https://schema.org,VideoObject,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6132544/artificial-intelligence-humor/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,,,,,TIME Covers of 2021: The Year Inside the Red Border,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/zZq2Xa5Z/poster.jpg?width=720,,2021-12-13T12:52:00.000Z,PT6M44S,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/zZq2Xa5Z.m3u8,https://time.com/6132544/artificial-intelligence-humor/,,,,,,,,,,

Trend 1: Ubiquitous computing

These days, computers are all around us: in our pockets, on our wrists, in our cars, even in our household appliances…

As processing power has increased and the size of computer microchips has shrunk, we’ve quickly become used to computers and devices getting smaller, lighter, cheaper, more powerful, and more ubiquitous. (As an example, the average smartphone today is more powerful than the supercomputers of 10 years ago.) Looking ahead, probably the next big leap in computing power will come from quantum computers – computers that are so fast and powerful, they could be used to complete new, previously impossible tasks that traditional computers aren’t capable of.

Trend 2: Connected and smart everything
No doubt you’re familiar with the Internet of Things (IoT) from devices like smart TVs, smartwatches, and smart thermostats. The IoT refers to the increasing number of intelligent, connected devices and objects that are capable of gathering and transmitting data.
In the future, anything that can be connected, will be. Not just in terms of devices and products – although that is obviously a key consideration for businesses – but also the spaces in which we live and work. From smart, connected factories and offices to entire smart cities, the spaces around us will increasingly be equipped with the ability to monitor what’s going on and act accordingly.

Trend 3: The datafication of our world
Ubiquitous computing and the IoT are both huge contributors to the sheer volume of data that’s being generated on a daily basis. But alongside this machine-generated data, we humans are also generating masses of data through our daily activities, and this shows no signs of slowing down.

The good news is businesses can use this data to design better products and services, improve business processes, enhance decision making and even create new revenue sources. But businesses must also be aware of the risks posed by data, particularly around data privacy and security.

Trend 4: Artificial intelligence (AI)
All that data being generated is a core enabler for AI, which has made incredible leaps in the last few years, particularly when it comes to “conversational AI.” In 2020 alone, smart speakers answered 100 billion voice commands – 75 percent more than in 2019 – all thanks to AI.
The takeaway for businesses is that, as our interactions with machines become increasingly intelligent, customers will expect all manner of products and services to feature some sort of AI capability.
Trend 5: Extended Reality (XR)
XR is an umbrella term representing the spectrum of immersive technologies: virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality.
XR was primarily known for immersive gaming, but nowadays, it is deployed across a wide range of industries, where it is being used to create more immersive, personalized experiences for customers and employees. For example, customers can now try out products virtually – such as digitally placing a new sofa in their living room to see how it looks – and employees can learn in immersive, interesting new ways.
In the future, I believe our experience of the world will increasingly take place in this blurred space between the real world and the digital one, and XR is only going to accelerate this shift. Companies must therefore begin to consider how they will accommodate this, and create immersive experiences for their customers and employees.
Trend 6: Digital trust
Digital trust is essentially the confidence users place in organizations to build a secure digital world, where transactions and interactions can take place safely, securely, and easily.
Many – myself included – believe blockchain and distributed ledger technology will play a central role in raising digital trust and making interactions more secure. That said, the technology has some way to go before it’s truly accessible for all types of organizations. For many businesses, the answer may lie in partnering with the many new innovators and entrepreneurs who are making real headway in the blockchain space.
Trend 7: 3D printing
These days, the materials used for 3D printing can be pretty much anything: plastic, metal, powder, concrete, liquid, even chocolate. Entire houses can now be 3D printed.
This has the potential to transform manufacturing. In short, 3D printing gives manufacturers the ability to make things that can’t easily be produced with traditional methods, to streamline the manufacturing process, and create highly personalized products (even completely unique one-offs), all while eliminating waste and reducing costs.
Trend 8: Gene-editing and synthetic biology
Gene editing can have particular advantages when “bad” genes are detected – genes that could endanger the health of an organism or its descendants. Thanks to new gene-editing technology, these harmful characteristics can, in theory, be altered. In this way, gene editing could deliver some drastic leaps forward in the fight against disease – in humans, animals, and crops.
While gene-editing tools can be used to make small changes to DNA, synthetic biology can involve stitching together long strands of DNA and inserting them into an organism. As a result, the organism may behave differently or have entirely new abilities.
What’s this got to do with businesses? I believe synthetic biology and gene editing may drastically alter the way we produce products. Think of exciting new products such as cultured meat, and it’s easy to see how transformative these technologies could be.
Trend 9: Nanotechnology and materials science
Materials science (the discipline of studying and manipulating materials) and nanotechnology (the science of controlling matter on a tiny scale, at the atomic and molecular level) have already given us some incredible advances, from tiny computer chips, smartphone displays, and lithium-ion batteries, to stain-resistant fabrics.
Looking ahead, this trend could deliver major breakthroughs in electric car batteries, make solar energy more affordable, and deliver other advances that will make the world a better place.
Trend 10: New energy solutions
Nuclear fusion is often touted as the clean and potentially inexhaustible energy solution for the future, but there’s a problem – maintaining a fusion reaction takes more energy than it produces! But now, thanks to advances in magnet technology, we may see a nuclear fusion reactor deliver a net power output by 2035.
Another exciting zero-carbon energy solution is green hydrogen (which is different from traditional ""grey hydrogen"" production). With green hydrogen, water is split into hydrogen and water, without creating any byproducts, through a process of electrolysis. Historically, this process took so much electricity; green hydrogen was basically unfeasible. But renewable electricity sources may change this. For example, as excess renewable electricity is becoming available on the grid, that excess energy could, in theory, be used to drive the electrolysis of water.
The key lesson from all these trends is we’re entering an era of continual and rapid evolution, where multiple tech trends combine and feed into each other to deliver huge changes. For businesses, this means the days of incremental tech upgrades are gone forever. Continual change is the way of the future.

Will Artificial Intelligence Take Over Your Job in 2022?







Zia Muhammad


1/01/2022 06:30:00 PM









We have been worried about artificial intelligence (AI) and other kinds of robots taking over our jobs for quite some time now. Techno paranoia is by no means a new phenomenon, and it manifests itself in a wide range of ways including situations where people will be concerned about the impact that automation might have on their careers. With the new year right around the corner, what are the chances that AI might make you unemployed in 2022? People’s opinions on this are quite varied.The group that is perhaps most fearful of losing their jobs to an AI based program is that of college graduates. Over 69% of people that have completed a college degree fear that they might not be able to get a job or that AI will make their job more or less redundant in the coming years since it would more than likely be able to do whatever job they can handle in a much more efficient manner and they would cost a lot less too. If you look at all of the respondents to the survey as a whole, you would notice that the average is around 55% for people that are afraid to losing jobs to AI. Hence, college graduates seem to be disproportionately worried about this sort of thing occurring with all things having been considered and taken into account. However, if we were to break down the responses and sort them out by the category of job that we are looking at, it becomes clear that virtually everyone is fearful of the impact of AI. For example, about 63% of respondents felt that the role of cashiers will be fulfilled by AI in the coming years. This has already started to occur, with Amazon creating stores that you can walk in and out of and your payment will be automatically calculated and deducted from your bank account or some other source of funds. The practicality of such a setup is yet to be tested, but suffice it to say that it already exists in the modern day and many fast food companies are experimenting with this as well. 52% of respondents also said that they felt that the jobs of drivers could be automated and made redundant. This might have something or the other to do with the rise of driverless cars which use a computer program and an algorithm to make it so that you don’t have to take the wheel. While these types of cars still have a long way to go before they can become the global standard, they have been getting better on a regular basis and might make traffic jams less prevalent than they are right now. With all of that having been said and now out of the way, it is important to note that not all of the views that people have about AI are negative. If we were to take the example of the economy, around 45% of respondents felt that AI could do a lot of good in this regard. These respondents felt that if AI were made responsible for things like fiscal policy and the like it could reduce the prevalence of corruption and create a smoother type of system for everyone to enjoy. However, that doesn’t mean that everyone agrees that this is a good idea. 29% of respondents felt that doing so would be disastrous for the economy, but a plurality appear to think otherwise. The fact of the matter is that opinions regarding AI are mixed, but this has absolutely no impact on its growth this year. It will continue to grow in 2022 and the changes that are coming would need to be dealt with as and when they arrive so that people can get accustomed to a new way of living.

Given China’s track record of leveraging AI for mass surveillance, it’s tempting to view these initiatives as little more than a fig leaf to cover widespread abuses of human rights. But that response risks ignoring regulatory changes with major implications for global AI development and national security. Anyone who wants to compete against, cooperate with, or simply understand China’s AI ecosystem must examine these moves closely.
These recent initiatives show the emergence of three different approaches to AI governance, each championed by a different branch of the Chinese bureaucracy, and each at a different level of maturity. Their backers also pack very different bureaucratic punches. It’s worth examining the three approaches and their backers, along with how they will both complement and compete with each other, to better understand where China’s AI governance is heading.



Three Approaches to Chinese AI Governance


Organization
Focus of Approach
Relevant Documents




Cyberspace Administration of China
Rules for online algorithms, with a focus on public opinion
- Internet Information Service Algorithmic Recommendation Management Provisions
			- Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Overall Governance of Internet Information Service Algorithms

			- Trustworthy Facial Recognition Applications and Protections Plan


Ministry of Science and Technology
Establishing AI ethics principles and creating tech ethics review boards within companies and research institutions
- Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Ethical Governance of Science and Technology
			- Ethical Norms for New Generation Artificial Intelligence



The strongest and most immediately influential moves in AI governance have been made by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), a relatively new but very powerful regulator that writes the rules governing certain applications of AI. The CAC’s approach is the most mature, the most rule-based, and the most concerned with AI’s role in disseminating information.
The CAC made headlines in August 2021 when it released a draft set of thirty rules for regulating internet recommendation algorithms, the software powering everything from TikTok to news apps and search engines. Some of those rules are China-specific, such as the one stipulating that recommendation algorithms “vigorously disseminate positive energy.” But other provisions break ground in ongoing international debates, such as the requirement that algorithm providers be able to “give an explanation” and “remedy” situations in which algorithms have infringed on user rights and interests. If put into practice, these types of provisions could spur Chinese companies to experiment with new kinds of disclosure and methods for algorithmic interpretability, an emerging but very immature area of machine learning research.
Soon after releasing its recommendation algorithm rules, the CAC came out with a much more ambitious effort: a three-year road map for governing all internet algorithms. Following through on that road map will require input from many of the nine regulators that co-signed the project, including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).
The second approach to AI governance has emerged out of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), an influential think tank under the MIIT. Active in policy formulation and many aspects of technology testing and certification, the CAICT has distinguished its method through a focus on creating the tools for measuring and testing AI systems. This work remains in its infancy, both from technical and regulatory perspectives. But if successful, it could lay the foundations for China’s larger AI governance regime, ensuring that deployed systems are robust, reliable, and controllable.
In July 2021, the CAICT teamed up with a research lab at the Chinese e-commerce giant JD to release the country’s first white paper on “trustworthy AI.” Already popular in European and U.S. discussions, trustworthy AI refers to many of the more technical aspects of AI governance, such as testing systems for robustness, bias, and explainability. The way the CAICT defines trustworthy AI in its core principles looks very similar to the definitions that have come out of U.S. and European institutions, but the paper was notable for how quickly those principles are being converted into concrete action.
The CAICT is working with China’s AI Industry Alliance, a government-sponsored industry body, to test and certify different kinds of AI systems. In November 2021, it issued its first batch of trustworthy AI certifications for facial recognition systems. Depending on the technical rigor of implementation, these types of certifications could help accelerate progress on algorithmic interpretability—or they could simply turn into a form of bureaucratic rent seeking. On policy impact, the CAICT is often viewed as representing the views of the powerful MIIT, but the MIIT’s leadership has yet to issue its own policy documents on trustworthy AI. Whether it does will be a strong indicator of the bureaucratic momentum behind this approach.
Finally, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) has taken the lightest of the three approaches to AI governance. Its highest-profile publications have focused on laying down ethical guidelines, relying on companies and researchers to supervise themselves in applying those principles to their work.
In July 2021, MOST published guidelines that called for universities, labs, and companies to set up internal review committees to oversee and adjudicate technology ethics issues. Two months later, the main AI expert committee operating under MOST released its own set of ethical norms for AI, with a special focus on weaving ethics into the entire life cycle of development. Since then, MOST has been encouraging leading tech companies to establish their own ethics review committees and audit their own products.
MOST’s approach is similar to those of international organizations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which have released AI principles and encouraged countries and companies to adopt them. But in the Chinese context, that tactic feels quite out of step with the country’s increasingly hands-on approach to technology governance, a disconnect that could undermine the impact of MOST’s efforts.
One unanswered question is how these three approaches will fit together. Chinese ministries and administrative bodies are notoriously competitive with one another, constantly jostling to get their pet initiatives in front of the country’s central leadership in hopes that they become the chosen policies of the party-state. In this contest, the CAC’s approach appears to have the clear upper hand: It is the most mature, the most in tune with the regulatory zeitgeist, and it comes from the organization with the most bureaucratic heft. But its approach can’t succeed entirely on its own. The CAC requires that companies be able to explain how their recommendation algorithms function, and the tools or certifications for what constitutes explainable AI are likely to come from the CAICT. In addition, given the sprawling and rapidly evolving nature of the technology, many practical aspects of trustworthy AI will first surface in the MOST-inspired ethics committees of individual companies.
The three-year road map for algorithmic governance offers a glimpse of some bureaucratic collaboration. Though the CAC is clearly the lead author, the document includes new references to algorithms being trustworthy and to companies setting up ethics review committees, additions likely made at the behest of the other two ministries. There may also be substantial shifts in bureaucratic power as AI governance expands to cover many industrial and social applications of AI. The CAC is traditionally an internet-focused regulator, and future regulations for autonomous vehicles or medical AI may create an opening for a ministry like the MIIT to seize the regulatory reins.
The potential impact of these regulatory currents extends far beyond China. If the CAC follows through on certain requirements for algorithmic transparency and explainability, China will be running some of the world’s largest regulatory experiments on topics that European regulators have long debated. Whether Chinese companies are able to meet these new demands could inform analogous debates in Europe over the right to explanation.
On the security side, as AI systems are woven deeper into the fabrics of militaries around the world, governments want to ensure those systems are robust, reliable, and controllable for the sake of international stability. The CAICT’s current experiments in certifying AI systems are likely not game-ready for those kinds of high-stakes deployment decisions. But developing an early understanding of how Chinese institutions and technologists approach these questions could prove valuable for governments who may soon find themselves negotiating over aspects of autonomous weapons and arms controls.
With 2022 marking a major year in the Chinese political calendar, the people and bureaucracies building out Chinese AI governance are likely to continue jostling for position and influence. The results of that jostling warrant close attention from AI experts and China watchers. If China’s attempts to rein in algorithms prove successful, they could imbue these approaches with a kind of technological and regulatory soft power that shapes AI governance regimes around the globe.

The iPhone's photo roll can pick you out of a lineup, genealogy results get more accurate with each person that submits their blood, and TikTok knows just how to make hours melt away in the blink of an eye. All of this is powered by machine learning: Computer algorithms that get more and more effective with every piece of information they collect, called data points. Now, tech-minded skin-care founders are using machine learning to tackle concerns like acne… but is it too good to be true?
""The skin-care industry is very marketing driven and product development is based on trendy ingredients,"" says Meghan Maupin, CEO and cofounder of Atolla, customized skin care designed to become more effective with each monthly shipment, thanks to subtle reformulations powered by customer feedback and a patented algorithm. ""Our approach is to let the data show us patterns across different customer groups, and what formulations might work best for each... machine learning is the start of the skin-care industry becoming more data-driven.""
Atolla collects its data points through a quiz that covers the participant's skin goals and history, allergies, current product routine, medications, and lifestyle; a mail-in skin test that seeks to measure hydration and sebum levels through a blotting paper-like tool; and a selfie that helps remote aestheticians assess concerns. (Since Atolla's products are over the counter, it employs skin experts to educate the consumer instead of doctors able to treat skin issues, Maupin explains.)
Its algorithm then compares your data to other users who have similar skin concerns — seeing what worked for them — and scans for ingredient conflicts in your routine before generating a customized serum, which it will auto-ship to the customer for $39 a month or bundle with a cleanser and moisturizer for $69 per month. ""For customers with acne or breakouts, we're able to titrate your dosage of active ingredients up or down each month in response to your skin progress,"" Maupin adds.
Atolla is just one of many new companies that understand the monetary value of data, the appeal of bespoke personal-care products, and the power of a subscription model. In some respects, there's a data-driven beauty gold rush happening. You may remember Proven founder Ming Zhao pitch her bespoke skin care on Shark Tank — products formulated based on environment, diet, age, and dozens of other factors — or heard of Singapore-based Yours skin care, which offers custom products for acne, pigmentation, and many other concerns.
Then there are brands, like Curology, which use the expertise of medically-trained providers (doctors, physician assistants), to create unique formulations that target breakouts, fine lines, and other skin concerns. Similarly, there is Docent, which employs medical doctors to assess a makeup-free selfie and vanity shelfie before shipping your skin prescription.
Machine learning is even being used to improve the subscription box model. ""We use data to connect customers to products that work and curate high-performing skin-care routines that they never would have assembled on their own,"" says Katrina Moreno Lewis, founder and CEO of Kura Skin, a quarterly subscription box that offers a complete, bespoke routine — from cleanser to sunscreen — that starts at $99 or can be purchased as a one-off.
Quickly and effectively calming redness, fading melasma, and beating breakouts with the help of technology sounds like a dream, but this data-driven trend brings up important questions. First, can an at-home quiz really unlock the secret to healthier skin?
""Self-reported data has limits,"" says Corey L. Hartman, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist based in Birmingham, Alabama, explaining that the very language we use to describe our skin concerns is up for interpretation. ""There aren't very many specific parameters or criteria for some of these terms that we put a lot of credibility on.""
For example, he says the reason why medical papers don’t use the terms ""dry,"" ""oily,"" or ""combination"" is that they mean different things to different people. ""These are things that we talk about in beauty spaces and marketing, but in terms of real scientific data, there's nothing that's tied to that, so what does it really mean?""
Another question to consider is how our personal health data is being stored and used. Margaret Foster Riley, a health privacy expert and professor of law at The University of Virginia, raises a few red flags about this growing trend. ""Sometimes you'll see companies will assert that they'll never sell or use your data improperly but what’s unclear is what happens in a succession context,"" she says, noting that your data might not be protected in a bankruptcy or acquisition (both common with startups).
Then there are potential long-term risks: ""A lot of people [who willingly provide their data to companies] are young and healthy and not thinking of the impact that might be with health insurance or, even in some contexts, employment,"" Riley adds. ""They go into it willing to share everything, then, later on, they recognize that if things come out they may have an obligation to share it with a long-term care company or a life insurance company and they weren't thinking about that at the time.""

While COVID-19 forced an emergency transformation to online learning at universities, learning how to teach efficiently and effectively online using different platforms and tools is a positive addition to education and is here to stay.
To sustain this beneficial evolution and ensure quality education, universities should focus on supporting faculty to embrace and lead the change. 
The ethical and strategic use of artificial intelligence at centres of teaching and learning, which support faculty in troubleshooting and innovating their online teaching practices, can help with this task. Centres of teaching and learning are responsible for educational technology support, teaching and learning support, as well as instructional design.
Expansive move to online education
Research conducted at 19 centres of teaching and learning and their equivalents from Canada, the United States, Lebanon, the United Kingdom and France published in August 2020 showed that staff in these centres deployed all available resources to support the rapid switch to online education. 
Staff had been working 10- to 14-hour workdays during the first phase of the pandemic to meet the increase in faculty and staff needs. These centres also reported difficulty recruiting and training qualified candidates. 
Used strategically, chatbots could take over repetitive low-level guidance tasks that teaching and learning centres field and help avoid overload. A chatbot, also called a conversational or virtual agent, is a software or computer system designed to communicate with humans using natural language processing.
This communication can be via text messages or voice commands.



Centres for teaching and learning need to be equipped to support faculty with their teaching.


Why a chatbot?
Chatbots offer a viable, win-win solution to teaching and learning centres and to faculty. They are available 24/7, can respond to thousands of simultaneous requests and provide instant and robust service support when needed. 
Using chatbots could free teams for complex inquiries that require human interventions, such as transforming teaching approaches and collaborating to innovate solutions to respond to problems like improving equity and access in online teaching.

A collaboration between the centres’ experts and technology could provide better services and support for faculty to improve the learning experiences they create for students. Chatbots can guide faculty towards appropriate and effective resources and professional development activities, such as how-to articles, tutorials and upcoming workshops. These would be tailored to suit faculties’ individual needs, their varied digital skills levels and backgrounds in designing hybrid learning experiences.
Chatbot systems are already used in educational institutions for teaching and learning, to deliver administrative tasks, to advise students and assist them in research. 
How would it work?
Two options are possible when it comes to chatbots’ AI conversational ability:

Artificial Intelligence Markup Language methodology: Programmers give the AI a library of questions/answers and keyword associations through a database. From there, the chatbot is able to give appropriate answers in a strictly defined frame.
The Natural Language Processing approach: This allows for more flexibility. Once programmers build an initial dataset, the AI-powered tool will then learn from ongoing exchanges to find the best combination of answers to recurring questions asked by faculty members. The AI will then be able to identify keywords in a sentence and understand the context of a question. 

That programmers would need to add data from the conversation to an ongoing dataset building throughout time is expected. When asked a question, the chatbot will respond based on its current knowledge database. If the conversation introduces a concept that it isn’t programmed to understand, the chatbot can state it doesn’t understand the question — or pass the communication to a human operator.
Either way, the chatbot will also learn from this interaction as well as future interactions. Thus, the chatbot will gradually grow in scope and gain relevance.



Chatbot implementation scenario for teaching and learning centres to support faculty.
(Nadia Naffi)


For chatbots’ reliability and trustworthiness to increase, it should be effective in helping these centres supporting their faculty. Implementing and fine tuning chatbots so they are ready for use is important, even if it requires an investment of time and resources.
Ethical framework for AI in education
The Institute for Ethical AI in Education, based at the University of Buckingham in the United Kingdom, and funded by McGraw Hill, Microsoft Corporation, Nord Anglia Education and Pearson PLC, released The Ethical Framework for AI in Education in 2020. The framework argues AI systems should increase the capacity of organizations and the autonomy of learners while respecting human relationships and ensuring human control.
Chatbots in university settings should be ethical by design, meaning that they should be designed to be sensitive to values like security, safety and accountability and transparency. If used in centres of teaching and learning, users should be protected against all forms of harm or abuse. They also need to feel treated fairly and to always be provided the option to reach a human. Faculty members must know they are exchanging with an AI. 
Chatbots can and should be accessible. Tolerating user errors and input variation, being designed for diverse abilities and allowing multilingual texting communication are examples of facilitating accessibility.
Do no harm: privacy
Chatbots should be designed to “do no harm,” as per the UNESCO’s recent recommendations on the ethics of artificial intelligence. When talking about non-maleficence, privacy should be addressed. 
AI-powered tools come with data recording issues. Strong barriers in data collection and storage are needed. Following the European approach to data protection, centres should minimize data collection. Only required information should be stored, such as specific parts of conversations, but not the interlocutors’ identity. 
The transparency-based approach allows for users to agree on which personal data can be shared or not with the centres. This would help keep trust and usability of the tool high. In case of malfunction, faculty members would provide feedback on the problem, and centres would fix it.
Centres should consider anonymization of users, strong encryption of all data stored, and in-house storage when possible or by a trusted contracted third party following similar data privacy rules. 



Data collection should be minimized to protect user privacy.

Addressing bias, environmental impact
The possible bias in the initial database needs to be addressed. Whether it relates to gender, ethnicity, language or other variables, the initial dataset needs to be cleaned and carefully analyzed prior to being used to train the AI, whether AI markup language or NLP methods are deployed. If the latter is applied, ongoing monitoring should be considered.
A green data storage solution needs to be addressed to reduce the CO2 cost of activity on the environment. For example, universities might investigate if water cooling systems could be used in server rooms instead of air conditioning.
The university of the future as anticipated by many scholars and policy makers has already started. Technology, if used ethically and strategically, can support faculty in their mission to prepare their students for the needs of our society and the future of work.

As digital infrastructure’s role in business grows, IT service management (ITSM) has become increasingly crucial. In many cases, this trend has resulted in IT help desks facing more demand than they can efficiently handle. Artificial intelligence (AI) can help.
Many businesses have already realized AI’s potential in this area. As of 2019, 62% of surveyed companiesOpens a new window  were considering implementing AI in ITSM, with 46% actively researching these solutions.
Still, simply knowing that other companies are pursuing this technology is insufficient evidence for its effectiveness. With that in mind, here are four specific ways AI can improve help desk management.
1. Providing 24/7 Support
The most straightforward way to integrate AI into ITSM is through chatbots. With more than 3 billion virtual assistants in use worldwide, these solutions are widely available and largely effective in their roles. Perhaps the greatest advantage of chatbots for help desks is providing around-the-clock support.
Users may encounter an issue at any time, but most IT departments don’t have enough workers to staff the help desk for 24 hours. Chatbots can fill in when human agents are unavailable, providing support whenever a user may need it.
Chatbots today are sophisticated enough to handle many basic issues. So they can resolve many IT service tickets autonomously. If an issue requires the nuance of a human worker, the chatbot can field it and pass it on accordingly.

2. Categorizing and Routing Service Tickets
Another way AI can improve help desk management is by categorizing, prioritizing, and routing tickets. When requests come in, AI can compare them to similar past cases, determine their severity and likely outcome, then route them to the appropriate employee at the right time. Doing this reduces miscommunication and seeks the best help for each ticket, helping resolve issues faster.
The Toronto Pearson International Airport is an excellent example of this use case. The airport deployed an AI ITSM solution to better serve its 50 million annual passengersOpens a new window , and it created impressive results. By learning from past tickets and agent behavior, the system categorized and routed tickets more effectively, decreasing the mean repair time from 2.4 hours to 1.39 hours.
This AI could also provide instant solutions for 30% of repetitive tasks, reducing IT staff workload and further improving their productivity. All of these improvements resulted in a customer satisfaction score of 96.5%.

3. Informing Worker Decision Making
When these AI solutions pass service tickets along to human workers, they can still provide value. By analyzing similar situations, AI can provide the necessary context to help IT staff make the right decisions quickly.
Telecom company Rogers Communications experienced this first-hand when they implemented their ITSM AI. The company uses its system to provide a better picture of each user’s situation, including how long they’ve been a customer, what services they use, their customer journey, and the severity of the issue. All this information helps provide the right help faster.
Rogers Communications saw a 53% decrease in customer complaintsOpens a new window  in a year of using this AI solution. When IT staff have more context to understand a ticket and its potential solutions when they get it, they can solve it more effectively and efficiently.
4. Resolving Minor Infrastructure Issues
AI in ITSM can also make improvements behind the scenes. If the underlying infrastructure of a help desk’s platform or the system they provide help for has issues, it will take more than a customer experience call to fix it. AI can detect and resolve many of these problems while IT staff members focus on other tasks.
Since AI can handle more data faster than humansOpens a new window , it can detect infrastructure or network issues faster. If these problems aren’t overly complex, it can then automatically address them and solve them before they cause further disruption to ITSM services. If they are too complex, AI can alert the appropriate staff so they can fix the issue.
By automating these infrastructure fixes and improvements, IT teams can spend more time addressing users’ immediate needs. These quick patches will likely also reduce incoming tickets by preventing issues before they cause noticeable differences.
IT Help Desks Today Need AI
IT help desks will grow increasingly busy as digital services become more important in daily work and life. As that happens, these teams will need all the resources available to resolve issues quickly. These teams will need AI.
These four improvements illustrate how AI can improve help desk management through virtually every stage of the process. Those that implement AI effectively can see dramatic changes in their customer satisfaction and team productivity.

The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) has exploded just as managers and executives are adapting to hybrid work environments and struggling to oversee remote employees.
A recent report from research firm IDC predicts that by 2024, 80% of Global 2000 companies will use AI/ML-enabled “Digital Managers” to hire, fire, and train workers in jobs measured by continuous improvement — but only one in five companies will get any real value from the move without human engagement.
The ongoing worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has forced many companies to adopt new work models, ranging from fully remote to “hybrid” approaches where individuals and teams work at or across multiple digital and physical locations.











 
 
 
This shift to more distributed workforces has required companies to devise new methods for managing, leading, and organizing enterprises, according to IDC.

In fact, about 41% of companies see the ability to manage a remote and hybrid workforce as a critical skill to hire or develop in-house, according to IDC’s April 2021 Future Enterprise Resiliency and Spending Survey.
Today, digital-management software based on AI/ML is used to scan resumes and cull applicants, determine daily employee performance, recommend additional training, and determine when and how many employees are needed for a job – especially for shift-type work.











 
 
 
Amy Loomis, a research director for IDC’s worldwide Future of Work market research service, said that while the use of AI/ML to hire and fire workers might seem remarkable, “it’s rather widely used in [human resources] circles today to greater or lesser degree.
“Algorithms are often used to stack-rank employees offering recommendations on who would be best fit to hire or targeted to fire,” Loomis said.
Stack-ranking, also known as forced ranking or forced distribution, uses a statistics-based approach to rate employees on job performance in comparison to other team members.











 
 
 
Stack-ranking software can be used to suggest that employees take additional training, push  managers to perform employee remediation, or in some cases prompt the firing of a percentage of employees who fall below performance thresholds. A company, for instance, could choose to fire all employees who fall into the bottom 10% of performers.
Amazon comes under fire
For example, widespread media reports during the past year claimed Amazon uses software algorithms or “bots” to hire and rate employees, “firing millions of people with little or no human oversight.”
Overall, a large percentage of the Amazon workers are terminated for job abandonment. Only a small percentage are terminated for performance issues, according to Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson.











 
 
 
The company, which employs more than 1.4 million workers, denied its algorithms are used solely to fire workers. The company’s workforce management technology supports and enhances the experience of job candidates and employees. It’s not meant to replace managers, but to aid their decision-making with data and information, according to Nantel.
“There’s a distinct difference between a personnel management system flagging someone who has abandoned their jobs — and as a result they’re automatically terminated — versus our performance systems that help give feedback to our managers on where and how our employees are performing and stacking up against one another and giving recommendations and feedback to those who may be struggling,” Nantel said.
“Contextually, it’s easy to say thousands or hundreds of thousands are fired by robots. Well, in some cases that’s true in job abandonment cases, but they’re not fired for performance issues ever,” Nantel continued. “They’re not coached, fire,d or disciplined through any technology.”











 
 
 
Shannon Kalvar, research manager for IDC’s IT Service Management and Client Virtualization Program, said that while companies may not rely entirely on software bots to fire employees, recommendations based on AI/ML weigh heavily in decision making.
“We are human beings who are overworked and over stressed. What is the likelihood you’re going to disagree with a suggestion when it comes through — especially if you’re remote managing somebody?” Kalvar said.
Digital management software was already in use before the pandemic, when it mainly helped  manage trucking fleets, retail workers, service workers, and other “task oriented” jobs. For example, the gig economy enabled flexible hours for delivery services, which enabled same-day delivery for retail products and groceries. Delivery trucks were no longer pre-packed days in advance.











 
 
 
In 2015, for example, Amazon started its gig-style Flex delivery service using contract drivers instead of full-time employees. Contract workers’ performance is closely monitored by software algorithms that track their routes and delivery times.
“A frighteningly large number of organizations have digital managers,” Kalvar said. “We’ve seen a huge uptake in interest in that and it’s already starting to roll out for office workers in addition to everyone else. Today, it’s really a problem in task-oriented jobs, but you have to realize we’re all moving into task-oriented jobs.
“There’s plenty of software that detects problems with process, which is another way of saying, ‘Where are people screwing up and do they need to be remediated?’” Kalvar said.











 
 
 
The issue has become a hot-button one in Europe, where the European Commission is eyeing rules that could force companies to be more transparent about their use of algorithmic management.

Cloud ROI: Getting innovation economics right with FinOps

One major flaw with algorithmic employee management is the disparate nature of applications. Some tools are embedded in ERP system software, others are standalone applications and services. In a large enterprise, there can be many different personnel management and training applications, and many of them do not talk with each other.
That’s a problem at Amazon, which uses various types of software and algorithms. Some track employee time and attendance, others oversee worker performance, while still others keep a record of employee disability leave.











 
 
 
A manual patch the company deployed to enable communications between its time and attendance monitoring algorithm and its employee-leave system failed to integrate the two systems.
“In some cases there have been issues where an individual might have been out on leave and two systems were not talking to each other and the system generated a form email or letter being sent out to an employee saying they’d abandoned their job when, in fact, they were out on leave,” Nantel said. “We’re in the process right now of fully implementing a patch that connects those two systems together.
“We’re not unique to some of those challenges, and when you’re a company as big as Amazon and you’re scaling and growing as fast as we are, we certainly have found some situations where our technology and our systems haven’t kept pace,” she said.











 
 
 
Over the next several years, the use of AI/ML-based management software is only expected to grow. Investors and other analysts have projected that the AI software market will more than double from $150 billion to more than $500 billion in the next five years or so.
For example, IDC predicts the worldwide AI market, including software, hardware, and services, will grow from $327.5 B in 2021 to $554.3B in 2024 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.5%.
Forrester Research has taken a more conservative view, projecting the market will grow to $37 billion by 2025. Forrester explained its numbers in a report supplied to Computerworld, saying most applications add AI functions without monetizing them — and the custom-built AI apps that businesses create don’t generate market revenues.











 
 
 
“AI is fast becoming as fundamental to software as software has become to business. As a result, AI software will increasingly be embedded into existing software products by existing software vendors,” Forrester said in a white paper published last year.
“Companies will find that it makes the most sense to acquire AI functions through these software vendors. At the end of the day, AI will be everywhere in software products, just as analytics, workflow, and data are part of those same software products.”
Forrester draws a distinction between software “Build Platforms” that are general and specialize in enabling users and vendors to use AI to develop AI-infused applications, and “Buy Applications.” The latter are AI-infused software tools designed to help users improve business outcomes.











 
 
 
The prevalence of AI now in various platforms and apps means corporate execs leading a dispersed workforce need more than just new skills — they also need new “mental models” for understanding productivity, leadership, and the relationships between employees, managers, and enterprises, according to IDC’s Kalvar.
In other words, organizations using automated employee management software need to reevaluate their relationship with their workers.
“Today, we’re still very much stuck in an industrial-era mindset. The concept of an office as a factory is not a useful tool, though,” Kalvar said.











 
 
 
Autocratic styles of leadership, which emphasize the benefits of employee work to the managers — and the corporate bottom line — have to give way to human skills of oversight, IDC’s study said. Without human engagement, employees lack a sense of corporate community and don’t feel invested in the outcome of their work.
And without human oversight, companies risk losing out on qualified candidates because resume-scanning algorithms are often not set up properly and, thus, cull resumes of potential hires. Additionally, employees who’ve been fired by a bot — even if they were terminated without a good reason — are rarely rehired, Kalvar said.
“This happens in lower-wage jobs, especially,” Kalvar said. “If you’ve fired all of the qualified people because you didn’t want to keep them around, you’re done, because most companies will not rehire fired employees. The people are still there to hire, but you can’t find them. They’re invisible to you.”
If, for example, a company requires applicants with a college education, even if their work experience qualifies them for the job, algorithms will automatically cut them from a prospective  list of applicants.











 
 
 
“If you have a region with low college attainment and you put all your jobs to require college through your filtering software, you’re going to blow through the existing candidates pretty quick,” Kalvar said. “There may be 30% of the population who could be considered [for an opening], but you’re not going to see them.
“That creates a perception of talent imbalance and shortage,” he added.
Companies are already beginning to take note and change their management culture. For example, at SoftBank (a Japanese financial institution) humans review resumes rejected by AI/ML to ensure promising candidates are not overlooked.
“Honestly, there aren’t any best practices yet. I’d argue figuring this out is the big challenge for humans who manage,” Kalvar said. “We need to figure this out fast. Those who figure this out will have highly engaged, highly loyal communities working together. Those who fail will run highly lean organizations. That’s going to look really good for a couple of quarters.”
But without human intervention, those putative gains might fade away.

By helping to automate the analysis of large data sets and  making it easier to identify trends in data, AI frees up time for supply chain  professionals to engage in value-added activities that only humans can carry  out. For example, even the best technology is no substitute for the uniquely  human relationship-building skills that support listening to stakeholders,  communicating effectively with business partners, innovating and thinking  strategically about how to approach challenges. Through its AI in supply chain research, APQC has found  that there are at least six new skills that supply chain employees need to  develop or enhance as the result of AI adoption. While some of these are  technical skills, most are soft skills that help supply chain professionals to  forge stronger relationships, work more effectively with partners and solve  complex problems. Actively building and strengthening these skills among supply  chain professionals is important in order to leverage AI effectively and  strategically use the time it frees up.AdChoicesADVERTISINGActive listening and communicationActive listening  and communication skills sit at the top of the list. Supply chain employees  must be able to effectively discern the needs of their stakeholders, maintain  positive relationships with partners and convey clear expectations to suppliers  and other service providers.   Creativity and innovationThe business adage  “innovate or die” may sound dramatic, but it also happens to be true in today’s  business climate. In the face of numerous disruptions and other unplanned  challenges, supply chain professionals need to think creatively in order to  find novel solutions that keep the business running.  Technical skills in data science, machine learning and modellingThe need for new  soft skills does not detract from the importance of technical skills. To get the  most out of investments in AI, supply chain professionals need to know how to  leverage the technology effectively in order to derive insights that can lead  to better decisions.  Strategic thinking AI can use data to  model trends and make predictions, but humans still need to discern what the  data means in the context of an organization’s broader goals and strategy.  Supply chain professionals must be able to look at evidence from data and make  the best decision for the business, especially when there is no evident “right”  answer to an emerging trend or challenge.Analytical skills with business acumenSupply chain employees need to be able to translate the  findings of AI in a way that makes sense to organizational leaders and connects  to the priorities they care about. The ability to tell a clear and compelling  story about data that connects to business strategy helps to bridge the gap  between insight and action. Looking forward  The key to  retaining employees who will thrive in future supply chain roles is to ensure  that they have the right mix of skills to support AI and leverage it  strategically. Many organizations have already committed to providing learning  opportunities for supply chain professionals to develop or enhance these critical  skills. For example, APQC has found that organizations are investing a median  of seven days in employee learning per employee to ease the transition to AI.

Learning, on the other hand, is not restricted to the classroom. At home, students and beginners may do a variety of enjoyable and simple artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) projects. The majority of these projects require a computer or laptop, as well as internet connectivity. These projects provide your child with an enjoyable learning experience, that introduces them to artificial intelligence and machine learning at a young age..Face Filters using Face Detection.In an age, where changing your face to appear like your favorite dog or trying to seem royal by wearing a crown, is all the rage on the internet. This project allows you to do just that design your face app filters, and apply them to your face. This is a fun AI and machine learning project for kids, that teaches them how to use AI to recognise their face with a computer camera, then appropriately fit the filter to their face and even tilt it in line with how their face tilts..Predict Housing Price.In this project, you will have to anticipate the selling price of a new home in Boston, for this assignment. The prices of properties in various locations of the city are included in the project's dataset. The datasets for this experiment, are available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Aside from the costs of various properties, you'll also obtain statistics on the people's ages, the city's crime rate, and the locations of non-retail companies. It's a terrific assignment for youngsters, to put their knowledge to the test..Chatbot.Developing a chatbot, is one of the top AI-based initiatives. Create a rudimentary customer service chatbot first. The chatbots, which may be found on many websites, can be used as inspiration. After you've made a basic chatbot, you may improve it and make a more complex version. The chatbot's specialty may then be changed and its functions can be enhanced. AI allows you to construct a variety of innovative chatbots..Facial Recognition.This is a popular artificial intelligence project concept. This research aims to build on a ground-breaking current deep Learning application: face emotion identification. The deep Learning face emotion detection and identification system are used to recognise and understand human facial emotions. It can identify happy, sad, angry, terrified, surprised, disgusted, and neutral human emotions in real-time..Stock Price Prediction.This is one of the greatest beginners AI project ideas. The stock market is a favourite of machine learning scientists. Because it is tightly packed with information, this is the case. You may get a variety of data sets and start working on a project right away. This project would be perfect for students interested in working in the financial business, since it may give them significant insight into a variety of elements of the industry..Gesture Controlled Space Game Battle.This is a simple AI-based space combat game, where you just use hand gestures to operate your vessel. PictoBlox, a computer or laptop with a camera or webcam, and an internet connection are all necessary. The foundations of the game are simple: you move your finger around, to control the movement of the spaceship. The game uses artificial intelligence to analyse your hand, and its movements via the camera, which then drives the game's spaceship forward..Gesture Controlled Robot.The next AI and machine learning project for students, are to control a 2-wheel drive robot with hand gestures rather than a computer, smartphone, or joystick. If you haven't made the robot yet or are unsure how to do so, go here. A two-wheeled robot, a camera-equipped laptop or PC, PictoBlox, and an internet connection, are all necessary. You'll use machine learning to teach the model to recognise hand gestures, so it can move forward, turn left and right and stop in this project..AI-based Home Automation.Students may use the speech recognition capability of PictoBlox'sartificial intelligence extension, to operate household appliances in this project. The students will use PictoBlox, to create a room with appliances like lights, a fan, and a radio, then write a script in PictoBlox to operate them using voice commands. After you've completed the project, you may turn it into a real-life room with lights, fans, and radios..Attendance System using Face Detection.Because of the present global scenario and the rise of online classrooms, the conventional attendance method may be difficult or cumbersome. This cutting-edge machine learning project enables your teacher to take class attendance, using facial recognition. It collects sample photographs of your face using machine learning, and the next time the computer scans a face, it uses AI to compare it to the stored samples, marking you as present if there is a match..Plagiarism Checker.You will create a plagiarism detector for a project, that can detect similarities in text copies, and calculate the proportion of plagiarism. Users can register for this software, by generating a valid login id and password. The file will be separated into content and reference links, after the uploads are complete. The checker will next go through the whole document, checking for grammatical problems, visiting each reference link, and scanning the content of all of the links for matches, to your material..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Mr Maire works for Firmenich, a business with a perfume industry pedigree stretching back to 1895. Firmenich's nose for a new market saw it diversify into food ingredients as the public appetite for alternatives to meat led to a scramble to put plant-based food on supermarket shelves.The company says there is a global market for plant-based meat substitutes of $25bn (£19bn) and believes this will grow to $200bn by 2030.To help perfect the flavours of these innovative foods, Mr Maire has a new sous-chef in the form of Sam, an artificial intelligence (AI) robot. FirmenichNew plant-based foods have raised demand for flavouringAlong with a team of flavourists, Sam helps blend a huge array of flavours for clients.In humans the sense of taste stems from multiple receptors that are primed to alert our brains to the nature of any possible food we encounter.Sam lacks this sense of taste, but it has been trained on a database of ingredients gathered over 60 years at the company.Using a technique called machine learning, it has raced through examples of flavour combinations and has learnt its own definitions, maturing over 18 months into today's AI robot. Eric Saracchi runs the digital side of Firmenich: ""Flavours are more complex than perfumes,"" he says, and Sam had to understand what a strawberry is, or how grilled beef hits the tongue, before finding matches between tastes and plant foodstuffs. The robot is primed with so many ingredients it is known internally as ""a piano with 5,000 keys"".That piano is played by the company's team of human flavourists.The top tasters are the master flavourists, and out of some 30 in the world six work at Firmenich. Creators of flavours are so rare, ""you can't replace them, you can only enhance them,""  says Mr Saracchi.FirmenichPatrick Salord is principal flavourist at FirmenichFlavourists are at the heart of Firmenich, and Patrick Salord is its principal flavourist.""Being a flavourist is a combination of art and science. I took a masters degree in chemistry before I began this career. We train to pick the best ingredients to achieve the flavour we want. We evaluate and describe them and compare them.""He uses certain aromas and tastes to mask ""off-notes"" such as acidic tastes while giving a formula the right texture. He talks of the tonality of food, how removing one tiny ingredient can change the overall taste.Sam takes the knowledge of flavourists and generates new formulas in minutes, a fraction of the time Mr Salord and his team take using their own skills. ""It suggests a formula that is in line with our senses.""Getty ImagesOne big advantage of an AI robot is that it has no cognitive bias. This lack of human prejudices helps Firmenich to get past any unconscious leanings of the flavourists. The objectivity of Sam, devoid of influences that can sway even the most professional of flavourists, allows it to work at speed. ""It adds value by combining the knowledge of all the other flavourists here,"" says Mr Salord.The machine rapidly gives an indication of how a flavour can be created and how much of an ingredient should be included. And Sam can hold the line between Mr Salord's team of flavourists and public tastes, refereeing decisions when the flavourists' view differs from that of a consumer panel. But the finished product needs more - and that's what Mr Salord's team bring to the tasting party, which belongs to the start of the day. ""We try to taste in the morning before we have coffee. By the afternoon your sense of taste becomes tired and affected by lunch. So we leave the afternoon for work on the computer.""More technology of business:Like a drone that you sit in – but is it safe?What can we do to get more women into coding?Controversy over wood pellets as a green energy sourceThe companies offering delivery to the MoonIs there a better way to make new resolutions stick?Back in Mr Maire's kitchen the cross-fertilisation between flavourist and robot is coming out of the frying pan. He is accustomed to hosting business clients, searching for a specific taste they can drop into foodstuffs on supermarket shelves. The flavourists remain his close colleagues, even though AI is ""a powerful, beautiful tool."" And he rates the taste of UK consumers highly. ""It's an advanced market with many vegan people."" Firmenich is betting big on the rest of the world changing their food habits in line with the British. He concedes that this marriage of science and culinary arts has its critics. ""When you say chemicals it's not sexy for gastronomy.""His triumphant retort is to brandish thick slices of a pale juicy meat that tastes like a good cut of chicken but springs from Sam's recipe for vegetable protein, resembling a paste. ""The essence of what we do is innovation, for me molecules are another flavour."" Mr Maire maintains he is ready to whip up Christmas turkey and more from plant-based ingredients. ""We are only at the beginning of what can be done. We have the competency to make Christmas pudding flavours too.""   His beef burger is less appealing, in the mouth sausage seems to be a dominant taste rather than beef.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Dick and Mac McDonald opened the first McDonald’s restaurant in San Bernardino, California in 1940. By the end of the decade, the restaurant added its now-famous French fries. Ray Kroc joined the growing organization in 1954, purchased it in 1961, and served as its CEO into the early 1970s. Over the next decades, the restaurant chain grew, adding its drive-thru concept, Hamburger University, and iconic menu items like its Filet-O-Fish, Big Mac, and Quarter Pounder sandwiches.  Today, McDonald’s is the world’s second-largest restaurant company by revenue and its largest fast-food restaurant chain with more than 39,000 locations in 119 countries. As of January 2022, McDonald’s trades on the NYSE with a market cap of approximately $200 billion. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, McDonald’s reported total revenues of over $22 billion.  McDonald’s created McD Tech Labs after its 2019 acquisition of Apprente, a voice technology firm, which in turn followed its earlier acquisition of Dynamic Yield, a Tel Aviv-based firm that specialized in personalization and decision logic technology.  In 2020, McDonald’s announced its Accelerating the Arches growth strategy, which includes a “double down on the 3 D’s: Digital, Delivery and Drive-Thru,” and the integration of these newly acquired AI technologies.  In this article, we’ll look at how McDonald’s has explored AI applications for its business and industry through two unique use-cases: Automated Drive-Thrus — McDonald’s acquired natural language processing and machine learning expertise through its 2019 acquisition of Apprente, which the chain has applied to its automated order-taking initiatives.  Order Prediction — McDonald’s uses machine learning-based decision technology to predict what menu offerings are most likely to drive sales in its drive-thru business.  We will begin by examining how McDonald’s uses natural language processing and machine learning technology to speed its order-taking process as its drive-thru business has become more popular during the pandemic.   Automated Drive-Thrus Since the introduction of its first drive-thrus in the 1970s, McDonald’s has grown to rely on the model to attract and serve its guests. As of December 2021, McDonald’s offers drive-thru service in some 25,000 locations across the world, including at 95% of all US operations. Valued by consumers for its convenience and flexibility, the drive-thru model has taken on even more importance during the COVID-19 pandemic, representing some 70% of sales in top markets since March 2020.  “Our drive-thru sales across our top six markets continue to stay elevated versus pre-pandemic levels even as dining rooms reopened,” said Chris Kempczinski, the chain’s president and CEO during its Q3 2021 earnings call.  In addition to implementing drive-thru innovations like express pick-up, express drive-thru, and smaller “on-the-go” locations, McDonald’s is also looking to improve on its ordering and payment functions.   The company made its biggest jump into innovating the order and payment components of the drive-thru process by beginning to automate drive-thru order-taking in 2018, and with its 2019 acquisition of Apprente. Later renamed McD Tech Labs, the acquisition enabled McDonald’s to implement and test automated order-taking at several of its US-based restaurants, Kempczinski said in October 2021.    Apprente technology, per a Q3 2019 McDonald’s press release is a “voice-based [platform] for complex, multilingual, multi-accent, and multi-item conversational ordering.” McDonald’s hopes that using the solution’s natural language processing and machine learning capabilities will create a faster, simpler, and more accurate order-taking process at the company’s drive-thrus.    Here Mason Smoot, McDonald’s Chief Restaurant Officer for the US, explains McDonald’s plans for its Automated Order-Taking technology at the Company’s Worldwide Connection 2.0 (WWC) Meeting:  Since 2018, McDonald’s reports that the chain has cut the time it takes to serve drive-thru customers by thirty seconds and claims that this has resulted in increased customer satisfaction. McDonald’s has announced plans to expand its drive-thru “innovations” to more than 10,000 locations worldwide.  Automated order-taking boasts an 85% accuracy rating, Kempczinksi said at the Alliance Bernstein’s Strategic Decisions conference, adding that about 20% of orders have required human intervention.  In its most recent earnings call, the chain reports substantial benefits for both customers and its employees, and has announced plans to continue to scale the technology to more than 14,000 locations across the country.   To help drive that growth, McDonald’s entered into a “strategic relationship” with IBM in Q4 2021 to tap into their expertise in “building AI powered customer care solutions and voice recognition,” Kempczinski continued during the Q3 2021 earnings call. As part of the deal, automated order taking “will continue to be integrated into McDonald’s highly secure technology ecosystem.”  Order Prediction Digitization is coming to the drive-thru. As we drive around—and go inside—McDonald’s restaurants, we are increasingly met with digital displays, and those displays are growing smarter.    In the United States alone, McDonald’s serves more than 25 million customers daily. In the chain’s top markets, some 70% of sales come through the drive-thru. As part of its Accelerating the Arches effort to make the drive-thru as efficient and convenient as possible for its customers, McDonald’s purchased Dynamic Yield in 2019, planning to leverage its decision technology to add personalization to its drive-thrus and modernize the customer experience.  When McDonald’s added Dynamic Yield’s machine-learning-driven solution to its drive-thrus at select locations in 2018, the tech considered purchases made by other customers when updating the offerings presented on the ordering displays. The technology also updated the digital drive-thru menu displays based on: The time of day Current order selections Current restaurant traffic Popularity of menu items  Weather conditions Here, at McDonald’s November 2020 Virtual Investor Update, Mason Smoot, McDonald’s Chief Restaurant Officer for the US, explains the company’s vision for its Drive-Thru strategy:    Through the machine-learning technology acquired in the Dynamic Yield transaction, McDonald’s digitized its point-of-sale process at its brick-and-mortar locations with decision technology. After testing the digital displays in several domestic markets in 2018, McDonald’s announced plans to continue its rollout to more US and international locations in 2019. With Dynamic Yield’s machine-learning-driven decision technology, McDonald’s now offers digital displays that suggest items popular with other customers, or that are frequently purchased in certain weather or during a specific time of day. These digital displays can also suggest faster-to-prepare items to alleviate drive-thru slowdowns.  Rumors first emerged in early 2021 that McDonald’s was considering selling its Dynamic Yield business. Possible reasons included disagreements about $70 million in technology fees that McDonald’s said were not paid by its franchisees.  Later in 2021, in December, McDonald’s announced plans to sell Dynamic Yield to Mastercard. Although Dynamic Yield, with its portfolio of more than 400 global brands, will become part of Mastercard’s digital service strategy, Mastercard, through its President of Data & Services, stated that it plans to “continue working with McDonald’s.”  While McDonald’s does not provide separate financial performance information for its Dynamic Yield business, the company does plan to continue using the technology in its bid to further personalize its customer experience and, at the time of the Dynamic Yield sale, reiterated its plans to “further scale and integrate Dynamic Yield’s capabilities globally and across ordering channels.”

Increasingly, researchers are looking for ways to implement artificial intelligence into medical imaging.
There are several different cases for why a patient might need medical imaging. Whether it’s for a cardiac event, fracture, neurological condition, or thoracic complications, AI can quickly diagnose and provide treatment options.







Recently, research organizations and universities have been pursuing the expansion of AI in cancer screenings. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients chose to delay care, such as well-visits and cancer screenings, resulting in more advanced cancers.
By implementing AI into medical imaging, the technology can enhance medical screenings, improve precision medicine, assess patient risk factors, and lighten the load for physicians.

Advancing medical screenings 
By using AI in medical imaging, physicians can identify conditions much quicker, promoting early intervention.
At Tulane University, researchers discovered that AI can accurately detect and diagnose colorectal cancer by analyzing tissue scans as well or better than pathologists.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether artificial intelligence could be a tool to assist pathologists in keeping up with the rising demand for services.
According to the researchers, pathologists regularly evaluate and label thousands of histopathology images to identify whether a patient has cancer. However, their average workload has significantly increased, which could lead to unintended misdiagnoses.
“Even though a lot of their work is repetitive, most pathologists are extremely busy because there’s a huge demand for what they do but there’s a global shortage of qualified pathologists, especially in many developing countries,” Professor and Director of the Tulane Center of Biomedical Informatics and Genomics at Tulane University School of Medicine, Hong-Wen Deng, PhD, said in a press release.
“This study is revolutionary because we successfully leveraged artificial intelligence to identify and diagnose colorectal cancer in a cost-effective way, which could ultimately reduce the workload of pathologists.”
Additionally, AI can be used in assessing cardiovascular complications.
Measuring various structures of the heart can indicate a patient’s risk for cardiovascular disease. In addition, automating the detection of abnormalities in imaging tests can lead to quicker decision-making and fewer diagnostic errors.
With AI, the technology can identify left atrial enlargement from chest x-rays to rule out other cardiac or pulmonary problems, assisting providers in targeting the appropriate treatments for patients. 
Similar AI tools could be used to automate other measurement tasks, including aortic valve analysis, carina angle measurement, and pulmonary artery diameter.
Applying AI to imaging data could also help identify the thickening of certain muscle structures or monitor changes in blood flow through the heart and associated arteries. AI can be used to detect cancerous lesions.
With AI medical imaging, the technology can also detect fractures, diagnose neurological diseases, identify thoracic complications


Improving precision medicine 
AI can also be implemented into medical imaging to advance precision medicine. For example, at Stanford University, researchers found that a machine learning tool could differentiate between two types of lung cancer.
Additionally, the machine learning tool predicted patient survival rates better than the standard approach of pathologists classifying tumors by grade and stage.
“Pathology as it is practiced now is very subjective,” professor and chair of genetics, Michael Snyder, PhD, said in a press release.
“Two highly skilled pathologists assessing the same slide will agree only about 60 percent of the time. This approach replaces this subjectivity with sophisticated, quantitative measurements that we feel are likely to improve patient outcomes.”
The use of AI takes the subjectively out of the equation. The tool can identify the type of cancer and determine the best course of treatment for the patient, advancing precision medicine efforts. With precision medicine, physicians can provide a personalized treatment approach to specifically target the illness.


Indicating and assessing risk 
While AI can be used in medical imaging to identify current conditions impacting a patient, it can also predict the potential risk for future illnesses.
In a recent study, researchers found that by combining AI imaging techniques with clinical data, physicians could improve predictive models indicating a patient’s risk for heart attacks.
When analyzed together in an artificial intelligence model, researchers discovered that coronary 18F-NaF uptake on PET and quantitative coronary plaque characteristics on CT angiography were complementary and robust predictors of heart attack risk in patients with established coronary artery disease. 
Together, the two techniques could provide more accurate heart attack risk prediction than using clinical data alone. 
“Recently, advanced imaging techniques have demonstrated considerable promise in determining which coronary artery disease patients are most at risk for a heart attack. These techniques include 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) PET, which assesses disease activity in the coronary arteries, and CT angiography, which provides a quantitative plaque analysis,” Director of Innovation in Imaging at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Piotr J. Slomka, PhD, FACC, FASNC, FCCPM, said in a press release. 
“Our goal in the study was to investigate whether the information provided by 18F-NaF PET and CT angiography is complementary and could improve prediction of heart attacks with the use of artificial intelligence techniques.” 
According to the researcher team, their findings supported the use of artificial intelligence methods for integrating multimodality imaging and clinical data for accurately predicting heart attacks.
With AI, machine learning methods can advance medical screenings, enhance precision medicine, analyze patient risk factors, and lighten the load for physicians.

AbstractThis manuscript discusses the relationship between women, technology manifestation, and likely prospects in the developing world. Using India as a case study, the manuscript outlines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics affect women’s opportunities in developing countries. Women in developing countries, notably in South Asia, are perceived as doing domestic work and are underrepresented in high-level professions. They are disproportionately underemployed and face prejudice in the workplace. The purpose of this study is to determine if the introduction of AI would exacerbate the already precarious situation of women in the developing world or if it would serve as a liberating force. While studies on the impact of AI on women have been undertaken in developed countries, there has been less research in developing countries. This manuscript attempts to fill that need.

IntroductionWomen in some South-Asian countries, like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan face significant hardships and problems, ranging from human trafficking to gender discrimination. Compared to their counterparts in developed countries, developing-world women encounter a biased atmosphere. Many South Asian countries have a patriarchal and male-dominated society, and their culture has a strong preference for male offspring (Kristof, 1993; Bhalotra et al., 2020; Oomman and Ganatra, 2002). These countries, particularly India, have experienced instances where technology has been utilized to create gender bias (Guilmoto, 2015). For example, there has been a great misuse of some of the techniques, of which sonography, or ultrasound, is one. The public misappropriated sonography, which was intended to determine the unborn’s health select the fetus’s gender, and perform an abortion if the fetus is female (Alkaabi et al., 2007; Akbulut-Yuksel and Rosenblum, 2012; Bowman-Smart et al., 2020). Many Indian states, particularly the northern states of India, have seen a significant drop in the sex ratio due to this erroneous use of technology. India’s unbalanced child sex ratio has rapidly deteriorated. In 1981, there were 962 females in the 0–6-year age group for every 1000 boys. In 1991, there were 945 girls, then 927 girls in 2001, and 918 girls at the time of the 2011 Census (Bose, 2011; Hu and Schlosser, 2012). In 1994, the Indian government passed the Pre-conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act to halt this trend. The law made it unlawful for medical practitioners to divulge the sex of a fetus due to worries that ultrasound technology was being used to detect the sex of the unborn child and terminate the female fetus (Nidadavolu and Bracken, 2006; Ahankari et al., 2015). However, as the Indian Census data over the years demonstrates, the law did not operate as well as intended. According to public health campaigners, this is due to the Indian government’s failure to enforce the law effectively; sex determination and female feticide continue due to medical practitioners’ lack of oversight. Radiologists and gynecologists, on the other hand, argue that it’s because the law was misguided from the outset, holding the medical profession responsible for a societal problem (Tripathi, 2016).In the realm of artificial intelligence, gender imbalance is a critical issue. Because of how AI systems are developed, gender bias in AI can be problematic. Algorithm developers may be unaware of their prejudices, and implicit biases and unknowingly pass their socially rooted gender prejudices onto robots. This is evident because the present trends in machine learning reinforce historical stereotypes of women, such as humility, mildness, and the need for protection. For instance, security robots are primarily male, but service and sex robots are primarily female. Another example is AI-driven risk analysis in the justice system. The algorithms may overlook the fact that women are less likely to re-offend than men, placing women at a disadvantage. Female gendering increases bots’ perceived humanity and the acceptability of AI. Consumers believe that female AI is more humane and more reliable and therefore more ready to meet users’ particular demands. Because the feminization of robots boosts their marketability, AI is attempting to humanize them by embedding feminist characteristics and striving for acceptability in a male-dominated robotic society. There’s a risk that machine learning technologies will wind up having biases encoded if women don’t make a significant contribution. Diverse teams made up of both men and women are not just better at recognizing skewed data, but they’re also more likely to spot issues that could have dire societal consequences. While women’s characteristics are highly valued in AI robots, protein-basedFootnote 1 women’s jobs are in jeopardy. Presently, women hold only 22% of worldwide AI positions while men hold 78% (World Economic Forum Report, 2018). According to another study by wired.com, only 12% of machine learning researchers are women, which is a concerning ratio for a subject that is meant to transform society (Simonite, 2018). Because women make up such a small percentage of the technological workforce, technology may become the tangible incarnation of male power in the coming years. The situation in the developing world is worse, and hence a cautious approach is required to ensure that a male-dominated society in some of the developing world’s countries does not abuse AI’s power and use it to exacerbate the predicament of women who are already in a precarious situation.This manuscript discusses the relationship between women, technology, manifestation, and probable prospects in the developing world. Taking India as a case study, the manuscript further focuses on how the ontology and epistemology perspectives used in the fields of AI, and robotics will affect the futures of women in developing countries. Women in the developing world, particularly in South Asia, are stereotyped as doing domestic work and have low representation in high-level positions. They are disproportionately underemployed and endure employment discrimination. The article will attempt to explore, whether the introduction of AI would exacerbate the already fragile position of women in South Asia or serve as a liberating force for them. While studies on the influence of AI on women have been conducted in industrialized countries, research in developing countries has been minimal. This manuscript will aim to bridge this gap.The study tests the following hypothesis:H01: The changing lifestyle, growing challenges, and increasing use of AI robots in daily life may not be a threat to the existing human relationship.HA1: The changing lifestyle, growing challenges, and increasing use of AI robots in daily life may be a threat to the existing human relationship.H02: There is no significant difference in the perception of females and males towards AI robots.HA2: There is a significant difference in the perception of females and males towards AI robots.H03: There is no major variation in the requirements and utilization of AI robots between men and women.HA3: There is a considerable difference in the requirements and use of AI robots between men and women.H04: When it comes to the gender of the robots, there is no substantial difference between male and female preferences.HA4: When it comes to the gender of the robots, there is a substantial difference between male and female preferences.The manuscript is divided into four sections. The first section is an introduction, followed by a literature review, methodology, results and discussion, and finally, a conclusion.Literature reviewAI’s basic assumption is that human intellect can be studied and simulated so that computers can be programmed to perform tasks that people can do (Guo, 2015). Alan Turing, the pioneer of AI, felt that to develop intelligent things like homo sapiens, humans ought to be considered as mechanical beings rather than as emotionally manifested super-beings so that they could be studied and replicated (Evers, 2005; Sanders, 2008). Rosalind Picard published “Affective Computing” in 1997, with the basic premise being that if we want smarter computers that interact with people more naturally, we must give them the ability to identify, interpret, and even express emotions. This approach went against popular belief, which held that pure logic was the highest type of AI (Venkatraman, 2020). Many human features have been transferred into non-human robots as a result of AI advancements, and expertise and knowledge will no longer be confined to only humans (Lloyd, 1985). Researchers like Lucy Suchman look at how agencies are now arranged at the human-machine interface and how they might be reimagined creatively and materially (Suchman, 2006). Weber believes that recent advancements in robotics and AI are going towards social robotics, as opposed to past achievements in robotics and AI, which can be attributed to fairly strict, law-oriented, conceding to adaptive human behavior towards machines (Weber, 2005, p. 210). Weber goes on to say that social roboticists want to take advantage of the human predisposition to anthropomorphize machines and connect with them socially by structuring them to look like a woman, a child, or a pet (Weber, 2005, p. 211). Reeves and Nass say humans communicate with artificial media, such as computers, in the same way, that they connect with other humans (Reeves and Naas, 1996). Studies further indicate that humans are increasingly relying on robots, and with the advancement of social artificially intelligent bots such as Alexa and Google Home, comme les companionship between comme les robots and humans is now becoming a reality (de Swarte et al., 2019; Odekerken-Schröder et al., 2020). It is believed that robots will not only get smarter over the next few decades, but they will also establish physical and emotional relationships with humans. This raises a fresh challenge about how people view robots intended for various types of closeness, both as friends and as possible competitors (Nordmo et al., 2020). According to Erika Hayasaki, artificial intelligence will be smarter than humans in the not-too-distant future. However, as technology advances, it may become increasingly racial, misogynistic, and inhospitable to women as it absorbs cultural norms from its designers and the internet (Hayasaki, 2017). The rapid advancement in robot and AI technology has highlighted some important problems with issues of gender bias (Bass, 2017; Leavy, 2018). There are apprehensions that algorithms will be able to target women specifically in the future (Caliskan et al., 2017). Given the increasing prominence of artificial intelligence in our communities, such attitudes risk leaving women stranded in many facets of life (UNESCO Report, 2020; Prives, 2018). Discrimination is no longer a purely human problem, as many decision-makers are aware that discriminating against someone based on an attribute such as sex is illegal and immoral. Therefore, they conceal their true intent behind an innocuous, constructed excuse (Santow, 2020). In the literature surrounding the discipline of Critical Algorithm Series, gender bias is a commonly debated topic (Pillinger, 2019). Donna Haraway published her famous essay titled, “A Cyborg Manifesto” in Socialist Review in 1985. In the essay, she criticized the traditional concepts of feminism as they mainly focus on identity politics. Haraway, inspires a new way of thinking about how to blur the lines between humans and machines and supports coalition-building through affinity (Pohl, 2018). She employs the notion of the cyborg to encourage feminists to think beyond traditional gender, feminism, and politics (Haraway, 1987, 2006). She further claims that, with the help of technology, we may all promote hybrid identities, and people will forget about gender supremacy as they become more attached to their robotics (Haraway, 2008). To date, however, this has not been the case. In recent times, growing machine prejudice is a problem that has sparked great concern in academia, industry research laboratories, and the mainstream commercial media, where trained statistical models, unknown to their developers, have grown to reflect critical societal imbalances like gender or racial bias (Hutson, 2017; Hardesty, 2018; Nurock, 2020; Prates et al., 2020). While previous research indicates that gendered and lifelike robots are perceived as more sentient, the researchers of those studies primarily ignored the distinction between female and male bots (DiMaio, 2021). The study by Sylvie Borau et al. indicates that female artificial intelligence is preferred by customers because it is seen to have more good human attributes than male artificial intelligence, such as affection, understanding, and emotion (Borau et al., 2021). This is consistent with the literature, which suggests that male robots may appear intimidating in the home and that people trust female bots for in-home use (Carpenter, 2009; Niculescu et al., 2010). Another study indicates that when participants’ gender matched the gender of AI personal assistant Siri’s voice, participants exhibited more faith in the machine (Lee et al., 2021). Human–robot-interaction (HRI) researchers have undertaken various studies on gender impacts to determine if men or women are more inclined to prefer or dislike robots. According to research, males showed more positive attitudes toward interacting with social robots than females in general (Lin et al., 2012), and females had more negative attitudes regarding robot interactions than males in particular (Nomura and Kanda, 2003; Nomura et al., 2006). In another study, Nomura urged researchers to explore whether gendering robots for specific roles is truly required to foster human–robot interaction (Nomura, 2017). The investigation by R. A. Søraa demonstrates how gendering practices of humans influence mechanical species of robots, concluding that the more sapient a robot grows, the more gendered it may become (Søraa, 2017). “I am for more women in robotics, not for more female robots,” Martina Mara, director of the RoboPsychology R & D division at the Ars Electronica Futurelab, adds (Hieslmair, 2017). While there is a large body of work describing gender bias in AI robots in developed countries, little research has been done on the impact of AI robots on women in developing and undeveloped countries. This article will try to bridge the gaps in the studies.MethodologyThe overarching purpose of this exploratory project is to look at gender and feminist issues in artificial intelligence from a developing-world perspective. It also intends to depict how men and women in developing countries react to the prospect of having robot lovers, companions, and helpers in their everyday lives. A vignette experiment was conducted with 125 female and 100 male volunteers due to the lack of commercial availability of such robots. The survey was distributed online, which aided in the recruitment of volunteers. The vast majority of those who responded (76%) were university students from India. Because the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic phase, the questionnaire was prepared in Google Form and distributed to participants via WhatsApp group and email. The participants ranged from 16 to 60 years old, with an average age of 27.25 (SD = 7.722) years. The vignette was created to portray a futuristic human existence as well as a variety of futuristic robots and their influence on people. The extracts from the vignette are: “At today’s science fair, Sam and Sophie, who are husband and wife, came across a variety of AI robots, including domestic robots, sex robots, doctor robots, nurse robots, engineer robots, personal assistant robots, and so on. This made them pleasantly surprised, and they were left to believe that in the future, AI robot technology will become so sophisticated that it will develop as an efficient alternative to protein-based humans. Back at home, Sophie utilizes Google Assistant and Alexa Assistant in the form of AI devices in the couple’s house to listen to music, cook food recipes, and entertain their children, while Sam uses them to get weather information, traffic information, book products online, set reminders, and so on. Mesmerized by the advancements in AI technology displayed at the science fair, Sam jokingly told Sophie that if there was a beautiful robot that could do household chores and give love and care to a partner, then the person would not need a marriage nor would he have to go through problems like break-up and divorce. Sophie disagreed, believing that the robot could not grasp or duplicate the person’s feelings and mood. Sam disagreed, claiming that a protein-based individual isn’t immune to these flaws either, because if that had been the case, human relationships would be devoid of misery, pain, violence, and breakups. Sophie thought that people need a companion but are unwilling to put up with human imperfections and that many people love the feminine traits inherent in AI robots but do not want to engage in a true relationship with real women.” After the respondents had finished reading the vignettes, they were handed the questionnaire and asked to fill it out. The questions were all delivered in English, with translation services available if necessary. Participation was entirely voluntary, and respondents were offered the option of remaining anonymous and not disclosing any further personal information such as their address, email address, or phone number. The participants gave their informed consent, and the participants’ personal information was kept private and confidential.In this study, a varied group was subjected to demographic data sheets as well as a self-developed questionnaire. The people that have been surveyed are of different sexes, ages, educational levels, and marital statuses. The purposive (simple random) sampling technique was used to attain the objectives.The research was conducted using a self-developed questionnaire. All the items on the scale were analyzed using IBM SPSS®23. Mean, standard deviation, total-item correlation, regression, and reliability analysis were performed on all the items. The questionnaire measured the items of AI using the following four scales: perspective, gender, requirements/use, and the threat of using AI. The alpha has been set to default 0.05 as a cut-off for significance.Results and discussionTable 1 shows a positive and significant intra-correlation between factors, such as perceptions towards AI robots, AI robot use and requirements, robot gender, and the threat from AI robots.Table 1 Correlation table.Full size tableA regression study to identify threat factors with respect to AI robots is shown in Table 2. The threat posed by AI robots is predicted by people’s perception of AI robots and the gender of AI robots. As a result, the hypothesis, that the changing lifestyle, growing challenges, and increasing use of AI robots in daily life may be a threat to the various existing human relationships is accepted. It could be inferred that people may be more motivated to live with AI robots due to changing lifestyles and increasing challenges and complications in human relationships (see Fig. 1). The majority of the respondents believe that greater use and reliance on AI robot technology will jeopardize the existence of protein-based people and lead to more prejudiced, discriminatory, and solitary societies. This is in support of the findings of the study, which show that people have an innate dread that robots will one day outwit them to the point that they will start exploiting humans (see Fig. 2). Moreover, the majority of respondents feel that AI may have a significant impact on gender balance in countries like India and that it may also affect gender balance in the subcontinent. This is in line with past concerns in India about the misuse of sonography technology (see Fig. 3).Table 2 Regression table.Full size tableFig. 1: Changing lifestyles and growing challenges in human relationships may make people inclined to adapt to AI robots.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 2: AI robots may endanger human existence and lead to a society that is increasingly prejudiced, discriminatory, and solitary.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 3: The gender balance in developing countries will be impacted as a result of human–AI interaction.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageTable 3 exhibits the results of the t-test. The results portray a significant difference between male and female respondents on the perception of AI robots. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternate hypothesis stating that there is a significant difference in the perception of females and males towards AI robots can be accepted. The t-test further indicates that there exists no significant difference between males and females on the requirements and use of AI robots, as no significant gender difference was found on the requirements and use of AI robots by both males and females. The majority of respondents believe that living with AI robots will become a reality soon (see Fig. 4) and that the AI robots’ ethnic and racial appearance may have a significant impact on consumers’ AI robot purchasing preferences (see Figs. 5 and 6). The respondents also advocated different ethical programming for the female and male robots (see Fig. 7). However, as far as the use of robots is concerned, it is evident that all other categories of robots have shown roughly equal demand from both males and females, except for sex and love robots, where the gender discrepancy is more than twice, with 24% of males and 8.8% of females indicating a need for sex and love robots (see Fig. 8). Assistant robots, teaching robots, entertainment robots, robots that do household tasks and errands, and robots that offer care were among the most popular. Females showed the least interest in sex and love robots, while males showed the least interest in companion and friendship robots. Overall, 15.56% of respondents said they were open to having sex and love robots. This demonstrates the general concern and reluctance to engage in sexual or romantic relationships with AI computers. Females, on the other hand, appear to be more hesitant and averse to engaging in intimacy with robots than males. The key reasons for this are sentiments of envy and insecurity. The study’s findings also show that males in developing countries have a more favorable attitude toward sex robots than females. This confirms the existence of gender differences in emotional intimacy and sex preferences (Johnson, 2004). Sex robots have the potential to reduce or eliminate prostitution, human trafficking, and sex tourism for women (Yeoman and Mars, 2012) in developing countries. According to data from the Indian government’s National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), 95% of trafficked people in India are forced into prostitution (Divya, 2020; Munshi, 2020).Table 3 Mean, SD and p-values on different dimensions of AI robots (N = 225) (t-test) (alpha is set to the default 0.05).Full size tableFig. 4: Living with AI robots will become a reality in the near future.Total number of respondents:225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 5: The racial and ethnic appearance of AI robots impacts the purchase decision of their buyers.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 6: In the future, some individuals may replace human companions with AI analogs.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 7: Separate ethical norms for male and female robots are required.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 8: Artificial intelligence robots and their use.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageThe t-test further indicates that there exists no significant difference between male and female respondents as far as the gender of the robots is concerned. However, the analysis of mean figures indicates that the majority of respondents believe that gender has a role in AI robot development and production (see Fig. 9), and AI will have a greater impact on both men and women (see Fig. 10), but when asked which gender AI will have the greatest impact on, both genders answer that AI will have the greatest impact on their gender (see Fig. 11). While most people disagreed with the premise that female robots are seen by them as more humane (see Fig. 12), they did agree that female robots are regarded differently by them (see Fig. 13). They further agreed that feminizing robots improves their marketability and acceptance (see Fig. 14), and that corporations are using feminity to humanize non-human things like AI robots (see Fig. 15). The responses also indicate that a majority of the respondents (55.11%) believe that the use of feminine features in robots increases the risk of females being stereotyped (see Fig. 16).Fig. 9: Gender has a role in AI robot development and production.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 10: AI robots may unduly favor one gender over the other.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 11: The gender that is more likely to be impacted by their AI counterparts.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 12: Female AI robots are more humane than Male robots.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 13: Women are perceived differently even when they are AI robots.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 14: The feminization of AI robots makes them more marketable and acceptable.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 15: Feminity is being used to humanize non-human creatures such as AI robots.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 16: Increased adoption of feminine traits in AI robots would put females at risk of being stereotyped.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageConclusionThe gendering of the robots in AI is problematic and does not always lead to the desired improved acceptability, as gender makes no difference in terms of robot functionality and performance. The study contradicts the widely held belief that women in developing nations such as India are wary about living with AI robots in the near future. It also shows that both men and women feel AI will have a stronger impact on both males and females. The majority of respondents dissented that female robots are considered more commiserate than male robots, but they accede to the fact that female robots are perceived differently, even when they are robots. The majority of respondents feel that AI will have a significant impact on gender balance in nations like India just like the sonography technique that was misused for doing gender selection. However, they are in general agreement with the fact that people may be motivated to live with AI robots due to changing lifestyles and increasing challenges and complications in human relationships. Due to the rising cost of maintaining a protein-based lifestyle, humans may turn to robots to eschew the issues that come with it. The study also found people in developing countries have an innate dread that robots will one day outwit them.

NotesThe term “protein-based” has been used in the manuscript as a synonym for “humans”, with the understanding that, except for water and fat, the human body is virtually entirely made up of protein. Muscles, bones, organs, skin, and nails are all made up of protein. Muscles are made up of around 80% protein, excluding water.ReferencesAhankari AS, Myles P, Tata LJ, Fogarty AW (2015) Banning of fetal sex determination and changes in sex ratio in India.

Using India as a case study, the manuscript outlines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics affect women’s opportunities in developing countries. Women in developing countries, notably in South Asia, are perceived as doing domestic work and are underrepresented in high-level professions. They are disproportionately underemployed and face prejudice in the workplace. The purpose of this study is to determine if the introduction of AI would exacerbate the already precarious situation of women in the developing world or if it would serve as a liberating force. While studies on the impact of AI on women have been undertaken in developed countries, there has been less research in developing countries.

Cognitive rail pilot: can robots take over train driving?

AI or Artificial Intelligence concept with train light trails and industrial factory.

The artificial intelligence (AI) based system Cognitive Rail Pilot acquired the Declaration of Conformity to the regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union, meaning that it can start its deployment in several countries. The system is designed to assist locomotive drivers during operations by predicting and avoiding possible hazards.

The system was developed by the company Cognitive Pilot, and its functions allow rail companies, professionals and enthusiasts to take a look at the future of rail freight. The way it works not only assists the locomotive drivers but also takes over the hard part of their job- the management of dangerous situations. “The locomotive driver profession is one of the most challenging and dangerous – you have to work to the limit. Robots can take away the driver’s routine workload and assist in emergencies,” comments the company’s CEO Olga Uskova.
Robots taking over
Robots, as we fictionally imagine them, might not take the seat in the locomotive’s driving booth. However, they will have a crucial role in recognising the train’s route and providing functions such as stopping at a red light, stopping in danger of collision, stopping before a closed arrow, and high-precision locating of the locomotive.

Of course, AI will be the game changer in this case. As we have seen happening in terminal operations, AI will be the enabler of taking the next step to safe rail freight operations. “The AI-based system allows the locomotive to ‘see’ and ‘understand’ the situation along the way with high accuracy, to warn the driver of the danger, and in case of lack of response, to perform a safe stop automatically. In addition, using a set of special algorithms, the system allows the location and dynamics of the locomotive to be determined with a very high degree of accuracy,” explains the company.

Apart from the software system, the new generation locomotives will also need to equip with some hardware. Specifically, the system comprises three components: A multi-zone video camera that tracks the locomotive’s route and helps the system navigate, a specialised high-resolution millimetre-wave radar to locate any obstacles, and finally, an industrial-grade computing unit to support the system’s functions.

Licenced and ready to go
By acquiring the Eurasian Economic Union’s declaration of conformity, which ensures the system’s safety, Cognitive Rail Pilot is ready to start delivering its products in countries like Armenia, Kazakhstan and Belarus while more countries are about to follow.
“This declaration of conformity with the Eurasian Economic Union technical regulations requirements is the result of comprehensive tests of the Cognitive Rail Pilot system, that took place in 2021, and is an important step for the system’s further development and scaling,” says Uskova. Indeed the system underwent multiple tests in facilities belonging to the Russian Railways in which it succeeded. The tests included examining the software source code and testing hardware on dozens of parameters like electromagnetic compatibility, noise resistance, vibration resistance, compliance with climatic norms and resistance to moisture.

Photo: Vjeran PavicSocial media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an “AI supercomputer” — a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world’s fastest. “Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.” The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like Microsoft and Nvidia have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta’s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company’s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse — the company’s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.“RSC will help Meta’s AI researchers build new and better AI models”“RSC will help Meta’s AI researchers build new and better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds of different languages; seamlessly analyze text, images, and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and much more,” write Meta engineers Kevin Lee and Shubho Sengupta in a blog post outlining the news.  “We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together.”Meta’s AI supercomputer is due to be complete by mid-2022.  Image: MetaWork on RSC began a year and a half ago, with Meta’s engineers designing the machine’s various systems — cooling, power, networking, and cabling — entirely from scratch. Phase one of RSC is already up and running and consists of 760 Nvidia GGX A100 systems containing 6,080 connected GPUs (a type of processor that’s particularly good at tackling machine learning problems). Meta says it’s already providing up to 20 times improved performance on its standard machine vision research tasks. Before the end of 2022, though, phase two of RSC will be complete. At that point, it’ll contain some 16,000 total GPUs and will be able to train AI systems “with more than a trillion parameters on data sets as large as an exabyte.” (This raw number of GPUs only provides a narrow metric for a system’s overall performance, but, for comparison’s sake, Microsoft’s AI supercomputer built with research lab OpenAI is built from 10,000 GPUs.)These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change?The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy. AI supercomputers and regular supercomputers can’t necessarily be compared apples to applesThe brief explanation is that machine learning requires less accuracy than the tasks put to traditional supercomputers, and so “AI supercomputers” (a bit of recent branding) can carry out more calculations per second than their regular brethren using the same hardware. That means when Meta says it’s built the “world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” it’s not necessarily a direct comparison to the supercomputers you often see in the news (rankings of which are compiled by the independent Top500.org and published twice a year). To explain this a little more, you need to know that both supercomputers and AI supercomputers make calculations using what is known as floating-point arithmetic — a mathematical shorthand that’s extremely useful for making calculations using very large and very small numbers (the “floating point” in question is the decimal point, which “floats” between significant figures). The degree of accuracy deployed in floating-point calculations can be adjusted based on different formats, and the speed of most supercomputers is calculated using what are known as 64-bit floating-point operations per second, or FLOPs. However, because AI calculations require less accuracy, AI supercomputers are often measured in 32-bit or even 16-bit FLOPs. That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers. Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.” In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeTesla’s big, epic, confusing future | The Vergecast

“Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.” 

The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like Microsoft and Nvidia have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta’s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company’s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse — the company’s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.

""“RSC will help Meta’s AI researchers build new and better AI models”""

“RSC will help Meta’s AI researchers build new and better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds of different languages; seamlessly analyze text, images, and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and much more,” write Meta engineers Kevin Lee and Shubho Sengupta in a blog post outlining the news.  

“We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together.”

[Image: Meta’s AI supercomputer is due to be complete by mid-2022. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wLPsoiuCIAykDzohYja3qTttGnw=/0x0:1128x598/1128x598/filters:focal(564x299:565x300)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23190900/Screenshot_2022_01_24_at_12.52.44.png]

Work on RSC began a year and a half ago, with Meta’s engineers designing the machine’s various systems — cooling, power, networking, and cabling — entirely from scratch. Phase one of RSC is already up and running and consists of 760 Nvidia GGX A100 systems containing 6,080 connected GPUs (a type of processor that’s particularly good at tackling machine learning problems). Meta says it’s already providing up to 20 times improved performance on its standard machine vision research tasks. 

Before the end of 2022, though, phase two of RSC will be complete. At that point, it’ll contain some 16,000 total GPUs and will be able to train AI systems “with more than a trillion parameters on data sets as large as an exabyte.” (This raw number of GPUs only provides a narrow metric for a system’s overall performance, but, for comparison’s sake, Microsoft’s AI supercomputer built with research lab OpenAI is built from 10,000 GPUs.)

These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change?

The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy. 

""AI supercomputers and regular supercomputers can’t necessarily be compared apples to apples""

The brief explanation is that machine learning requires less accuracy than the tasks put to traditional supercomputers, and so “AI supercomputers” (a bit of recent branding) can carry out more calculations per second than their regular brethren using the same hardware. That means when Meta says it’s built the “world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” it’s not necessarily a direct comparison to the supercomputers you often see in the news (rankings of which are compiled by the independent Top500.org and published twice a year). 

To explain this a little more, you need to know that both supercomputers and AI supercomputers make calculations using what is known as floating-point arithmetic — a mathematical shorthand that’s extremely useful for making calculations using very large and very small numbers (the “floating point” in question is the decimal point, which “floats” between significant figures). The degree of accuracy deployed in floating-point calculations can be adjusted based on different formats, and the speed of most supercomputers is calculated using what are known as 64-bit floating-point operations per second, or FLOPs. However, because AI calculations require less accuracy, AI supercomputers are often measured in 32-bit or even 16-bit FLOPs. That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers. 

Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.” 

In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.

Artificial intelligence has personalised customer experiences through the vast amounts of data generated through the various machine learning and data science tools. Overall, it has not only impacted our professional lives and has also deeply affected our personal lives. But even after such advancements in technology, AI still needs human intervention. Researchers and scientists are innovating new ways to automate activities in our daily lives, but AI still needs human intervention at its helm to perform efficiently. .Advanced technologies like self-driving cars, drones, flying robots, and such call for driverless operations. But enterprise AI needs third-party intervention to accurately perform and depend on humans for further instruction on operations. .So, why does AI still need human intervention?.Firstly, the idea that AI will make most of the workforce employed has got several researchers and scientists to develop such machines that will be handled by humans too. Automating processes will make operations error-free but it will make the human workforce obsolete. Besides, there are not enough experiments on human-robot collaboration models that will produce accurate results with the same efficiency to satisfy customers. .AI is best applied when it is both monitored and augmented by people. When that happens, people move up the skill continuum, take on more complex challenges while the AI continues to learn, improve, and keep in check the potentially harmful effects of AI. Using advanced models like conversational AI and cognitive AI in collaboration with real people who possess the expertise, ingenuity, and empathy, leads to more positive outcomes from the intelligent systems. .Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Already it is unleashing the power of data across a range of crucial functions such as customer service, marketing, training, pricing, security, surgeries, automobiles, and so on. To remain competitive, firms in nearly every industry will need to adopt AI. The role of AI in businesses has modified considerably from its preliminary creation on the threshold of an enterprise in their innovation labs to the modern-day, while human beings are starting to recognize that it has the ability to convert businesses from the center out..According to the reports, Artificial Intelligence will be better than human beings in translating languages by 2024, promoting items by 2031, and conducting surgical procedures by 2053. Businesses are using AI to enhance the productiveness of their employees. The advantage of AI for enterprise is that it handles repetitive tasks throughout an organization simply so that employees can focus on creative solutions, complicated problem solving, and impactful work. The idea of the workplace may also be redefined through the arrival of technology. The future work may be distinctly flexible. The concept of 'Work from Home' may be the brand-new norm and virtual meetings and conferences will be the normal practice. There are many AI Strategies that will help enterprises increase their revenue. These strategies will not just maximize the revenue but also it will help the businesses to reduce spending additional capital on many things such as cyber-attacks, repetitive tasks, and the list will go on. Here are the top AI strategies for businesses that will help your organization increase profits..TOP ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INTERNSHIPS TO APPLY FOR IN JAN 2022TOP AI AND DATA SCIENCE HACKATHONS TO APPLY FOR IN 2022THE FUTURE OF INDIAN POLICING WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN 2022 AND BEYOND .Top AI Strategies.AI as Risk Management.The AI collects actionable insights from numerous data reasserts and structures to assist with root motive evaluation. This will reduce attacks from outsiders and it will help the company to protect its data and crucial information..AutoML.The demand for AI skills has grown faster and it's difficult to imagine a business that wouldn't benefit from the detailed analysis of AI and machine learning algorithms performantly. It automates the process of applying machine learning techniques to data. Usually, a data scientist would spend their time on pre-processing, selecting features, selecting and tuning models, and then evaluating the results. AutoML will be able to automate tasks (such as preprocessing, selecting features, selecting and tuning models, evaluating results, etc.) and can provide high-performing results to certain problems..AI in Analyzing Problems.While data is the most appetizing target for every cyber-attack, companies can also use data against them via advanced data analytics consisting of machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), statistics visualization, and so forth. This will help enterprises from spending much on problem-solving or from robing business data..AI with Customers.Consumers usually look around and compare different options while purchasing. They even go through social media handles of businesses and demand special treatment. AI allows a business organization to get through such customers in a far-reaching manner. This allows a business to engage in a real-time, one-on-one conversation with consumers..Automation.Data automation is the process of uploading, handling, and processing data via automated tools, instead of manually performing all these tasks. It enables the organization to manage big data and innovate the pace of business. The data collected across an organization's business units, applications, and external sources is growing exponentially.  Big data is crucial for faster, more informed decision-making..AI as Workforce.The consensus amongst many specialists is that some professions might be definitely computerized. A group of senior-level tech executives who contain the Forbes Technology Council named 13, which include insurance underwriting, warehouse, and production jobs, consumer service, studies and information entry, long haul trucking, and a fairly disconcertingly wide class titled &quot;Any Tasks That Can Be Learned.&quot; Accountants, manufacturing unit employees, truckers, paralegals, and radiologists — simply to name a few..AI- Chatbots.Chatbots have been around for ages. But with the evolution of AI, chatbots have ended up being more in time-saving, process-efficiency-riding technology play..With time, chatbots at the moment are smarter with the aid of using distinctive features of understanding and experience, and its application. Responses from chatbots are consequently more meaningful, and the performance of communications with clients and people has improved..Chatbots can act as a scalable way for bridging the distance among people and management, with the aid of using making data more effortlessly available to people..Chatbots also are being used to survey people, in a real-time, issue-particular format. This is a notable improvement for the efficient checking out the group of workers pulse, employee engagement, and well-known place of job sentiment, a system that formerly could have taken weeks to complete. So, on this application, ability problems may be diagnosed and addressed earlier than they turn out to be the foremost troubles for the organization..AI- Writers.For instance, writing jobs. AI can effortlessly generate textual content which is indistinguishable from human writing. This form of AI job automation is helping enterprises to maximize their revenue. It's anticipated that robots don't tire, don't require payment, and may generate a vast quantity of content material..For example Ryte, Writesonic, Article Forge..AI- Support.This AI isn't restrained to writing. AI is likewise automating jobs in customer service, accounting, and a bunch of different professions. For instance, groups like Thankful, Yext, and Forethought use AI to automate client support. This shift is frequently imperceptible to the client, who doesn't recognize if they're talking to a biological intelligence or a machine. The upward push of AI-powered customer service has huge implications for the workforce. It's anticipated that 85 percent of client interactions are already dealt with without human interaction..AI in Increasing Productivity.It automates redundant tasks and helps in keeping workers happy also it has high computational power. Fear for job security often comes intertwined with mentioning AI in the context of the workplace. It has been predicted that AI will render various jobs redundant and replace half of the workforce by 2033. It will replace many jobs, but at the same time, it will create many new, more fulfilling jobs. While AI directly improves employee productivity by automating redundant and mundane tasks, it indirectly helps with increased work satisfaction in employees. AI tools have been deployed to analyze the emojis and certain keywords used on workplace communication platforms like Slack, so using these, you can subjectively gauge employee satisfaction in your workplace.AI is superior to its human counterpart when it comes to solving complex problems and recognizing patterns. For instance, we have AI programs that can scan complex legal documents to fetch relevant information. This frees employees to focus on tasks that add value to your business.AI in Increasing Sales.AI creates targeted marketing strategies. AI can be leveraged to analyze data and identify patterns in consumer behavior in your sales funnel faster and with more accuracy than a human. Post-processing, your sales team will be left with only high-quality leads, which won't require much vetting. A solid marketing strategy is a core to the success of any organization, and targeting your campaigns to reach the right audience will give you the best results. AI-powered marketing tools like chatbots, advertising platforms, and data-collection systems will be helpful in this venture. AI can also generate personalized content based on customer data in the CRM, and this will further help in automating a sales pursuit..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

It has changed the way people and businesses work, and it is now swiftly becoming a necessary component of modern combat..One of the criteria that determines how powerful a country is the strength of its army. When compared to other parts, investment in this industry is the largest in some of the most developed countries. A significant portion of this investment is dedicated to rigorous research and development in current technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) in military applications. AI-enabled military devices are able to efficiently handle large amounts of data. Furthermore, due to their enhanced computation and decision-making skills, such technologies have improved self-regulation, self-control, and self-actuation..Applications of AI in Defence.Training.Training and simulation are diverse fields that employ system and software engineering ideas to create models that can assist soldiers in training on different fighting systems used in actual military operations. Various sensor simulation programmes have already been launched by the US Navy and Army..Furthermore, augmented and VR technology techniques can be used to construct training simulations that are effective, authentic, and dynamic. Both virtual entities and human soldiers can benefit from the reinforcement tactics..Surveillance.AI combined with geospatial analysis can aid in the extraction of useful information from linked devices like radars and autonomous identification systems. This data can aid in the detection of any unlawful or suspicious activity, as well as alerting the appropriate authorities. Target recognition and classification can also be aided by AI-enabled robots and IoT-enabled computer vision..Ammunition and Arms.AI-enabled technology is now incorporated in new-age weaponry. Advanced missiles, for example, can estimate and examine the target level for kill zones without the need for human participation..Cybersecurity.After land, sea, and air, cyberspace is currently regarded as the third war front in military circles. A hacked and malevolent network might jeopardise the security of the entire region. Machine learning is being used by defence agencies to forecast and protect against unauthorised intrusions. In most cases, intrusion detection is accomplished by categorising the network as either normal or invasive. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques aid in improving the accuracy of such categorization..Logistics.Logistics is one of the most critical variables in determining whether or not a military mission succeeds. ML and geospatial analysis are integrated with military logistic systems to decrease effort, time, and error..Use of AI in Militaries Around World.Russia's military might is well-known around the world. The Foundations for Advanced Research Projects is the country's equivalent of DARPA in the United States. Top leaders have been observed promoting the development of AI-based technology for the military. According to reports, the Russian military is considering using AI, big data, and ML to conduct more effective information operations. Russia is currently investing extensively in artificial intelligence (AI) for the identification, analysis, and refutation of misinformation in both the commercial and defence sectors..India is also taking small measures to incorporate AI-based technology into its combat and surveillance projects. In reality, the Ministry of Defence formed a high-level Defence AI Council (DAIC) in 2019, tasked with delivering strategic direction for AI adoption in the defence sector. The major objective of the DAIC is to guide government-industry collaboration for the deployment of such breakthroughs..Conclusion.One of the primary challenges with deploying AI-based technologies is the financial and expertise investment required. How much can we afford to fund infrastructure capabilities for constructing such technologies, especially in middle-income nations like India, where a large portion of the population is still living in poverty, is a huge challenge. The conceivable solution is for policymakers to determine which AI programmes are required for national security and to strive toward them..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
