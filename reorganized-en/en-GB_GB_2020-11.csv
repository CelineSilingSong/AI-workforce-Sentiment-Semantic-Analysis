by Richie SantosdiazNovember 7, 2020November 5, 2020LinkedInTwitterFacebookWhatsAppTelegramCopy LinkShareArtificial Intelligence (AI)’s role in the Middle East is a similar trend that it faces across the rest of the world, meaning it has grown in importance, relevance and economic value.Various countries across the Middle East have placed an emphasis on AI. Clear examples of that have been nation-wide strategies around AI and part of wider government digital transformations. In the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), economic development diversifications such as Saudi Vision 2030 has prioritised wider future and innovative economies. Sectors such as fintech and AI-both fintech and non-fintech related- play a strong role in that.It is not just nation-wide economic development diversification strategies such as Vision 2030 but also, complimenting and in parallel, strategies purely around AI. For example, the UAE has its Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031. To note, the UAE has prioritised a commitment to “smart,” advocating application and adoption of exponential technologies (such as AI) to transform business, government, and society.Its commitment to wider digital transformation is pretty clear, as it ranks the highest in the Arab World (and 12th globally) in digital competitiveness. With respect to AI it was also the first country in the world to have a State Ministry of AI. Dubai, for instance, from 2015 to 2018, attracted a total of $21.6 billion in foreign direct investments (FDI) for artificial intelligence and robotics, said to be the highest in the world. Also, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala announced that it will become an investor in Group42 (G42), an artificial intelligence and cloud computing company, via the integration of Injazat and Khazna Data Centers (Khazna).Recent estimates of AI contribution to economic growth suggest significant positive impact on Middle East GDP—more than USD 300 billion by 2031, according to a report from PwC IMAGE SOURCE GETTYRecent estimates of AI contribution to economic growth suggest significant positive impact on Middle East GDP—more than $300 billion by 2031, according to a report from PwC. In the UAE, for instance, it is expected to contribute almost $100 billion USD (or around under 14% of its gross domestic product (GDP). In the GCC4 (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman), the AI contribution to the economy is expected to be almost $46 billion by 2030 – around 8.2% of its GDP.Saudi Arabia at its recent Global AI Summit in October revealed its new National Strategy for Data & AI (NSDAI); by 2030, Saudi Arabia’s vision is to become the place where the best of Data and AI is made reality. Under the strategy, Saudi Arabia will implement a multi-phase, multi-faceted plan that includes skills, policy and regulation, investment, research and innovation, and ecosystem development. During the launch, HE Dr. Abdullah Bin Sharaf Alghamdi, President of SDAIA, said, “The National Strategy for Data and AI sets the direction and foundations upon which we will unlock the potential of data and AI to fulfil our national transformation priorities and establish Saudi Arabia as a global hub for data and AI.” AI can contribute an estimated $135 billion to its GDP, which corresponds to 12.4% of the national GDP.Beyond the GCC but within the Middle East region, examples of prioritisation in AI include countries like Egypt and Israel. First, in Egypt, the government is looking to develop AI capabilities in a number of ways, including launching its first AI faculty at Kafr El Sheikh University. Egypt is aiming to have 7.7 percent of its GDP, or almost $43 billion, derived through AI by 2030.Second, Tel Aviv headquartered BlackSwan Technologies launched as the world’s first enterprise AI operating system, enabling any company to leverage the most advanced artificial intelligence for an unprecedented level of operational efficiency and data-driven decision making. This has included its recent partnership with Deloitte, to provide banks an AI-powered platform.According to BlackSwan’s founder and CEO Michael Ouliel, “We believe this represents a true paradigm shift in enterprise software, eliminating all barriers to digital transformation so that enterprises can easily harness big data and artificial intelligence to generate immediate and actionable business insights. Our aim is to completely disrupt the enterprise software market by finally making the world’s most advanced artificial intelligence available to any company.”42% of the total sum invested in high-tech in Israel went towards AI technologies in 2019 IMAGE SOURCE GETTYAs a whole in Israel, last year, 42% of the total sum invested in high-tech went towards AI technologies. Despite Israel’s strong tech and AI sector, the country has yet to adopt a national AI strategy, which many in the tech community have flagged. Last year, a report by the government’s Innovation Authority urged authorities to adopt a national strategy to include boosting Israel’s data science engineers, supercomputing infrastructure, as well as allocate more public money to R&D.Other countries such as Turkey, are also preparing to launch its own national AI strategy. From AI as a whole, Turkey, given its large population and economy, has had an active AI scene. In fact, from an AI Middle East and Africa (MEA) report commissioned by Microsoft and conducted by EY, it was Turkey, based on the relative spend on AI transactions in MEA from 2008-2018, that received the top spot $3.49 billion with 252 deals (beating second place the UAE at $2.15 billion with 160 deals).On a final note, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, AI has been important across various aspects of our lives. This has been aided of course by fintech but AI as a whole has played roles in keeping the global population safe and healthy. From thermal cameras in large shopping malls to contact tracing and other streamlined services such as with payments – the solutions seem to be endless.AI in its adopting in the Middle East is nothing unique. Nevertheless, its embracement of it as a whole, integration of its solutions and creating its own innovations are remarkable.Author Richie SantosdiazExecutive Economic Development Advisor (Emerging Markets) | Contributor LinkedInTwitterFacebookWhatsAppTelegramCopy LinkShare",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But while these changes are predicted for the future, they’re already present in many organizations for many different jobs. The situation brings to mind the William Gibson comment, “The future is already here—it’s just not evenly distributed.” The jobs and work processes described below are an example of this phenomenon. It’s a clear example of an existing set of jobs that have been transformed by AI and related tools.

You may have noticed that lots of companies today create content, and massive quantities of it. Whether a software company, an industrial company, or a healthcare company, they all create content—marketing materials, product and service documentation, website content, investor relations reports, etc, etc. In a few cases, some of this content may be generated by artificial intelligence. But the vast majority of it is created by human writers—not professional writers, necessarily, but humans who write.

That creates a series of problems for organizations. Not everybody is a great writer. Humans who write misspell words, employ bad grammar, use inappropriate tone, insert words they shouldn’t use, refer to the same thing in different ways—you’ve seen all these issues as you read content generated by companies. People who worry about these issues used to be called “copy editors,” but now they’re often called something related to “content”—content creators, content strategists, content designers, digital content writers, and even “Senior Manager, Content Systems.” Most of the companies that use these “content” titles are tech firms, but some other types of companies, including household names like Mastercard and Transamerica, also use them.

PROMOTED
 That “Content Systems” title is the job that Jennifer Schmich has at Intuit, the successful provider of personal and small business financial software including QuickBooks, TurboTax and Mint. Schmich has the responsibility of using systems—AI included—to make Intuit’s content better. Thousands of people at Intuit write content, and she has to figure out a way to improve its quality and its conformity to meet corporate standards. You can tell that Intuit cares about this because they hire people like Schmich, and the company also has a publicly-accessible website that describes various aspects of their content design approach.

Writer—the AI Software, That Is—at Intuit
One of the systems that Jennifer Schmich uses in her role as an Intuit Senior Manager of Content Systems comes from Writer, a San Francisco-based startup that has built an AI writing assistant for business writing. It uses AI (machine learning and natural language processing) to make real-time content suggestions to employees to keep their content clear and consistent with the company-approved messaging and approved terminology. In addition to Intuit, Writer has a number of tech-oriented companies as customers, including Twitter, Bill.com, and UiPath.

Writer focuses on four different aspects of content:


Foundations of great writing—Grammar, spelling, style, the correct reading level, and format (of course, word processing systems like MS Word are often used to correct grammar and spelling, but Writer goes well beyond them);
Editorial—Writing style, general and company-specific conventions, copyediting (to use Oxford commas or not, for example);
Interpersonal—Accessibility, sensitivity, inclusivity, sarcasm, and tone;
Brand—Reusable messaging describing the brand, specific terminology to use or not use, discussing a company’s value proposition in a consistent fashion.

Different functions or units within a company may care about one of these more than the others—Human Resources, for example, is primarily focused on interpersonal issues. Marketing is also a common customer of Writer, particularly for marketing and brand-oriented writing. But a “Content” function can address all of the different writing objectives and issues.

 The Writer software allows people to type their content—at Intuit, typically with a Google Docs or Microsoft Word plugin—and as they do so they get suggestions. One might say, “This is not our preferred style—use “you” to communicate with customers when possible.” The content creators don’t have to leave their workspace and workflow to use Writer. The suggestions, which are normally created by Intuit’s Style Council, can be delivered it to anybody who is writing anywhere on the Intuit network. They can accept the suggestion, ignore it, reject it, or provide feedback, such as “We need to add this term to our taxonomy.” If the content is banned, which at Intuit is the case for certain words such as “blacklist,” (considered racist) or locational cues like “bottom left,” (considered ableist) and the writer leaves in the banned content, it will be flagged for review. The document may also be flagged as needing a wholesale edit, which often happens when content from external agencies that’s submitted to Intuit is run through Writer.
Intuit was an early customer of Writer (originally known as Qordoba). Jennifer Schmich led the effort to bring in the software to Intuit. The company has a lot of different people and teams across the company that create content—including technical documentation, customer support, marketing, and product content—and some are quite large. The QuickBooks product, for example, has forty or so people producing product content alone. Many of these distributed content creators, Schmich said, are not professional writers and don’t have the same sensibilities and objectives as a writer. She saw Writer as a way to improve and scale the content creation processes without a lot of human intervention.
Schmich had originally been a copywriter, but over time became increasingly interested in how technology could improve content processes. She made up the “Senior Manager, Content Systems” job title with her boss several years ago. The Content team at Intuit was particularly interested in creating more inclusive language, including avoiding terms with racist roots. Tina O’Shea, Intuit’s Director of Content, said in a television news interview that, ""We have used black and white as metaphors for bad and good, so blacklist and whitelist, and so we have now identified terms that we're not going to use anymore as metaphors for bad and good.”
 Schmich credited content strategy guru Kristina Halvorson for “putting content systems on the map,” and she sees a growing number of jobs like hers at other companies. At Intuit, she manages a staff of three. The group maintains Intuit’s company-wide styleguide (down from about a dozen different guides when she started in 2016), voice and tone preferences, design systems, content architecture, and taxonomy management. The group is also getting more involved in the content employed by chatbots and semantic technologies. Schmich says that much of her job involves working with engineers on content taxonomies and on models of customer and user intent—typically as expressed in search engines or chatbot conversations.
 For Intuit, Writer performs two primary functions:


Writing assistant. It addresses issues like grammar, punctuation, and readability, and adds tone, inclusivity language, and customized Intuit rules for the company’s style and word choice;
Finance language. It addresses terminology and syntax for accounting, tax, and personal finance. Because Writer has machine learning, it learns as the team provides feedback about what is particular about writing at Intuit.


Producers of content around Intuit don’t have to remember all the rules, look up answers to questions, or go through old documents to find correct examples.
Schmich said that Writer improved both the quality and quantity of content creation at Intuit. She uses the Writer dashboard to track user engagement and content improvements, and compares quality across different pieces of content.
The Impact on Content Creators
Sarah Mohs is a Senior Content Designer for Intuit who works closely with the QuickBooks product. She creates and edits content for it, and also works with Jennifer Schmich’s team to edit the Writer Styleguide. As a content creator and editor, she feels that Writer improves productivity and saves time. She said,
“It’s too hard to keep everything in your brain, and looking things up only works if you know what you are looking for. The AI provides all those checks as you are writing. It definitely reduces the cognitive strain.”
AI, she believes, takes some of the burden off of correcting writing. Instead of focusing on missing commas, she can do more nuanced analysis and think more strategically about the content. It’s harder, but more satisfying, work. She said, however, that whether you like this type of change depends on your personality and job focus. “If you like copyediting, it will pose some challenges,” she notes.
Mohs said that some people in the content field worry that AI will render their jobs irrelevant, but she’s not particularly worried about losing her job because of it:
“I don’t think it will replace human editors or copywriters; it’s just a good companion. The machine learning is useful but not perfect, and context always matters—AI doesn’t always get contextual corrections right. And AI can analyze tone, but only with the information it receives from the user.”
Schmich and Mohs agree that for Intuit to get full value from Writer and other AI tools for content, the content creators and editors need education and new skills. Schmich commented,
“We are only using a small fraction of what the tool can do. At some point we will need to upskill all our content creators to learn about other capabilities, and to help us think about other use cases for it. It’s hard to get everyone out of the old mental model based on writing things down on paper.”
Mohs said,
“Writer and using AI to help with content are pretty new for us. We do need more education in what it can do. For content designers it could free us up to think about the end-to-end process of content creation and deployment.”
Writing has been around for several thousand years, and AI as an aid to writing for only a few years. It’s not surprising that we have some way to go in figuring it out. It does appear, however, that human writing will continue for at least a few more decades.

The work was developed with a computer program that had been fed Mr. McGregor’s choreography.Credit...Camilla GreenwellBy Genevieve CurtisPublished Nov. 5, 2020Updated Nov. 7, 2020In a messy warehouse, a dancer’s silhouetted spine and legs begin to undulate. Illuminated only by a spotlight attached to a machine, she begins to move, tracing shapes with her arms.But then something odd happens: The spotlight starts to move of its own accord. Responding to the dancer, it finds its own rhythm and sways side to side. It soon becomes unclear who is leading whom. What is clear is that a dance is being made, and that one partner is 9 feet high, more than 500 pounds. Called ABB IRB 6700, it is one of the largest industrial robots in the world.The dancer and choreographer Catie Cuan is the human star of this show, “Output,” which is part of a collaboration with ThoughtWorks Arts and the Pratt Institute. And while dancing with robots may sound a bit like science fiction, to Ms. Cuan, who is completing her Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Stanford University, it “feels like an extension of my body — and of possibility.”The working assumption for most of history has been that dance is a thing done by and for humans. Yet it does not seem beyond the pale that robots will one day perform for us mortals, particularly when choreographers like Ms. Cuan are using technology to explore the outer limits of the art form.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOne of Ms. Cuan’s projects is translating basic jazz and ballet vocabulary into robot joint angles and creating what she called “a ballet for swarms of robots, mapped onto robot morphology that leverages their innate nature.”That “innate nature” has to do with their distinctive movement qualities — the precise torques of their joints, that they have no muscles to contract or relax — which totally changes the perception of weight placement and bodily distribution.ImageCatie Cuan with Rethink Robotics Baxter (big robot) and SoftBank Robotics NAO (small robot) in “Time to Compile,” performed in 2018 at the Conference for Research on Choreographic Interfaces at Brown University.Credit...Sam BerubeMeshing an art form so tied to the body with machines may seem like a paradox. But, Ms. Cuan said, “A.I. is a choreographic tool that can disrupt the habitual dance-making process.”At the forefront of this growing field is Sydney Skybetter, a former dancer and a professor of what he calls choreographics at Brown University, where his students approach dance in a way that is heavily computational — like using machine learning to create ghostly digital avatars that dance along with live performers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Skybetter and Ms. Cuan join a line of working artists who have experimented with technology to break new ground in dance. The pioneer was the choreographer Merce Cunningham who, working with the electronic artist Thecla Schiphorst, used a software program called LifeForms that could sketch movement.“Trackers” (1991) was Cunningham’s first dance made with LifeForms, and roughly a third of the movement was created on the computer. Using the software opened up “possibilities of working with time and space that I had never thought of before,” he said at the time.By the end of the 20th century, motion capture, wearable tech and virtual reality had arrived on the scene. Then came A.I. One of the first major artists to work with it was the choreographer Trisha Brown, who in 2005 employed a program that responded to her dancers’ movements by drawing graphics that were then projected onstage.In the last five years, Google Arts and Culture has been collaborating with dance artists, including the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company and the Martha Graham Dance Company. Last year, Google released the Living Archive — an interactive atlas of a half-million movements drawn from the choreographer Wayne McGregor’s repertory. The archive allows a user to choose poses and construct a dance phrase; or to dance in front of the camera and let the computer find the closest visual match that will then be a building block in a new sequence.Damien Henry, the project lead at Google, also developed a more advanced machine for Mr. McGregor to use. That machine was fed a diet of the Living Archive and 100 hours of footage of McGregor dances. In rehearsal, the algorithm could capture dancers’ movements via webcam and then immediately render onscreen a selection of 30 original McGregor-esque sequences. Mr. McGregor and his dancers could choose to adopt or develop this output.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“At times, the algorithm produced suggestions that the dancer wouldn’t want to do,” Mr. Henry said. “But then Wayne realized it was extremely useful. It forced a dancer to explore unnatural territory.”ImageJacob O’Connell, left, and Chien-Shun Liao from Company Wayne McGregor in “Living Archive: An AI Performance Experiment” at the Music Center in Los Angeles.Credit...Cheryl Mann, via LA PhilIn July 2019, Company Wayne McGregor premiered “Living Archive: An AI Performance Experiment,” a 30-minute work developed in conjunction with the program, at the Music Center in Los Angeles.“We all have biases,” Mr. McGregor said in an interview, “and ways in which we frame the world. A.I. affords more self-knowledge. It helps you play your ‘instrument’ differently.”Some dance artists are thinking about A.I. beyond its utility as a technical tool and predictor of movement. Pontus Lidberg, the artistic director of the Danish Dance Theater, set out to use A.I. as a more integral part of his choreography, in rehearsal and performance. The goal: To create a dance that articulated the tension between man and machine, by putting the two together onstage.In 2019, Mr. Lidberg began working with the computer artist Cecilie Waagner Falkenstrom. “We didn’t want to create something proving that an algorithm can find patterns,” she said. “That is boring. We wanted to create something that touches us as human beings.”To achieve this, the A.I. (affectionately called David) was fed information from myriad sources — ranging from planetary movements to the structure and semiotics of Greek tragedy.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Because the A.I. was trained on more than just my movement vocabulary,” Mr. Lidberg said, “it learned a lot, deconstructed this knowledge, and then built it up again with the dancers — this created something entirely new.” Each performance of the dance, called “Centaur” (2020), is a distinct, unpredictable event — a neat allegory to our relationship with technology. (The production is currently touring Europe).“This type of work opens an intense conversation about where the choreography is, and by whom,” Mr. Skybetter said. “With machines, it becomes difficult to point to any singular choreography by one person or system.”As more choreographers deconstruct and redefine their craft with the help of A.I., they are often faced with the question: At what point does human creation end and the machine take over?ImageDanish Dance Theater in a performance — each one is distinct — of Pontus Lidberg’s “Centaur.” Foreground, Lua Mayenco Cardenal, left, and Merete Hersvik.Credit...Per Morten AbrahamsenArguments against A.I. making art are as old as A.I. itself: It is ethically abhorrent, it cheapens art, it accelerates the redundancy of humanity — the list goes on. Sean D. Kelly, a professor of philosophy at Harvard University and the author of a book on A.I. called “All Things Shining,” wrote in a 2019 article for the M.I.T. Technology Review wrote about what worried him: “We will come to treat artificially intelligent machines as so vastly superior to us that we will naturally attribute creativity to them. Should that happen, it will not be because machines have outstripped us. It will be because we will have denigrated ourselves.”But for those working with dance and A.I., this view seems fatalistic. “What is often not clear,” Mr. Lidberg said, “is that an A.I. with a consciousness doesn’t exist. That is science fiction. However you choose to intellectualize it, the human body and mind are still central to dance.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAs the dance world continues to navigate the pandemic, Mr. McGregor stresses the importance of “finding ways that audiences can engage viscerally with work — not just cerebrally.” He suggests that haptic technologies — like virtual reality headsets and other user engagement tools primarily used in gaming — could be the way to experience what he calls a “chemical engagement” with dance.Some are already coming up with ideas. Kate Sicchio, a choreographer and an assistant professor of dance and media technologies at Virginia Commonwealth University, is developing a visual dance score created by a machine. As part of her research, she stages “live coding jams,” in which dancers respond to notations projected onscreen. There are obvious applications to our pandemic context: “You could do one of these jams distantly — I have done it once. But nothing beats being in the room.”Mr. Skybetter is similarly adamant that “none of these technologies can really exist without a human hand.” A human is needed at every stage: to input the coding, feed it with information and design the algorithm to reach creative goals. Science is not at a point where choreographic software can generate its own material. It is hard enough to translate dance to other humans, let alone a computer.“Art needs the fallibility of the human mind to recognize where the unexpected is exciting,” Ms. Waagner Falkenstrom said. Mr. Lidberg agrees: “A.I. can probably replace everybody. But a true artist, one with embodied knowledge, interested in posing questions and making aimless research — no, that cannot be replaced.”For the skeptics, it might be reassuring that there remains an instinctive bias to retain human ownership over art. Machines or virtual reality headsets will struggle to replicate the tension between artist and audience. Just like a robot will struggle to feel or mimic the training held in the bodies of dancers.Ms. Cuan said she believes that learning to choreograph and move alongside intelligent robots will fundamentally change our understanding of human locomotion — and therefore of dance. Particularly because she one day, she said, “robots will be ubiquitous, moving with us.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt is unclear if A.I. will carve out a significant space in the dance canon. But at this nascent stage, it is taking dance to fascinating, sometimes uncomfortable, places. Where this relationship goes next is largely up to science and artistic appetite.Mr. McGregor, for one, is unequivocal about A.I.’s potential. “Creatives think that their process is a mysterious thing that happens to you and it cannot be formalized,” he said. “But the more we understand about how we make our choices, the more we can make different choices.”And, he’s sure about one thing: “Nothing can replace the human heart.”See more on: Merce CunninghamShare full articleRead in appAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEnjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.6-month Welcome Offeroriginal price:   $6.25sale price:   $1/weekLearn more",2020-11-07T14:43:23.000Z,,False,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'name': 'Arts', 'position': 1, 'item': 'https://www.nytimes.com/section/arts'}, {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'name': 'Dance', 'position': 2, 'item': 'https://www.nytimes.com/section/arts/dance'}]",en,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.meteredContent'}","{'@id': 'https://www.nytimes.com/#publisher', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","{'@id': 'https://www.nytimes.com/#publisher', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",2024.0,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'The New York Times', 'productID': 'nytimes.com:basic'}",https://www.nytco.com/company/diversity-and-inclusion/,https://www.nytco.com/company/standards-ethics/,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/28/admin/the-new-york-times-masthead.html,1851-09-18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

What rights does a robot have? If our machines become intelligent in the science-fiction way, that’s likely to become a complicated question — and the humans who nurture those robots just might take their side.
Ted Chiang,  a science-fiction author of growing renown with long-lasting connections to Seattle’s tech community, doesn’t back away from such questions. They spark the thought experiments that generate award-winning novellas like “The Lifecycle of Software Objects,” and inspire Hollywood movies like “Arrival.”
Chiang’s soulful short stories have earned him kudos from the likes of The New Yorker, which has called him “one of the most influential science-fiction writers of his generation.” During this year’s pandemic-plagued summer, he joined the Museum of Pop Culture’s Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. And this week, he’s receiving an award from the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation for employing imagination in service to society.
Can science fiction have an impact in the real world, even at times when the world seems as if it’s in the midst of a slow-moving disaster movie?
Absolutely, Chiang says.
“Art is one way to make sense of a world which, on its own, does not make sense,” he says in the latest episode of the Fiction Science podcast, which focuses on the intersection between science and fiction. “Art can impose a kind of order onto things. … It doesn’t offer a cure-all, because I don’t think there’s going to be any easy cure-all, but I think art helps us get by in these stressful times.”

COVID-19 provides one illustration. Chiang would argue that our response to the coronavirus pandemic has been problematic in part because it doesn’t match what we’ve seen in sci-fi movies.
“The greatest conflict that we see generated is from people who don’t believe in it vs. everyone else,” he said. “That might be the product of the fact that it is not as severe. If it looked like various movie pandemics, it’d probably be hard for anyone to deny that it was happening.”
This pandemic may well spark a new kind of sci-fi theme.
“It’s worth thinking about, that traditional depictions of pandemics don’t spend much time on people coming together and trying to support each other,” Chiang said. “That is not typically a theme in stories about disaster or enormous crisis. I guess the narrative is usually, ‘It’s the end of civilization.’ And people have not turned on each other in that way.”
Artificial intelligence is another field where science fiction often gives people the wrong idea. “When we talk about AI in science fiction, we’re talking about something very different than what we mean when we say AI in the context of current technology,” he said.
Chiang isn’t speaking here merely as an author of short stories, but as someone who joined the Seattle tech community three decades ago to work at Microsoft as a technical writer. During his first days in Seattle, his participation in 1989’s Clarion West Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers’ Workshop helped launch his second career as a fiction writer.
In our interview, Chiang didn’t want to say much about the technical-writing side of his career, but his expertise showed through in our discussion about real vs. sci-fi AI. “When people talk about AI in the real world … they’re talking about a certain type of software that is usually like a superpowered version of applied statistics,” he said.
That’s a far cry from the software-enhanced supervillains of movies like “Terminator” or “The Matrix,” or the somewhat more sympathetic characters in shows like “Westworld” and “Humans.”
In Chiang’s view, most depictions of sci-fi AI fall short even by science-fiction standards. “A lot of stories imagine something which is a product like a robot that comes in a box, and you flip it on, and suddenly you have a butler — a perfectly competent and loyal and obedient butler,” he noted. “That, I think jumps over all these steps, because butlers don’t just happen.”
In “The Lifecycle of Software Objects,” Chiang imagines a world in which it takes just as long to raise a robot as it does to raise a child. That thought experiment sparks all kinds of interesting all-too-human questions: What if the people who raise such robots want them to be something more than butlers? Would they stand by and let their sci-fi robot progeny be treated like slaves, even like sex slaves?
“Maybe they want that robot, or conscious software, to have some kind of autonomy,” Chiang said. “To have a good life.”

Chiang’s latest collection of short stories, “Exhalation,” extends those kinds of thought experiments to science-fiction standbys ranging from free will to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
Both those subjects come into play in what’s certainly Chiang’s best-known novella, “Story of Your Life,” which was first published in 1998 and adapted to produce the screenplay for “Arrival” in 2016. Like so many of Chiang’s other stories, “Story of Your Life” takes an oft-used science-fiction trope — in this case, first contact with intelligent aliens — and adds an unexpected but insightful and heart-rending twist.
Chiang said that the success of the novella and the movie hasn’t led to particularly dramatic changes in the story of his own life, but that it has broadened the audience for the kinds of stories he tells.
“Exhalation” is the latest collection of Ted Chiang’s science-fiction short stories. (Knopf Doubleday)
“My work has been read by people who would not describe themselves as science-fiction readers, by people who don’t usually read a lot of science fiction, and that’s been amazing. That’s been really gratifying,” he said. “It’s not something that I ever really expected.”
What’s more, Chiang’s work has been popping up in places where you wouldn’t expect to see science fiction — such as The New York Times, where he weighs in on the implications of human gene editing; or Buzzfeed News, where he reflects on the downside of Silicon Valley’s world view; or the journal Nature, where you can find Chiang’s thought experiments on free will and transhumanism; or Nautilus, where Chiang offers an unorthodox perspective on SETI.
During our podcast chat, Chiang indulged in yet another thought experiment: Could AI replace science-fiction writers?
Chiang’s answer? It depends.
“If we could get software-generated novels that were coherent, but not necessarily particularly good, I think there would be a market for them,” he said.
But Chiang doesn’t think that would doom human authors.
“For an AI to generate a novel that you think of as really good, that you feel like, ‘Oh, wow, this novel was both gripping and caused me to think about my life in a new way’ — that, I think, is going to be very, very hard,” he said.
Ted Chiang only makes it look easy.
Chiang and other Arthur C. Clarke Foundation awardees will take part in the 2020 Clarke Conversation on Imagination at 9 a.m. PT Nov. 12. Register via the foundation’s website and Eventbrite to get in on the interactive video event.

Some technology firms built AI models to predict election outcomes.  Photo: michael reynolds/ShutterstockIn the months leading up to Election Day, pollsters placed voters under the microscope, parsing data from telephone surveys and past voting trends to determine probable outcomes. By Tuesday evening, as results veered from predictions, it was the pollsters’ turn under the microscope. There are alternative ways of assessing sentiment, though. Some technology experts say artificial intelligence, used increasingly by companies to gauge customer sentiment, could hold promise for better understanding the electorate.Newsletter Sign-upWSJ | CIO JournalThe Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team.PreviewSubscribe“I wouldn’t fire the pollsters, but I would direct them to try to leverage machine learning, data mining and AI in their work more to get better projections,” said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI, a nonprofit research center in Seattle.The size of this year’s polling error is still unknown as the vote count continues. But polls generally predicted clear Democratic gains, not cliffhangers.No person or algorithm can predict human behavior accurately all the time, said Heidi Messer, chairman of New York-based Collective[i], which offers AI and predictive technologies for sales teams. But the problem with traditional polls is that the designations pollsters use are based on historical classifications and averages. Polling will need to find a data source that captures actual behavior the way tech firms such as Amazon.com Inc. do. “Amazon’s algorithm doesn’t care if I’m a person or a dog, it just knows that if I buy a leash, I’m likely to buy kibble,” she said.She added: “Data reflecting behavior is much harder to amass but infinitely more useful in dynamically identifying the patterns and correlations that fuel probabilistic predictions.”A few AI companies have used their models to make election predictions.Expert.ai, an Italian software company specializing in natural-language processing, applied its technology to millions of social posts around the candidates. Its AI system, trained partly on past elections, analyzed factors such as tone and emotion and projected how that might translate into votes. Expert.ai’s system projected that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would win 50.2% of the popular vote and Republican President Donald Trump would get 47.3% of the vote, a 2.9 percentage-point margin. As of Friday afternoon, Mr. Biden had 50.5% of the popular vote compared with Mr. Trump’s 47.8%, a 2.7 percentage-point margin. (Dow Jones & Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal, is an Expert.ai customer.) Unanimous.ai ran a live survey in September asking 50 participants to predict who would win the presidential contest in 11 battleground states and by what margin. Photo: Unanimous.aiAnother company, San Luis Obispo, Calif.-based Unanimous.ai, sells what is known as swarm-intelligence software. It uses AI models to aggregate predictions and decisions from groups of people, such as investors predicting commodity prices.Chief Executive Louis Rosenberg said his team used the software to run a live survey of 50 people in the U.S. in September, asking them to predict who they thought would win the presidential contest in 11 battleground states and by what margin.As of Sunday afternoon, that September survey had correctly predicted the winner of the presidential vote in 10 battleground state races as called by the Associated Press. It is on track to correctly predict the final state, North Carolina. The survey also generally predicted which of the races would be tighter.Unanimous.ai’s live survey allows users to see what other participants are choosing in real time, and machine-learning algorithms assess who has the most confidence in their predictions, based on factors such as answer changes. The most confident answers have the greatest influence on the final aggregated answer.“Our data was 50 randomly selected voters and then the use of a swarm to amplify their intelligence; it wasn’t 100,000 poll samples,” Dr. Rosenberg said. “Again and again, we see that we’re able to outperform really huge polls.” Advertisement


But not all AI polling was that accurate.Polly, developed by AI consumer market research company Advanced Symbolics Inc., had successfully predicted some 20 elections and referendums, including the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union.ASI predicted Mr. Biden would win. However, it had him taking Florida and winning the electoral vote 372 to 166. The AP has called Florida for Mr. Trump and the AP’s electoral vote totals so far are much closer, but they do have Mr. Biden in the lead.“We got this one wrong,” said Kenton White, an ASI co-founder and the company’s chief scientist.More From CIO JournalInternet Browsers Are Getting a Makeover for the WorkplaceJuly 2, 2024CDK Global Hack Shows Risk of One Software Vendor Dominating an IndustryJune 29, 2024Goldman Sachs Deploys Its First Generative AI Tool Across the FirmJune 27, 2024To make election predictions, ASI uses machine learning to track and analyze election-related topics being discussed on major social media sites, such as Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. The company harvests public data from the sites to come up with a sample of users that represent the U.S. population.Polly also taps data on past elections and looks at how people’s posts in the past matched up against previous votes to make a prediction on which way a population might go in an upcoming election. For instance, it might see that people in past elections who talked about bringing jobs back to America leaned Republican and those talking about global warming leaned Democrat.Erin Kelly, ASI’s co-founder and chief executive officer, says using AI to predict an election is still a relatively young practice. And one of the strengths of AI is that models can learn and tend to get better over time.For Polly, she said, this year’s election “is a learning experience.”Write to Jared Council at jared.council@wsj.com and John McCormick at john.mccormick@wsj.comCopyright ©2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

 You may have seen Pepper the robot in the news. She has been introduced as HSBC Bank’s in-branch greeter and banking assistant. She currently provides bank patrons with information and entertainment, but as her technology improves, she will provide more personalization through features like facial recognition. 






 While the average person may not be greeted at the bank by an actual robot, we see artificial intelligence being used regularly in our day-to-day banking world. 


 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 
 Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to independently perform tasks normally done by humans, more specifically, things like understanding language, making decisions, or solving problems. 

 Machine learning (ML) refers to systems that can not only do the tasks but learn from experience. In banking, computer systems are fed a great amount of data about customers. Computers can sort, classify, and analyze that data. They can make predictions based on customers’ previous behavior and make decisions based on previously determined criteria. Systems can also learn from exceptions and improve over time. 








 Where Is AI Being Used? 
 Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been used in banking, to some extent, for many years. Over the last several years, as customers rely more on mobile banking and online services, brick and mortar banks have reduced their number of locations. 

 In 2020, with the onset of the pandemic, many local bank branches closed for extended periods of time. Thankfully, we were still able to complete many of our daily banking tasks. According to Statista, there are 57 million people in the U.S. alone using mobile banking. 

    

 Here are some everyday banking services where you might see AI and ML at work: 

Telephone banking: When you call your bank, you’ll need to verify your identity. AI is at work there, matching PINs or using voice recognition for authentication. Websites and mobile banking: Most banks allow you to manage your accounts, complete everyday apps online, and offer mobile apps to access accounts on the go, make bill payments, send money, and more. AI is connecting and managing all the interactions between services and keeping your transactions secure in the process.Some British banks allow customers wishing to open an account to send a selfie to validate their identity. This means you can open an account in minutes without visiting a branch or waiting days for manual verification. Chatbots: When you visit your bank online or open your mobile app, you might be greeted by an AI-powered chatbot, who can help you locate information or services. Conversational banking allows you to ask questions and get answers in real-time. Your interactions are stored so the bots can give you more personalized services each time you connect, and recommend products for you, based on your behavior and the services you already use. Budgeting: If you’re using online budget software like YNAB or EveryDollar, you’ll see AI in the way these systems interact with your banking transactions, automatically move funds into designated categories, and make future projections about your financial situation. Integration with digital assistants: In some countries, you can ask Google or Alexa, in plain language, to do simple transactions such as check your accounts or pay a bill. Retail payments: Instead of using credit or debit cards to pay for purchases, many people use their mobile devices for contactless shopping. Services like Apple Pay and Google Pay allow users to make payments securely, with mobile devices, using biometric face or fingerprint scanning technology. Lending: AI processes at your favorite lending institutions means you can apply for credit cards, loans, and even mortgages. Whether AI is involved at certain stages or during the whole process will depend on the bank. But it can mean faster and more accurate decision making and more security for you and the lender. Investments: With the ability to handle huge amounts of data, AI is transforming investment banking too. Systems can keep up with industry changes and make better predictions over time. Investors can even make voice-activated trades on their morning commute. 









 Behind the Scenes 
 No matter which banking activities you are using, you can be sure there is some aspect of artificial intelligence involved. That number is set to increase exponentially over the next several years. 

 Through automated processes, banks collect, sort, categorize, and analyze huge amounts of data to target customers through marketing, better personalize their services, and offer you the best products for your needs. 

 Considering automatic transactions are less expensive than in-branch activities, AI processes help banks to reduce their costs. 

 At the same time, AI and ML are helping banks monitor data for unusual transactions, to detect and prevent fraudulent activity, and to keep your accounts secure. 



 What’s in It for you? 
 You get 24/7 convenience to bank on your own terms, personalized service based on your previous behavior or that of people similar to you, and faster service overall. 






 You might think people would be leery about giving up their privacy for the sake of convenience, but according to Genpact, 68 percent of millennials and over 42 percent of older generations are okay with businesses using their personal data if it means they will get better customer service. 

    



 Concerns with AI in the Banking Industry 
Privacy Risks 
 Whenever organizations collect a large amount of data, there is a possible security risk. Personal information is always open to hackers, but banks and FinTech companies spend huge amounts of time and money to predict, analyze, and prepare to mitigate those risks. Data is encrypted, verification processes are becoming more complex, and security and fraud detection are very high priorities. 





Job Loss 
 As in any industry, people question whether automation in the banking industry will eliminate jobs. This may be a valid concern as many banks have reduced their brick and mortar location as online and mobile options have increased. That said, automation means that banks can offer more services so new jobs may appear in different areas. Leaders in the banking industry claim they are investing in technology, not to eliminate the human experience, but to make it better. 



 AI in the Banking Industry Is Here to Stay 
 While some banks are moving forward with artificial intelligence and machine learning at a faster pace than others, the consensus is AI in the banking industry is here to stay. As technology improves, banks will continue to provide faster, more convenient, more personalized services for you while benefiting from better marketing, reduced costs, and time savings themselves.

Same goes for AI – individuals can utilize it for creating medical diagnosis equipment or killing machines; the main thing that matters is who is utilizing it and for what. For instance, in the medical field the AI algorithms could be utilized to become familiar with the best chemical constituents that can be utilized to fix diseases. Then again, AI can likewise be utilized to build up UAVs to kill individuals (great/terrible) by learning different war skills..We have encountered similar blended emotions about AI faltering between fear, fascination, and hope. Frequently, it is depicted as the start of a startling apocalyptic age when robots will control over humankind and sci-fi bad dreams work out as expected. In a similar vein, for some individuals, AI is that scary digital monster that will greatly gobble up jobs and will prompt a jobless future. Interestingly, AI is viewed as the crucial part for staggering technological advancements and innovations such as self-driving cars, autonomous drones, or smart personal agents..It is unequivocally attached to a sentiment of expectation that AI will be the overall answer for the most challenging problems of our time. Enchanted expectations on AI lead to a &quot;technotopia&quot;, a promotion where nothing is by all accounts possible. These outrageous sentiments and conceptions are powered by intense, clingy features that virally spread in social media. However, they regularly don't reflect reality. We get charmed by new AI accomplishments, yet we overlook that these features are generally shown in explicit test settings but then not prepared to work practically..There are different kinds of friendships: friendships of utility, pleasure, and goodness. Aristotle utilized these separations to depict the inspiration driving our connections. Some are simple comfort and energized by mutual gain; others depend on partaking in exercises together, yet blur away without that external stimulus..The 'best' kind of friendships have solid basics: mutual respect and unselfish desire. We all know how unique and precious these friendships are, as they don't tag along regularly..We likewise realize that fellowship can have no justifiable purpose. Think about a lion prepping infant chick as opposed to eating down on it. In any case, what advantage do we gain from positioning the significance of friendships? It's fundamental to guarantee neither one of the parties is being exploited, but past that, as long as it brings you bliss, does it truly make a difference? If you just spend time with somebody since you need somebody to play golf with, and AI can repeat that and become your chess partner, your experience isn't debased on the grounds that one is a machine..Artificial intelligence will supplement human work as opposed to supplanting it. In numerous cases, AI algorithms are not precise enough to completely automate a particular task. Accept imaged based diagnosis for instance: A computer vision algorithm can just give proposals. A doctor constantly needs to revise the proposal since an off-base finding could be lethal for the patient. Nonetheless, AI can feature the data that is applicable for the diagnosis, empowering the doctor to be more gainful..As the lines between people and machines keep on obscuring, there's likewise whether or not seeing AI as a friend could have unfriendly impacts. Mike Elgan from Fast Company contends against teaching children to be obliging to Alexa by expressing: &quot;we don't need kids to see Alexa as a friend or having human qualities and forming attachments that will make shaping incredulity later on more troublesome.&quot; This proposes that one day machines might need to dupe us, putting the individuals who use them in danger. On the whole, we need to give them power. Giving them characters tracks into this domain – yet we never recommended the ride would be a simple one..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

From drug discovery to thermal scans, AI has transformed this sector significantly over the past decade. While we know AI's contributions to physical healthcare, AI is also easing mental health concerns too. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA)'s 2016 report on drug use and health, only 63% of adults identified as having had at least one major depressive episode reported receiving any kind of treatment..In the US alone, one in five adults suffers from a form of mental illness. Suicide rates are at an all-time high, 115 people die daily from substance abuse, and one in eight Americans over 12 years old take an antidepressant every day. The economic burden of depression alone is estimated to be a minimum of US$210 billion annually, which includes costs due to increased absenteeism and reduced productivity in the workplace. The situation is grim in other regions as well. For instance, in Europe, 83 million people are struggling with mental health. Other than this, people also have to endure stigma, lack of mental health professionals and high costs of counselling sessions too..Currently, during the world pandemic crisis, even the COVID-19 has been tangibly affecting millions of people in terms of their mental peace. Rates of depression and panic attacks are much higher than normal. Isolation due to social distancing has triggered sleep deprivation, social anxiety, and reduced happiness while also causing people to worry about their jobs. As per a report, 70% of people have had more stress and anxiety at work this year than any other previous year. This increased stress and anxiety have negatively impacted the mental health of 78% of the global workforce, causing more stress (38%), a lack of work-life balance (35%), burnout (25%), depression due to lack of socialization (25%), and loneliness (14%). A recent report by Deloitte suggests COVID-19's impact on mental health could last for years.While, AI is proving to be an effective way for clinicians to both make the best of the time they do have with patients, and bridge any gaps in access, it has also helped in early prediction and diagnosis of the diseases too. So, incorporating AI to address mental health issues can achieve similar promising results. For starters, this can be done by employing AI into digital interventions, like web and smartphone apps, to enhance user experience and optimize personalized mental health care. One can analyze modern streams of abundant data as a means to develop prediction or detection models for mental health conditions. E.g. Quartet Health, has reduced hospitalization of patients by 15-25% by screening patient medical histories and behavioral patterns to uncover undiagnosed mental health problems..Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville has created a machine learning algorithm that uses hospital admissions data, including age, gender, zip code, medication, and diagnostic history, to predict the likelihood of any given individual taking their own life. Scientists are experimenting with linear classifiers of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to risk assessment in possible PTSD cases..Also, while AI would not replace existing therapists and psychiatrists, it surely provides a medium where people can talk about their struggles without the fear of being judges or facing stigma. Further, AI can help doctors and therapists increase emotional awareness for their patients, such as in expressing empathy. Research has also proved that AI helped employees improve their mental health at work..Next, we have emotional AI-powered chatbots (like Wysa, Woebot) that can provide unprecedented accessibility by being available 24/7 at little to no cost. These apps collect data that allow them to create a level of therapeutic rapport with users and offer relevant responses. Mood tracking apps like Woebot, which is created by a team of Stanford psychologists and AI experts, uses brief daily chat conversations, mood tracking, curated videos, and word games to help people manage mental health. This is faster and comfortable than traditional practice in mental health where professionals rely on the individual to observe and self-report indicative changes. E.g. IBM's Computational Psychiatry and Neuroimaging group, alongside several universities, have built a model using NLP to predict the onset of psychosis in patients. This model can detect differences in speech patterns between high-risk patients who develop psychosis and those who did not. At present, a team of scientists at Dublin, Ireland-based startup Behavidence is currently preparing to launch an effective digital phenotyping solution that can provide an accurate psychiatric diagnosis for ADHD..Mental health will likely remain a major challenge in today's world due to various reasons. Although AI for mental health still needs to deal with many complexities, its applications and tools are doing an appreciable job in alleviating this issue for many. Soon it will be well equipped to mitigate and manage the stress, depression and trauma, things which are living hell for many..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

This AI-powered project towards recognizing work stress and fatigue aims to leverage the abilities of human-machine teams, cooperating to solve complex problems. According to MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers, much of the development of these human-machine teams focuses on the machine, addressing the technology challenges of training AI algorithms to perform their role in a mission effectively..Pointing out to the collaboration between humans and machines, Michael Pietrucha, a tactical systems specialist at the laboratory, said that in the area of human-machine collaboration, he and his team often think about the technology, such as how do they monitor it, understand it, and make sure it is working right. But he further noted that teamwork is a two-way street, and the machine can help humans to boost their performance. Pietrucha is one of the laboratory researchers that intends to develop AI systems that can sense a person's cognitive fatigue interfering with their work performance..Furthermore, Megan Blackwell, former deputy lead of internally funded biological science and technology research at the laboratory, explained that neuromonitoring is becoming more specific and portable today. &quot;We envision using technology to monitor for fatigue or cognitive overload. Is this person attending to too much? Will they run out of gas, so to speak? If you can monitor the human, you could intervene before something bad happens.&quot; she said. Using technology to read a person's cognitive or emotional state has been the laboratory's decade-long research..The stress and fatigue recognition system operates on biometric data such as video and audio recordings of a person speaking. By processing these data with advanced AI algorithms, researchers found biomarkers of various psychological and neurobehavioral conditions. These biomarkers have been used to train models that can accurately estimate the level of a person's depression, for example..As part of the study, the team will apply their biomarker research to an artificial intelligence-powered system to assess an individual's cognitive state, encapsulating how fatigued, stressed, or overloaded a person is feeling. The system will use biomarkers derived from physiological data such as vocal and facial recordings, heart rate, EEG and optical indications of brain activity, and eye movement to excerpt these insights..According to researchers, the first step will be to build a cognitive model of an individual. This will integrate the physiological inputs and monitor the inputs to see how they change as a person performs particular fatiguing tasks, according to Thomas Quatieri, who leads several neurobehavioral biomarker research efforts at the MIT Lincoln laboratory. This process will enable the AI system to establish patterns of activity and learn a person's baseline cognitive state involving basic task-related functions needed to prevent injury or undesirable outcomes, such as auditory and visual attention and response time. When this individualized baseline is established, the system can begin recognizing deviations from normal and predict if those deviations will lead to mistakes or poor performance..Currently, the project is in its early stage as researchers are collecting data to train their algorithms and develop the technology further..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Nov 13, 2020, 9:00 AM ESTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeFacebook has always made it clear it wants artificial intelligence to handle more moderation duties on its platforms. Today, it announced its latest step toward that goal: putting machine learning in charge of its moderation queue. Here’s how moderation works on Facebook. Posts that are thought to violate the company’s rules (which includes everything from spam to hate speech and content that “glorifies violence”) are flagged, either by users or machine learning filters. Some very clear-cut cases are dealt with automatically (responses could involve removing a post or blocking an account, for example) while the rest go into a queue for review by human moderators. Facebook employs about 15,000 of these moderators around the world, and has been criticized in the past for not giving these workers enough support, employing them in conditions that can lead to trauma. Their job is to sort through flagged posts and make decisions about whether or not they violate the company’s various policies. In the past, moderators reviewed posts more or less chronologically, dealing with them in the order they were reported. Now, Facebook says it wants to make sure the most important posts are seen first, and is using machine learning to help. In the future, an amalgam of various machine learning algorithms will be used to sort this queue, prioritizing posts based on three criteria: their virality, their severity, and the likelihood they’re breaking the rules. Facebook’s old system of moderation, combining proactive moderation by ML filters and reactive reports from Facebook users.  Image: FacebookThe new moderation workflow, which now uses machine learning to sort the queue of posts for review by human moderators.  Image: FacebookExactly how these criteria are weighted is not clear, but Facebook says the aim is to deal with the most damaging posts first. So, the more viral a post is (the more it’s being shared and seen) the quicker it’ll be dealt with. The same is true of a post’s severity. Facebook says it ranks posts which involve real-world harm as the most important. That could mean content involving terrorism, child exploitation, or self-harm. Posts like spam, meanwhile, which are annoying but not traumatic, are ranked as least important for review. “All content violations will still receive some substantial human review”“All content violations will still receive some substantial human review, but we’ll be using this system to better prioritize [that process],” Ryan Barnes, a product manager with Facebook’s community integrity team, told reporters during a press briefing. Facebook has shared some details on how its machine learning filters analyze posts in the past. These systems include a model named “WPIE,” which stands for “whole post integrity embeddings” and takes what Facebook calls a “holistic” approach to assessing content. This means the algorithms judge various elements in any given post in concert, trying to work out what the image, caption, poster, etc., reveal together. If someone says they’re selling a “full batch” of “special treats” accompanied by a picture of what look to be baked goods, are they talking about Rice Krispies squares or edibles? The use of certain words in the caption (like “potent”) might tip the judgment one way or the other. Facebook uses various machine learning algorithms to sort content, including the “holistic” assessment tool known as WPIE.  Image: FacebookFacebook’s use of AI to moderate its platforms has come in for scrutiny in the past, with critics noting that artificial intelligence lacks a human’s capacity to judge the context of a lot of online communication. Especially with topics like misinformation, bullying, and harassment, it can be near impossible for a computer to know what it’s looking at.Facebook’s Chris Palow, a software engineer in the company’s interaction integrity team, agreed that AI had its limits, but told reporters that the technology could still play a role in removing unwanted content. “The system is about marrying AI and human reviewers to make less total mistakes,” said Palow. “The AI is never going to be perfect.” When asked what percentage of posts the company’s machine learning systems classify incorrectly, Palow didn’t give a direct answer, but noted that Facebook only lets automated systems work without human supervision when they are as accurate as human reviewers. “The bar for automated action is very high,” he said. Nevertheless, Facebook is steadily adding more AI to the moderation mix. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly gave Chris Palow’s name as Chris Parlow. We regret the error.

Their job is to sort through flagged posts and make decisions about whether or not they violate the company’s various policies. 

In the past, moderators reviewed posts more or less chronologically, dealing with them in the order they were reported. Now, Facebook says it wants to make sure the most important posts are seen first, and is using machine learning to help. In the future, an amalgam of various machine learning algorithms will be used to sort this queue, prioritizing posts based on three criteria: their virality, their severity, and the likelihood they’re breaking the rules.

Exactly how these criteria are weighted is not clear, but Facebook says the aim is to deal with the most damaging posts first. So, the more viral a post is (the more it’s being shared and seen) the quicker it’ll be dealt with. The same is true of a post’s severity. Facebook says it ranks posts which involve real-world harm as the most important. That could mean content involving terrorism, child exploitation, or self-harm. Posts like spam, meanwhile, which are annoying but not traumatic, are ranked as least important for review. 

""“All content violations will still receive some substantial human review”""

“All content violations will still receive some substantial human review, but we’ll be using this system to better prioritize [that process],” Ryan Barnes, a product manager with Facebook’s community integrity team, told reporters during a press briefing. 

Facebook has shared some details on how its machine learning filters analyze posts in the past. These systems include a model named “WPIE,” which stands for “whole post integrity embeddings” and takes what Facebook calls a “holistic” approach to assessing content. 

This means the algorithms judge various elements in any given post in concert, trying to work out what the image, caption, poster, etc., reveal together. If someone says they’re selling a “full batch” of “special treats” accompanied by a picture of what look to be baked goods, are they talking about Rice Krispies squares or edibles? The use of certain words in the caption (like “potent”) might tip the judgment one way or the other.

Facebook’s use of AI to moderate its platforms has come in for scrutiny in the past, with critics noting that artificial intelligence lacks a human’s capacity to judge the context of a lot of online communication. Especially with topics like misinformation, bullying, and harassment, it can be near impossible for a computer to know what it’s looking at.

Facebook’s Chris Palow, a software engineer in the company’s interaction integrity team, agreed that AI had its limits, but told reporters that the technology could still play a role in removing unwanted content. “The system is about marrying AI and human reviewers to make less total mistakes,” said Palow. “The AI is never going to be perfect.” 

When asked what percentage of posts the company’s machine learning systems classify incorrectly, Palow didn’t give a direct answer, but noted that Facebook only lets automated systems work without human supervision when they are as accurate as human reviewers. “The bar for automated action is very high,” he said. Nevertheless, Facebook is steadily adding more AI to the moderation mix.

In some cases, this might mean entirely removing traditional aspects of the hiring process.

Introduced in the nineties, applicant tracking systems (ATS), were created to help HR professionals organize the surge of applications that resulted from the growing use of the internet. Over the last several decades, ATS became increasingly advanced, using algorithms to sift through thousands of resumes based on various data. The promise was efficiency and blind hiring, but the algorithms have proven to perpetuate structural inequities in hiring.

Algorithms work by being fed data and then making choices based on that data. If a company’s data set is already skewed towards a specific demographic, like “Harvard graduates who worked at Goldman Sachs,” the algorithm will just perpetuate that. A good example of this is when Amazon realized its AI algorithm preferred male candidates in 2015. Amazon discovered that the algorithm penalized resumes with the word women and was biased against candidates that went to certain women’s colleges.

A new crop of tech companies believes that AI can solve the problem. Founded in 2013, Pymetrics describes itself as a “human-centered AI platform with the vision to realize everyone’s potential with fair and accurate talent matching.”

Pymetrics hiring software doesn’t assess a candidate’s skill set based on past performance. Applicants play a round of games based on neuroscience research exercises that reveal behaviors and skills and then match these skills to different jobs. For companies, these matches give access to a larger, diverse pool of qualified candidates that an ATS might have filtered out. For candidates, the matches expand their job search and potentially make them aware of roles they wouldn’t have originally considered.

“The whole idea behind Pymetrics is that instead of using a resume, you are looking at people’s cognitive, social, and emotional aptitudes [through a combination of neuroscience-based tests and machine learning to match job seekers with openings]. It’s also much more future-facing and potential-oriented, rather than backward-facing and sort of only talking about your past experiences. It’s a much more holistic, hopeful view of someone than, Oh, this is what you’ve done, and this is all you can do,” explained Pymetric CEO Frida Poli in a Quartz at Work interview. Pymetrics says its custom algorithms are rigorously tested for bias.

The concept of blind hiring is also the premise of startup Blendoor, a Tinder-style app for jobs that removes candidates’ gender, race, photos, and names. “[Blendoor] enables companies to hire based on merit, not molds. We are using performance data to train our algorithms rather than historical data sets.” said the company’s founder Stephanie Lampkin in an interview with All Raise.

These companies claim their tools are already working. Pymetrics, which already boasts clients such as the Boston Consulting Group, Accenture, Linkedin, and Unilever, says one of its clients evened out the gender and ethnicity split for applicants. Blendoor says it doubled the number of women it hires and substantially increased minority hires for a client. There is not year rigorous experimental evidence on the effect of these programs.

Gamification and blind hiring present possible effective solutions. But diversity, inclusion, and equity practitioners stress that they only address symptoms of a root issue and are not a panacea to address racial bias in hiring.

“Culture eats strategy for breakfast”, explains Kyanna Wheeler, a racial and equity strategist for the city of Seattle. “Even if a company does manage to improve its racial diversity, is its company culture able to sustain this strategy?” Instead, Wheeler says leaders should work to build an anti-racist company that rethinks the way the company operates. Companies need to dismantle the invisible cultural structures that drive them. “What you really need is a cultural shift. If your company values John Smith, and keeps hiring John Smiths, you have to unpack why this pattern exists.” This approach will take more work and requires accountability, she says.

The platforms themselves might even perpetuate cultural assumptions about talent. Blind hiring removes identity but still bases past work experience as a metric for future success. “We’ve been socialized to believe certain metrics have equal value. Real change means questioning assumptions”, Wheeler says.

There’s also a danger for AI in hiring to be too reductive. Gamification cannot convey context and lived experiences. “If you’re testing for risk, a poor person might be risk-averse but still innovative. Poor communities are known for innovation, they’ve perfected how to do more with less”, says Kirk Mead, Principal at the Carrington Consulting Group, a consultancy specializing in organizational development.

Also, these softwares don’t do anything about helping diverse job seekers find the right companies. After all, a diverse workforce starts with a diverse pool of candidates to pull from. “Algorithms can’t fix pathology. These solutions present a necessary component to solving racial bias but not a sufficient one,” says Mead. “We still have to address the core question of access and opportunity.”

Researchers at Imperial College London have proposed ""physical artificial intelligence"" as a new multidisciplinary area of research that could be vital to producing lifelike intelligent robots in the future.


Writing in the Nature Machine Intelligence journal, the team argue that teaching materials science, mechanical engineering, computer science, biology and chemistry as a combined discipline would help students and researchers develop lifelike artificially intelligent robots.

This combined discipline of ""physical AI"" could effectively be the missing link in the attempt to create artificially intelligent robots that look and behave like humans, the Imperial College London team suggests. They argue that research into how to build lifelike robot bodies has failed to keep up with advances in computational artificial intelligence, and that the study and practice of physical artificial intelligence could rectify this imbalance.

PROMOTED
""The development of robot 'bodies' has significantly lagged behind the development of robot 'brains'. Unlike digital AI, which has been intensively explored in the last few decades, breathing physical intelligence into them has remained comparatively unexplored,"" says Professor Mirko Kovac, of Imperial College London and the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa).

Physical Artificial Intelligence For Remote Tasks
The proposal of Physical AI comes in the context of a growing societal need to perform everyday tasks remotely and automatically, particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and widespread social distancing.

""Today’s robots are not mature and robust enough to perform everyday tasks, such as manipulating objects or moving in unpredictable and complex environments, and are not sufficiently safe to interact with humans and natural outdoor environments,"" the researchers write.

In particular, the team urges a greater focus on the development of novel materials and structures for building robots’ bodies, as well as on the co-development of functional body morphologies and intelligent control and sensor systems. Such work could then be combined with existing research into computer-based artificial intelligence, potentially producing autonomous robots that could interact with their surrounding environments in a more ‘natural’ manner.

If developed, lifelike autonomous robots could potentially help humans at work and in daily living, performing tasks that would otherwise be dangerous, onerous or tedious. They could, for example, assist in health care and social care, helping to plug the global shortage of healthcare workers.
Defining Physical AI
In order to reach such a goal, the researchers propose introducing a systematic educational approach for teaching students and researchers how to create robot bodies and brains as coordinated, unified wholes. They argue that this approach must be centred around physical AI, which they define as ""the theory and practice of creating physical systems capable of performing tasks that are typically associated with intelligent organisms.""
Five main disciplines are essential for creating physical AI, according to the researchers. These are materials science, mechanical engineering, computer science, biology and chemistry.
“The notion of AI is often confined to computers, smartphones and data intensive computation. We are proposing to think of AI in a broader sense and co-develop physical morphologies, learning systems, embedded sensors, fluid logic and integrated actuation,"" says Mirko Kovac.
Collaboration between researchers in different disciplines will also be necessary if physical AI and lifelike robots are to be developed. This is something Imperial College London and Empa are already doing, with their joint Materials and Technology Centre of Robotics connecting Empa’s material science expertise with Imperial’s Aerial Robotics Laboratory.
The Quest For Lifelike Robots
“Creating lifelike robots has thus far been an impossible task, but it could be made possible by including Physical AI in the higher education system. Developing skills and research in Physical AI could bring us closer than ever to redefining human-robot and robot-environment interaction,"" explains co-lead author Dr Aslan Miriyev, also of Empa and Imperial College London.
Both he and Mirko Kovac intend to implement physical AI methodology into their research and teaching activities. However, they aren’t the only people researching how to make autonomous robots that move like humans or other animals.
Most notoriously, Boston Dynamics–a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology–has developed a range of life-mimicking robots in its 28-year existence. This includes Atlas, a bipedal anthropomorphic robot that can perform rudimentary gymnastics. It also includes Spot, a ‘dog’ that can open doors and flip light switches, and that was recently used in Singapore to encourage social distancing.
Other companies are operating in similar areas to Boston Dynamics. US-based Agility Robotics launched its own bipedal anthropomorphic robot, Digit, at the beginning of this year, with Ford purchasing two units in order to research last-mile package delivery. Even Disney has been getting in on the act, with it releasing a video at the end of October of a ""humanoid animatronic bust"" (i.e. an artificial human head) capable of looking at objects and people in its vicinity.
There is, then, plenty of pioneering research happening right now into the production of lifelike robots. But with the team at Imperial College London and Empa defining the new discipline of ""Physical AI,"" such research is likely to be given more impetus and a greater level of systematic organisation.

Smart speakers, deepfake videos, personalised advertising –artificial intelligence is everywhere. Alexander Ilic, head of the new AI research centre at ETH Zurich, wants to make sure AI is there to help humans, not replace them.  
swissinfo.ch: AI increasingly influences our lives. How important is it for society? 
Alexander Ilic: Machines are more and more capable of doing things we thought only humans could do. At the moment, several new technologies are coming together and speeding up progress. ETH Zurich has been strong in AI research for several decades. What we need now is to organise a dialogue with society and business, and we need to do it responsibly. 
swissinfo.ch: Have we reached a turning point? 
A.I.: There are often technological advances that fuel each other. Mobile phones, for example, have changed our society forever. Some people say that in 20 years’ time, AI will be part of our lives like electricity has been since its invention. It will be hard to imagine what life used to be like without it. 



                New AI Research Centre             

 


The new centreExternal link was launched in October with a core team of 29 professorships from seven departments. “We aim to have 100 professorships in the near future,“ director Alexander Illic told a press conference. 
He said AI courses were increasingly popular at ETH. Students from different fields attend these courses, so uniting the different departments around AI makes sense. 
The AI research centre aims to connect Europe’s leading AI hotspots and build bridges between fields of expertise, so that trustworthy, widely accessible and inclusive AI systems can be developed for society. 
The centre is on the ETH compound, but is due to move to a more spacious location in Oerlikon near Zurich in 2022. 


swissinfo.ch: There are already many institutes doing AI research, so was it necessary for ETH to create this centre?   
A.I.: The special thing about our centre is that our work is interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary. It is not only about applying existing AI methods to complex social problems, such as climate change. Some problems require redefining the fundamentals of AI, and that is what we want to do. 
swissinfo.ch: Can you elaborate on that? 
A.I.: The areas of application where we want to bring about change and the fundamentals of AI should influence each other. In other words, the application changes the AI, and by changing the AI new fields of application arise. We want it to work both ways. In order to do this, we have set up this centre where various departments that used to be separate entities come together for dialogue. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic we have not been able to meet as often as we would have liked. The centre is to become a central hub for ETH’s internal communication but also for external dialogue. Here, all departments and areas of operation come together and form a focal point for cooperation with the industry. The centre will also become an incubator for start-ups and support them in their development.  







                Alexander Ilic, Managing Director of the new “ETH AI Center”, has gained experience with artificial intelligence in theory and practice as an academic and entrepreneur.

swissinfo.ch: While consumers are swamped with digital information and apps, it is hard for them to grasp the technology behind it and its purpose. How do you deal with this tension? 
A.I.: We want to show in dialogue with the public what AI can achieve. There are many tangible examples, such as what is happening in medicine and digital health which is easy to understand and brings many positive changes. We want to show that artificial intelligence supports people, it does not replace them.
swissinfo.ch: Can you give an example of how you communicate with the public? 
A.I.: We are planning a series of events on these issues. We want to show applications that already exist and also how they impact society. We have made it our mission to be a pioneer of trustworthy and inclusive AI. This means involving different population groups equally and respecting people’s individual rights. It’s also important to us that this core technology should be widely accessible. In a nutshell, trustworthy, inclusive and widely accessible. AI should not be only for large companies, it should also be available to small and medium-sized firms. 
swissinfo.ch: You want to carry the digital transformation to society through human beings. Do you expect resistance from people? 
A.I.: When something changes, there is always a certain amount of uncertainty and scepticism. It is important to understand that technological progress will change our society. We want to help shape this change and show that we at ETH Zurich are doing this in a responsible way. For example, we have a professor of ethics on our steering committee who makes sure our work is in line with the basic principles. When it comes to AI, it is particularly important to emphasize ethical work practices, which is best done by using examples.

            Read more: How do you build trust in new technologies?        


swissinfo.ch: Which ethical questions will be dealt with at the new centre? 
A.I.: The first question is whether we need new ethical fundamentals for AI, or not. Generally, most scientists in other departments of ETH Zurich already work following ethical principles. However, the questions around AI are a bit more complex, for example concerning algorithms. Are these algorithms fair? How can we judge that? Are they inclusive? These questions need a lot of clarification. There are currently scores of different guidelines. We need to be involved in the dialogue and provide clarity. We want to enter into dialogue with different groups, not only to discuss the issue but also to take a position. 
swissinfo.ch: One such ethical question would be who should get access to certain AI technologies, such as military applications for example. To what extent will the centre address such questions and advise companies on how to assess and understand what their technologies are used for?
A.I.: Our main message is that technology is not simply neutral. The person who designs something new carries a certain responsibility. Hence, it is important to us that we help shape this dialogue and let our European values influence the development of AI applications. 
swissinfo.ch: How will you deal with such ethical questions and dilemmas in the future? 
A.I.: We want to set a good example, stand up for our values and culture and allow them to shape the development of our projects. This is a very effective method as we train people who live these values and take them with them when they go out into the world.

[a]China has previously released a number of AI-related policy documents, including the State Council Guidelines on Promoting the Healthy and Orderly Development of the Internet of Things (2013), Made in China 2025, Robotics Industry Development Plan (2016-2020), and the State Council Guidelines on Promoting the “Internet+” Action (2015).
[b] Compulsory education in China covers nine-year schooling in primary and junior secondary schools.
[c] Recently, it has taken key initiatives towards incorporating AI. For example, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship signed an agreement with IBM in September 2019 to train faculty members from Industrial Training Institutes in the basics of AI skills under the Train-the-Trainer programme.
[d] H-index is a measure to evaluate an author’s scholarly output and performance. It compares publications to citations; “there are h papers that have each been cited at least h times”.
[e] The rest come from research institutions, enterprises and other entities.
[f]For an extensive search that goes beyond the generic phrase of AI and inclusive of many AI-related keywords/categories, see Tsinghua University’s ‘China AI Development Report 2018,’ which shows that that China leads in the 1997-2017 timespan in AI paper output.
[g]The search included “People’s Republic of China or China” in the country/region.
[h] For “academic promotions, job offers and allocation of research funding.” (Sharma, 2020).
[i]This does not rule out funding by other national and international agencies.
[j]Web of Science defines HCPs as papers that received enough citations in a specific period “to place them in the top 1% of their academic fields based on a highly cited threshold for the field and publication year.”
[k]Turkey, ahead of India, is in the transcontinental region.

As technologies such as 3D printing move the discipline forward in remaking the built environment, AI and generative design are having an impact on architecture from a planning and design perspective, where the profession is largely digital and computational. We spoke with Lilli Smith, Senior Product Manager AEC Generative Design at Autodesk, a practitioner in the field of architecture for more than 20 years — the last 18 of which have been making the software that architects use to design their creations.In architecture, art, and other creative fields, generative design is a methodology that automates the creation of design options that may balance a variety of competing goals. The latest wave of generative design is driven by artificial intelligence. “This is often the case in architectural design problems,” Smith says. “There’s not a single objective that you’re trying to go after — there’s no one answer. But, there’s a lot of different objectives that come into making an architectural project. So, for example, in an urban design workflow, having a nice amount of open space and good views from your property might be important. But return on investment and value generated through more rentable area[s] might also be important.”Figure 01: Generative design is a methodology that automates the creation of design options that may balance a variety of competing goals.[Photo: by Markus Spiske on Unsplash]Generative design can help automate the creation of options, which satisfy a variety of goals that the designer wants to encode into the system. Generative design can also be an exploratory tool to open up a designer’s thinking — not necessarily solving the problem or providing one right answer.“Using algorithms to guide the creation of these design options, the computer will give you … the best options that it can, given the goals and the size of the exploration also that you have specified,” says Smith. “Then you can have a discussion with your stakeholders about which goals may actually be more important or which designs … the stakeholder may favor for other reasons. It’s a great way to have conversations with people.”“When there are several inputs to the design, it becomes really hard for the human mind to keep track of all the combinations of those inputs,” says Smith. “The computer can actually surprise you with combinations of different inputs that you might not have thought about before …”The AI can quickly produce a high volume of concepts attuned to the requirements of the project. That concept generation, or what we might have used to think of as “brainstorming”, at scale, by the machine is affordable and more comprehensive than what a human could do in the same budget of time and money. This is particularly important in the context of architecture where, as Smith illustrates, the requirements are complex, extensive, and can often be competing. “So, the computer isn’t really coming up with anything on its own,” says Smith. “[It’s] just having an automated way to produce all of these combinations that humans aren’t good at, but computers are really good at. And then being able to rank and sort them, or search through them, given the different metrics that you’ve also included, can sometimes even yield surprising and delightful results that you didn’t expect.”A Brief History of Generative DesignEven though we think of terms and applications like “generative” as cutting edge, programmatic artists have been using this creative method for over 50 years. “Generative design is really not new,” says Smith. “There’s a long history of generative art.” In the 1960s, the pioneering Hungarian computer artist Vera Molnár worked in the early programming language Fortran to generate images examining theme, variation, automated generation, and display of options in her work. Digital artist Manfred Mohr, another pioneer of algorithmic art, generated variations of 3D geometry in the 1960s and 1970s. And, in their 1972 article, “Shape Grammars and the Generative Specification of Painting and Sculpture”, design technologists George Stiny and James Gips created a manual encoding of design systems, describing a production system for generating shapes. “It’s really a direct line of thinking for a lot of what goes on in parametric design and also underpinnings of tools like CityEngine, which is a tool by Esri for urban planning based on GIS data, and other tools, as well,” says Smith. “There are papers in the 1970s that demonstrate how people were really thinking about, in architecture and specifically in hospital floor plans, how to lay out those floor plans algorithmically,” says Smith. “So, these ideas have been around for a long time in architecture. They’ve also been around in engineering.”In a more recent example of AI-driven generative approaches, NASA used programmatic design to create configurations for its satellite antennas. Jason Lohn, the leader of this project at NASA Ames Research Center, described the algorithmic approach to design in a feature article published by the agency in 2006:“The AI software examined millions of potential antenna designs before settling on a final one,” said Lohn. The software did this much faster than any human being could do so under the same circumstances, according to Lohn. “Through a process patterned after Darwin’s ‘survival of the fittest,’ the strongest designs survive and the less capable do not.”“We told the computer program what performance the antenna should have, and the computer simulated evolution, keeping the best antenna designs that approached what we asked for. Eventually, it zeroed in on something that met the desired specifications for the mission,” Lohn said.“They searched through tens of thousands of these different antennas,” says Smith. “And they were able to come up with a design that was never something that they would have come up with in their own minds [through] their own traditional design process. But the final antenna design performed more than 90% more efficiently over the traditional antenna.” In the NASA example, we can see how AI can inform and enhance creative decisions by introducing superior design options that humans may not even initially consider, with surprisingly effective results. The design output is better because both human and machine are doing what they do best.Figure 02: NASA used programmatic design to create configurations for its satellite antennas.[Photo: by NASA on Unsplash]Computational Design Approaches in PracticeInspired in part by generative design’s storied history, Autodesk research has long been interested in using generative workflows. “A couple of years ago, Autodesk bought an architectural firm called The Living out of New York City,” says Smith. “[An] amazing collection of talented designers who also have computational brains. They are really good coders and very good designers. And, they’ve worked on a number of projects involving generative design pursuits.”“They worked with Airbus on a partition. [It’s] one component of a plan which might not seem super important. But, there’s a lot of different functionality that has to go into the thinking about that panel. They have to be able to remove certain sections of it to accommodate emergency stretchers going into the plane,” says Smith, “… and of course rigorous safety standards and crash testing standards.”“They were able to use this process of studying flexible models and looking at how a material could be taken out, but you still have the structural integrity of this panel. And also use 3D printing technology to get the total weight of each partition down by about 45% or about 30 kilograms,” says Smith. “And this might seem minor, in the context of a whole plane that’s really big and fully weighted. But, they do estimate that these weight savings across the current generation of these A320 series of planes could result in the savings of almost half a million metric tons of CO2 every year.”In order to test their applications of and theories about generative design, Autodesk used the method in the design of their new Autodesk Toronto facility — referred to as their new center for emerging technologies. “They wanted to use generative techniques in order to design the new office space. So, they started out by collecting a bunch of data to guide the design and help them to create goals for what was their ideal office,” says Smith. “So they ask people questions like: ‘Who would you like to sit by?’, ‘How much distraction can you take in your day?’, ‘Do you like a lot of daylight near your desk or do you need a darker environment because you’re using screens and you don’t like a lot of glare’”. After conducting extensive internal research, the team developed six goals that they used to evaluate their designs. “They surveyed existing employees and then they boiled all that data down to these six goals that were about adjacency, distraction, things like that,” says Smith. The team created a flexible model. “They had an idea about how this design was going to work and had an idea about how it could flex and vary,” says Smith. They wanted to study … the various implications of where they put groups of desks and where they put groups of amenities, meaning conference rooms, phone booths, more private spaces. So, they developed flexible models and ways to measure the success of those designs and use the computer to help guide them to solutions that satisfied those goals.”Figure 03: AI can help architects develop flexible models for designing an ideal office space, and help guide them to solutions that satisfy those goals.[Photo: by Nastuh Abootalebi on Unsplash]AI and the Future of Architecture“A lot of people that we talk to see the possibility of the computer augmenting their design efforts,” says Smith. “They see that humans are still going to be critical in these design efforts because they’re going to be setting up the problems, deciding what kinds of problems to solve, using machines to help them to do a better job.”“I think we’ve got a long way to go before the machines are writing all the software or doing design for us. Maybe it will happen someday but I think we have a long way to go before the bots take over,” says Smith. Our computer overlords remain a long way off. The machines are going to be helping us to make things, not removing us from the equation. They will remove the more physical, manual, mundane, and tedious parts. They will not be doing the core problem solving, particularly up front in the research and requirements but even, for the time being, in the core solution articulation once a generative approach has determined the correct basic direction.“I think generative design is a different way of thinking for designers. It’s different to think about designing a system for design instead of several one-off designs…. It’s different to think about how you can make a whole design system that’s going to flex for you,” says Smith. “It also requires computational design skills, so that you can use the computer to augment your powers. We’ve tried to make it easier for architects and engineers by making these visual scripting environments where you can write code by just putting together these different nodes or different functionality. And we also work on developing nodes that people can share. And also developing a community of people who want to share code with each other.”Enabling creators via a visual interface that precludes the need to learn programming or otherwise tangle with unsophisticated UI is important to unlocking the potential of artificial intelligence in a creative context. The approach of offering visual environments of use, instead of expecting non-programmers to use programming to best use next generation tools, is a common theme when it comes to emerging technologies like AI. Contrary to the popular buzz around the importance of everyone learning programming, the reality is that companies that create the tools for creatives are proactively trying to make these tools so they can be fully exploited by the non-programmers among us. Indeed, while today there is a good argument for many creatives to learn some degree of programming to best leverage the early and nascent tools at our disposal, those are skills that might build our long-term holistic knowledge base, but will only be practically applicable in our work for a shorter time horizon, during this transition period when computational creativity is in the early days.Using AI-assisted automated methods to better design buildings may very well be a future imperative. “By the year 2050, there are going to be 10 billion people on earth. And, if you do the math, we’re going to need to build about 13,000 buildings a day to accommodate all those people,” says Smith. “In order to build all these buildings without totally destroying the earth, we’re going to have to develop better methods to design and construct [them]… Generative design is one tool in this effort. I think we’re going to have to drastically change a lot of how we’re getting things done to accommodate all of these people on earth.”Creative Next is a podcast exploring the impact of AI-driven automation on the lives of creative workers, people like writers, researchers, artists, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs.

AI and the Battle for the Future of Photo Editing





Nov 12, 2020





DL Cade







































 For photographers, AI photo editing is no longer a fringe topic for ML researchers or a gimmick employed by smartphone apps. With the impending release of Skylum’s Luminar AI and Adobe calling the latest build of Photoshop “the world’s most advanced AI application for creatives,” it’s time for the community to reckon with an important question: What does this mean for photography, photo editing, and creativity at large? One of the hottest hot takes in the industry right now is that AI photo editing is going to be very bad for photographers and retouchers of all stripes. Whether it’s Luminar AI, Adobe’s Sensei AI-powered tools, or the NVIDIA technology behind Photoshop’s new portrait editing features, most photographers seem wary of this technology and its potential impacts of creativity. Naysayers paint a grim picture of over-edited portraits and homogenous landscapes that are indistinguishable from one another–each of them edited using the same sky replacement tool, the same skin smoothing, the same fake fog, and the same “intelligent” dodge and burn tools. Like calligraphy or traditional printmaking, they envision a future where “manual” photo editing is an artisanal skill practiced by a dedicated few.

Some argue that lowering the barrier to entry into the world of photo editing will act as a “gateway drug” that will empower young artists to discover and expand their creative chops. But what about the people on the front lines? How do the companies behind this tech feel about the “AI revolution” that they are bringing about? And what about professional retouchers and educators whose jobs depend on (and might be replaced by) this technology? I wanted to find out, and so I reached out to Adobe, Skylum, Pratik Naik of Solstice Retouch, and Aaron Nace of Phlearn and asked each the same somewhat-loaded question:


Do you believe that the advent of increasingly capable AI-powered photo editing tools is going to be a net positive on the photography and retouching industries? Why or why not? Feel free to elaborate. I’ve re-printed their responses in full below, in the hopes of injecting a bit of nuance and perspective into this conversation. As with most things in life, there is no black and white answer, but understanding the shades of gray might help a few of us prepare to live and work (and maybe even thrive) in the AI-powered future of photo editing. Because as each of our responders pointed out in one way or another: unlike Thanos, this really is inevitable.  Alex Tsepko, CEO at Skylum To cut to the chase, I think AI is definitely a positive thing that’s happening to the photo industry right now. People are using photography to build their brand, sell their services, goods, tell their friends and family a story. To do this well, they need to be able edit photos well; spending the minimum amount of time in the process.  Creators don’t want and most importantly don’t have to waste time on routine work. Instead, they use smart technologies to speed up the process of creating the photographs they need to tell their stories to the world via print, social media, or anything in between. At Skylum, we believe all technology should serve a meaningful purpose and, ideally, a noble one. To that end, we thought by adding the power of artificial intelligence to Luminar AI, we could offer new ways of doing things.




When editing photos, people spend 74% of their time on repetitive, routine tasks, which we call grunt work. Because of the boring nature of this grunt work, people come to think of photo editing as more difficult and less satisfying. We believe that AI can automate much of this grunt work and free people to reinvest that time in their personal lives or in further developing their creativity. When a professional opens a photo to edit, the end result is already well-formed, if not completely alive in her mind… this is not always the case with amateurs or hobbyists. ​ Lacking the knowledge of the professional, amateurs and hobbyists start clicking buttons and dragging sliders hoping to find their way to a great result. Too often, they fail. Looking at this problem, we wondered if artificial intelligence might serve as a guide; inspiring amateurs and hobbyists to find and develop their own style. ​ To solve these problems, Luminar AI uses artificial intelligence to evaluate the user’s photos and suggest several style options. Here, it is important to understand the software robot (AI) does not replace human creativity. In fact, human creativity, in the form of very talented professional photographers and retouchers, trains our AI to understand what a good image is and then guides it through a series of options to get their images there … quickly. Thus, a creator has the immediate benefit of a creative inspiration, prompted by the AI, and does not find themselves stuck when experience is lacking or, in the case of professionals, the ideas are not flowing.  Maria Yap, Vice President of Digital Imaging at Adobe [It is] absolutely [a positive]. I firmly believe that AI, when done right, helps amplify human creativity and enhances creative expression. For photographers and photo retouching professionals, AI-powered features across Photoshop and Lightroom eliminate manual and repetitive tasks, reduce complex workflows, and even enable adjustments to images in ways that were previously not possible with existing tools.  To address real-world needs and pain points, we work closely with professional photographers in developing our Sensei AI-powered features, and have seen that most photographers are quick to incorporate these powerful tools into their day-to-day workflows. Photoshop is the world’s most advanced AI application for creatives, and we’re just getting started.




  Pratik Naik of Solstice Retouch This heavily debated topic is at the center of discussion today in our industry. No matter the genre, we’re all going to benefit from tools that work for everything from landscapes, portraits, and anything in between. I personally am optimistic and embrace developments in tech that give us options for creativity. With our communities, I get to see how creatives work with our tools in order to further accomplish their vision. I know that there are also many out there that may consider it cheating to have these assisted tools modify a photo that goes well beyond what was there in reality. We could sit here all day and discuss whether something is a photograph or not. However, we can’t deny that these tools will help people get to their end goal quicker and more accurately, no matter what definition they use to define the final image. On retouching portraits in specific, if tools enable us to get done faster, we’ll have the ability to get through more images. Based on how one manages time and rates, it could actually end up producing a positive impact in making more money. Because these tools are a part of the workflow chain, they still require user input to guide them in order to get to where each person wants. For example, if you gave the same image to ten retouchers, the end result will vary greatly, so taste and direction are still required. This is where experience in working will still take precedence and the tools themselves will not level the playing field entirely. No matter what comes in the future, it can only provide additional opportunities for us to not only explore but implement these tools in our work to produce better results at a faster pace. Those who have a harder time adapting will always struggle, but I see promise with these tools if people can incorporate them into their workflow and businesses strategically.   Aaron Nace of Phlearn Technology continues to evolve at a startling pace, and we have seen huge shifts in the photography industry in the past – for instance, the advent of the digital camera. Art and technology have always been intrinsically linked, and with each iteration of technology, new art forms are developed. 




Whether these changes in AI are positive or negative depends on the subjective point of view of individuals, but one thing is clear – It is up to us to continue to evolve or get left behind. My perspective is that I don’t see it as a positive or a negative, it is just a change. If you are unwilling to adjust with the change, you may see it as a negative, if you embrace it, then it can be a positive. Personally, I plan on embracing changes in technology and moving forward.  Final Thoughts One of the most surprising things about the answers we got, especially the ones from Naik and Nace, is how generally optimistic they were. At worst, the sentiment is that these tools are coming whether you like them or not so you may as well find a way to work with them—”evolve or get left behind.” No one’s denying the impact that automating large parts of the photo editing process will have on the art of retouching and photo editing. Google Maps came along, and now nobody learns how to read a physical map; automatic cars are so common in the US that hardly anybody learns how to drive stick; Spell Check isn’t helping anybody become a better speller. It would be naïve to imply that AI photo editing tools–the powerful, accurate, realistic ones–won’t have a similar impact on photo editing, encouraging some people to outsource more and more of their workflow to the algorithms. But as Naik and Nace rightly point out, it would be equally naïve to buy into the idea that AI spells the “end of creativity as we know it.” Good art demands subtlety and surprise, and the latter is, by definition, impossible to automate.  This debate is a great distraction–sort of like obsessing over the latest lens that’s 2% sharper than the last, or touting the unique benefits of Brand A over Brands B and C. If you’re looking for something to debate in the comments or yet another company/technology/website/*fill in the blank* that’s coming for photographers’ jobs, AI is low-hanging fruit. But just as no combination of specs has ever birthed an artist… no amount of automation could ever truly snuff one out.

The increasing attention being paid to artificial intelligence raises important questions about its integration with social sciences and humanity, according to David De Cremer, founder and director of the Centre on AI Technology for Humankind at the National University of Singapore Business School. He is the author of the recent book, Leadership by Algorithm: Who Leads and Who Follows in the AI Era?
While AI today is good at repetitive tasks and can replace many managerial functions, it could over time acquire the “general intelligence” that humans have, he said in a recent interview with AI for Business (AIB), a new initiative at Analytics at Wharton. Headed by Wharton operations, information and decisions professor Kartik Hosanagar, AIB is a research initiative that focuses on helping students expand their knowledge and application of machine learning and understand the business and societal implications of AI. 
According to De Cremer, AI will never have “a soul” and it cannot replace human leadership qualities that let people be creative and have different perspectives. Leadership is required to guide the development and applications of AI in ways that best serve the needs of humans. “The job of the future may well be [that of] a philosopher who understands technology, what it means to our human identity, and what it means for the kind of society we would like to see,” he noted. 
An edited transcript of the interview appears below.
AI for Business: A lot is being written about artificial intelligence. What inspired you to write Leadership by Algorithm? What gap among existing books about AI were you trying to fill?
David De Cremer: AI has been around for quite some time. The term was coined in 1956 and inspired a “first wave” of research until the mid-1970s. But since the beginning of the 21st century more direct applications became clear and changed our attitude towards the “real” potential of AI. This shift was especially fueled by events where AI started to engage with world champions in chess and the Chinese game Go. Most of the attention went, and still goes to, the technology itself: that the technology acts in ways that seem to be intelligent, which is also a simple definition of artificial intelligence.
It seems intelligent in ways that humans are intelligent. I am not a computer scientist; my background is in behavioral economics. But I did notice that the integration between social sciences, humanity, and artificial intelligence was not getting as much attention as it should. Artificial intelligence is meant to create value for society that is populated by humans; the end users always must be humans. That means AI must act, think, read, and produce outcomes in a social context.
AI is particularly good at repetitive, routine tasks and thinking systematically and consistently. This already implies that the tasks and the jobs that are most likely to be taken over by AI are the hard skills, and not so much the soft skills. In a way, this observation corresponds with what is called Moravec’s paradox: What is easy for humans is difficult for AI, and what is difficult for humans seems rather easy for AI.
An important conclusion is then also that in the future developments of humans, training our soft skills will become even more important — and not less as many may assume. I wanted to explain that because there are many signs today — especially so since COVID-19 — that we need and are required to adapt more to the new technologies. As such, that puts the use and influence of AI in our society in a dominant position. As we are becoming more aware, we are moving into a society where people are being told by algorithms what their taste is, and, without questioning it too much, most people comply easily. Given these circumstances, it does not seem to be a wild fantasy anymore that AI may be able to take a leadership position, which is why I wanted to write the book.
“We are moving into a society where people are being told by algorithms what their taste is, and, without questioning it too much, most people comply easily.”
AIB: Is it possible to develop AI in a way that makes technology more efficient without undermining humanity? Why does this risk exist? Can it be mitigated?
De Cremer: I believe it is possible. This relates to the topic of the book as well. [It is important] that we have the right kind of leadership. The book is not only about whether AI will replace leaders; I also point out that humans have certain unique qualities that technology will never have. It is difficult to put a soul into a machine. If we could do that, we would also understand the secrets of life. I am not too optimistic that it will [become reality] in the next few decades, but we have an enormous responsibility. We are developing AI or a machine that can do things we would never have imagined years ago.
At the same time, because of our unique qualities of having and taking perspective, proactive thinking, and being able to take things into abstraction, it is up to us how we are going to use it. If you look at the leadership today, I do not see much consensus in the world. We are not paying enough attention to training our leaders – our business leaders, our political leaders, and our societal leaders. We need good leadership education. Training starts with our children. [It is about] how we train them to appreciate creativity, the ability to work together with others, take perspectives from each other, and learn a certain kind of responsibility that makes our society. So yes, we can use machines for good if we are clear about what our human identity is and the value we want to create for a humane society.
AIB: Algorithms are becoming an important part of how work is managed. What are the implications?
De Cremer: An algorithm is a model that makes data intelligent, meaning it helps us to recognize the trends that are happening in the world around us, and that are captured by means of our data collections. When analyzed well, data can tell us how to deal with our environment in a better and more efficient manner. This is what I’m trying to do in the business school, by seeing how we can make our business leaders more tech savvy in understanding how, where, and why to use algorithms, automation, to have more efficient decision-making.
Many business leaders have problems making business cases for why they should use AI. They are struggling to make sense of what AI can bring to their companies. Today most of them are influenced by surveys showing that as a business you have to engage in AI adoption because everyone else is doing it. But how it can benefit your own unique company is often less well understood.
Every company has data that is unique to it. You must work with that in terms of [shaping] your strategy, and in terms of the value that your company can and wishes to create. For this to be achieved, you also have to understand the values that define your company and that make it different your competitors. We are not doing a good job training our business leaders to think like this. Rather than making them think that they should become coders themselves, they should focus on becoming a bit more tech savvy so they can pursue their business strategy — in line with their values — in an environment where technology is part of the business process.
This implies that our business leaders do understand what an algorithm exactly does, but also what its limits are, what the potential is, and especially so where in the decision-making chain of the company AI can be used to promote productivity and efficiency. To achieve this, we need leaders who are tech savvy enough to optimize their extensive knowledge on business processes to maximize efficiency for the company and for society. It is there that I see a weakness for many business leaders today.
Without a doubt, AI will become the new co-worker. It will be important for us to decide where in the loop of the business process do you automate, where is it possible to take humans out of the loop, and where do you definitely keep humans in the loop to make sure that automation and the use of AI doesn’t lead to a work culture where people feel that they are being supervised by a machine, or being treated like robots. We must be sensitive to these questions. Leaders build cultures, and in doing this they communicate and represent the values and norms the company uses to decide how work needs to be done to create business value.
AIB: Are algorithms replacing the human mind as machines replaced the body? Or are algorithms and machines amplifying the capabilities of the mind and body? Should humans worry that AI will render the mental abilities of humans obsolete or simply change them?
De Cremer: That is one of the big philosophical questions. We can refer to Descartes here, [who discovered the] body and mind [problem]. With the Industrial Revolution, we can say that the body was replaced by machine. Some people do believe that with artificial intelligence the mind will now be replaced. So, body and mind are basically taken over by machines.
“We can use machines for good if we are clear about what our human identity is and the value we want to create for a humane society.”
As I outlined in my book, there is more sophistication to that. We also know that the body and mind are connected. What connects them is the soul. And that soul is not a machine. The machine at this moment has no real grasp of what it means to understand its environment or how meaning can be inferred from it. Even more important in light of the idea of humanity and AI, a machine does not think about humans, or what it means to be a human. It does not care about humans. If you die today, AI does not worry about that.
So, AI does not have a connection to reality in terms of understanding semantics and deeply felt emotions. AI has no soul. That is essential for body and mind to function. We say that one plus one is three if you want to make a great team. But in this case if we say AI or machines replace the body and then replace the mind, we still have one plus one is two, but we do not have three, we don’t have the magic. Because of that, I do not believe AI is replacing our mind.
Secondly, the simple definition that I postulated earlier is that artificial intelligence represents behaviors, or decisions that are being made by a machine that seem intelligent. That definition is based on the idea that machine intelligence is able to imitate the intelligent behavior that humans show. But, that machines seem able to act in ways like humans does not mean that we are talking about the same kind of intelligence and existence.
When we look at machine learning, it is modeled after neural networks. But we also know, for example, that neuroscience still knows little, maybe not even 10%, of how the brain works. So, we cannot say that we know everything and put that in a machine and argue that it replicated the human mind completely.
The simplest example I always use is that a computer works in ones and zeroes, but people do not work in ones and zeroes. When we talk about ethics with humans, things are mostly never black or white, but rather gray. As humans we are able to make sense of that gray area, because we have developed an intuition, a moral compass in the way we grew up and were educated. As a result, we can make sense of ambiguity. Computers at the moment cannot do that. Interestingly, efforts are being made today to see whether we can train machines like we educate children. If that succeeds, then machines will come closer to dealing with ambiguity as we do.
AIB: What implications do these questions have for leadership? What role can leaders play in encouraging the design of better technology that is used in wiser rather than smarter ways?
“That machines seem able to act in ways like humans does not mean that we are talking about the same kind of intelligence and existence.”
De Cremer: I make a distinction between managers and leaders. When we talk about running an organization, you need both management and leadership. Management provides the foundation for companies to work in a stable and orderly manner. We have procedures so we can make things a little bit more predictable. Since the early 20th century, as companies grew in size, you had to manage companies and [avoid] chaos. Management is thus the opposite of chaos. It is about structuring and [bringing] order to chaos by employing metrics to assess goals and KPI’s are achieved in more or less predictable ways. In a way, management as we know it, is a status-quo maintaining system.
Leadership, however, is not focused on the status quo but rather deals with change and the responsibility to give direction to deal with the chaos that comes along with change. That is why it is important for leadership to be able to adapt, to be agile, because once things change, as a leader you are looked upon to [provide solutions]. That is where our abilities to be creative, to think in proactive ways, understand what value people want to see and to adapt to ensure that this kind of value is achieved when change sets in.
AI will be extremely applicable to management because management is consistent, it tries to focus on the status quo, and because of its repetitiveness it is in essence a pretty predictable activity … and this is basically also how an algorithm works. AI is already doing this kind of work by predicting the behavior of employees, whether they will leave the company, or whether they are still motivated to do their job. Many managerial decisions are where I see algorithms can play a big role. It starts as AI being an advisor, providing information, but then slowly moving into management jobs. I call this management by algorithm – MBA. Theoretically and from a practical point of view, this will happen, because AI as we know it today in organizations is good at working with stationary data sets. It, however, has a problem dealing with complexities. This is where AI, as we know it today, falls short on the leadership front.
Computer scientists working in robotics and with self-driving cars say the biggest challenge for robots is interacting with people, physical contact, and coordinating their movements with the execution of tasks. Basically, it is more difficult for robots to work within the context of teams than sending a robot to Mars. The reason for this is that the more complex the environment, the more likely it is that robots will make mistakes. As we are less tolerant to having robots inflict harm on humans, it thus becomes a dangerous activity to have autonomous robots and vehicles interacting with humans.
Leadership is about dealing with change. It is about making decisions that you know are valuable to humans. You need to understand what it means to be a human, that you can have human concerns, taking into account that you can be compassionate, and you can be humane. At the same time, you need to be able to imagine and be proactive, because your strategy in a changing situation may need to be adjusted to create the same value. You need to be able to make abstraction of this, and AI is not able to do this.
AIB: I am glad you brought up the question of compassion. Do you believe that algorithm-based leadership is capable of empathy, compassion, curiosity, or creativity?
“[Artificial intelligence] has a problem dealing with complexities. This is where AI, as we know it today, falls short on the leadership front.”
De Cremer: Startups and scientists are working on what we call “affective AI”. Can AI detect and feel emotions? Conceptually it is easy to understand. So, yes, AI will be able to detect emotions, as long as we have enough training data available. Of course, emotions are complex – also to humans – so, really understanding what emotions signify to the human experience, that’s something AI will not be able to do (at least in decades to come). As I said before, AI does not understand what it means to be human, so, taking the emotional intelligence perspective of what makes us human is clearly a limit for machines. That is also why we call it artificial intelligence. It is important to point out that we can also say that humans have an AI; I call that authentic intelligence.
At this moment AI does not have authentic intelligence. People believe that AI systems cannot have authentic emotions and an authentic sense of morality. It is impossible because they do not have the empathic and existential qualities people are equipped with. Also, I am not too sure that algorithms achieve authentic intelligence easily given the fact that they do not have a soul. So, if we cannot infuse them with a common sense that corresponds to the common sense of humans, which can make sense of gray zones and ambiguity, I don’t think they can develop a real sense of empathy, which is authentic and genuine.
What they can learn — and that is because of the imitation principle — is what we call surface-level emotions. They will be able to respond, they will scan your face, they will listen to the tone of your voice, and they will be able to identify categories of emotions and respond to it in ways that humans usually respond to. That is a surface-level understanding of the emotions that humans express. And I do believe that this ability will help machines to be efficient in most interactions with humans.
Why will it work? Because as humans we are very attuned to the ability of our interaction partners to respond to our emotions. So almost immediately and unconsciously, when someone pays attention to us, we reciprocate. Recognizing surface-level emotions would already do the trick. The deeper-level emotions correspond with what I call authentic intelligence, which is genuine, and an understanding of those type of emotions is what is needed to develop friendships and long-term connections. AI as we know it today is not even close to such an ability.
With respect to creativity, it is a similar story. Creativity means bringing forward a new idea, something that is new and meaningful to people. It solves a problem that is useful, and it makes sense to people. AI can play a role there, especially in identifying something new. Algorithms are much faster than humans in connecting information because they can scan, analyze, and observe trends in data so much faster than we do. So, in the first stage of creativity, yes, AI can bring things we know together to create a new combination so much faster and better than humans. But, humans will be needed to assess whether the new combination makes sense to solve problems humans want to solve. Creative ideas gain in value when they become meaningful to people and therefore human supervision as the final step in the creativity process will be needed.
“One of the concerns we have today is that machines are not reducing inequality but enhancing it.”
Let me illustrate this point with the following example: Experiments have been conducted where AI was given several ingredients to make pizzas, and some pizzas turned out to be attractive to humans, but other pizzas ended up being products that humans were unlikely to eat, like pineapple with marmite. Marmite is popular in the U.K. and according to the commercials, people love it or hate it, so, it’s a difficult ingredient. AI, however, does not think about whether humans will like such products or find them useful – it just identifies new combinations. So, the human will always be needed to determine whether such ideas will at the end of the day be useful and regarded as a meaningful product.
AIB: What are the limits to management by algorithm?
De Cremer: When we look at it from the narrow point of view of management, there are no limits. I believe that AI will be able to do almost any managerial task in the future. That is because of the way we define management as being focused on the idea of creating stability, order, consistency, predictability, by means of using metrics (e.g., KPIs).
AIB: How can we move towards a future where algorithms may not lead but still be at the service of humanity?
De Cremer: First, all managers and leaders will have to understand what AI is. They must understand AI’s potential and its limits — where humans must jump in and take responsibility. Humanity is important. We have to make sure that people not only look at technology from a utility perspective, where it can make a company run more efficiently because it reduces cost by not having to hire too many employees or not training people anymore to do certain tasks.
I would like to see a society where people become much more reflective. The job of the future may well be [that of] a philosopher…one who understands technology, what it means to our human identity, and what it means to the kind of society we would like to see. AI also makes us think about who we are as a species. What do we really want to achieve? Once we make AI a coworker, once we make AI a kind of citizen of our societies, I am sure the awareness of the idea “Us versus them” will become directive in the debates and discussions of the kind of institutes, organizations and society we would like to see. I called this awareness the “new diversity” in my book. Humans versus non-humans, or machines: It makes us think also about who we are, and we need that to determine what kind of value we want to create. That value will determine how we are going to use our technology.
One of the concerns we have today is that machines are not reducing inequality but enhancing it. For example, we all know that AI, in order to learn, needs data. But is data widely available to everyone or only a select few? Well, if we look at the usual suspects — Amazon, Facebook, Apple and so forth — we see that they own most of the data. They applied a business model where the customer became the product itself. Our data are valuable to them. As a result, these companies can run more sophisticated experiments, which are needed to improve our AI – which means that technology is also in the hands of a few. Democracy of data does not exist today. Given the fact that one important future direction in AI research is to make AI more powerful in terms of processing and predicting, obviously a certain fear exists that if we do not manage AI well, and we don’t think about it in terms of [whether] it is good for society as a whole, we may run into risks. Our future must be one where everyone can be tech-savvy but not one that eliminates our concerns and reflections on human identity. That is the kind of education I would like to see.

<em>An edited transcript of the interview appears below.</em>

<strong>AI for Business</strong><strong>: </strong>A lot is being written about artificial intelligence. What inspired you to write <em>Leadership by Algorithm</em>? What gap among existing books about AI were you trying to fill?

<strong>David</strong> <strong>De Cremer: </strong>AI has been around for quite some time. The term was coined in 1956 and inspired a “first wave” of research until the mid-1970s. But since the beginning of the 21st century more direct applications became clear and changed our attitude towards the “real” potential of AI. This shift was especially fueled by events where AI started to engage with world champions in chess and the Chinese game Go. Most of the attention went, and still goes to, the technology itself: that the technology acts in ways that seem to be intelligent, which is also a simple definition of artificial intelligence.

It seems intelligent in ways that humans are intelligent. I am not a computer scientist; my background is in behavioral economics. But I did notice that the integration between social sciences, humanity, and artificial intelligence was not getting as much attention as it should. Artificial intelligence is meant to create value for society that is populated by humans; the end users always must be humans. That means AI must act, think, read, and produce outcomes in a social context.

AI is particularly good at repetitive, routine tasks and thinking systematically and consistently. This already implies that the tasks and the jobs that are most likely to be taken over by AI are the hard skills, and not so much the soft skills. In a way, this observation corresponds with what is called Moravec’s paradox: What is easy for humans is difficult for AI, and what is difficult for humans seems rather easy for AI.

An important conclusion is then also that in the future developments of humans, training our soft skills will become even more important -- and not less as many may assume. I wanted to explain that because there are many signs today -- especially so since COVID-19 -- that we need and are required to adapt more to the new technologies. As such, that puts the use and influence of AI in our society in a dominant position. As we are becoming more aware, we are moving into a society where people are being told by algorithms what their taste is, and, without questioning it too much, most people comply easily. Given these circumstances, it does not seem to be a wild fantasy anymore that AI may be able to take a leadership position, which is why I wanted to write the book.
<blockquote>“We are moving into a society where people are being told by algorithms what their taste is, and, without questioning it too much, most people comply easily.”</blockquote>
<strong>AIB: </strong>Is it possible to develop AI in a way that makes technology more efficient without undermining humanity? Why does this risk exist? Can it be mitigated?

<strong>De Cremer: </strong>I believe it is possible. This relates to the topic of the book as well. [It is important] that we have the right kind of leadership. The book is not only about whether AI will replace leaders; I also point out that humans have certain unique qualities that technology will never have. It is difficult to put a soul into a machine. If we could do that, we would also understand the secrets of life. I am not too optimistic that it will [become reality] in the next few decades, but we have an enormous responsibility. We are developing AI or a machine that can do things we would never have imagined years ago.

At the same time, because of our unique qualities of having and taking perspective, proactive thinking, and being able to take things into abstraction, it is up to us how we are going to use it. If you look at the leadership today, I do not see much consensus in the world. We are not paying enough attention to training our leaders – our business leaders, our political leaders, and our societal leaders. We need good leadership education. Training starts with our children. [It is about] how we train them to appreciate creativity, the ability to work together with others, take perspectives from each other, and learn a certain kind of responsibility that makes our society. So yes, we can use machines for good if we are clear about what our human identity is and the value we want to create for a humane society.

<strong>AIB: </strong>Algorithms are becoming an important part of how work is managed. What are the implications?

<strong>De Cremer: </strong>An algorithm is a model that makes data intelligent, meaning it helps us to recognize the trends that are happening in the world around us, and that are captured by means of our data collections. When analyzed well, data can tell us how to deal with our environment in a better and more efficient manner. This is what I’m trying to do in the business school, by seeing how we can make our business leaders more tech savvy in understanding how, where, and why to use algorithms, automation, to have more efficient decision-making.

Many business leaders have problems making business cases for why they should use AI. They are struggling to make sense of what AI can bring to their companies. Today most of them are influenced by surveys showing that as a business you have to engage in AI adoption because everyone else is doing it. But how it can benefit your own unique company is often less well understood.

Every company has data that is unique to it. You must work with that in terms of [shaping] your strategy, and in terms of the value that your company can and wishes to create. For this to be achieved, you also have to understand the values that define your company and that make it different your competitors. We are not doing a good job training our business leaders to think like this. Rather than making them think that they should become coders themselves, they should focus on becoming a bit more tech savvy so they can pursue their business strategy -- in line with their values -- in an environment where technology is part of the business process.

This implies that our business leaders do understand what an algorithm exactly does, but also what its limits are, what the potential is, and especially so where in the decision-making chain of the company AI can be used to promote productivity and efficiency. To achieve this, we need leaders who are tech savvy enough to optimize their extensive knowledge on business processes to maximize efficiency for the company and for society. It is there that I see a weakness for many business leaders today.

Without a doubt, AI will become the new co-worker. It will be important for us to decide where in the loop of the business process do you automate, where is it possible to take humans out of the loop, and where do you definitely keep humans in the loop to make sure that automation and the use of AI doesn’t lead to a work culture where people feel that they are being supervised by a machine, or being treated like robots. We must be sensitive to these questions. Leaders build cultures, and in doing this they communicate and represent the values and norms the company uses to decide how work needs to be done to create business value.

<strong>AIB: </strong>Are algorithms replacing the human mind as machines replaced the body? Or are algorithms and machines amplifying the capabilities of the mind and body? Should humans worry that AI will render the mental abilities of humans obsolete or simply change them?

<strong>De Cremer: </strong>That is one of the big philosophical questions. We can refer to Descartes here, [who discovered the] <a href=""https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/discovery-mind-body-problem/"">body and mind</a> [problem]. With the Industrial Revolution, we can say that the body was replaced by machine. Some people do believe that with artificial intelligence the mind will now be replaced. So, body and mind are basically taken over by machines.

But in this case if we say AI or machines replace the body and then replace the mind, we still have one plus one is two, but we do not have three, we don’t have the magic. Because of that, I do not believe AI is replacing our mind.

One of the concerns we have today is that machines are not reducing inequality but enhancing it. For example, we all know that AI, in order to learn, needs data. But is data widely available to everyone or only a select few? Well, if we look at the usual suspects -- Amazon, Facebook, Apple and so forth -- we see that they own most of the data. They applied a business model where the customer became the product itself. Our data are valuable to them. As a result, these companies can run more sophisticated experiments, which are needed to improve our AI – which means that technology is also in the hands of a few. Democracy of data does not exist today. Given the fact that one important future direction in AI research is to make AI more powerful in terms of processing and predicting, obviously a certain fear exists that if we do not manage AI well, and we don’t think about it in terms of [whether] it is good for society as a whole, we may run into risks. Our future must be one where everyone can be tech-savvy but not one that eliminates our concerns and reflections on human identity. That is the kind of education I would like to see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combining formal instruction with practical problem-solving for fourth-year residents could accelerate the use of artificial intelligence in radiology, according to a report published in Radiology: Artificial Intelligence.







Artificial intelligence and machine learning have demonstrated their potential to improve medical imaging, from enhancing the quality of CT scans to detecting breast cancer.
However, formal training in AI and machine learning is still rare in the medical imaging field: The report noted that organized AI and machine learning curricula are limited to a few institutions and training opportunities are lacking.
To better prepare radiology residents to use AI and machine learning, and to advance the use of these technologies in medical imaging, three senior radiology residents at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) recently developed a data science pathway to provide a well-rounded introductory experience to AI and machine learning for fourth-year residents.
The pathway incorporates formal instruction and practical problem-solving into residents’ curriculum, allowing them to collaborate with data scientists.
""Across the nation there are a number of radiology residency programs that are trying to figure out how to integrate AI into their training,"" said the paper's co-lead author Walter F. Wiggins, MD, PhD.
""We thought that perhaps our experience would help other programs figure out ways to integrate this type of training into either their elective pathways or their more general residency curriculum.""
The pathway provides residents with an immersion into AI and machine learning through a flexible schedule of educational, experimental, and research activities at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS).
Through the pathway, residents were exposed to all aspects of AI and machine learning application development, such as data curation, model design, quality control, and clinical testing. Residents contributed to model and tool development at different stages, and their work during the pilot led to 12 accepted abstracts for presentation at national meetings.
Feedback from the pilot project led to the establishment of a formal AI and machine learning curriculum for future residents.
""Radiologists have always had to manage, analyze and process data in order to be able to do their work,"" Wiggins said. ""We already have the underlying skill sets and infrastructure that we can tap into to allow residents with an interest in AI and ML to really develop and become leaders in applying these skills clinically.""
The pathway provides radiology residents with the opportunity to work directly with data scientists to better understand how they approach image analysis issues with machine learning tools.
This partnership enabled the data scientists to better understand how radiologists approach a radiology problem in a clinical setting. The data scientists could be easily integrated into clinical practice.
""An important component of a curriculum like this is to learn the language the data scientists speak and teach them a little bit about the language that we as radiologists speak so that we can have better, more effective collaborations. Going through that process over several different projects was where I think I gained the best experience throughout all of this,"" said Wiggins.
""I also hope that people from other institutions might read this manuscript and find something useful for integrating into their residency curricula or for developing specialized pathways for informatics and/or data science.”
The team stated that the framework for the pathway could be easily implemented in other organizations, which could help contribute to the widespread use of AI and machine learning in radiology.
“The key factors that contributed to the success of the program that could be extrapolated to any other training institution were motivated learners, dedicated mentors, and integration into a multidisciplinary AI-ML research environment,” researchers concluded.
“It is our belief that each of these facets of the data science pathway experience will prepare residents to serve as leaders in multidisciplinary clinical data science an in radiology as a whole.”

																Is Artificial Intelligence Ruining Photography or Are You Close Minded?							





Pye Jirsa,
                                    
                                                                            4 years ago                                            






Is artificial intelligence ruining photography or are you just a smidgen close-minded? I wanted to share my two cents on this matter because it’s a conversation I find myself having too often given the current trend of software and cameras. A special thank you to Skylum Software for sponsoring this video and allowing us to showcase the benefits of AI photo editing in our previous tutorials.



So here is the main question I see asked the most: “Is artificial intelligence ruining the process and the art behind photography or is there a place for this in the workflow?“. I thought the best way to answer this was to separate the conversation into different groups of people or schools of thought, but first, I would hate for you guys to have to wait until the end of a video just to figure out someone’s opinion on something, so here’s my opinion: NO, A.I. is not ruining photography. Now that you know my answer let’s work backward to see how I arrived at that stance.
Where is Photography Going & How Did We Get Here?
Newest SLR Lounge Premium Course: Creative Photography 101 (all images made with an iPhone 11 Pro Max)
Before we dive into DSLR’s or mirrorless cameras, let’s talk about the camera that almost every individual owns: smartphone cameras. They have incredibly sophisticated software systems and what’s known as computational photography built into them so much so that they can simulate depth of field, allow you to dial in manual exposure, capture RAW photos, and offer you a variety of lens choices. We even made an entire course dedicated to iphoneography called Creative Photography 101 to help smartphone owners become better photographers. The way that I see photography going is your towards the development of better tech for phone cameras. This is based purely on facts and stats of how many people use smartphone cameras and how that camera tech has developed since its fruition to become as robust as it is today.
A.I. Based Software
Software like Skylum Software, which we’ve shown in the past, allows you to easily swap out skies using A.I. and how you can batch retouch faces in order to speed up your editing workflow. We designed Visual Flow lighting condition-based presets to expedite the editing process in Lightroom to allow users to apply a preset based on the lighting in the scene. The next project that we’re working on is with Canon to design a piece of A.I. that detects the lighting conditions when you load the images onto your computer.
Four Schools of Thought
I can easily amend my previous ‘no’ to a ‘yes’ by changing my point of view and perspective on photography. To debate this, let’s create four different types of people that have responses to this question:

The Purist
The Professional
The Enthusiast
The End User

The Purist
 Yes, A.I. definitely ruins photography for those that have an obsession with the art and science of photography. This person finds their enjoyment and passion in the artistic process. They’re in this for the craft of being able to take something from their mind and translate it through the camera. When the transition from digital to film happened, we saw a bunch of naysayers and purist photographers say that the art of photography was being tarnished with the digital age.  Let’s use coffee as an example: there is a person that will spend 30 minutes grinding coffee beans by hand, placing the perfect filter, warming the water just right, pour and separate it, and then consume the coffee. As the coffee purist, your enjoyment comes from primarily the ritual the process of creating that cup of coffee. When this purist tastes instant coffee, they have an undeniable level of respect for this process and therefore cherish it and hold it to a higher regard.
I love my purist friends because they help me to celebrate the craft in a way that sometimes I forget to see myself so it’s a wonderful thing. The danger lies in that outlook lies in trying to decide for the entire industry if photography as an art form is subjective or if it’s the process of journalism. I want to use Ansel Adams as an example because I guarantee that if there was an easier way to manipulate his photographs in post-production, he would have done it in a heartbeat. As soon as you bring a camera up to your eye and decided on your intended composition, that is already a fictitious representation of reality. So where does the purist draw the line and at what point does the process of photography evolve with the times?
The Professional
For the professional, artificial intelligence and computational photography, from the point of capture all the way through to the point of editing, serves as enhancements to their workflow. Let’s take it back to the coffee example: you enjoy making that pour over cup of coffee for you and maybe a couple close friends and love the process. Let’s say you opened a coffee shop and it then becomes your job to serve 200 people using your pour-over technique. I would venture to bet that you’re very much going to lose your interest and entire passion for the ritual. You’ll need to start figuring out how to speed up the process without compromising the quality of the product. Now, back to photography: there is nothing interesting or fun about replacing a hundred different skies. For professional wedding, event, and portrait photographers you’re typically delivering 50-1000+ images and there’s nothing enjoyable about repeating the exact same step over and over, Monday through Friday, from one client to the next. If I can use Luminar’s A.I. to batch retouch my portraits, I’m a happy working professional that now has time to do things I enjoy rather than slave away editing photos. You’re going to look at these enhancements as just being quality of life improvements and you’re going to have a hard time seeing the purist mentality.
The Enthusiast
These are the people that enjoy taking pictures but don’t necessarily know or study photography. They may own a phone that might be their primary point of capture, they might be using a dedicated camera. So does A.I. ruin for them? Nope, it in fact provides a resounding improvement across the board because it manages to do the hardest parts of photography for them. Computational photography has enabled people that don’t understand anything about photography to not only appreciate photography but take semi-decent photographs with just their phones. Oftentimes, it’s from that process that they develop a passion for photography and they step into the entire process as an art form. It’s the accessibility that pulls them into the craft. Let’s move away from the coffee example and switch over to something I love comparing photography to – cars.  Do self-driving cars ruin driving for driving enthusiasts? I’ve spent much of my time on a track in a dedicated race car and now I want a Tesla because it drives itself. In my day-to-day life, I don’t want to deal with the hassle of driving and therefore a self-driving car that takes our tediousness of driving but still allows me to enjoy it when I want because the quality of the product/experience is a major win to me. A.I. computational photography can make the craft more enjoyable from day to day and still allows you to choose when you want to hone your craft or utilize your own judgment to create photos.
The End Consumer
These people don’t care at all about the art of photography, the process, your experience as a professional, the years of schooling, none of it.  Whether it’s a client, a person browsing Instagram, a troll on Facebook – they look at an image and they base its merits on the story that it’s telling, how visually appealing it is, and then they move on with their lives. All these people care about is the end result and what the image evokes. Obviously, this is on the complete opposite side of the spectrum from the purist, who spends hours fine-tuning their art and dissecting photographs to understand them. A.I. to the end consumer doesn’t ruin photography at all because that’s not at all what they are focusing on.
Conclusion… So Does A.I. Ruin Photography or Not?
I still stand by my answer that A.I. doesn’t ruin photography. For all the people that appreciate it, it’s a massive quality of life improvement. Not having to deal with all the parts in the process that are not enjoyable when you have to do them repeatedly over and over this is a huge factor for many professionals to consider. For the people that enjoy photography as just a pure process, guess what, you can still define exactly what that process is to you and ignore all those tools out there. I do think, from the standpoint of competitions and awards, it’s worthwhile defining what’s actually permissible in terms of the submitted images so if the competition is journalism. A.I. and computational photography don’t take away from your vision, they make it easier to achieve it. What are your thoughts? Let us know in the comments below!

The AI Advantage explores which which businesses are leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and what works and what doesn’t in the field.
This article is part of our series that explore the business of artificial intelligence
The news about artificial intelligence is mostly dominated by sensational stories such as the ominous threat of deepfakes, deep learning algorithms that create fake blogs, AI bots that create their own language, and generative adversarial networks that create realistic portraits of non-existent people.
But the practical use of AI algorithms is much farther behind than the hype caused by the media. From peer-reviewed breakthrough research presented at mainstream AI conferences to PR-style videos created by large tech companies and well-funded research labs, only a trickle of the innovation we see in the field makes it into real business processes and applications.
And the organizations that are putting AI to good use are those who understand the powers and limits of today’s technology and master the challenges of integrating it into their processes and solutions.
“AI does offer a lot of business value, but much of that value isn’t terribly sexy or visible. Products and processes will be made somewhat better and easier to use. Decisions will be better informed. We’ll continue — and perhaps even accelerate a bit — the amazing progress that we’ve seen over the last couple of decades in data and analytics. But as all of the early adopters have discovered, it’s still difficult to create systems that think and communicate like humans — even in narrow domains,” academic and business author Thomas H. Davenport writes in his book The AI Advantage: How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work.
The book explores the mundane-but-practical side of artificial intelligence that is making a real difference at startups and large organizations. In it, Davenport discusses which organizations and sectors are making the best use of AI, what are the challenges business leaders and decision-makers face in adopting AI technologies, and how to develop a successful AI adoption strategy.
Following are some key insights from The AI Advantage, complemented by some exclusive comments and observations Davenport shared with TechTalks in October.

Hesitation in the adoption of AI technologies
While there’s an impression that AI is seeping into every aspect of life and business (and it eventually will), for the moment, a lot of organizations are on the fence. Albeit interested, many business leaders are loath to invest in a technology that entails a lot of risk.
“Almost every survey suggests that a high degree of enthusiasm about AI exists, but that it’s still early days in terms of broad corporate application,” Davenport writes in The AI Advantage, which is largely based on interviews and examination of AI adoption strategies and outcomes at different firms.
The AI Advantage by Thomas H. Davenport
The AI Advantage was written in 2018. Since then and a lot of innovation has happened in the field since then, Davenport stresses that we are still in the early days in terms of production applications.
“A lot of companies did small experiments or pilots, but didn’t fully implement them. I think that companies are realizing that AI will be transformative over the long haul, but only moderately beneficial over the short run,” Davenport said in written comments to TechTalks.
The covid-19 pandemic has also highlighted some of the challenges of AI technologies and has forced companies to reconsider their AI adoption strategies.
“I think the COVID economy has meant that companies are re-prioritizing their applications and emphasizing those that have relatively short payback,” Davenport says, adding that some surveys he has worked on suggest an increased preference in buying AI solutions instead of building them in-house, which may be “a factor of COVID-related conservativism.”
AI adoption limited to tech startups and large companies
Given the barriers and risks involved in the integration of AI technologies, their adoption is currently limited to tech startups and large companies.
“Startups build their businesses around new technologies. Large enterprises are typically next in line; they have the technological sophistication to make informed investments in new technologies, and can hire the people to build and implement new solutions,” Davenport writes in The AI Advantage.
Startups are not bound by established business processes and customers they need to keep satisfied. They don’t have liabilities and commitments that slow them down. They build for the future and raise funding for their ideas and innovations. The founding team already has the required AI talent to build the intended solution. AI is a core component of their business proposition and is integrated into their products from the get-go, therefore they don’t need to worry about making possibly breaking changes to an already working system. Although creating an AI product has many other challenges, startups at least have the fuel and gear to start the journey.
Large tech companies, on the other hand, have the financial resources and the flexibility to launch and manage AI pilot project on the side of their main business. They can create divisions that operate independently and manage their own business models, tailored for the dynamics of new markets created by artificial intelligence innovations. They can hire expensive AI talent and acquire startups that are developing promising technology. And as their proof-of-concept projects meet success, they integrate them into their main products.
More importantly, large companies have a lot customer data, a vital requirement for machine learning algorithms.

Small and medium businesses find themselves in an uncomfortable position. They don’t have the flexibility of startups or the extensive resources of big companies. They are bound to the demands of their current customers and dynamics of the markets they are competing in. They don’t have large data stores and the financial means to acquire AI talent and launch in-house moonshot projects.
And perhaps a key factor that is lacking in small to medium firms from an AI standpoint, Davenport points out in The AI Advantage, is awareness and understanding of what is possible. “Big firms have people whose job it is to look out for promising new technologies and inject them into the organization; small firms usually don’t,” he writes.
“I still see that divide being present. I’m not sure it will change much until traditional software vendors incorporate more AI capabilities into their offerings for SMBs. Then it will be an easy adoption,” Davenport said in his comments to TechTalks. “Before that, I don’t think that most SMBs have the spare time and energy to experiment that large firms do, and they don’t have the pressure to innovate that startups do.”
This does not mean SMBs are entirely deprived of AI innovation. There are established platforms that allow businesses to integrated AI technologies into their processes without much technical effort. One interesting example is natural language processing, which is still one of the most challenging subfields of AI and an active area of research. But while AI researchers continue to advance NLP with new deep learning models, the field has also seen the development of tools such as DialogFlow, which can help you create chatbots for your business and integrate them in your website and social media accounts without in an intuitive way. While DialogFlow is not at the cutting edge of NLP, it is accessible to anyone who can break down interactions with customers into distinct steps.
“Overall, it’s important for anyone implementing cognitive technologies to be aware that they are still somewhat immature. Progress is being made quickly in the current environment, but if your application is on the frontier of that progress you may encounter substantial technical challenges. Before you start with a particular project you may want to assess just how close to the frontier you are likely to come,” Davenport warns in The AI Advantage.
How to integrate AI into your organization’s process

Even when you’re a large company in the right market position, AI adoption is still fraught with perils. “It’s easy to make mistakes if you don’t understand the tradeoffs behind each technology,” Davenport writes. “Understanding these technologies and tradeoffs will inform decisions about which might best address specific needs, which vendors to work with, and how quickly a system of a given type can be implemented.”
The AI Advantage provides some key guidelines that can help companies develop a smooth integration strategy. Here are some of my favorite takeaways:
If your AI integration plan involves machine learning, you’ll need the help of talented data scientists to analytics teams to steer the project in the right direction.Don’t expect leaps: “In time, cognitive technologies will transform how companies do business. Today, however, it’s wiser to take incremental steps with the currently available technology while planning for transformational change in the not-too-distant future,” Davenport writes.Plan for redesigning your business processes based on cooperation between AI systems and human operators. “Organizations should think through how work will be done with a given new application, focusing specifically on the division of labor between humans and the AI… Systematic design activity is necessary to determine how humans and machines will augment each other’s strengths and compensate for their weaknesses,” Davenport writes.No matter how exciting a technology is, if it doesn’t provide business value, avoid it. “Cognitive technology may not result in savings from large layoffs anytime soon, but it does need to provide some business value,” Davenport writes.
The AI Advantage is filled with case studies and examples of successful and failed attempts to integrate artificial intelligence in businesses. The book paints a comprehensive picture of what is working and what isn’t, and how companies can find their way through the treacherous path of achieving AI success.
Per Davenport: “There is no reason virtually every large company shouldn’t be exploring cognitive technologies. Those who explore them earlier and more successfully, those who integrate AI with their business processes, and those who identify and nurture effective collaborations between humans and machines — those companies will dominate the future. They’ll have more appealing products and services, more productive and effective processes, and people who have the time and freedom to be creative and resourceful on behalf of customers.”

Globalisation, automation, and rapidly changing needs mean the future of employment will probably look very different from how it looks today. In fact, many current careers won’t exist in the next 10 to 20 years. So, it’s critical that students ask the important question: ‘Will my chosen study path lead to strong job opportunities after graduation and beyond?’
In this series, we’re exploring a range of occupations forecast to have strong employment prospects in the future. Some careers in the tech industry are quickly emerging. Plus, there are other existing careers that will also have an important place in the employment opportunities of tomorrow.
This article looks at the exciting and dynamic field of artificial intelligence. While you may have heard about the field, you might not know exactly what artificial intelligence is and what kinds of artificial intelligence careers are available.
What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a branch of computer science that focuses on building “smart” computers and machines, meaning they are capable of performing complicated tasks that usually require human intelligence or supervision. A critical aspect of this discipline is machine learning, a deep understanding of self-regulating computer systems. Leading scientists in artificial intelligence are now learning how to create computers that can process complex information, such as human emotion, expression, behaviour and languages. 
Artificial intelligence may sound futuristic, but it’s already here. Already it is being used across nearly every industry, including technology, healthcare, retail and transport. Think of Siri on your smartphone, Alexa in your home, computer modelling and predictive polling tools, speech recognition, manufacturing processes, conversation bots on websites, spam filters and recommendations for things you might like to watch on Netflix. All of these are examples of artificial intelligence. 










What is it like to work in artificial intelligence?
This branch of computer science is now so broad and aligned with so many different industries, that students have the opportunity to choose the type of work they are most inspired by. Mathematics, computer programming, statistics, networking, web development, software engineering and robotics are all key areas in the development of artificial intelligence. Students will often find they have a natural affinity for one or more of these skills, which in turn may determine their eventual career aspirations. The benefit of this is that, as a student, you can work out what you love to do while you are learning. As this is such a new area of study, you’re also likely to have the pick of available positions in the job market if you have the right qualifications. 
This is a cutting-edge science, where discoveries, breakthroughs, and never-before-seen advancements are common. It is also a fast-growing area of study and business, and is predicted to continue to grow. This makes artificial intelligence an ideal choice for those looking for an exciting, rewarding and varied career.
In Australia, jobs in artificial intelligence are high paying. Current statistics suggest that the average starting wage for an AI-focused role is around $75,000 per year, which jumps steeply once you have some industry experience. A senior software engineer typically earns more than $100,000 per year, while a senior solutions architect earns from $150,000 per year. Those figures only increase as the industry continues to grow. 
Are there artificial intelligence jobs in Australia?
Australia is already heavily invested in AI and is well-positioned to be a future leader of the industry. There are already several dedicated national agencies, as well as branches of well-known international AI-focused organisations. Some examples include the Australian Space Agency, SmartSat Cooperative Research Centre, MIT Living Lab, the Australian Institute for Machine Learning, and the Australian Cyber Collaboration Centre.
Accenture, one of the world’s largest technology and professional services firms, recently announced its move into South Australia with the establishment of the Adelaide Hub. This investment includes the development of national security operations and cyber defense capabilities, new advanced technology centres, and intelligent operations capabilities. It’s easy to see why career opportunities in AI are increasing and will continue to do so. 
Where can I study artificial intelligence?
This highly specialised industry requires extensive study. Entry-level positions require at least a bachelor’s degree, while senior positions entailing leadership, supervision or business management skills often require a master’s or postgraduate degree in addition to some industry experience. 
Typical coursework involves the study of mathematics (including probability, statistics, algebra, calculus, logic and algorithms), networking, modelling, physics, engineering, robotics, computer science, programming languages and coding.
If you’re interested in a career in artificial intelligence, look for degree programs that offer specific majors in AI, such as the Bachelor of Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) offered at Flinders University. Alternatively, you can pursue an AI specialisation within majors such as health informatics, graphic design, information technology and engineering.










Examples of artificial intelligence careers
Examples of job titles for artificial intelligence professionals include:

Machine learning engineer
Software analyst
Software developer
Computer scientist
Computer engineer
Algorithm specialist
Research scientist
Engineering consultant
Mechanical engineer 
Maintenance technician
Manufacturing engineer 
Electrical engineer
Medical health professional
Surgical technician
Military electrician 
Aviation electrician 
Drone technician
Graphic designer

Experts say that artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to have a bigger impact on health care than anything the field has experienced in our lifetime. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we’re seeing how AI is helping clinicians screen for, and diagnose, COVID-19; it’s aiding researchers’ efforts to develop new drugs and vaccines. Though some health care workers worry that AI tools could replace their jobs, in fact AI is driving innovation, process improvements and better patient outcomes. It’s enhancing providers’ ability to care for more patients safely.
The American Hospital Association and Microsoft now offer a free, one-hour course, for continuing education credits, to guide health care teams through key considerations and specific actions for AI’s responsible and strategic implementation.
Preparing Your Workforce for AI Adoption
It’s important to educate key stakeholders and clinical staff on the implications of adopting AI in a health care setting, including the risks and opportunities that accompany it. That’s why AHA and Microsoft partnered to develop an easy-to-navigate course, “AI in Health Care: Leading Through Change.”

This AHA-Microsoft course can help your organization reinvent the cultures around AI, moving away from fear and hesitancy and toward innovation.

The engaging training modules feature interactive activities (such as a strategic planner) and videos. You can complete the entire course in about one hour or take more time as needed, while saving and tracking your progress. Expert instructors lead you through different topics and also share practical insights based on their experiences using AI in different health care settings.
Course topics include:

Learning the fundamentals to ensure your organization, particularly among key stakeholders on your staff, has a universal baseline understanding of AI and how it works.
How to proactively communicate to your leaders and staff on the concept of AI, its building blocks and how these drive various AI technologies.
Addressing myths and barriers to adopting various AI tools and technologies.
Considerations to guide your AI investments, including identifying common oversights and techniques that should be mastered.
How data can be used to integrate AI across your organization and be used for transformation and continuous innovation.

Aligning AI with Your Organization’s Culture and Structure
Transformation requires people, process and technology. Technology cannot stand alone. Health care leaders and staff must work to align culture, structure and work processes to support strategy for AI’s use and adoption across the organization.
Since AI drives process improvements, the organization will need process improvement leaders who will focus on workforce transformation and use education and training to apply AI tools in support of the organization’s goals and mission. In addition to your organization’s technical teams, steering committees and operational groups must be involved from the beginning of AI adoption. Being open and transparent is crucial to ensuring your teams not only have buy-in to this change but also claim ownership, so they can leverage AI tools more effectively. Engaging stakeholders can help break down barriers and myths about AI.
Addressing Common Challenges and Moving Toward Success
Stakeholders may be intimidated by AI or show no interest because of their lack of knowledge of its value. Designating internal AI champions will help encourage buy-in and ownership. Organizations also will need a clear IT- and data-staffing plan for AI implementation, so identifying a data champion is a key step toward ensuring a smooth, effective process.
Another common challenge is managing employees’ fears that AI adoption will lead to job cuts. That’s not what the data show. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, there will be a workforce deficit of between 42,699 and 121,300 clinicians by 2030. AI can help alleviate looming shortages and address time and cost pressures to improve patient experiences and outcomes.
You can make assuaging employees’ fears of AI a part of your organization’s strategic plan and create a communications and feedback platform. You also can address any workforce concerns directly, sharing cases of successful implementation and demonstrating how your organization will differentiate its approach. It’s important that key stakeholders understand the overall need for AI and how it will deliver a return on investment that does not include cutting jobs.
This AHA-Microsoft course can help your organization reinvent the cultures around AI, moving away from fear and hesitancy and toward innovation.
AI is creating a space for innovation and enabling clinicians and staff to work more efficiently and effectively in the face of unprecedented change. By developing a robust strategic vision for AI adoption, your organization will be well positioned to deliver smarter, safer and better care to your patients.

People leave calling cards wherever they go in the form of unique fingerprints. As every Sherlock Holmes fan can attest, they provide a crucial means for law enforcement to determine someone’s identity. But it turns out that humans aren’t alone in having diagnostic prints. An Alberta wildlife reserve is turning to artificial intelligence to identify individual black bears based on their paw prints. The footprint identification technology (FIT) provides an inexpensive and non-invasive way of tracking wildlife, and the technology may assist researchers in determining what wildlife populations are at risk and need conservation help. 
The Cochrane Ecological Institute chose to use FIT software developed by the organization Wildtrack as a method for monitoring black bears following their release after rehabilitation. 
“When you’re doing wildlife rehab, pretty much all the animals you receive in a wildlife sanctuary have been injured or orphaned through human activity,” says Simon L’Allier, a biology intern at Cochrane Ecological Institute and a Master of Science candidate at York University. “When it’s human-caused, it’s our responsibility to get these animals back on track.” 
Wild Profile: Meet the black bear
One of the major bonuses for using FIT is that the process is simple and low cost. “All you need is a ruler and a camera. A smartphone camera can do the job quite well,” says L’Allier.  
One hitch? Getting the project up and running requires the researchers to “train” the FIT software to recognize individual black bear pawprints. And, turns out, “you can’t train the model with just random tracks you find in the wild,” says L’Allier. When you capture photos of prints, you need to know the individual, the sex, and the age of the black bear who made those prints. This information is sent back to Wildtrack, who teaches the artificial intelligence model to recognize individuals in the database from a single paw print. 
Once the model is trained, it will be able to distinguish pawprints from bears that aren’t in the database. “It can tell you: this is a bear track, and this is from an unknown individual because it’s not in our system,” says L’Allier. “You add it to the database, so once you see that track again in the wild for a second time, you know you’ve seen this individual before.” 
The ability to recognize new bear paw prints and add them to a database provides a huge advantage over other monitoring technology. While GPS collars have their uses and can provide fine data readings like an animal’s heartbeat, “with GPS collars, you have to capture every single bear in the area and put a collar on them,” says L’Allier. In contrast, FIT doesn’t require researchers to tranquilize or handle the bears.
Typically to train the AI model to be accurate, you need data from twenty individual black bears, says L’Allier. The model requires twenty photos of each bear’s front left paw print. Gathering that many clear photos can prove tricky. “Bears walk in their own tracks,” says L’Allier. “The back foot will go on the front paw track and so forth.” This can distort the shape of the track. 


The ground cover bears trek across affects the quality of the paw print. Coarse sand is an ideal substrate for making clear paw prints, says L’Allier. Mud doesn’t produce great tracks, because it sticks to the bear as the paw pulls back, he adds. You run into the same problem with snow. 
There is an exception: the snow on a “late afternoon when there’s a lot of sun and it starts melting on the surface” can create readable tracks, says L’Allier. 
L’Allier was able to begin the tracking project with a rehabilitated black bear named Siksi’naan who was released in early October. But with winter setting in and bears heading into hibernation, data collection is on hold until spring of 2021. 
In the meantime, wildlife enthusiasts can contribute to WildTrack’s database by joining the Wildtrack Fast Data Collection project on the Epicollect 5 app and submitting their own photos. As a bonus, the app can identify tracks to species. Now you can finally settle if the mystery tracks around your cottage garbage can are from a raccoon or a black bear.

Kobelco collaborating with Leica Geosystems to develop remote machine control operations


 



Kobelco Construction Machinery (KCM) has announced a collaboration with Leica Geosystems to develop integrated 2D and 3D machine control solutions which can be operated remotely.
Part of Kobelco’s ‘K-DIVE CONCEPT’ – the Japanese equipment maker’s remote control system – the system involves manipulating a dedicated cockpit with displays showing the job-site from an office. Operators can control excavators remotely without going to the real job-site.
“With a focus on bringing more efficiency, safety and productivity through digitalisation to the heavy construction industry, KCM and Leica Geosystems are working together to help facilitate the remote operation of excavators. The relationship will take advantage of Leica Geosystems’ know-how in relation to K-DIVE CONCEPT’s next generation Telework System using remote operation technology for operators,” said a statement from Kobelco.
The concept will allow a diverse range of operators to work efficiently with access to any job-site without being restricted by location. Using a remote system enables contractors to view progress of jobsites virtually and also use it as virtual training for operators.
Yoichiro Yamazaki, KCM general manager, Business Development Department, Corporate Planning Division, said: “We have great ambitions with K-DIVE CONCEPT, and in our search for technology to achieve this, we are excited to work with Leica Geosystems. Our IoT revolutionises the improvement of safety and on-site productivity, allowing a diverse range of operators to work remotely.”
Magnus Thibblin, Leica Geosystems Machine Control president, added: “We are honoured to be chosen as technology partner in our common journey towards an autonomous jobsite. Working with a leading excavator manufacturer like KCM, fulfils our ambition to be at the forefront of technology within the heavy construction industry.”
The advanced Leica iCON 3D excavator machine control solution guides the operator using reference models and GNSS in 3D. Design information and real-time cut/fill indications are displayed on the control panel, allowing the operators to rapidly excavate to the reference design on projects, such as large road and infrastructure construction, subdivision building, industrial sites and demolition works. By using that solution via K-DIVE CONCEPT, remote operators can easily control excavators’ performance on a jobsite in real-time. Also, KCM will take advantage of high-speed 5G mobile communication systems as the core of K-DIVE CONCEPT in the future.
The K-DIVE CONCEPT is under development for practical application in Japan at the moment, said Kobelco, and its global expansion has not been decided yet.

Emerging Tech




								How a small AI company found a way to scale its work for DOD							

								Shield AI, an artificial intelligence startup focused on military work, has found a tried-and-true way to scale its work with the DOD.

Despite all the prototype contracts and research grants the Department of Defense feeds to eager startups, that work rarely scales to the type of multimillion-dollar deals the government gives to big prime contractors. It’s a frustrating reality for both sides, particularly as Pentagon officials clamor to infuse emerging technology into defense systems.
But there are ways to keep startups invested in government work once the initial projects are finished. Artificial intelligence company Shield AI recently inked the kind of deal that could set an example for other small firms that work with emerging tech.
Shield AI entered a partnership with defense and aerospace company Textron Systems to develop prototypes and scale its work with the DOD. The relationship, which took “months” to come together, according to both companies, will couple the startup’s autonomy-enabling AI with Textron’s robotic vehicles, with the goal of protecting troops in battle.
“We had long tracked the work that Textron was doing,” Gayle Lemmon, a partner and chief policy and marketing officer of Shield, said in an interview. “Together we could take their leadership … and really think about what we specialize in, which is operationalizing AI.”

Officials at Shield AI did not want to talk about exactly how the two companies would work together, saying it could damage the security of the project. Lemmon did say that the project began with a “proof of concept” that was based on their “shared values.” A Shield AI spokesman teased at more announcements coming soon from “well-known” partners.
So far, Shield AI’s main customer has been U.S. Special Operations Command — a fit that makes perfect sense: The company’s offices are nearby in San Diego, and co-founder Brandon Tseng is a former Navy SEAL operator. Shield AI, unlike some of its Silicon Valley counterparts that have a more complicated relationship with military work, was created expressly with the goal of serving the Pentagon.
But any company with that kind of profile, working with SOCOM — which has unique purchasing acquisition authorities and can buy technology in smaller batches — has limitations. Scaling up work both within the command and to service-level acquisition is where revenue can become more sizable, more stable and more appealing to talented tech workers.
In September, the company announced it won a $7.2 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with the DOD’s Strategic Capabilities Office, a sizable chunk of change compared to the initial $100,000 of family-raised seed money the company started with, according to a recent profile in Wired. But now that the company employs about 150 people, a single-digit million-dollar contract through a program like SBIR may not be enough for the long term. (Shield has investments from firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Breyer Capital, Homebrew, and Silicon Valley Bank.)
No surprises from analysts

News of Shield’s deal with Textron came as no surprise to Nathan Ruiz, managing director for partnerships at government technology accelerator Dcode, he told FedScoop. Analysts have found a common way tech companies big and small work with the government is through subcontracts and partnerships.
“Partnering with primes is often the quickest way into [the federal market],” he said. It also is often a boon for the big primes that don’t need to invest in developing its own emerging technology which is a hit-or-miss game. Ruiz leads Dcode’s efforts to help small companies team up across industry and also coach big primes, or “systems integrator” companies, on what makes a successful partnership with startups.
“Aligning with good emerging tech companies is the best thing a systems integrator can do to remain at the forefront,” Ruiz said.
The key for small companies is to prove viability in their products and business. Primes don’t want to have to tell a government agency they won’t be able to deliver because the startup folded after six months of burning through investment cash. And for the primes, it’s all about being open to new tech and seeing how emerging trends can advance their own products, Ruiz said.
For a customer like the DOD, getting emerging technology in the Pentagon is the easy part. Getting it to scale — recurring and large purchasing orders that a company can regularly fill — is the hard part. Senior officials have said that hindrance to scaling is in part due to its risk-averse culture and acquisition practices that can take years. Those in industry have described the space between small research grants and earning contracts that can be a part of a company’s bottom line as the “valley of death.”

Other emerging tech companies that have tried to jump that valley with partnership include TrueFace, a facial recognition company that recently partnered with Modzy, a Booz Allen Hamilton enterprise AI platform. Deloitte also recently won a contract with the DOD’s Joint AI Center that requires them to subcontract with small emerging tech companies.
Helpful for the primes too
Large prime contractors that are tuned into the inner workings of the federal procurement bureaucracy can create inhibiting bureaucracies of their own. Working with small emerging technology companies can provide them with new life and innovation.
“Our work with Shield AI epitomizes our long-standing approach of how we help our customers distill an array of industry potential into meaningful and mission-ready solutions,” technical director for Textron Systems, Sean Baity, told FedScoop.
For Shield and Textron, the partnership could bring the type of AI applications other research shows the DOD is most interested in fielding. The partnership between the two companies aims to deliver autonomous systems that can assist troops on the battlefield, taking on tasks that can help keep humans out of harm’s way.

“We are forging strategic partnerships with other firms linked to the national security industrial and innovation base. We are also having ongoing discussions with others outside of the defense industry,” Raval said. Shield didn’t disclose how many companies it is partnered with, only saying it continues in “collaborating with several industry partners,” and that the mystery number could grow soon.

AI has invaded almost every field like blockchain, healthcare, education, banking, etc. The most impressive way AI is proving its proactiveness in recent years is through web development..Artificial Intelligence is modifying Web Development.Back in 1993, the introduction of Mosaic graphical web browser touched off a revolution in the way the public experiences the content of the website. Since then, web developers across the globe have worked continuously to establish and refine what solid user experience means online..In this digital era, web development is growing at an unprecedented rate. People prefer to go for secure, scalable and feature-packed web applications. The desire of users for enhanced experience along with customized content is ever-spiking. Artificial intelligence can fulfill all the needs. AI can transform web development by automating the tasks that are related to the developers..Around 38% of people leave a website if the content or layout is unattractive. More than 75% of customers decide a business's credibility based on its website design. Users take just 0.5 seconds to form an opinion about a website. A websites design matters more to visitors than we think. Henceforth, it is essential for technology to involve in the world of web development. By using AI, these industries improve user experience with chatbots, web design, marketing strategy, etc..Web development is widely seen as a place where hyper-customized user experience is necessary. Web development companies are seeking help from AI as they face challenges in terms of user expectations and traditional methods of website designing and development. Instead of pressuring web developers to work extensively and fulfill customer expectations, it is a fair job to automate the process using AI. Incorporating artificial intelligence is the best way to transform traditional web development approaches to a revolutionary web development field..By implying AI to develop a site, the system decides color, theme and style by itself. AI builds a site, which arranges and designs in accordance with user experience needs. Here is a list of AI-enabled features that are seen commonly in good sites..• User experience- The most pivotal role in site development is user experience. A site should be user-friendly, that the person visiting it should find relevant products or content within seconds of entering the web. Many customer-centric web applications are starting to rely on AI in order to improve enhance the customer experience..• Personalised content- AI analyzes dataand generates the idea to eliminate the web architectures irregularities. AI can also suggest new videos, music, and other relevant content for users based on their past behaviors..• Virtual assistant and voice search optimization- Virtual assistantsare simplifying web development works related to layouts, templates designing, and creating personalized content. Some websites provide AI-chatbot feature that takes care of customer queries..Even though when AI is designed to do extensive jobs that even humans can't contemplate, it is more unlikely that the technology could function on its own. AI needs human intervention to have a check now and then. However, the same can't be anticipated for the future. AI is not taking away web developers job for now as it needs their interference to check if things are going fine. It might turn upside down soon..The Future Ahead.Artificial Intelligence is a never-ending sector. The growth will double, triple and get ten-fold in a very short time. As technology spreads, experts envision AI to do more than just web designing at a small scale. AI is already doing tedious tasks in web designing to make websites from scratch. It is predicted to expand further in future..• AI, with its cognitive abilities, will create designs and themes..• Internet of Things(IoT) can help in building attractive and eye-catching graphics for the website..• AI's smart algorithm will understand the need of users and what it should do in that context by taking the help of cognitive capabilities and user preference..• Machine learning will be useful in picking up the difference in design inconsistencies, helpful in fixing them..• AI can detect and frame every pixel in an image..With more modern technologies being unravelled every day, the expectation for a customized web future is lying ahead. AI's support in web development will yield customers websites capable of adopting and perfecting themselves with user-by-user requirements..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

			Artificial Intelligence and Its Impact on Jobs		

Posted on November 19, 2020Updated June 13, 2024 By Manjeet Rege, PhD, and Dan Yarmoluk '17 MS in Data Science 



Everywhere you turn today is some unbelievable technological advancement on a variety of fronts. In our everyday lives, we hear or experience things about autonomous vehicles, warehouse robots, chatbots, Alexa, Siri, Uber, automated email responses, robotic surgeries, Netflix recommendation systems, smart factories, smart buildings and search retargeting. Technology giants are becoming the most valuable companies on the planet, and we see our lives shifting from what we thought was kids and their smartphone addictions and gaming to encroaching on our daily lives across the board. They are typically revolving around a variety of enabling technology layers, namely, cloud computing, computational systems, networks and sensors, robotics, material sciences, digital manufacturing and artificial intelligence. However, at the center of it, is AI that permeates many of the other advances in some shape or form in creating intelligent systems on top of advances in core products or technologies.
“Computers, intelligent machines and robots seem like the workforce of the future. And as more and more jobs are replaced by technology, people will have less work to do and ultimately will be sustained by payments from the government,” predicts Elon Musk, the cofounder and CEO of Tesla. This is a scary proposition in some sense, in that what will we do if all the work is done by AI or robots? Isn’t life tough enough? Don’t we have enough economic disparity and can barely make ends meet today? To add insult to injury, many of the analyses seem to center on displacing the low wage workers. As if they didn’t have enough disadvantages already, their entire economic class will be wiped out is the feeling we get from the news cycle. This is evidenced by robotic warehouses and chatbots or automated customer service and we can really feel the changes all around us.
Innovation and technology are certainly changing; skills and jobs as we know them today will need to change. Our frame of reference is being disrupted like never before, the guideposts and rules are changing, and this causes discomfort, uncertainty and worry. How can we chart the course if we are uncertain that the traditional methods (hard work, educational degrees, etc.) do not necessarily guarantee a certain quality of life? News flash, it is changing rapidly and therefore uncertain. We need to all become comfortable with being uncomfortable, with adapting to change, continuing education and reskilling.  Some reports predict that millennials will change their jobs 17 times, but that might be a low number when you really factor in the gig economy.
According to various reports, the warnings suggest that AI could lead to the loss of tens of millions of jobs. It begs the question, when or what is the time horizon of the adoption of AI and the job loss a reality? Many reports suggest of job displacement or the very nature of jobs shifting. Automation and technology have shifted work in pursuit of lowering costs, increasing efficiency and production. The automobile “displaced” work that was done via horse and buggy, electricity or fluorescent lighting displaced gas lamps and gas replaced coal in many instances. Jobs have been displaced in the past, but in today’s case the rate at which these exponential technologies are growing is moving faster than the rate of human adaptation. That speed at which we are experiencing technological and societal change is only the beginning as many futurists, such as Peter Diamandis, prophesize.
Bloomberg reports that “more than 120 million workers globally will need retraining in the next three years due to artificial intelligence’s impact on jobs, according to an IBM survey.” That report and interpretations of it seem to suggest that adoption of AI may result in massive job losses and requires massive retraining. This paints a doomsday scenario, creates uncertainty and worry. The interpretation is AI equals job loss; we would argue that the interpretation should be interpreted as AI and technology advancements will require job retraining and job reskilling. The reports also seem to suggest that our educational system is preparing for jobs of today, when we see that the jobs of the future will be quite different, with different resources and tools at our disposal. This further creates panic in that we see nothing but chaos and the inability to control our destiny for ourselves and our children.
The report was MIT-IBM Watson Lab research that shed light on the reorganization of tasks within occupations by analyzing 170 million online job postings in the U.S. between 2010-17. There is no question that AI and related technologies will affect all jobs; what the report did shed light on was the fact how the nature of work is changing, how tasks are changing and tried to link the implications for employment and wages. There were some key findings in the report, that tasks are shifting between people and machines (or AI), but the change has been small (Figure 1).

Automation or AI is disappearing from job requirements, shifting in the way work gets done; as technology reduces the cost of some tasks, the value of remaining tasks increases, particularly soft skills such as creativity, common sense, judgment and communication skills.

This type of analysis is what experts refer to as the “future of work” and how the work is shifting, job requirements are changing, and automation and AI are displacing certain sectors of the labor market. It also informs policymakers of where to focus attention and resources in order to best prepare for the future. Many of the takeaways and political talk seem to focus on “the vulnerable will be the most vulnerable” as a key takeaway, and that better-educated workers will fare out alright as AI/automation spreads. As a McKinsey report forecasted 800 million global workers could be replaced by robots by 2030, they further stated that blue-collar jobs, such as machine operating, warehouse workers and fast food are particularly susceptible to disruption.
But a new study published by the Brookings institution states that might not be the case. The report looked at thousands of AI patents and job descriptions and that educated, well-paid workers may be affected even more by the spread of AI. Most consider robotics and software as impacting the physical and routine work of traditionally blue-collar jobs. The report goes on to state that workers with a bachelor’s degree, for example, would be exposed to AI over five times more than those with only a high school degree. That is due to the fact AI is very strong at completing tasks that require planning, learning, reasoning, problem-solving and predicting – most of which are skills we think of as white-collar jobs.

This analysis of patent data and tasks and exposure to risk on a sampling of various occupations in Table 2.

AI’s impact on the workplace, the future of work, sectors of the economy and global domination are hard to assess. Most forecasts are rooted in well-established, well-understood technologies such as robotics and extrapolated across of a range of tasks, functions and jobs. The nature of AI being new and poorly understood, nonetheless unsuccessfully implemented across all industries, makes it even more difficult to understand. There is no shared agreement on the tasks, nor the expected impacts on the workforce or economy. The best scholars concede to the limitations of their economic or forecasts for the future. What we do know is that the nature of work will change, as it has through the centuries with innovation. We do know that disruption will occur in sectors of the economy, and we should brace for that change and try to harness that change for good. Perhaps AI can see patterns in deadly diseases, fight climate change and explore the universe. We should be as excited as nervous about change, and try to the best of our abilities to shape our society for that coming change.

Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) Job Trends Important to Watch in 2021

The use of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning (ML), technologies that help people and organizations handle customer personalization and communication, data analytics and processing, and a host of other applications continues to grow.   
An IDC report found three-quarters of commercial enterprise applications could lean on A.I. by next year alone, while an Analytics Insight report projects more than 20 million available jobs in artificial intelligence by 2023.   
Due to A.I. and ML's transformational reach, specialists with the right skills could find themselves with job opportunities across a wide range of industries. A global skills gap in the technologies means qualified applicants can expect good salaries and a strong bargaining position.  
Gus Walker, director of product at Veritone, an A.I. tech company based in Costa Mesa, California, told Dice that, in 2021, there will be growing opportunities for A.I. and ML specialists in public safety, banking and fintech, and healthcare.  
“These three industries have the money to invest in A.I. and ML right now and have the greatest opportunity to see the investment pay off, fast,” he said. “That being said, the pandemic has caused industries hit the hardest to take a step back and look at how they can leverage AI and ML to rebuild or adjust in the new normal.”  
Data collection and preparation, as well as data analytics expertise, could end up the most in-demand skills when hiring for artificial intelligence. “Organizations need to hire individuals who can identify the correct training data and annotate the data accurately,” Walker added. “They need talent that can maintain growing training sets and analyze the data to create targeted datasets for customized model generation.”  
This means companies will require professionals familiar with algorithm tuning and training; prime candidates will also have experience in A.I. operationalization and DevOps, in order to successfully set up datasets and continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines so that algorithms stay up-to-date.  
“Digitalization will make even more structured and unstructured data available to be leveraged, which will increase the need for more A.I. professionals,” Walker pointed out. “Businesses need someone who can maintain production deployments throughout.”   
Here’s a breakdown from Burning Glass, which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country, of how many technology jobs request machine learning skills. Although the current numbers are relatively small (at least when it comes to job postings), Burning Glass predicts significant growth over the next decade:   
  
Extreme Skills  
For Terry Simpson, technical evangelist at Nintex, a process management and workflow automation company based in Bellevue, WA, the skill sets around artificial intelligence and machine learning vary between extremes.  
“On one side, you have the technical developer who can take a desired outcome and build an algorithm or series of steps to execute a task in a repeatable format,” he said. “On the other extreme, you have the business analyst who needs to identify and understand what the business is needing and see the vision of how to automate it.”  
Between these two extremes, Simpson explained, you will find a small group of individuals who have the right balance between developer knowledge and business analyst knowledge.  
“These are skillsets that are in demand,” he said, pointing out most organizations are just starting to understand how A.I. and ML can have a positive strategic impact.  
“Someone who has high technical capabilities but lacks an understanding of the business won’t be successful,” Simpson noted. “On the flip side, someone who understands the business side, but is not technical enough to understand A.I. and ML, won’t be successful either. Finding the balance between the two is the sweet spot for a great candidate in the A.I. and ML space.”  
Simpson added that, as companies mature, they quickly find that they need full-time employees who have a good understanding of A.I. and ML tools in the marketplace: “Not only do they need professionals, they really need a group of them that have diverse skills in this area in order to stay up to date on the different offerings, and have the ability to implement.”  
Process mining is an area that businesses plan on investing more in, as it involves utilizing A.I. and ML to find processes inside the network that have a pattern. Once discovered, specialists can streamline and automate these patterns; in many cases, a business analyst or individual would never have been able to identify the pattern without an A.I. tool.   
As Walker noted, call center tools may see an increase in A.I. and ML usage to help match customers to the resources they need; retail experts may lean more on artificial intelligence apps to improve recommendation engines and “bespoke” personalized service.  
“Companies need someone who is familiar with A.I. and can look at the current problems and identify where A.I. can be applied,” he said. “Next, they need professionals who can develop and deploy the A.I. solution whether it be pre-built or a point solution.”  
Lastly, Walker explained, businesses should have someone with data analytics experience to ensure that products and services are actually improving as a result of A.I. and ML. Throughout 2021, we’ll likely see more A.I. usage by small businesses and educational institutions: “Now that the election is over and a vaccine is on the horizon, shifts to A.I. in all industries will be accelerated.”

A fascinating slice of electro-acoustic music history has just come out on the Carrier label. This 1984 concert performance of Rainbow Family by George Lewis — composer, master jazz trombonist, Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians member, computer music explorer — takes us back to an early stage of artificial intelligence (AI) when desktop computers (then known as microcomputers) were starting to interact with live musicians.
After two years of research and experimentation at IRCAM — Pierre Boulez’s new music laboratory underneath the Pompidou Centre in Paris — Lewis put together what he believes was IRCAM’s first commission for microcomputers and musicians improvising together. In his long booklet note, Lewis writes that he did all of the computer programming and “hardware hacking” himself, using the computer language Forth that he learned from his mentor, composer/record producer David Behrman.
The first popular digital synthesizer, the Yamaha DX7, had just been introduced the year before — and there are three of them here, driven by three Apple II computers via the newly established MIDI standard for connections. These computers and synthesizers — once considered state-of-the-art keys to music’s future, yet not fated to be a part of it for long — face off with four players, including a major jazz figure, soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy, plus Derek Bailey on electric guitar, Joëlle Leandre on acoustic bass, and Douglas Ewart on bass clarinet and flutes. 





After Lewis gives a spoken introduction in French and we hear the clicking of the keys of the computers, the hour-long piece starts with a digital rainbow of spangled, chromium-plated timbres typical of the DX7 that engage in a tumbling dialogue with Leandre — a promising start with a humorous ending. For me, this first section is the most interesting of a series of four fragmented, always atonal episodes for each instrument and another with Ewart and Bailey, an abstract amalgam of electronic music with the timbres and improvisatory streams-of-consciousness of free jazz. AACM meets the European avant-garde, in short.




The last movement is the longest, taking up about a third of the piece, with all four human musicians now involved. The textures are usually thicker, the direction meanders, and the music sometimes starts to sound a bit like Boulez’s later scores, though with much more active electronic participation (no wonder, since the music was conceived and performed in a time and place where the Boulez presence must have been overwhelming).
Ultimately, let me be rash enough to declare the computers and synthesizers the winners in this AI encounter — which is either a tribute to Lewis’s programming skills or simply that I respond more to the colors that the electronics produce than most of the salvos by the live musicians.
Experiments like this would be developed further by Lewis in the following decades. As recently as at the 2017 Ojai Festival, you could hear Lewis interacting on trombone and laptop with fellow AACM veterans — saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell and pianist Muhal Richard Abrams (who passed away four months later) — in an out-on-the-edge group improvisation not dissimilar to this one at IRCAM 33 years before.

Businesses turning to AI for job interviews

New York City is trying to rein in the use of algorithms used to screen job applicants. It's one of the first cities in the U.S. to try to regulate what is an increasingly common — and opaque — hiring practice. The city council is considering a bill that would require potential employers to notify job candidates about the use of these tools, referred to as ""automated decision systems."" Companies would also have to complete an annual audit to make sure the technology doesn't result in bias.The move comes as the use of artificial intelligence in hiring skyrockets, increasingly replacing human screeners. Fortune 500 companies including Delta, Dunkin, Ikea and Unilever have turned to AI for help assessing job applicants. These tools run the gamut from a simple text reader that screens applications for particular words and phrases, to a system that evaluates videos of potential applicants to judge their suitability for the job. 






""We have all the reasons to believe that every major company uses some algorithmic hiring,"" Julia Stoyanovich, a founding director of the Center for Responsible AI at New York University, said in a recent webinar. Machine biasAt a time when New Yorkers are suffering double-digit unemployment, legislators are concerned about the brave new world of digital hiring. Research has shown that AI systems can introduce more problems than they solve. Facial-recognition tools that use AI have demonstrated trouble in identifying faces of Black people, determining people's sex and wrongly matching members of Congress to a mugshot database. 


In perhaps the most notorious example of AI bias, a hiring tool developed internally at Amazon had to be scrapped because it discriminated against women. The tool was developed using a 10-year history of resumes submitted to the company, whose workforce skews male. As a result, the software effectively ""taught"" itself that male candidates were preferable and demoted applications that included the word ""women,"" or the names of two all-women's colleges. While the tool was never used, it demonstrates the potential pitfalls of substituting machine intelligence for human judgment. ""As legislators in a city home to some of the world's largest corporations, we must intervene and prevent unjust hiring,"" city council member Laurie Cumbo, the bill's sponsor, said at a hearing for the legislation last week. Not tough enoughSeveral civil rights groups say New York's proposed bill doesn't go far enough. A dozen groups including  the AI Now Institute, New York Civil Liberties Union and New York  Communities for Change issued a letter  last week pushing for the law to cover more types of automated tools and  more steps in the hiring process. They want the measure to include heavier  penalties, enabling people to sue if they've been passed  over for a job because of biased algorithms. This would be in line with existing employment law, which allows applicants to sue for  discrimination because of race or sex.""If we pass [the bill] as  it is worded today, it will be a rubber stamp for some of the worst  forms of algorithmic discrimination,"" Albert Fox Cahn, executive  director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told the city  council.

""We need much stronger penalties,"" he said. ""Just as we do with every other form of  employment discrimination, we need that private-sector enforcement.""


Alicia Mercedes, a spokesperson for Cumbo, the bill's sponsor, said the bill is still in its early stages and is likely to change in response to feedback. ""We're committed to seeing this legislation come out as something that can be effective, so we will of course take any input that we can get from those who are working on these issues every day,"" Mercedes said.Less time, better results?For hiring professionals, the main appeal of AI is its capacity to save time. But technologists have also touted the potential for automated programs, if used correctly, to eliminate human biases, such as the well-documented tendency for hiring managers to overlook African-American applicants or look favorably on candidates who physically resemble the hiring manager.

""When only a human reviews a resume, unfortunately, humans can't un-see the things that cause unconscious biases — if someone went to the same alma mater or grew up in same community,"" said Athena Karp, CEO of HiredScore, an AI hiring platform. Karp said she supports the New York bill. ""If technologies are used in hiring, the makers of technology, and candidates, can and should know how they're being used,"" she said at the hearing.  In the U.S., the only place where this is currently the case is in Illinois, whose Biometric Privacy Act requires employers to tell candidates if AI is being used to evaluate them and allows the candidates to opt out. On the federal level, a bill to study bias in algorithms has been introduced in Congress. In New York, most job candidates have no clue they're being screened by software — even those who are computer scientists themselves. ""I've received my fair share of job and internship rejections in my graduate and undergraduate careers,"" said Lauren D'Arinzo, a master's degree candidate in data science and AI at New York University. ""It is unsettling to me that a future employer might disregard my application based on the output of an algorithm.""


She added, ""What worries me most is, had I not been recruited into a project explicitly doing research in this space, I would likely not have even known that these types of tools are regularly used by Fortune 500 companies.""

Nov 20, 2020 | LIFE | By Joshua Kalenga | Illustration by Patil Khakhamian
At first thought, the concept of a “racist” algorithm might seem absurd. After all, one may ask, how can we assign any ethical value to what is just a set of calculations?
In a world where artificial intelligence is being used for everything from job hiring to policing, however, questions about how fairly these algorithms deal with different individuals and groups are surely warranted.
“Coded Bias,” a 2020 documentary by Shalini Kantayya, argues that some of the artificial intelligence in use today is biased against women and minorities and is in urgent need of government regulation.  
The documentary follows the journey of MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini. Her discovery that most facial-recognition software does not accurately identify the faces of women and darker-skinned people inspires her to investigate widespread bias in algorithms.  
In one particularly memorable scene, Buolamwini — who is a woman of color — explains to Congress that she had to wear a white mask for Amazon’s facial recognition software to ‘recognize’ her.
In response, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asks Buolamwini, “So, we have a technology that was created and designed by one demographic that is only mostly effective on that one demographic and they’re trying to sell it and impose it on the entirety of the country?” 
A 2019 study by The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of almost 200 facial recognition algorithms found that “for one-to-one matching, [there were] higher rates of false positives for Asian and African American faces relative to images of Caucasians. The differentials often ranged from a factor of 10 to 100 times, depending on the individual algorithm.”  
Since facial recognition software is already being employed in crucial facets of everyday life such as policing, the implications of misidentification are non-trivial. The New York Times reported in June 2020 that Robert Julian-Borchak Williams, a Black man, was arrested in Michigan after being wrongly identified by a faulty facial recognition program.
“Coded Bias” also cites an experimental Amazon program developed in 2014 to screen job applications for technology roles as an example of algorithmic bias. The program automatically disregarded résumés that mentioned women’s colleges or groups, likely reflecting the prevailing gender imbalance in the demographics of the company. 
A lack of adequate representation in the underlying data used to build some artificial intelligence systems is a recurring theme in the documentary.
“When you think of A.I., it’s forward-looking,” Buolamwini says in the film. “But A.I. is based on data, and data is a reflection of our history.”    
There are other concerning examples of bias in artificial intelligence that are not explicitly discussed in the “Coded Bias” documentary. An algorithm widely used in U.S. hospitals, according to a study published in Science, was less likely to refer Black people that were equally sick as White people to programs that provided personalized care.
In spite of the biases in some applications, artificial intelligence remains one of the most sophisticated developments of computer science. From natural language processing to cancer diagnosis, artificial intelligence applications can be both deeply fascinating (at least to a tech nerd like myself) and incredibly useful.
While “Coded Bias” certainly doesn’t romanticize the power of artificial intelligence, it doesn’t suggest that the concept is inherently flawed either. Instead, the film seems to simply argue for more racial and gender diversity in the technology industry, as well as more government regulation of widely used algorithms — especially those that have been proven to contain systematic bias.  
Following “The Great Hack” and “The Social Dilemma,” Kantayya’s “Coded Bias” is the latest documentary to address the dangers of Big Tech. Perhaps, at best, the directors and casts of these documentaries hope they are inspiring a global consciousness in us, the viewers. After all, it is our data that runs the algorithms.

There is a buzz in the tech industry around AI and its developments. The internet has expectedly played a vital role in the development of AI-enabled services. Although artificial intelligence is frequently thrown around, not everybody understands what it is and what AI is capable of..If you have ever talked with Siri, precisely searched for a film or show on Netflix, or asked Siri the temperature, you have interacted with AI. Initially coined by John McCarthy in 1955, artificial intelligence is a machine that can solve problems that humans perform using natural intelligence. AI is used to build agents or robots that can replicate human behaviour and decide on humans' behalf..Insightful Facts about AI.1. AI Pets Exist.Although real pets are lovable, as per pet-bot developers, they have a few setbacks. Real pets need to be taken care of, such as feeding and cleaning them up. AI pets will be robots that look, feel, and act like a real animal but eliminate such issues faced by owners. It is expected that AI-driven pets will be widely available in the market by 2025..2. Most AI Bots are Female.Studies show that most of the population prefer the sound of a female voice over a male voice. It is because if you ask voice assistants like Alexa, Siri a question, you will be answered by a pleasant and polite woman's voice..3. AI Recognises Emotions.A robot built in the late 1990s called Kismet can recognise emotions through human body language and voice tone..4. AI can Repair Itself.A robot that rebuilt itself after noticing its performance had dropped after losing two of its six legs. The robot did not know what the problem was but fixed it by trial and error..5. AI can Replace Human Workforce.Around 1,160,000 people are out of work in Canada alone. Although AI helps reduce business costs, it's set to create some significant problems. As per The Guardian, customer service jobs (85%) will face the highest AI threat by 2021..6. AI will Become Smarter than Humans.AI can learn anything quickly, meaning its intelligence is increasing. In 2013, AI had the same intelligence as a 4 year old. By 2029, AI will have the same intelligence level as adult humans..7. Humans can Develop Romantic Relationship with AI.David Levy, a student in this field, believes that marriage between humans and robots will be made legal by 2050. At the moment robots are not so advanced enough for this..8. AI has Nationalities and Passports.Sophia, a lifelike humanoid, has obtained guaranteed citizenship in Saudi Arabia. It has brought controversy as people wonder and question whether or not robots should have rights..9. AI can Write.A robot wrote an article on an earthquake in California on the Los Angeles Times website, gathering data from a seismograph..10. AI will Recognise people by Voice.As early as by the end of 2018, it was expected that robotic assistants would be able to carry out voice recognition..The primary purpose of artificial intelligence is for humans or businesses to have a machine that thinks faster and more efficiently. But the question becomes, in this process, will advancements in technology take over the world? Will it help humankind reach the highest potential or destroy it in the process?.Well, in January 2018, Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that artificial intelligence would be more transformative to humanity than electricity. Mckinsey report reveals that global demand for data scientists will exceed supply by more than 50% in 2018. On the other hand, PWC predicted that the global GDP could rise by 14% as a result of AI-powered activities by 2030, which is equal to US$15.7 trillion..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

We hope to address the pain of both consumers and tradesmen whilst saving the environment, creating new jobs in the economy by making the industry more reliable using technology and behavioural data”


— Anuj Gupta, Founder GreenVan

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM , November 16, 2020 /EINPresswire.com/ — GreenVan(GV) a home services company provides Movers, Plumbers, Electricians. GV is a branded service (like Uber) and not a marketplace ensuring quality of service delivered by its tradesmen. After a successful market launch GV now hopes to consolidate a fragmented market and become an affordable and accessible company for the 27 M households across the UK. Consumers today have the option to either use a large player by paying high prices or rely on small and unreliable independent tradesmen who make up to 94% of the market.
The pain is clear for consumers who spend hours in finding experienced, reliable and affordable tradesmen. They witness huge price variation, poor track record visibility of the tradesmen , last minute cancellations, disputes, loss of deposit, delays etc. Tradesmen on the other hand suffer from low income, poor family time ,subservience and an unorganised work life..
Gv hopes to make a huge shift in that by offering Customers instant, smooth and 24/7 access along with low prices , On-time promise, Insurance, Free changes & cancellation, time & day preference.
For the Tradesmen to work 250 days Vs 300 days and thereby create more family time for them and make them focus only on what they do best. The tradesmen would double their disposable income, retain their freedom and safety of increased work flow without any domination from a corporation. The income would directly come to their bank account making them more bankable, says Anuj Gupta the founder of GreenVan, who won the award for the best consumer technology  platform in the world by Microsoft in the business he had founded earlier.


Given the strong value proposition for the customers, GV hopes to expand the market as it would more viable for customers to to use GV than to do the job on their own (a shift from the DIY to GV) and that should result in a need for more tradesmen thereby creating large amounts employment for the economy.
Using the latest technology (Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms and process automation) results in better van capacity utilisation, optimal route planning, better vendor time utilisation and less fuel consumption along with a new business model and Green assets, GV hopes to organise the home services industry and even with capturing a small market share GV hopes to get to unicorn valuations as the market opportunity is enormous.
GV has launched moving services in the first phase and has already successfully moved a few thousand customers who seem delighted with the service as many have given a 10 on 10 rating and is now waiting for the current pandemic restrictions to get relaxed to operate at full scale as customers are vary of letting tradesmen into their homes.
GV is a carbon neutral business and has a huge thrust on climate protection and therefore the name GreenVan as the vans used by its tradesmen are electric in nature.  GV's network of the electric vans would also be used to advertise other conscious and ethical brands across the UK.


In recognition of the potential of the business. GV has received expectational levels of credits from Amazon for the use of their AWS technology infrastructure.
GV has entered into agreement with one of the largest outdoor media companies to use thousands of their billboards across the UK with a 50% co-investment from them for the advertising – GreenVan London Billboard – https://www.greenvan.eu/london-billboard
GV has many areas of Impact and caters to the UN sustainable development goals like 5-9-11-12-17 as it creates more social capital for both customers and tradesmen, decarbonising cities, a low-no emission green fleet, ethical partnerships, green media etc. GreenVan is very light in its processes right from the top of the funnel till the job day.

                    Artificial Intelligence at NATO: dynamic adoption, responsible use                


 Edward Hunter Christie 

 24 November 2020                    




The deputy head of NATO’s Innovation Unit lays out current efforts to develop Artificial Intelligence policy at NATO.
 
As noted in the first article in this series on innovation at NATO, the Alliance faces a global technology adoption race. Rival powers are leveraging new technologies to pursue the dual goal of greater economic competitiveness alongside greater military capabilities. The Allies face a range of challenges as they seek to exploit emerging and disruptive technologies. These challenges are based on two interrelated pillars of work: ensuring a dynamic adoption of new technologies and governing them responsibly. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at the heart of these considerations.
AI is the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence – for example, recognising patterns, learning from experience, drawing conclusions, making predictions, or taking action – whether digitally or as the smart software behind autonomous physical systems (see Science & Technology Trends 2020-2040 – Exploring the S&T Edge).
As proposed by the RAND think tank in the report The Department of Defense Posture for Artificial Intelligence: Assessment and Recommendations (2019), it is useful to distinguish between three broad types of applications: Enterprise AI, Mission Support AI, and Operational AI.
 

Enterprise AI includes applications such as AI-enabled financial or personnel management systems, which are deployed in tightly controlled environments, where the implications of technical failures are low (in terms of immediate danger and potential lethality).

Operational AI, by contrast, can be deployed in missions and operations, i.e. in considerably less controlled environments and such that the implications of failure may be critically high. Examples include the control software of stationary systems or those of unmanned vehicles.

Mission Support AI, an intermediate category in terms of environment control and failure implications, includes a diverse set of applications, e.g. logistics and maintenance, or intelligence-related applications.




These distinctions may prove useful in setting priorities, both for adoption policies and for principles of responsible use, taking into account the differing levels of risk inherent to these categories.
The contemporary wave of AI, or Second Wave AI, is centered on Machine Learning (ML).  ML involves the development and use of statistical algorithms to find patterns in data. For example, a classification algorithm can be trained on a large set of correctly labelled examples to determine to which previously encountered category a newly observed object belongs. Deep Learning is a subset of ML, which uses multiple computational layers (Artificial Neural Networks with multiple layers) for the handling of computationally demanding pattern recognition or prediction problems, e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks for object detection within images.   Figure one below is an illustration of Deep Learning for the identification of planes, vehicles and buildings within images.






Deep Learning can be used to detect specific objects within images.
(Source: Hoeser, T.; Kuenzer, C. Object Detection and Image Segmentation with Deep Learning on Earth Observation Data: A Review-Part I: Evolution and Recent Trends. Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1667.)



ML thrives on large sets of accurate data and performs poorly with small datasets or with inaccurate data. Under good conditions across a wide range of uses, ML outperforms humans, in terms of both predictive performance and of course speed, over an increasing range of narrow pattern recognition and prediction tasks. This is the central reason for the increasing adoption of ML across vast areas of human activity.

Towards dynamic adoption


Traditionally, economists have modelled output as a function of labour and capital (production factors), and material inputs. For AI, the production factors are high-skill specialist talent and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure for computing and storage, and data is the key input.
Is data then the new oil? Essentially no. While data does need to be ‘extracted’ and then ‘refined’ before further use, its availability grows with the volume of output. Data is also specific, not fungible. For any specific use case, specific datasets that capture exactly relevant real-life observations (or simulations) are needed. To ensure a solid starting point, Allied defence establishments will need to ensure their further digitisation. Overall, data policy needs to address a full value chain, covering collection, access, sharing, storage, metadata, documentation, quality control (including data cleaning and bias mitigation), and processes to ensure compliance with legal requirements.
Supporting measures for the production factors – talent and infrastructure – should include sound and flexible human resources and contracting policies to attract and nurture the best human talent, as well as the deployment of relevant and secure computational and data storage capacities.
Next is productivity. Through the ages, economic actors have sought the best ways to combine the factors of production: Are they complementary? Are they substitutable? What combinations bring the highest returns? What production and managerial processes and practices yield the best outcomes? For AI, while trade-offs exist to some extent, the factors of production are far more complements than they are substitutes: one needs substantial investments in all three factors to succeed.
As for processes and management, software industry best practice indicates that the development and delivery of AI solutions should rely on Agile approaches, rather than on a traditional Waterfall model. This implies highly dynamic and iterative processes, starting from an initial and flexible problem statement, rather than a detailed and rigid statement of requirements. Several variants of Agile exist in industry and some of these variants are actively pursued within certain NATO communities.







Committing to responsible use


The Alliance’s success with AI will also depend on new and well-designed principles and practices relating to good governance and responsible use.  Certain Allied governments have already made certain public commitments in the area of responsible use, addressing concepts such as lawfulness, responsibility, reliability, and governability, among others.
In parallel, Allies have taken part in the Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems under the auspices of the United Nations, leading to the formulation of 11 guiding principles.
Importantly, there is a good case for viewing work on adopting AI and work on principles of responsible use as complementary and synergistic. In effect, there are certain essential principles or goals that will underpin and facilitate both engineering good practice, as well as responsible state behaviour.
Certain national principles imply a need for specific design requirements. For example, a principle of governability may be linked to technical abilities to detect and avoid unintended consequences, and to disengage or deactivate in case of unintended behaviour.
The technical characteristics required to ensure that these and other objectives are met will necessarily be part of the design and testing phases of relevant systems. In turn, the relevant engineering work will be an opportunity to refine understanding, leading to more granular and more mature principles. Further work in the area of Testing, Evaluating, Verifying and Validating (TEVV) will be essential, as will support from relevant Modelling and Simulation efforts. NATO’s well-established strengths in the area of standardization will help frame these lines of effort, while also ensuring interoperability between Allied forces.
In the meantime, overarching principles such as those developed in some national cases, as well as under UN auspices, offer a baseline for further consultations among Allies, as well as points of reference concerning existing national positions.
This is the second article of a mini-series by NATO’s innovation team, which focuses on technologies Allies are looking to adopt and the opportunities they will bring to the defence and security of the NATO Alliance.

And there’s no guarantee that we humans will understand the result.Share full article131Read in appCredit...Alex Eben MeyerBy Dennis OverbyeNov. 23, 2020Once upon a time, Albert Einstein described scientific theories as “free inventions of the human mind.” But in 1980, Stephen Hawking, the renowned Cambridge University cosmologist, had another thought. In a lecture that year, he argued that the so-called Theory of Everything might be achievable, but that the final touches on it were likely to be done by computers.“The end might not be in sight for theoretical physics,” he said. “But it might be in sight for theoretical physicists.”The Theory of Everything is still not in sight, but with computers taking over many of the chores in life — translating languages, recognizing faces, driving cars, recommending whom to date — it is not so crazy to imagine them taking over from the Hawkings and the Einsteins of the world.Computer programs like DeepMind’s AlphaGo keep discovering new ways to beat humans at games like Go and chess, which have been studied and played for centuries. Why couldn’t one of these marvelous learning machines, let loose on an enormous astronomical catalog or the petabytes of data compiled by the Large Hadron Collider, discern a set of new fundamental particles or discover a wormhole to another galaxy in the outer solar system, like the one in the movie “Interstellar”?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt least that’s the dream. To think otherwise is to engage in what the physicist Max Tegmark calls “carbon chauvinism.” In November, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Dr. Tegmark is a professor, cashed a check from the National Science Foundation, and opened the metaphorical doors of the new Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions.The institute is one of seven set up by the foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture as part of a nationwide effort to galvanize work in artificial intelligence. Each receives $20 million over five years.The M.I.T.-based institute, directed by Jesse Thaler, a particle physicist, is the only one specifically devoted to physics. It includes more than two dozen scientists, from all areas of physics, from M.I.T., Harvard, Northeastern University and Tufts.“What I’m hoping to do is create a venue where researchers from a variety of different fields of physics, as well as researchers who work on computer science, machine-learning or A.I., can come together and have dialogue and teach each other things,” Dr. Thaler said over a Zoom call. “Ultimately, I want to have machines that can think like a physicist.”Rediscovering the fundamental lawsTheir tool in this endeavor is a brand of artificial intelligence known as neural networking. Unlike so-called expert systems like IBM’s Watson, which are loaded with human and scientific knowledge, neural networks are designed to learn as they go, similarly to the way human brains do. By analyzing vast amounts of data for hidden patterns, they swiftly learn to distinguish dogs from cats, recognize faces, replicate human speech, flag financial misbehavior and more.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We’re hoping to discover all kinds of new laws of physics,” Dr. Tegmark said. “We’re already shown that it can rediscover laws of physics.”Last year, in what amounted to a sort of proof of principle, Dr. Tegmark and a student, Silviu-Marian Udrescu, took 100 physics equations from a famous textbook — “The Feynman Lectures on Physics” by Richard Feynman, Robert Leighton and Matthew Sands — and used them to generate data that was then fed to a neural network. The system sifted the data for patterns and regularities — and recovered all 100 formulas.“Like a human scientist, it tries many different strategies (modules) in turn,” the researchers wrote in a paper published last year in Science Advances. “And if it cannot solve the full problem in one fell swoop, it tries to transform it and divide it into simpler pieces that can be tackled separately, recursively relaunching the full algorithm on each piece.”In another more challenging experiment, Dr. Tegmark and his colleagues showed the network a video of rockets flying around and asked it to predict what would happen from one frame to the next. Never mind the palm trees in the background. “At the end, the computer was able to discover the essential equations of motion,” he said.Finding new particles at a place like CERN’s Large Hadron Collider would be a cinch, Dr. Tegmark said; A.I. likes big data, and the collider data runs to thousands of terabytes a second. Nevermind that a new particle hasn’t appeared in the CERN data since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, despite years of frenzied examinations of every bump in the data stream.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Those are curves that humans look at,” Dr. Tegmark said. “In 10 years, machine-learning will be as essential to doing physics as knowing math.”For now, he conceded, there are limits to what can be achieved by the algorithm’s recursive method of problem solving, a practice known as regression. Although the machine can retrieve from a pile of data the fundamental laws of physics, it cannot yet come up with the deep principles — like quantum uncertainty in quantum mechanics, or relativity — that underlie those formulae.“By the times that A.I. comes back and tells you that, then we have reached artificial general intelligence, and you should be very scared or very excited, depending on your point of view,” Dr. Tegmark said. “The reason I’m working on this, honestly, is because what I find most menacing is, if we build super-powerful A.I. and have no clue how it works — right?”‘A dialogue between human and machine’Dr. Thaler, who directs the new institute at M.I.T., said he was once a skeptic about artificial intelligence but now was an evangelist. He realized that as a physicist he could encode some of his knowledge into the machine, which would then give answers that he could interpret more easily.“That becomes a dialogue between human and machine in a way that becomes more exciting,” he said, “rather than just having a black box you don’t understand making decisions for you.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHe added, “I don’t particularly like calling these techniques ‘artificial intelligence,’ since that language masks the fact that many A.I. techniques have rigorous underpinnings in mathematics, statistics and computer science.”Yes, he noted, the machine can find much better solutions than he can despite all of his training: “But ultimately I still get to decide what concrete goals are worth accomplishing, and I can aim at ever more ambitious targets knowing that, if I can rigorously define my goals in a language the computer understands, then A.I. can deliver powerful solutions.”Recently, Dr. Thaler and his colleagues fed their neural network a trove of data from the Large Hadron Collider, which smashes together protons in search of new particles and forces. Protons, the building blocks of atomic matter, are themselves bags of smaller entities called quarks and gluons. When protons collide, these smaller particles squirt out in jets, along with whatever other exotic particles have coalesced out of the energy of the collision. To better understand this process, he and his team asked the system to distinguish between the quarks and the gluons in the collider data.“We said, ‘I’m not going to tell you anything about quantum field theory; I’m not going to tell you what a quark or gluon is at a fundamental level,’” he said. “I’m just going to say, ‘Here’s a mess of data, please separate it into basically two categories.’ And it can do it.”That is, the system successfully identified and distinguished between quarks and gluons, without ever knowing what either was. If you then ask the system if there is a third type of object in the data, Dr. Thaler said, it starts to discover that quarks are not just one entity but exist in different types — so-called up-quarks and down-quarks.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“And so it starts to, like, learn as you give it more flexibility to explore,” he said. “It doesn’t know quantum field theory yet, but it knows to look for patterns. And this is a pattern that I was shocked that the machine would find.” The work, he added, would help collider physicists untangle their results.At one point during a Zoom conversation, Dr. Thaler displayed what he called “a goofy cartoon” of the neural net that had been used for the quark-gluon project. It looked like a pile of multicolored rubber bands, but it represented several layers of processing, involving some 30,000 nodes, or “neurons,” where information was gathered and passed on.“This is the kind of small network you could train on your laptop, if you waited long enough,” he said.It would fit on a small chip and is fast enough to be used in colliders to help decide which collisions to keep for study and which to discard. Since the collisions happen 40 million times a second, there isn’t a lot of time to decide.Another feature of this new field, Dr. Thaler said, was that it provided a common language for researchers from vastly different fields of endeavor. It turned out that the mathematics involved in solving the collider problem were also applicable to optimizing shipping schedules for an outfit like Amazon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The most surprising discoveries have come from realizing that someone else had precisely the tool or precisely the widget that can actually help me understand my problems in a new light,” Dr. Thaler said. “And from there, to actually do things that had never been done before.”The start of something quantum“One of the reasons A.I. has been so successful at solving games,” Dr. Thaler said, “is that games have a very well-defined notion of success.” He added, “If we could define what success means for physical laws, that would be an incredible breakthrough.”“In five to 10 years from now, I’m going to want to do exactly what you’re getting at: Here’s the data, here’s a very rough tool kit; find the equation I could put on a T-shirt, the equation that replaces the Standard Model of particle physics. What’s the equation that replaces Einstein’s general relativity?”Some physicists think the next great leap will come with advent of A.I. on quantum computers. Unlike classical computers, which manipulate bits that can be 1 or 0, the so-called qubits in quantum computers can be both at once. According to quantum physics, that is how elementary particles behave on the smallest scales of nature, and it allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of information simultaneously.Such machines are still in their infancy, but they hold great promise, said Seth Lloyd, a mechanical engineer and quantum computing expert at M.I.T. who is not part of the new artificial-intelligence institute there.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The basic insight is that quantum systems can generate patterns that are hard for classical systems to generate,” Dr. Lloyd said. “So maybe quantum systems can also recognize patterns that classical systems recognize.”Or as Joe Lykken, deputy director of research at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., put it, “To paraphrase Richard Feynman, if you want to use A.I. to discover things about our quantum world, you should use quantum A.I.”Maria Spiropulu, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, pointed to the growing literature “on quantum A.I. and quantum-inspired algorithms that solve problems that we thought of as unsolvable previously.” She added, “It’s like Plato’s allegory of the cave and the theory of forms coming-of-age!”‘It’s just an algorithm running’How far this could go depends on whom you ask. Could a machine produce the abstruse and unintuitive principles of quantum theory, or Einstein’s bulwark principles of relativity? Could it produce a theory that we humans can’t understand? Could we wind up in the Matrix, or a world run by SkyNet, like in the “Terminator” series?I asked a random sample of theoretical physicists whether they were ready to be replaced.“The way you are asking is adding to the confusion,” said Jaron Lanier, a computer engineer now working with Microsoft. The field of computer science, he said, is rife with romantic overstatements about the power and threat of superintelligent machines.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Can we form a question in such a way that we can do the computation?” he asked. “Remove the romanticism. It’s not a creature like a cat, it’s just an algorithm running.”Steven Weinberg, a Nobel laureate and a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, called it “a troubling thought” that humans might not be smart enough to understand the final Theory of Everything. “But I suspect in that case,” he wrote in an email, “we will also not be smart enough to design a computer that can find a final theory.”Lisa Randall, a physicist at Harvard, wrote: “I can readily imagine computers finding equations or relationships we don’t know how to interpret. But that is not really different from the many measurements we cannot yet explain.”Nima Arkani-Hamed, a theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., took issue with the idea that the computer would discover something too deep for humans to comprehend: “This does not reflect what we see in the character of the laws of nature, which we have come to see over the centuries are based on fewer, deeper, simpler if more abstract, mathematical ideas.”If Isaac Newton came back from the dead, for example, Dr. Arkani-Hamed said, he would have no trouble getting up to speed on contemporary physics: “Indeed, scores of non-Newtons manage to do this over the course of a four-year undergraduate education.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMichael Turner, a cosmologist at the Kavli Foundation in Los Angeles, said it ultimately didn’t matter where our ideas came from, so long as they were battle-tested before we relied on them.“So where do we get these theories or paradigms? It can be from deep principles — symmetry, beauty, simplicity — philosophical principles, religion or the local drunk,” he said. “As machines become smarter, we can add them to the list of sources.”Edward Witten, also of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, noted that although a theory-of-everything machine didn’t exist yet, it might in the next century. “If there were a machine that appeared to be interested in and curious about physics, I would certainly be interested in conversing with it.”No doubt it would be interested in talking with him.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Dennis Overbye joined The Times in 1998, and has been a reporter since 2001.

The pixels of his face rearranged themselves. A sentence came out as hiccups. Then he sputtered, froze, and ghosted.Green and I had been chatting on Headroom, a new video conferencing platform he and cofounder Andrew Rabinovich launched this fall. The glitch, they assured me, was not caused by their software, but by Green’s Wi-Fi connection. “I think the rest of my street is on homeschool,” he said, a problem that Headroom was not built to solve. It was built instead for other issues: the tedium of taking notes, the coworkers who drone on and on, and the difficulty in keeping everyone engaged. As we spoke, software tapped out a real-time transcription in a window next to our faces. It kept a running tally of how many words each person had said (Rabinovich dominated). Once our meeting was over, Headroom’s software would synthesize the concepts from the transcript; identify key topics, dates, ideas, and action items; and, finally, spit out a record that could be searched at a later time. It would even try to measure how much each participant was paying attention.Meetings have become the necessary evil of the modern workplace, spanning an elaborate taxonomy: daily stand-ups, sit-downs, all-hands, one-on-ones, brown-bags, status checks, brainstorms, debriefs, design reviews. But as time spent in these corporate conclaves goes up, work seems to suffer. Researchers have found that meetings correlate with a decline in workplace happiness, productivity, and even company market share. And in a year when so many office interactions have gone digital, the usual tedium of meeting culture is compounded by the fits and starts of teleconferencing.Trending NowUnderstanding Algorithms With Sinead BovellRecently, a new wave of startups has emerged to optimize those meetings with, what else, technology. Macro (“give your meeting superpowers”) makes a collaborative interface for Zoom. Mmhmm offers interactive backgrounds and slide-share tools for presenters. Fireflies, an AI transcription tool, integrates with popular video conferencing platforms to create a searchable record of each meeting. And Sidekick (“make your remote team feel close again”) sells a dedicated tablet for video calls.The idea behind Headroom, which was conceived pre-pandemic, is to improve on both the in-person and virtual problems with meetings, using AI. (Rabinovich used to head AI at Magic Leap.) The use of video conferencing was already on the rise before 2020; this year it exploded, and Green and Rabinovich are betting that the format is here to stay as more companies grow accustomed to having remote employees. Over the last nine months, though, many people have learned firsthand that virtual meetings bring new challenges, like interpreting body language from other people on-screen or figuring out if anyone is actually listening.“One of the hard things in a videoconference is when someone is speaking and I want to tell them that I like it,” says Green. In person, he says, “you might head nod or make a small aha.” But on a video chat, the speaker might not see if they’re presenting slides, or if the meeting is crowded with too many squares, or if everyone who’s making verbal cues is on mute. “You can't tell if it's crickets or if people are loving it.”Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDHeadroom aims to tackle the social distance of virtual meetings in a few ways. First, it uses computer vision to translate approving gestures into digital icons, amplifying each thumbs up or head nod with little emojis that the speaker can see. Those emojis also get added to the official transcript, which is automatically generated by software to spare someone the task of taking notes. Green and Rabinovich say this type of monitoring is made clear to all participants at the start of every meeting, and teams can opt out of features if they choose.More uniquely, Headroom’s software uses emotion recognition to take the temperature of the room periodically, and to gauge how much attention participants are paying to whoever’s speaking. Those metrics are displayed in a window on-screen, designed mostly to give the speaker real-time feedback that can sometimes disappear in the virtual context. “If five minutes ago everyone was super into what I'm saying and now they're not, maybe I should think about shutting up,” says Green.Emotion recognition is still a nascent field of AI. “The goal is to basically try to map the facial expressions as captured by facial landmarks: the rise of the eyebrow, the shape of the mouth, the opening of the pupils,” says Rabinovich. Each of these facial movements can be represented as data, which in theory can then be translated into an emotion: happy, sad, bored, confused. In practice, the process is rarely so straightforward. Emotion recognition software has a history of mislabeling people of color; one program, used by airport security, overestimated how often Black men showed negative emotions, like “anger.” Affective computing also fails to take cultural cues into context, like whether someone is averting their eyes out of respect, shame, or shyness.Keep ReadingThe latest on artificial intelligence, from machine learning to computer vision and moreFor Headroom’s purposes, Rabinovich argues that these inaccuracies aren’t as important. “We care less if you're happy or super happy, so long that we're able to tell if you're involved,” says Rabinovich. But Alice Xiang, the head of fairness, transparency, and accountability research at the Partnership on AI, says even basic facial recognition still has problems—like failing to detect when Asian individuals have their eyes open—because they are often trained on white faces. “If you have smaller eyes, or hooded eyes, it might be the case that the facial recognition concludes you are constantly looking down or closing your eyes when you’re not,” says Xiang. These sorts of disparities can have real-world consequences as facial recognition software gains more widespread use in the workplace. Headroom is not the first to bring such software into the office. HireVue, a recruiting technology firm, recently introduced an emotion recognition software that suggests a job candidate's ""employability,"" based on factors like facial movements and speaking voice.Constance Hadley, a researcher at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, says that gathering data on people’s behavior during meetings can reveal what is and isn’t working within that setup, which could be useful for employers and employees alike. But when people know their behavior is being monitored, it can change how they act in unintended ways. “If the monitoring is used to understand patterns as they exist, that’s great,” says Hadley. “But if it’s used to incentivize certain types of behavior, then it can end up triggering dysfunctional behavior.” In Hadley’s classes, when students know that 25 percent of the grade is participation, students raise their hands more often, but they don’t necessarily say more interesting things. When Green and Rabinovich demonstrated their software to me, I found myself raising my eyebrows, widening my eyes, and grinning maniacally to change my levels of perceived emotion.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDIn Hadley’s estimation, when meetings are conducted is just as important as how. Poorly scheduled meetings can rob workers of the time to do their own tasks, and a deluge of meetings can make people feel like they’re wasting time while drowning in work. Naturally, there are software solutions to this, too. Clockwise, an AI time management platform launched in 2019, uses an algorithm to optimize the timing of meetings. “Time has become a shared asset inside a company, not a personal asset,” says Matt Martin, the founder of Clockwise. “People are balancing all these different threads of communication, the velocity has gone up, the demands of collaboration are more intense. And yet, the core of all of that, there’s not a tool for anyone to express, ‘This is the time I need to actually get my work done. Do not distract me!’”Clockwise syncs with someone’s Google calendar to analyze how they’re spending their time, and how they could do so more optimally. The software adds protective time blocks based on an individual’s stated preferences. It might reserve a chunk of “do not disturb” time for getting work done in the afternoons. (It also automatically blocks off time for lunch. “As silly as that sounds, it makes a big difference,” says Martin.) And by analyzing multiple calendars within the same workforce or team, the software can automatically move meetings like a “team sync” or a “weekly 1x1” into time slots that work for everyone. The software optimizes for creating more uninterrupted blocks of time, when workers can get into “deep work” without distraction.Clockwise, which launched in 2019, just closed an $18 million funding round and says it’s gaining traction in Silicon Valley. So far, it has 200,000 users, most of whom work for companies like Uber, Netflix, and Twitter; about half of its users are engineers. Headroom is similarly courting clients in the tech industry, where Green and Rabinovich feel they best understand the problems with meetings. But it’s not hard to imagine similar software creeping beyond the Silicon Valley bubble. Green, who has school-age children, has been exasperated by parts of their remote learning experience. There are two dozen students in their classes, and the teacher can’t see all of them at once. “If the teacher is presenting slides, they actually can see none of them,” he says. “They don't even see if the kids have their hands up to ask a question.”Indeed, the pains of teleconferencing aren’t limited to offices. As more and more interaction is mediated by screens, more software tools will surely try to optimize the experience. Other problems, like laggy Wi-Fi, will be someone else’s to solve.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

Artificial Intelligence Is Now Smart Enough to Know When It Can't Be Trusted

Tech24 November 2020By David Nield

How might The Terminator have played out if Skynet had decided it probably wasn't responsible enough to hold the keys to the entire US nuclear arsenal? As it turns out, scientists may just have saved us from such a future AI-led apocalypse, by creating neural networks that know when they're untrustworthy.



These deep learning neural networks are designed to mimic the human brain by weighing up a multitude of factors in balance with each other, spotting patterns in masses of data that humans don't have the capacity to analyse.



While Skynet might still be some way off, AI is already making decisions in fields that affect human lives like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, and that means it's vital that they're as accurate as possible. To help towards this goal, this newly created neural network system can generate its confidence level as well as its predictions.



""We need the ability to not only have high-performance models, but also to understand when we cannot trust those models,"" says computer scientist Alexander Amini from the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).



This self-awareness of trustworthiness has been given the name Deep Evidential Regression, and it bases its scoring on the quality of the available data it has to work with – the more accurate and comprehensive the training data, the more likely it is that future predictions are going to work out.



The research team compares it to a self-driving car having different levels of certainty about whether to proceed through a junction or whether to wait, just in case, if the neural network is less confident in its predictions. The confidence rating even includes tips for getting the rating higher (by tweaking the network or the input data, for instance).



While similar safeguards have been built into neural networks before, what sets this one apart is the speed at which it works, without excessive computing demands – it can be completed in one run through the network, rather than several, with a confidence level outputted at the same time as a decision.



""This idea is important and applicable broadly,"" says computer scientist Daniela Rus. ""It can be used to assess products that rely on learned models. By estimating the uncertainty of a learned model, we also learn how much error to expect from the model, and what missing data could improve the model.""



The researchers tested their new system by getting it to judge depths in different parts of an image, much like a self-driving car might judge distance. The network compared well to existing setups, while also estimating its own uncertainty – the times it was least certain were indeed the times it got the depths wrong.



As an added bonus, the network was able to flag up times when it encountered images outside of its usual remit (so very different to the data it had been trained on) – which in a medical situation could mean getting a doctor to take a second look.



Even if a neural network is right 99 percent of the time, that missing 1 percent can have serious consequences, depending on the scenario. The researchers say they're confident that their new, streamlined trust test can help improve safety in real time, although the work has not yet been peer-reviewed.



""We're starting to see a lot more of these [neural network] models trickle out of the research lab and into the real world, into situations that are touching humans with potentially life-threatening consequences,"" says Amini.



""Any user of the method, whether it's a doctor or a person in the passenger seat of a vehicle, needs to be aware of any risk or uncertainty associated with that decision.""The research is being presented at the NeurIPS conference in December, and an online paper is available.

Ethical AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) promises better, more intelligent decision-making.
Governments are using AI to make decisions in welfare, policing and many other areas. Meanwhile, the private sector has readily adopted AI in to its business models. However, using AI carries with it the risk of algorithmic bias. We cannot achieve ethical AI without fully understanding and addressing this risk.
Algorithmic bias
Algorithmic bias is a kind of error associated with using AI, often resulting in unfairness. Algorithmic bias can arise in many ways - sometimes, the problem is with the design of the AI product itself. Other times the problem lies with the data set used to train the AI.
Algorithmic bias can cause actual harm as it may lead to a person being unfairly treated or even suffering unlawful discrimination based on characteristics such as race, age, sex or disability.
Technology and human rights
This project simulated a typical decision-making process and explored how algorithmic bias can ‘creep in’ to AI systems and, most importantly, how this problem can be addressed. 
The lessons learned in this project will be essential in promoting ethical AI compliance with human rights principles. 
This technical paper offered some guidance for companies to ensure that when they use AI, their decisions are fair, accurate and comply with human rights.

Comparing big data and artificial intelligence is like choosing between a shovel and a pick. Although the two complement each other in important ways, they're distinctively different in both nature and purpose.







Big data refers to large volumes of diverse and dynamic data that can be mined for information. AI is a set of technologies that enables machines to simulate human intelligence. AI requires the volumes of big data to effectively learn and evolve. Big data relies on AI to more intelligently mine for information.
The discussion is less about big data vs. artificial intelligence and more about big data and AI combined. They're both powerful technologies in their own rights, but together, the possibilities are unlimited.

What is big data?
Big data not only describes large sets of data, but it's also encompasses data that can be extremely varied, moves at a high velocity and has meaning within a defined context. The goal of using big data is data transformation and analytics that lead to specific results.
For example, data produced by social networks or the internet of things (IoT) by itself isn't enough to qualify as big data in the strictest sense. The data must also be part of a larger analytics strategy that can lead to process automation, enhanced decision-making or other specific results.
Big data can include structured, semistructured and unstructured data. It can originate from any data source capable of generating large volumes of data, including:

social media
IoT devices
websites
log files
text files
spreadsheets
databases
machinery sensors

From these data sets, organizations can derive valuable insights into their customers and operations in order to make more informed decisions that lead to strategic advantages in how they operate and do business.





What is AI?
When comparing big data vs. artificial intelligence, AI is a much different phenomenon. It refers to a type of intelligence that makes it possible for a machine to perform cognitive functions like those attributed to humans. A traditional system without AI reacts according to how it's been programmed to act; the AI-enabled machine can analyze and interpret data and then problem-solve based on those interpretations. It's always learning from the data, evolving as the data evolves and reacting to what it learns. In this way, the AI system is constantly improving and adjusting its behavior to accommodate change.






AI is made up of a broad set of technologies that each provide different methodologies for analyzing data and learning from that analysis. AI technologies are considered subdisciplines of AI or other AI technologies, but they all fall under the AI umbrella. The following categories are four of the most well-known AI technologies:

Machine learning is an AI subdiscipline that enables computers to learn from the collected data and then apply that knowledge without human intervention.
Deep learning is a subdiscipline of machine learning that enables computers to more closely simulate the analytical capabilities of the human brain to achieve increasingly greater accuracy.
Natural language processing is an AI subdiscipline that enables a machine to analyze, understand and generate human language and approximate natural conversation.
Computer vision is an AI subdiscipline that enables a machine to recognize and classify images, such as human faces, and then respond to what it sees.

AI is now being used in a variety of ways to enhance technology and drive innovation. AI technology supports everything from robotics to stock trading to medical imaging and personal assistants.





How AI and big data work together
The bottom line in the big data vs. artificial intelligence comparison is that big data refers to the data itself, while AI describes a machine's ability to use big data when learning to act like a human. They are complementary technologies, able to work together in important ways.
AI thrives on data. The greater the amount of data, the more effectively an AI system can analyze, learn and evolve. It's only through big data that AI can realize its fullest potential.
In the past, AI made relatively little progress in becoming useful in a practical sense. AI's slow development was, in part, because of the lack of technologies able to handle massive data sets. But the proliferation of the internet and the influx of unprecedented amount of information have forced these technologies to evolve, particularly when it comes to storage. These advancements enable AI to ingest more data and, as a result, conduct more accurate and thorough data analytics. And as these technologies continue to improve, AI will only become more powerful, accurate and comprehensive.
At the same time, AI promises to enhance big data so it can derive greater meaning from the data through more advanced analytics. Until recently, the characteristics that defined big data -- volume, velocity and variety -- quickly overwhelmed the capabilities of traditional analytics. AI, however, can help find significant trends and patterns in big data that might otherwise be misinterpreted or go undiscovered. In the same way that AI needs big data, big data needs AI to reach its fullest potential.








How storage technologies support AI and big data
The advancements in storage and data management technologies are what make today's AI and big data offerings possible. Today's solid-state flash arrays can handle greater capacities and support faster I/O operations than ever. Although AI doesn't warrant these capacity and performance levels, its hunger for large data sets does, creating a symbiotic relationship between AI and big data realized, in large part, through modern storage technologies.
The latest generation of SSDs can deliver greater IOPS and throughput at much lower latencies than could be achieved only a few years ago. Some enterprise SSD arrays can now deliver throughputs of 100 GBps and even much higher, with latency falling to well below 1 millisecond. At the same, they can deliver petabyte-scale capacity without compromising performance.
One reason for the greater capabilities is NVMe-oF, a storage communications standard that offers speeds comparable to DAS but over network connections. In this way, organizations can set up flexible, shared storage that can more effectively handle AI and big data workloads. In addition, new technologies such as storage class memory promise to continue to break performance barriers to better accommodate AI and big data going forward.
With the improvement in storage technologies, large data sets have become more available and manageable, making it possible for AI to also evolve. In fact, big data might turn out to be the greatest single influence on AI's imminent rise. Although there is a significant difference between big data and artificial intelligence, the two go hand in hand, and the relationship between them will only continue to grow and intensify.

While it sparked numerous innovations and brought digital disruption to many industries, it also changed the jobs market forever. It is true that AI has replaced some jobs, however, it has also brought new roles for human workers. As per a 2017 research from IDC, released by Salesforce, AI is projected to create 823,734 jobs by the year 2021, surpassing the number of jobs lost to AI technologies such as machine learning and automation. The report had also predicted that AI would increase global business revenues by US$1.1 trillion in the same time frame. So, AI will continue to be the big game-changer in the global economy, with much of the value potential up for grabs..This year, while the COVID-19 pandemic had an upsetting impact on the job market as a whole, AI still manages to continue its upward curve. Earlier, Analytics Insight had analyzed the data of open job opportunities for AI professionals from 2018 to 2023. The insights reveal that open AI jobs are expected to increase at a CAGR of 31.6% to reach a total of 1,928,658 in 2023, up from 489,393 in 2018. Analytics Insight also predicts the count to hit 1,006,945 by next year..However, a 2016 report from Forrester reveals a negative forecast in job trends. As per the report, 16% of US jobs will be replaced by 2025, while an equivalent of 9% of jobs will be created, thus resulting in a net loss of 7% of US jobs by 2025. On the contrary, Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, said Forrester's estimate seems a bit high. He expects the number to be closer to 3% or 4%. Forrester also stated in the report that smart systems like autonomous robots, digital assistants, AI software and chatbots would take over customer service rep jobs and eventually even serve as truck and taxi drivers. Further, it asserts that from 2021, AI will undergo significant changes to diversify beyond current machine learning and natural language processing capabilities..Demand for New Skills and Roles.The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs report, mentions 5 million jobs will have been lost to automation. At the same, it also pointed out that job positions like software developer, computer systems analyst and market-research and marketing specialist jobs are set to grow by around a fifth between now and 2024. This indicates the obvious that with the rise in new job roles in AI, there will also be a similar rise in AI skills. For instance, LinkedIn witnessed a 190% increase from 2015 to 2017 in terms of skills required for AI-based jobs. It also means that the unskilled jobs are under ominous threat. Hence the need for AI-skilling to operate, utilize and advance disruptive technologies will remain unequivocally necessary..With the AI spectrum is expanding, it is also predicted that the job roles will change every ten years too. A 2017 Cognizant whitepaper proposes 21 such jobs that will emerge over the next ten years and create mass employment. Some of these are AI business development managers, man-machine teaming managers, data detective, and AI-assisted healthcare technicians. Simultaneously, jobs like cybersecurity roles, business analysts, and financial analysts will also multiply as a result of AI. A recent survey by Burning Glass, which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country, of how many technology jobs request machine learning skills reveals significant growth for 2021. These job roles include, Software Developer / Engineer, Data Scientist, Network Engineer / Architect, Data Engineer, Data Mining Analyst, Database Architect, and so on. Moreover, it is important to note that AI has also helped create jobs where man and machine can work together via collaboration, e.g., cobots..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

This new system, GPT-3, had spent those months learning the ins and outs of natural language by analyzing thousands of digital books, the length and breadth of Wikipedia, and nearly a trillion words posted to blogs, social media and the rest of the internet.Mckay Wrigley, a 23-year-old computer programmer from Salt Lake City, was one of the few invited to tinker with the system, which uses everything it has learned from that vast sea of digital text to generate new language on its own. Mr. Wrigley wondered if it could imitate public figures — write like them, perhaps even chat like them.One of his experiments involved a pop psychologist, Scott Barry Kaufman. The system took in Mr. Kaufman’s name and a topic for discussion: creativity. Then, when asked “How do we become more creative?” GPT-3 responded instantly:I think creative expression is a natural byproduct of growing up in a diverse world. The more diverse the world is, the more you get exposed to different people, to different opportunities, to different places and to different challenges. And the more diverse that is, the more likely you’ll be to be able to put the dots together to form something new. And in many ways, I think if you want to be creative, you have to go for it. If you want to be a writer, you have to write, if you want to be a musician, you have to create music, if you want to be a comedian, you have to create comedy, and the more you create, the more likely it is that you’ll stumble onto some interesting stuff.Later, when Mr. Wrigley posted the paragraph on Twitter, somebody looped in the real Scott Barry Kaufman. He was stunned. “It definitely sounds like something I would say,” the real Mr. Kaufman tweeted, later adding, “Crazy accurate A.I.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn the weeks since its arrival, GPT-3 has spawned dozens of other experiments that raise the eyebrows in much the same way. It generates tweets, pens poetry, summarizes emails, answers trivia questions, translates languages and even writes its own computer programs, all with very little prompting. Some of these skills caught even the experts off guard.For many artificial intelligence researchers, it is an unexpected step toward machines that can understand the vagaries of human language — and perhaps even tackle other human skills.“It is surprising to me, and to a lot of people,” said Melanie Mitchell, an A.I. researcher at the Santa Fe Institute, an independent lab in New Mexico, who is among those experimenting with the system. “It is hard to figure out exactly what this thing is doing.”GPT-3 is far from flawless. It often spews biased and toxic language. And if you ask for 10 paragraphs in the style of Scott Barry Kaufman, it might give you five that are convincing — and five others that are not. When Mr. Kaufman actually chatted with his A.I. doppelgänger, he was not nearly as impressed as he was at first:Scott Barry Kaufman: What is imagination?“Scott Barry Kaufman”: What is imagination? You should tell me!Scott Barry Kaufman: You should know!“Scott Barry Kaufman”: Nope, you should know. You are the one who knows what imagination is. What do you think it is?But even this looked like real conversation. And notably, it showed what the system could do entirely on its own, without extra coding or fine-tuning.GPT-3 is the culmination of several years of work inside the world’s leading artificial intelligence labs, including OpenAI, an independent organization backed by $1 billion dollars in funding from Microsoft, as well as labs at Google and Facebook. At Google, a similar system helps answer queries on the company’s search engine.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThese systems — known as universal language models — can help power a wide range of tools, like services that automatically summarize news articles and “chatbots” designed for online conversation. So far, their impact on real-world technology has been small. But GPT-3 — which learned from a far larger collection of online text than previous systems — opens the door to a wide range of new possibilities, such as software that can speed the development of new smartphone apps, or chatbots that can converse in far more human ways than past technologies.As software designers, entrepreneurs, pundits and artists explore this system, each new experiment stokes an already heated debate over how powerful this breed of technology will ultimately be. While some say it may be a path toward truly intelligent machines, others argue that these experiments, while endlessly fascinating, are also misleading.“It is very fluent,” said Mark Riedl, a professor and researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “It is very articulate. It is very good at producing reasonable-sounding text. What it does not do, however, is think in advance. It does not plan out what it is going to say. It does not really have a goal.”An ‘emergent quality’Jordan Singer is a product designer at Square, the Silicon Valley mobile-payments company. He helps design the company’s smartphone apps, building the graphics, menus, buttons and other widgets that define an app’s look and feel. When he heard about GPT-3, he wondered if this automated system could do his job.He fed the system a simple description of a smartphone app, and the computer code needed to create the app. The description was in plain English. The code was built inside Figma, a specialized design tool used by professionals like Mr. Singer.He did this a few more times, feeding the system several more English-language descriptions alongside the matching Figma code. And when he was done, GPT-3 could write such code on its own.If he described a simple app for posting and viewing photos as a user would on Instagram, the system generated the code needed to build it. This code was sometimes flawed. But typically, if Mr. Singer made just a tweak or two, it worked as he wanted. “It’s not absolutely perfect,” he said. “But it is very, very close.”This behavior was entirely new, and it surprised even the designers of GPT-3. They had not built GPT-3 to generate computer code, just as they had not built it to write like Mr. Kaufman or generate tweets or translate languages. They had built it to do just one thing: predict the next word in a sequence of words.GPT-3 is what artificial intelligence researchers call a neural network, a mathematical system loosely modeled on the web of neurons in the brain. This is the same technology that identifies faces in the photos you post to Facebook and recognizes the commands you bark into your iPhone.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA neural network learns such skills by pinpointing patterns in vast amounts of digital data. By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a cat.About three years ago, researchers at Google and top labs like OpenAI started designing neural networks that learned from enormous amounts of prose, including unpublished books and Wikipedia articles by the thousands. These universal language models could be applied not just to one task, like translation, but to many.GPT-3 analyzed digital prose on an unprecedented scale, spending months looking for patterns in huge amounts of text posted to the internet. In this way, it learned to predict the next word in a sequence. If you type a few words into GPT-3, it will keep going, completing your thought with entire paragraphs of text.But in acquiring this specific skill, it learned much more. During its months of training, GPT-3 identified more than 175 billion parameters — mathematical representations of patterns — in that sea of books, Wikipedia articles and other online texts. These patterns amount to a map of human language: a mathematical description of the way we piece characters together, whether we are writing blogs or coding software programs. Using this map, GPT-3 can perform all sorts of tasks it was not built to do.Before asking GPT-3 to generate new text, you can focus it on particular patterns it may have learned during its training, priming the system for certain tasks. You can feed it descriptions of smartphone apps and the matching Figma code. Or you can show it reams of human dialogue. Then, when you start typing, it will complete the sequence in a more specific way. If you prime it with dialogue, for instance, it will start chatting with you.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It has this emergent quality,” said Dario Amodei, vice president for research at OpenAI. “It has some ability to recognize the pattern that you gave it and complete the story, give another example.”Previous language models worked in similar ways. But GPT-3 can do things that previous models could not, like write its own computer code. And, perhaps more important, you can prime it for specific tasks using just a few examples, as opposed to the thousands of examples and several hours of additional training required by its predecessors. Researchers call this “few-shot learning,” and they believe GPT-3 is the first real example of what could be a powerful phenomenon.“It exhibits a capability that no one thought possible,” said Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist and a key figure in the rise of artificial intelligence technologies over the past decade. “Any layperson can take this model and provide these examples in about five minutes and get useful behavior out of it.”This is both a blessing and a curse.Unsafe for work?OpenAI plans to sell access to GPT-3 via the internet, turning it into a widely used commercial product, and this year it made the system available to a limited number of beta testers through their web browsers. Not long after, Jerome Pesenti, who leads the Facebook A.I. lab, called GPT-3 “unsafe,” pointing to sexist, racist and otherwise toxic language the system generated when asked to discuss women, Black people, Jews and the Holocaust.With systems like GPT-3, the problem is endemic. Everyday language is inherently biased and often hateful, particularly on the internet. Because GPT-3 learns from such language, it, too, can show bias and hate. And because it learns from internet text that associates atheism with the words “cool” and “correct” and that pairs Islam with “terrorism,” GPT-3 does the same thing.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThis may be one reason that OpenAI has shared GPT-3 with only a small number of testers. The lab has built filters that warn that toxic language might be coming, but they are merely Band-Aids placed over a problem that no one quite knows how to solve.“They are doing the right thing by not just publicly releasing GPT-3,” said Allison Koenecke, a Stanford researcher who explores unwanted bias in A.I. systems. “A lot is still up in the air.”The onus is ultimately on OpenAI to ensure that this behavior remains in check, said Liz O’Sullivan, a vice president with Arthur, a company that helps businesses manage the behavior of artificial intelligence technologies. As it stands, she said, OpenAI is “passing along legal and reputation risk to anyone who might want to use the model in consumer-facing applications.”Other experts worry that these language models could help spread disinformation across the internet, amping up the kind of online campaigns that may have helped sway the 2016 presidential election. GPT-3 points to a future in which we are even less sure if what we are reading is real or fake. That goes for tweets, online conversations, even long-form prose.At the end of July, Liam Porr, a student at the University of California, Berkeley, generated several blog posts with GPT-3 and posted them on the internet, where they were read by 26,000 people. Sixty viewers were inspired to subscribe to the blog, and only a few suspected that the posts were written by a machine.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThey were not necessarily gullible people. One of the blog posts — which argued that you can increase your productivity if you avoid thinking too much about everything you do — rose to the top of the leader board on Hacker News, a site where seasoned Silicon Valley programmers, engineers and entrepreneurs rate news articles and other online content. (“In order to get something done, maybe we need to think less,” the post begins. “Seems counterintuitive, but I believe sometimes our thoughts can get in the way of the creative process.”)But as with most experiments involving GPT-3, Mr. Porr’s is not as powerful as it might seem.The flaws nobody noticesIn the mid-1960s, Joseph Weizenbaum, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, built an automated psychotherapist he called ELIZA. Judged from our vantage point in 2020, this chatbot was exceedingly simple.Unlike GPT-3, ELIZA did not learn from prose. It operated according to a few basic rules defined by its designer. It pretty much repeated whatever you said to it, only in the form of a question. But much to Dr. Weizenbaum’s surprise, many people treated the bot as if it were human, unloading their problems without reservation and taking comfort in the responses.When dogs and other animals exhibit even small amounts of humanlike behavior, we tend to assume they are more like us than they really are. The same goes for machines, said Colin Allen, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who explores cognitive skills in both animals and machines. “People get sucked in,” he said, “even if they know they are being sucked in.”That is part of what is happening with GPT-3. Because it can generate convincing tweets, blog posts and computer code, we read humanity into this digital system — and pay less attention to its limits.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn practice, the system fails about as often as it succeeds. We overlook that the computer code it writes requires some fine-tuning from human programmers — a line removed here or added there. We do not notice that its talent for conversation breaks down after a few exchanges, when it cannot “remember” what it said just a few seconds before. We do not quite realize that although the system generated a convincing blog post for Mr. Porr, he provided the headline and the photo and the first few sentences, and he removed some sentences that were less convincing.Mr. Porr does not believe GPT-3 is an enormous threat to the battle against disinformation in the short term, because it still requires so much help from humans. A tool like this becomes truly dangerous only if it can generate enormous amounts of convincing disinformation entirely on its own, exceeding what a team of hired hands can do with relative ease today.Similarly, when app designers ask Mr. Singer of Square if GPT-3 is a threat to their careers, he assures them it is not — at least not yet. He sees it as a way of making their jobs easier. “If it can get 70 percent of the way there, that is a lot of tedious work taken out of the equation,” he said.What we do not know is how much this technology will continue to improve in the months and years to come.Smarter, faster, even more expensiveWhile the researchers at OpenAI were training GPT-3 on more than a trillion words posted to the internet, they ran a second experiment, training a similar system on tens of thousands of digital photos. That system could analyze all of those photos and learn to build images in much the same way that GPT-3 builds paragraphs. Given half of a cat photo, it could generate the rest of the cat.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFor some researchers, the experiment indicates that such a system could ultimately handle tasks across multiple dimensions — language, sight, sound — much like humans do. Even when trained solely on language, they say, the system could already reach into other areas, whether computer programming, playing chess or generating guitar tabs.But continuing to improve this technology is far from trivial. Processing all of that internet data requires a specialized supercomputer running for months on end, an undertaking that is enormously expensive. When asked if such a project ran into the millions of dollars, Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said the costs were actually “higher,” running into the tens of millions.Mr. Amodei, OpenAI’s vice president for research, said there was still room to improve the technique, using more processing power to analyze more data. But he also said the approach might be close to running out of “juice.”At the very least, GPT-3 is a new tool for a world of A.I. researchers and entrepreneurs, a way of building all sorts of new technologies and new products. Mr. Wrigley, the computer programmer, recently quit his day job to start a company called LearnFromAnyone, which aims to build a kind of automated tutor using GPT-3 that can assume the guise of everyone from scientist Douglas Hofstadter to venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Others are building companies that aim to automatically generate code for computer programmers and automatically write promotional emails and tweets for marketing professionals.But it is unclear how effective these services will ultimately be. If GPT-3 generates the right text only half of the time, can it satisfy professionals? And it is unclear whether this technique is a path to truly conversational machines, let alone truly intelligent systems. Additional progress on the long road to machines that can mimic the human brain, Mr. Amodei said, will require entirely new ideas.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It is kind of like a chemistry reaction,” he said. “We have this one ingredient. But other ingredients are required as well.”[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Cade Metz is a technology correspondent, covering artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality, and other emerging areas.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is ready to have a transformational effect on business. Information Technology is not, at this point about business automation and codifying business logic. All things being equal, insight is the new currency, and the speed with which we can scale that understanding and the knowledge it brings is the reason for esteem creation and the way to competitive advantage. As per Gartner, AI will be one of the main five venture needs for over 30% of CIOs internationally, by 2020. Many organizations are still early in their journey and are attempting to see how AI can change their organizations.
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes it feasible for machines to learn from experience, adapt to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks. AI works by joining a lot of information with quick, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms, permitting the software to adapt consequently by recognizing patterns in the data. Types of AI being used today incorporate, among others, digital assistants, chatbots, and robots.
Artificial Intelligence incorporates numerous techniques and consistently advancing the scope of technology, following are the major subfields:

Machine Learning (ML) utilizes neural networks and statistical analysis to discover concealed bits of knowledge in information without unequivocally being customized for where to look or what to finish up. It automates building investigative models.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the capacity of computers to analyze, comprehend, and generate human language, including speech.
Deep Learning (DL) is a variation of machine learning – it includes the capacity of machines to create self-taking abilities from a large amount of information utilizing tremendous neural networks with numerous layers of handling units. Basic applications incorporate picture and discourse acknowledgment.

Why Artificial Intelligence is important?
The genuine guarantee of AI is to release noteworthy experiences that would otherwise be caught in a massive amount of data. A lot of that data is unstructured data – information that is produced by written reports and business documents, recordings, photographs, online media posts, or even email messages.
With artificial intelligence, we can assemble a huge number of computers that could all work simultaneously to work on solving complex problems. It is likewise fit for seeing patterns in the information that even trained experts don't generally get.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies can automate significantly, yet manual and time-consuming tasks, permitting representatives to zero in on higher-esteem work. Artificial intelligence will be utilized to remove new insights, transform decision making, and drive improved business results. A recent PwC report shows that a staggering 72% of business decision-makers that AI gives a serious edge on the business front.
Early selection of artificial intelligence for specific, clearly characterized applications empowers forward-looking organizations to make huge business value and, at last, to set the stage for transforming business models and processes.
Artificial Intelligence in organizations can be utilized to:

Increase competitive advantage and improve efficiency
Advance automated cooperations with clients, partners, and workers
Multiply productivity gains via computerizing measures
Power smarter machinery, vehicles, and structures
Improve client closeness and subsequently increment buyer interest
Improve the examination of video and audio in real-time

SAP – AI Business Intelligence 
HANA is SAP's cloud stage that businesses use to oversee information on the basis of data they have gathered. To put it plainly, it replicates and ingests organized information, for example, sales transaction or customer information, from relational databases, applications, and different sources.
The stage can be installed to run on-premise through a company's servers, or via the cloud. HANA takes in information gathered from access points across over the business—including mobile and work stations, money related exchanges, sensors, and equipment at production plants. If your business staff utilizes organization cell phones or tablets in the field to record purchase orders, data from those exchanges can be analyzed and perceived by HANA to spot patterns and abnormalities.
Let's take a look at how Artificial learning is making our business smart. Considering 3 industries:
Retail Sector

AI calculations are being utilized by online retailers in ways given below:
The online proposal engine allows retailers to offer customized advancements or client experience dependent on the client's previous purchases or activities.
Better customer service and conveyance frameworks are conceivable utilizing smart machines which can reduce responses time and support in circumstances where assets are less
Monitoring price changes over a specific timeframe empower e-commerce organizations to follow designs in these variances and set costs as indicated by the request.

Financial Sector

The extraordinary capability of AI is convincing the financial sector to adopt it with vigor. AI can help banks, insurers, and investors settle on smarter decisions in different areas:
Overseeing customer fulfillment
Responding to market trends
Foreseeing hazard
Innovate to stay competitive

The Banking and Finance (BFSI) sector is taking the help of Artificial Intelligence to manage the huge amount of data that is getting generated. Financial sectors are progressively relying upon AI for portfolio management like forecasting and overseeing wealth and resources. These calculations can recognize drifts more productively than people and react in real-time.
Health Sector
Associations can benefit from the crossing point between the Internet of Things (IoT) and information examination to empower smarter healthcare and solutions.

The robot helped medical procedures are getting more normal. They are more exact, however, have a higher achievement rate with quicker recovery and smaller surgery scars.
Customized wellbeing observing using smart-watches and other wearable gadgets have made wellbeing telemetry a reality

How AI monitoring can better your business?
The impacts of AI will be amplified in the coming decade, as essentially every industry will change its core processes and plans of action to take advantage of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The bottleneck presently is in business imagination, implementation, and management. For business pioneers, it is basic to get an arrangement for making AI work in the organization. Initial AI tasks may get postponed or underdeliver, yet the risk of organizations turning out to be non-serious by disregarding AI is high.

Credit...Trevor WallaceBy Zach ZorichNov. 24, 2020Finding the tomb of an ancient king full of golden artifacts, weapons and elaborate clothing seems like any archaeologist’s fantasy. But searching for them, Gino Caspari can tell you, is incredibly tedious.Dr. Caspari, a research archaeologist with the Swiss National Science Foundation, studies the ancient Scythians, a nomadic culture whose horse-riding warriors terrorized the plains of Asia 3,000 years ago. The tombs of Scythian royalty contained much of the fabulous wealth they had looted from their neighbors. From the moment the bodies were interred, these tombs were popular targets for robbers; Dr. Caspari estimates that more than 90 percent of them have been destroyed.He suspects that thousands of tombs are spread across the Eurasian steppes, which extend for millions of square miles. He had spent hours mapping burials using Google Earth images of territory in what is now Russia, Mongolia and Western China’s Xinjiang province. “It’s essentially a stupid task,” Dr. Caspari said. “And that’s not what a well-educated scholar should be doing.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAs it turned out, a neighbor of Dr. Caspari’s in the International House, in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, had a solution. The neighbor, Pablo Crespo, at the time a graduate student in economics at City University of New York who was working with artificial intelligence to estimate volatility in commodity prices, told Dr. Caspari that what he needed was a convolutional neural network to search his satellite images for him. The two bonded over a shared academic philosophy, of making their work openly available for the benefit of the greater scholarly community, and a love of heavy metal music. Over beers in the International House bar, they began a collaboration that put them at the forefront of a new type of archaeological analysis.ImageDr. Caspari spent hours mapping Scythian burial sites across a huge swath of territory in present-day Russia, Mongolia and China using Google Earth images.Credit...via Pablo CrespoImageTomb images used by Pablo Crespo and Dr. Caspari to train the neural network.Credit...via Pablo CrespoA convolutional neural network, or C.N.N., is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to analyze information that can be processed as a grid; it is especially well suited to analyzing photographs and other images. The network sees an image as a grid of pixels. The C.N.N. that Dr. Crespo designed starts by giving each pixel a rating based on how red it is, then another for green and for blue. After rating each pixel according to a variety of additional parameters, the network begins to analyze small groups of pixels, then successively larger ones, looking for matches or near-matches to the data it has been trained to spot.Working in their spare time, the two researchers ran 1,212 satellite images through the network for months, asking it to look for circular stone tombs and to overlook other circular, tomblike things such as piles of construction debris and irrigation ponds.At first they worked with images that spanned roughly 2,000 square miles. They used three-quarters of the imagery to train the network to understand what a Scythian tomb looks like, correcting the system when it missed a known tomb or highlighted a nonexistent one. They used the rest of the imagery to test the system. The network correctly identified known tombs 98 percent of the time.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCreating the network was simple, Dr. Crespo said. He wrote it in less than a month using the programming language Python and at no cost, not including the price of the beers. Dr. Caspari hopes that their creation will give archaeologists a way to find new tombs and to identify important sites so that they can be protected from looters.Other convolutional neural networks are beginning to automate a variety of repetitive tasks that are usually foisted on to graduate students. And they are opening new windows on to the past. Some of the jobs that these networks are inheriting include classifying pottery fragments, locating shipwrecks in sonar images and finding human bones that are for sale, illegally, on the internet.“Netflix is using this kind of technique to show you recommendations,” Dr. Crespo, now a senior data scientist for Etsy, said. “Why shouldn’t we use it for something like saving human history?”Gabriele Gattiglia and Francesca Anichini, both archaeologists at the University of Pisa in Italy, excavate Roman Empire-era sites, which entails analyzing thousands of broken bits of pottery. In Roman culture nearly every type of container, including cooking vessels and the amphoras used for shipping goods around the Mediterranean, was made of clay, so pottery analysis is essential for understanding Roman life.ImageFrancesca Anichini, an archaeologist at the University of Pisa, studies Roman Empire-era sites.Credit...MAPPALab - University of PisaImageShe and her colleague Gabriele Gattiglia must analyze thousands of broken bits of clay pottery.Credit...MAPPALab - University of PisaImageTheir project, called ArchAIDE, will allow archaeologists to photograph a piece of pottery in the field and have it identified by convolutional neural networks. Credit...MAPPALab - University of PisaThe task involves comparing pottery sherds to pictures in printed catalogs. Dr. Gattiglia and Dr. Anichini estimate that only 20 percent of their time is spent excavating sites; the rest is spent analyzing pottery, a job for which they are not paid. “We started dreaming about some magic tool to recognize pottery on an excavation,” Dr. Gattiglia said.That dream became the ArchAIDE project, a digital tool that will allow archaeologists to photograph a piece of pottery in the field and have it identified by convolutional neural networks. The project, which received financing from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, now involves researchers from across Europe, as well as a team of computer scientists from Tel Aviv University in Israel who designed the C.N.N.s.The project involved digitizing many of the paper catalogs and using them to train a neural network to recognize different types of pottery vessels. A second network was trained to recognize the profiles of pottery sherds. So far, ArchAIDE can identify only a few specific pottery types, but as more researchers add their collections to the database the number of types is expected to grow.“I dream of a catalog of all types of ceramics,” Dr. Anichini said. “I don’t know if it is possible to complete in this lifetime.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSaving time is one of the biggest advantages of using convolutional neural networks. In marine archaeology, ship time is expensive, and divers cannot spend too much time underwater without risking serious pressure-related injuries. Chris Clark, an engineer at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif., is addressing both problems by using an underwater robot to make sonar scans of the seafloor, then using a convolutional neural network to search the images for shipwrecks and other sites. In recent years he has been working with Timmy Gambin, an archaeologist at the University of Malta, to search the floor of the Mediterranean Sea around the island of Malta.Their system got off to a rough start: On one of its first voyages, they ran their robot into a shipwreck and had to send a diver down to retrieve it. Things improved from there. In 2017, the network identified what turned out to be the wreck of a World War II-era dive bomber off the coast of Malta. Dr. Clark and Dr. Gambin are now working on another site that was identified by the network, but did not want to discuss the details until the research has gone through peer-review.ImageResearchers from Cal Poly SLO, Harvey Mudd College and the University of Malta deploying an autonomous underwater vehicle from the Malta coast.Credit...Dr. Zoe Wood/Harvey Mudd CollegeImageA 3-D reconstruction of a World War II plane wreckage off the coast of Malta.The reconstruction was built using sensor data obtained from an autonomous underwater vehicle, which was programmed to collect the “best” images for making such reconstructions.Credit...Harvey Mudd CollegeShawn Graham, a professor of digital humanities at Carleton University in Ottawa, uses a convolutional neural network called Inception 3.0, designed by Google, to search the internet for images related to the buying and selling of human bones. The United States and many other countries have laws requiring that human bones held in museum collections be returned to their descendants. But there are also bones being held by people who have skirted these laws. Dr. Graham said he had even seen online videos of people digging up graves to feed this market.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“These folks who are being bought and sold never consented to this,” Dr. Graham said. “This does continued violence to the communities from which these ancestors have been removed. As archaeologists, we should be trying to stop this.”He made some alterations to Inception 3.0 so that it could recognize photographs of human bones. The system had already been trained to recognize objects in millions of photographs, but none of those objects were bones; he has since trained his version on more than 80,000 images of human bones. He is now working with a group called Countering Crime Online, which is using neural networks to track down images related to the illegal ivory trade and sex trafficking.Dr. Crespo and Dr. Caspari said that the social sciences and humanities could benefit by incorporating the tools of information technology into their work. Their convolutional neural network was easy to use and freely available for anyone to modify to suit their own research needs. In the end, they said, scientific advances come down to two things.“Innovation really happens at the intersections of established fields,” Dr. Caspari said. Dr. Crespo added: “Have a beer with your neighbor every once in a while.”[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]A version of this article appears in print on Nov. 24, 2020, Section D, Page 8 of the New York edition with the headline: Archaeologists Let Deep Learning Do  All Those Dull Tasks.

Police officers had attached roughly a pound of C-4 explosive to it, steered the device up to a wall near an active shooter and detonated the charge. In the explosion, the assailant, Micah Xavier Johnson, became the first person in the United States to be killed by a police robot.Afterward, then-Dallas Police Chief David Brown called the decision sound. Before the robot attacked, Mr. Johnson had shot five officers dead, wounded nine others and hit two civilians, and negotiations had stalled. Sending the machine was safer than sending in human officers, Mr. Brown said.But some robotics researchers were troubled. “Bomb squad” robots are marketed as tools for safely disposing of bombs, not for delivering them to targets. (In 2018, police officers in Dixmont, Maine, ended a shootout in a similar manner.). Their profession had supplied the police with a new form of lethal weapon, and in its first use as such, it had killed a Black man.Designed to Deceive: Do These People Look Real to You?The people in this story may look familiar, like ones you’ve seen on Facebook or Twitter or Tinder.

Goodman, a psychiatrist at the Veterans Integrated Service Network in the Bronx. “The fact is, we can’t rely on trained medical experts to identify people who are truly at high risk,” she said.Credit...Bryan Anselm for The New York TimesBy Benedict CareyNov. 23, 2020At a recent visit to the Veterans Affairs clinic in the Bronx, Barry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, learned that he belonged to a very exclusive club. According to a new A.I.-assisted algorithm, he was one of several hundred V.A. patients nationwide, of six million total, deemed at imminent risk of suicide.The news did not take him entirely off guard. Barry, 69, who was badly wounded in the 1968 Tet offensive, had already made two previous attempts on his life. “I don’t like this idea of a list, to tell you the truth — a computer telling me something like this,” Barry, a retired postal worker, said in a phone interview. He asked that his surname be omitted for privacy.“But I thought about it,” Barry said. “I decided, you know, OK — if it’s going to get me more support that I need, then I’m OK with it.”For more than a decade, health officials have watched in vain as suicide rates climbed steadily — by 30 percent nationally since 2000 — and rates in the V.A. system have been higher than in the general population. The trends have defied easy explanation and driven investment in blind analysis: machine learning, or A.I.-assisted algorithms that search medical and other records for patterns historically associated with suicides or attempts in large clinical populations.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDoctors have traditionally gauged patients’ risks by looking at past mental health diagnoses and incidents of substance abuse, and by drawing on experience and medical instinct. But these evaluations fall well short of predictive, and the artificially intelligent programs explore many more factors, like employment and marital status, physical ailments, prescription history and hospital visits. These algorithms are black boxes: They flag a person as at high risk of suicide, without providing any rationale.But human intelligence isn’t necessarily better at the task. “The fact is, we can’t rely on trained medical experts to identify people who are truly at high risk,” said Dr. Marianne S. Goodman, a psychiatrist at the Veterans Integrated Service Network in the Bronx, and a clinical professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “We’re no good at it.”Deploying A.I. in this way is not new; researchers have been gathering data on suicides through the National Health Service in Britain since 1996. The U.S. Army, Kaiser Permanente and Massachusetts General Hospital each has separately developed a algorithm intended to predict suicide risk. But the V.A.’s program, called Reach Vet, which identified Barry as at high risk, is the first of the new U.S. systems to be used in daily clinical practice, and it is being watched closely. How these systems perform — whether they save lives and at what cost, socially and financially — will help determine if digital medicine can deliver on its promise.“It is a critical test for these big-data systems,” said Alex John London, the director of the Center for Ethics and Policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “If these things have a high rate of false positives, for instance, that marks a lot people at high risk who are not — and the stigma associated with that could be harmful indeed downstream. We need to be sure these risk flags lead to people getting better or more help, not somehow being punished.”The V.A.’s algorithm updates continually, generating a new list of high-risk veterans each month. Some names stay on the list for months, others fall off. When a person is flagged, his or her name shows up on the computer dashboard of the local clinic’s Reach Vet coordinator, who calls to arrange an appointment. The veteran’s doctor explains what the high-risk designation means — it is a warning sign, not a prognosis — and makes sure the person has a suicide safety plan: that any guns and ammunition are stored separately; that photos of loved ones are visible; and that phone numbers of friends, social workers and suicide hotlines are on hand.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDoctors who have worked with Reach Vet say that the system produces unexpected results, both in whom it flags and whom it does not.To some of his therapists, Chris, 36, who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, looked very much like someone who should be on the radar. He had been a Marine rifleman and saw combat in three of his four tours, taking and returning heavy fire in multiple skirmishes. In 2008, a roadside bomb injured several of his friends but left him unscathed. After the attack he had persistent nightmares about it and received a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress. In 2016, he had a suicidal episode; he asked that his last name be omitted to protect his privacy.“I remember going to the shower, coming out and grabbing my gun,” he said in an interview at his home near New York City. “I had a Glock 9-millimeter. For me, I love guns, they’re like a safety blanket. Next thing I know, I’m waking up in cold water, sitting in the tub, the gun is sitting right there, out of the holster. I blacked out. I mean, I have no idea what happened. There were no bullets in the gun, it turned out.”ImageChris, during a deployment to Afghanistan.Credit... The strongest risk factor for suicide is a previous attempt, especially one with a gun. Yet Chris’s name has not turned up on the high-risk list compiled by A.I., and he does not think it ever will.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“At the time, in 2016, I was going to school for a master’s, working full time,” he said. “Our two kids were toddlers; I was sleeping no more than a few hours a night, if that. It was too much. I was sleep-deprived all the time. I had never been suicidal, never had suicidal thoughts; it was a totally impulsive thing.”The A.I. behind Reach Vet seems to home in on other risk factors, Dr. Goodman said: “The things this program picks up wouldn’t necessarily be the ones I thought about. The analytics are beginning to change our understanding of who’s at greatest risk.”The algorithm is built on an analysis of thousands of previous suicides in the V.A.’s database, dating to 2008. The computer mixes and shuffles scores of facts from the medical records — age, marital status, diagnoses, prescriptions — and settles on the factors that together are most strongly associated with suicide risk. The V.A. model integrates 61 factors in all, including some that are not obvious, like arthritis and statin use, and produces a composite score for each person. Those who score at the very top of the range — the top 0.1 percentage — are flagged as high risk.“The risk concentration for people in the top 0.1 percent on this score was about 40 times,” said John McCarthy, the director of data and surveillance, in Suicide Prevention in the VA Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention. “That is, they were 40 times more likely to die of suicide” than the average person.Bridget Matarazzo, the director of clinical services at the Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center for Veteran Suicide Prevention, said of Reach Vet. “My impression is that it’s identifying some folks who were previously on providers’ radar, but also others who were not.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLate in 2018, a V.A. team led by Dr. McCarthy presented the first results of the Reach Vet system. Over a six-month period, with Reach Vet in place, high-risk veterans more than doubled their use of V.A. services. By contrast, in a comparison group tracked for six months before Reach Vet was installed, the use of V.A. services stayed roughly the same.The Reach Vet group also had a lower mortality rate over that time — although it was an overall rate, including any cause of death. The analysis did not detect a difference in suicides, at least up to that stage. “It’s encouraging, but we’ve got much more to do to see if we’re having the impact we want,” Dr. McCarthy said.Ronald Kessler, a professor of health care and policy at Harvard Medical School, said: “Right now, this and other models predict who’s at highest risk. What they don’t tell you is who is most likely to profit from an intervention. If you don’t know that, you don’t know where to put your resources.”For doctors using the system, however, it has already prompted some rethinking of how to assess risk. “You end up with a lot of older men who are really struggling with medical problems,” Dr. Goodman said. “They’re quietly miserable, in pain, often alone, with financial problems, and you don’t see them because they’re not coming in.”And for those whose names have popped up on Reach Vet’s list, the experience of being identified and contacted is not something they can easily forget.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBarry, the Vietnam veteran, said that he was in a relatively good place, for now. He is close to his two grown children, and he receives regular care at the Bronx V.A., including both individual and group therapy, and medication for recurrent psychotic episodes. But he is also aware of how quickly things can turn dark.“Look, I know I sometimes talk to myself at night, and I hear voices,” he said. “The meds work fine, but once in a while they don’t, and that angers them, the voices. And that is not good for me.”[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Benedict Carey has been a science reporter for The Times since 2004.

[+] The DEUCE: Digital Electronic Universal Computing Engine, was the first commercially produced digital model and was developed from earlier plans by Alan Turing. 30 were sold and in 1956 one cost ú50,000. The DEUCE took up a huge space compared to modern computers and worked from 1450 thermionic valves which grew hot , blow outs were frequent. However the DEUCE proved a popular innovation and some models were working in to the 1970s.

When computers were still in the nascent stages, Alan Turing published his legendary paper, “Computing Machinery And Intelligence,” in the Mind journal in 1950. In it, he set forth the intriguing question: Can machines think?


At the time, the notion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) did not exist (this would not come until about six years later at a conference at Dartmouth University). Yet Turing was already thinking about the implications of this category.

In his paper, he described a framework to determine if a machine had intelligence. This essentially involved a thought experiment. Assume there are three players in a game. Two are human and the other is a computer. An evaluator—who is a human—then asks open-ended questions to the players. If this person cannot determine who is the human, then the computer is considered to be intelligent.

PROMOTED
The Turing Test was quite ingenious because there was no need to define “intelligence,” which is fraught with complexities. Even today this concept is far from clear-cut.

Keep in mind that Turing thought the test would ultimately be cracked by 2000 or so. But interestingly enough, this turned out to be way too optimistic. The Turing Test has remained elusive for AI systems.
“If Alan Turing was alive, he might be shocked that given 175 billion neurons from GPT-3 we are still unable to pass his test, but we will soon,” said Ben Taylor, who is the Chief AI Evangelist at DataRobot.

So why has it been so difficult to beat the test? A key reason is that it can be tricked. If you ask a nonsensical question, the results will often be non-human like. Let’s face it, people are very good at detecting when something is not quite right.

“When you ask a GPT-3 system how many eyes the sun has, it will respond that there is one and when asked who was the president of the U.S. in 1600, the answer will be Queen Elizabeth I,” said Noah Giansiracusa, who is an Assistant Professor of Mathematics and Data Science at Bentley University. “The basic problem seems to be that GPT-3 always tries in earnest to answer the question, rather than refusing and pointing out the absurdity and unanswerability of a question.”

But over time, it seems reasonable that these issues will be worked out. The fact is that AI technology is continuing to progress at a staggering pace. 
There may also be a need for another test as well. “Since the Turing test, humans have actually discovered much more insight into our own minds through fMRI and what makes us superior in our own intelligence,” said Taylor. “This insight into our own brains justifies changing the goals of a test beyond mimicking behavior. Defining a new test might help us get out of the deep-learning rut, which is currently insufficient for achieving AGI or Artificial General Intelligence. The Turing test was our moonshot, so let's figure out our Mars-shot.”
Over the years, other tests have emerged. According Druhin Bala, who is the CEO and co-founder of getchefnow.com, there are:


The Marcus Test: In which a program watches a television show and is asked meaningful questions about the show's content.
The Lovelace Test 2.0: Where you detect AI through an ability to create art.
Total Turing Test: Where the questioner can also test perceptual abilities as well as the ability to manipulate objects.


But my favorite is the Wozniak Test (yes, this is from the co-founder of Apple). This is where a robot can enter a stranger’s home and make a cup of coffee!
Now of course, all these tests have their own issues. The fact is that no test is fool-proof. But in the coming years, there will probably be new ones and this will help with the development of AI. 
“The Turing Test is brilliant in its simplicity and elegance, which is why it's held up so well for 70 years,” said Zach Mayer, who is the Vice President of Data Science at DataRobot. “It's an important milestone for machine intelligence, and GPT-3 is very close to passing it. And yet, as we pass this milestone, I think it's also clear that GPT-3 is nowhere near human-level intelligence. I think discovering another ‘Turing Test’ for AI will illuminate the next step on our journey towards understanding human intelligence.”

Photograph: DeepMind/PADeepMind This article is more than 3 years oldDeepMind AI cracks 50-year-old problem of protein foldingThis article is more than 3 years oldProgram solves scientific problem in ‘stunning advance’ for understanding machinery of lifeIan Sample Science editorMon 30 Nov 2020 10.58 ESTLast modified on Mon 30 Nov 2020 12.41 ESTShareHaving risen to fame on its superhuman performance at playing games, the artificial intelligence group DeepMind has cracked a serious scientific problem that has stumped researchers for half a century.With its latest AI program, AlphaFold, the company and research laboratory showed it can predict how proteins fold into 3D shapes, a fiendishly complex process that is fundamental to understanding the biological machinery of life.Independent scientists said the breakthrough would help researchers tease apart the mechanisms that drive some diseases and pave the way for designer medicines, more nutritious crops and “green enzymes” that can break down plastic pollution.DeepMind said it had started work with a handful of scientific groups and would focus initially on malaria, sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease.“It marks an exciting moment for the field,” said Demis Hassabis, DeepMind’s founder and chief executive. “These algorithms are now becoming mature enough and powerful enough to be applicable to really challenging scientific problems.”Venki Ramakrishnan, the president of the Royal Society, called the work “a stunning advance” that had occurred “decades before many people in the field would have predicted”.DeepMind is best known for its run of human-trouncing programs that achieved supremacy in chess, Go, Starcraft II and old-school Atari classics. But superhuman gameplay was never the primary aim. Instead, games provided a training ground for programs that, once powerful enough, would be unleashed on real-world problems.Protein folding has been a grand challenge in biology for 50 years. An arcane form of molecular origami, its importance is hard to overstate. Most biological processes revolve around proteins and a protein’s shape determines its function. When researchers know how a protein folds up, they can start to uncover what it does. How insulin controls sugar levels in the blood and how antibodies fight coronavirus are both determined by protein structure.Scientists have identified more than 200m proteins but structures are known for only a fraction of them. Traditionally, the shapes are discovered through meticulous lab work that can take years. And while computer scientists have made headway on the problem, inferring the structure from a protein’s makeup is no easy task. Proteins are chains of amino acids that can twist and bend into a mind-boggling variety of shapes: a googol cubed, or 1 followed by 300 zeroes.To learn how proteins fold, researchers at DeepMind trained their algorithm on a public database containing about 170,000 protein sequences and their shapes. Running on the equivalent of 100 to 200 graphics processing units – by modern standards, a modest amount of computing power – the training took a few weeks.DeepMind put AlphaFold through its paces by entering it for a biennial “protein olympics” known as Casp, the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction. Entrants to the international competition are given the amino acid sequences for about 100 proteins and challenged to work them out. The results from teams that use computers are compared with those based on lab work.AlphaFold not only outperformed other computer programs but reached an accuracy comparable to the laborious and time-consuming lab-based methods. When ranked across all proteins analysed, AlphaFold had a median score of 92.5 out of 100, with 90 being the equivalent to experimental methods. For the hardest proteins, the median score fell, but only marginally to 87.Hassabis said DeepMind had started work on how to give researchers access to AlphaFold to help with scientific research. Andrei Lupas, the director of the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, Germany, said he had already used the program to solve a protein structure that scientists had been stuck on for a decade.Janet Thornton, a director emeritus of EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute near Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, said she was excited to hear the results. “This is a problem that I was beginning to think would not get solved in my lifetime,” she said. “Knowing these structures will really help us to understand how human beings operate and function, how we work.”John Jumper, a researcher on the team at DeepMind, said: “We really didn’t know until we saw the Casp results how far we had pushed the field.” It is not the end of the work, however. Future research will focus on how proteins combine to form larger “complexes” and how they interact with other molecules in living organisms.Explore more on these topicsDeepMindBiologyArtificial intelligence (AI)AlphabetnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedRFK Jr apologises after leaked phone call in which Trump seems to offer dealI’m from Appalachia.

At the moment, artificial intelligence in banking allows you to analyze huge amounts of information, up to the user's request in social networks, in order to make more competent and less risky decisions.The cutting edge advantage. Machine learning in banking may make you more competitive depending on the task you want to solve with its help. Further, we will dwell on artificial intelligence in banking case studies so you will be able to find the task that is relevant for your business and solvable with AI at the same time. Costs cut. Depending on the way you use AI and ML for your financial institution, it may cut you some costs. For example, using robo-advisors as a part of your support team may lower the cost of staff maintenance. Better security. Artificial intelligence in banking can be applied in different ways if you want to achieve more security. For example, credit card fraud detection using machine learning has become a fairly standard application of the technology, while innovative cameras with face recognition can determine if a client's intentions are false judging by their facial expressions.Artificial Intelligence in Banking Case Studies ExamplesAs for the practical application of these innovations in the sphere of baking and finances, AI and ML may be successfully used for:Customer service improvement. For example, a chatbot may help the customers navigate the bank’s website and application, suggest making regular payments, and notify users in the case of overspendings. Even more advanced chatbots already help customers with their budget planning, money-saving, and investment management. Risk assessment. Making money out of money is always a risky process so AI and ML can help correctly assess the risks when issuing a loan, and make sure that the customer isn’t engaged in money laundering and terrorist financing. What’s more, machine learning for investment management and risk evaluation is quite useful as well. Fraud detection with AI and machine learning. Credit card fraud detection using machine learning is not the only example of utilizing this technology for security purposes. In addition, artificial intelligence can protect your employees ‘inboxes from phishing emails, as well as keep your customers' data safe in mobile banking applications. Alternatively, you can use a ready-made security solution, or partner with a company with fraud detection expertise like SPD Group to create your own fraud prevention system based on the core threats you face. Investment management. As for machine learning for investment management, below are more insights into this topic. What Is Meant by Investment Management?As defined by Investopedia, “Investment management refers to the handling of financial assets and other investments—not only buying and selling them. Management includes devising a short- or long-term strategy for acquiring and disposing of portfolio holdings. It can also include banking, budgeting, and tax services and duties, as well.”How ML and AI Can Benefit Investment Management?If we take one more look at the infographics above, we will discover that machine learning for investment management can be helpful with all of the core aspects of this process. Make new forms of data subjected to an accurate analysis. You can never be sure that you are taking into account all the information you know. In turn, AI is able to dig deeper and find invisible relationships that directly affect investment benefits.Decrease the influence of human biases in the decision-making process. AI has no emotions and is totally indifferent to which decision you will make. Its task is to only suggest a better deal with an unbiased look. Clarify the possible risks and opportunities. As we said, risk assessment is a competent machine learning advantage for investment management. Thanks to this opportunity, you will be able to make the soundest investment decisions.Make accurate predictions. Artificial intelligence for investment management may also be powered by a predictor which will allow you to get as accurate predictions as possible taking into account the real-time and historical data. Suggest the best decision being guided by certain parameters. For example, if you are looking for the opportunity to invest in real estate in a certain region, there are already two parameters the model may be guided by when looking for the best options. What Are the Main Types of Investing Strategies and How ML Can Be Useful for EachHere is how machine learning and artificial intelligence may work to make different investment strategies safe and beneficial. Strategy definitionThe way to apply ML and AIValue InvestingThis strategy means investing in undervalued but promising securities.ML and AI can search for such stocks using data analysis predictive abilities.Income InvestingThe purpose of this strategy is to get a constant flow of passive income. The task of AI and ML will be analyzing different markets and current trends with the goal of finding the most passive income promising deals. Growth InvestingThe goal of this strategy is to increase capital. The simplest example is a deposit with an interest capitalization option.An AI-powered system may analyze different options, calculate the possible capital increase for a given period, and suggest the best solution from all the available. Small-Cap InvestingThis is the strategy of investments in the stocks of the companies with a small market capitalization. AI and ML may search and suggest stocks from the most promising small-cap companies. Socially Responsible InvestingThis strategy suggests investing in green and/or socially promising projects.The ML model may research the current social trends to find out which projects are the most promising to invest in. ConclusionAs you can see, machine learning and artificial intelligence are quite promising for banking and finance, especially in an environment of increased risk and lack of guarantees, that is, in investment management and countering banking fraud. In 2021, you should focus on these challenges, and leverage fintech innovation to gain an additional edge as well.

They begin as strings of chemical compounds, before twisting and folding into three-dimensional shapes that define what they can do — and what they cannot.For biologists, identifying the precise shape of a protein often requires months, years or even decades of experimentation. It requires skill, intelligence and more than a little elbow grease.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Seattle, Microsoft and the field of artificial intelligence come in for their share of the spotlight in “Superintelligence” — an HBO Max movie starring Melissa McCarthy as the rom-com heroine, and comedian James Corden as the world’s new disembodied AI overlord.
But how much substance is there behind the spotlight? Although the action is set in Seattle, much of the principal filming was actually done in Georgia. And the scientific basis of the plot — which involves an AI trying to decide whether or not to destroy the planet — is, shall we say, debatable.
Fortunately, we have the perfect team to put “Superintelligence” to the test, as a set-in-Seattle movie as well as a guide to the capabilities of artificial intelligence.
The Seattle area is one of the world’s hottest AI hotspots, thanks to Microsoft, Amazon, the University of Washington, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and dozens of AI startups.
We enlisted Oren Etzioni — the CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI2 — and Carissa Schoenick, AI2’s senior program manager and communications director, to do a reality check on the movie’s depiction of AI. Kurt Schlosser, who covers the Geek Life beat at GeekWire, weighed in on the movie’s depiction of Seattle tech culture.

AI pros and cons
Right off the bat, Etzioni said Melissa McCarthy fans are likely to take a liking to “Superintelligence,” regardless of any AI faux pas.
“It’s always great to see her,” he said. “It’s actually fun for the whole family. My 10-year-old and my wife joined me, and so clearly that says something for it as a movie — although it’s not a classic masterpiece or as funny as when she was playing a James Bond character in ‘Spy.'”
“Superintelligence” goes heavy on the stereotypes — including the classic tale of rekindling romance with an old boyfriend, the high-tech situation room filled with world leaders, and hilarity from a hapless pair of FBI agents (one of whom is played by Ben Falcone, the film’s director and McCarthy’s husband).
Corden’s disembodied AI follows a stereotype as well, Etzioni said.
“The AI is omniscient and basically omnipotent, so long as it has internet, right?” he said. “There’s no real separation from the notion of highly intelligent and knowing every little fact about you, whereas we think of it at AI2 as very different things.”
In a way, the AI stereotype as portrayed in “Superintelligence” is “almost more pernicious than the Terminator,” Etzioni said: “The Terminator … you know it’s a monster, right? But here, it’s a comedy. It’s this guy’s voice, and of course, the AI knows everything. But that’s a stereotype.”
Previously at the movies: ‘Terminator’ is back — and AI experts do a reality check
Even though it’s lighthearted, “Superintelligence” comes with a scary premise, Schoenick said.
“The movie presents this AI as coming into existence suddenly, and it arrives with a built-in agenda of evaluating humanity for potential destruction,” she said. “That’s a pretty impossible, scary way to portray AI technology, though not uncommon in Hollywood.”
Schoenick noted that the AI could find its way into any device, ranging from a Tesla to a toaster, but couldn’t break in on the movie’s characters while they were working on secret plans to foil its scheme. “It’s exactly as powerful or not as it needs to be at any given point in the movie,” she said.
In one of Schoenick’s favorite over-the-top tech scenes, a Microsoft researcher points to the ups and downs of a worldwide neural network on a giant display screen. “I don’t think the audience would buy that as something that we could just dial up and say, ‘Oh, let me check the neural network activity today around the world. It’s really high, I wonder what that means?'” she said. “Also, why would Microsoft be the one coordinating the global response to a rogue AI?”
Etzioni said the movie gets at least one thing about AI right. “Emotions, interactions, the little contradictions that make us decide who to love and who not to love are very difficult for people to understand — and completely unfathomable for machines,” he said.
Etzioni noted that Yejin Choi, a researcher at UW and AI2, is working on a project that’s aimed at giving AI programs more common sense.
“We actually have benchmarks and metrics around social common sense, and it’s extremely opaque to a machine,” he said. “That’s the one part the movie really got right: Machines don’t ‘get it’ in that emotional sense.”
Seattle clips and slips
Like most movies that are ostensibly set in Seattle (such as Netflix’s recently released “Love, Guaranteed”), parts of “Superintelligence” were actually filmed somewhere else. Most of the Microsoft scenes were done at Georgia Tech, for example. In one such scene, a futuristic sculpture in Georgia Tech’s Clough Building takes center stage.
To be sure, there are the standard establishing shots of the Space Needle, the Monorail and other Seattle landmarks. “The first aerial zoom into a ‘tech office’ from Elliott Bay is actually the Zillow HQ or Russell Investments Center building,” Schlosser said.
There’s also the obligatory fish toss at Pike Place Market, although the filmmakers commit what Schlosser calls “the most egregious non-Seattleite mistake” by labeling it as Pike’s Place Market in a satellite-shot graphic. (We should note that we were watching a pre-release version of the movie, and there’s a chance that the graphic was corrected for final release.)

Sharp-eyed Seattleites might notice a couple of inconsistencies that outsiders would miss. For example, McCarthy moves into a Pioneer Square penthouse that seems to have a view of the Great Wheel and the Seattle waterfront — but that’s a perspective that could be seen in reality only from Pike Place Market, farther north.
Schlosser said “Superintelligence” capitalizes on the spirit of the Seattle startup scene when McCarthy’s character, named Carol Peters, looks for a job at a down-and-dirty matchmaking site called BaDunkaDunk.com  (Sorry, geeks, that domain name was taken three years ago.)
“BaDunkaDunk goes all in on normal startup cliches, including absurd beanbag furniture and the use of ‘we need a rock star’ when interviewing Carol,” he said.
Another Seattle twist has Carol and her old flame, played by Bobby Cannavale, meeting Ken Griffey Jr. at a Mariners game. The Mariners get almost as much of the spotlight as Microsoft. “At one point, Carol’s boyfriend offers a toast to ‘another Mariners victory,’ which we all know doesn’t happen very often,” Schlosser quipped.
At least one Seattle icon is missing, however. “Why is Microsoft still the go-to tech representation for the Seattle area, in an age when Amazon has risen to such prominence?” Schlosser asked. “I don’t think I saw any Amazon clues in the film.”
Final grades
We asked each of our reviewers to grade “Superintelligence” on an A-to-F academic scale, for pure entertainment and for science.

Etzioni: Hollywood’s depictions of AI — ranging from “Terminator” and “Westworld” to “Her” and “Ex Machina” — typically don’t come close to the mark, in Etzioni’s view. And “Superintelligence” is a typical AI movie. “It did get me to chuckle, and I love Melissa McCarthy regardless. As a movie, I would give it a B. As an AI depiction, I would give it a C-minus. The only reason I give it a C-minus is because I’m grading on the curve, and the other students didn’t do very well.”
Schoenick: C-minus for entertainment, F for science. “Suspend all your disbelief for this one, because pretty much nothing the AI does makes sense, and the buzzword usage is sloppy, too. They even misused the term ‘Turing Test,’ which is pretty unforgivable in a movie starring an AI.” Her recommendation for a far more realistic (albeit far less funny) AI movie: “The Social Dilemma” on Netflix.
Schlosser: “I have laughed quite a bit at Melissa McCarthy in other roles, including ‘Bridesmaids’ and on SNL, but I did not like this movie. I thought it was just loaded with clichés, weird references and out-of-touch stuff. So I give it a low C or a D. I’m glad I got to watch it for free while I was working.”
Boyle: C for entertainment — with the “C” standing for a common cable movie. D for the science — with the “D” standing for “Don’t you dare take it seriously.” And B for serving as a parlor game to spot Seattle tie-ins — with the “B” standing for BaDunkaDunk.

HBO Max has launched a “20 Days fo Kindness” campaign on behalf of “Superintelligence,” with HBO Max donating $20,000 to a different good cause daily for 20 days. AT&T helped kick things off with a $1 million contribution to Girls Who Code, and there’s a Prizeo charity sweepstakes as well.
