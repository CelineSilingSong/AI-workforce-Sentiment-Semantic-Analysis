Where and how will generative AI have its greatest business impact? There is no shortage of speculation and high hopes that AI will shorten innovation cycles, spur new ideas, write and check code, and relieve workers and executives alike of the drudgeries of manual tasks. It could go even deeper, adding the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually.


That’s the word from a recent report out of McKinsey, in which the co-authors observe that “all of us are at the beginning of a journey to understand generative AI’s power, reach, and capabilities.”

Generative AI, the McKinsey team notes, is very good at performing routine tasks, such as reorganizing and classifying data. That’s a logical step in automation. But generative AI opens new doors when it delivers creative output. This is new stuff, and “as a result, a broader set of stakeholders are grappling with generative AI’s impact on business and society but without much context to help them make sense of it.”

PROMOTED
The co-authors predict over the next several years, AI “will take us on a roller-coaster ride featuring fast-paced innovation and technological breakthroughs that force us to recalibrate our understanding of AI’s impact on our work and our lives,” the report states. Generative AI will transform roles and boost performance — especially across functions such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software development.

The transformation of work is where and how generative AI will deliver a lot of value. It will “change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities,” the McKinsey team says. “Current generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb 60 to 70 percent of employees’ time today.” This will likely occur over a period of two decades, they add.

This is a step up from McKinsey’s previous estimate that technology has the potential to automate half of work activities. “The acceleration in the potential for technical automation is largely due to generative AI’s increased ability to understand natural language,” which will help boost knowledge work.

Of course, as the McKinsey authors point out, future realities don’t always cooperate with futuristic technology predictions — and this is definitely the case with AI. “Technology adoption at scale does not occur overnight,” the co-authors caution. Even when a solution is developed, “it might not be economically feasible to use if its costs exceed those of human labor. Additionally, even if economic incentives for deployment exist, it takes time for adoption to spread across the global economy.”

The Generative AI Revolution: A Glimpse Into the Future of Work





										BY Bhaskar Chakravorti, Tufts University
•



July 04, 2023












The explosion of interest in artificial intelligence has drawn attention not only to the astonishing capacity of algorithms to mimic humans but to the reality that these algorithms could displace many humans in their jobs. The economic and societal consequences could be nothing short of dramatic.
The route to this economic transformation is through the workplace. A widely circulated Goldman Sachs study anticipates that about two-thirds of current occupations over the next decade could be affected, and a quarter to a half of the work people do now could be taken over by an algorithm. Up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected. The consulting firm McKinsey released its own study predicting an AI-powered boost of US$4.4 trillion to the global economy every year.
The implications of such gigantic numbers are sobering, but how reliable are these predictions?
I lead a research program called Digital Planet that studies the impact of digital technologies on lives and livelihoods around the world and how this impact changes over time. A look at how previous waves of such digital technologies as personal computers and the internet affected workers offers some insight into AI’s potential impact in the years to come. But if the history of the future of work is any guide, we should be prepared for some surprises.
The IT revolution and the productivity paradox
A key metric for tracking the consequences of technology on the economy is growth in worker productivity – defined as how much output of work an employee can generate per hour. This seemingly dry statistic matters to every working individual because it ties directly to how much a worker can expect to earn for every hour of work. Said another way, higher productivity is expected to lead to higher wages.
Generative AI products are capable of producing written, graphic, and audio content or software programs with minimal human involvement. Professions such as advertising, entertainment, and creative and analytical work could be among the first to feel the effects. Individuals in those fields may worry that companies will use generative AI to do jobs they once did, but economists see great potential to boost productivity of the workforce as a whole.
The Goldman Sachs study predicts productivity will grow by 1.5 percent per year because of the adoption of generative AI alone, which would be nearly double the rate from 2010 and 2018. McKinsey is even more aggressive, saying this technology and other forms of automation will usher in the “next productivity frontier,” pushing it as high as 3.3 percent a year by 2040.
That sort of productivity boost, which would approach rates of previous years, would be welcomed by both economists and, in theory, workers as well.
If we were to trace the 20th-century history of productivity growth in the U.S., it galloped along at about 3 percent annually from 1920 to 1970, lifting real wages and living standards. Interestingly, productivity growth slowed in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the introduction of computers and early digital technologies. This “productivity paradox” was famously captured in a comment from MIT economist Bob Solow: You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.

Digital technology skeptics blamed “unproductive” time spent on social media or shopping and argued that earlier transformations, such as the introductions of electricity or the internal combustion engine, had a bigger role in fundamentally altering the nature of work. Techno-optimists disagreed; they argued that new digital technologies needed time to translate into productivity growth because other complementary changes would need to evolve in parallel. Yet others worried that productivity measures were not adequate in capturing the value of computers.
For a while, it seemed that the optimists would be vindicated. In the second half of the 1990s, around the time the World Wide Web emerged, productivity growth in the U.S. doubled, from 1.5 percent per year in the first half of that decade to 3 percent in the second. Again, there were disagreements about what was really going on, further muddying the waters as to whether the paradox had been resolved. Some argued that, indeed, the investments in digital technologies were finally paying off, while an alternative view was that managerial and technological innovations in a few key industries were the main drivers.
Regardless of the explanation, just as mysteriously as it began, that late 1990s surge was short-lived. So despite massive corporate investment in computers and the internet – changes that transformed the workplace – how much the economy and workers’ wages benefited from technology remained uncertain.
Early 2000s: New slump, new hype, new hopes
While the start of the 21st century coincided with the bursting of the so-called dot-com bubble, the year 2007 was marked by the arrival of another technology revolution: the Apple iPhone, which consumers bought by the millions and which companies deployed in countless ways. Yet labor productivity growth started stalling again in the mid-2000s, ticking up briefly in 2009 during the Great Recession, only to return to a slump from 2010 to 2019.
Throughout this new slump, techno-optimists were anticipating new winds of change. AI and automation were becoming all the rage and were expected to transform work and worker productivity. Beyond traditional industrial automation, drones, and advanced robots, capital and talent were pouring into many would-be game-changing technologies, including autonomous vehicles, automated checkouts in grocery stores, and even pizza-making robots. AI and automation were projected to push productivity growth above 2 percent annually in a decade, up from the 2010-2014 lows of 0.4 percent.
But before we could get there and gauge how these new technologies would ripple through the workplace, a new surprise hit: the COVID-19 pandemic.
The pandemic productivity push – then bust
Devastating as the pandemic was, worker productivity surged after it began in 2020; output per hour worked globally hit 4.9 percent, the highest recorded since data has been available.
Much of this steep rise was facilitated by technology: larger knowledge-intensive companies – inherently the more productive ones – switched to remote work, maintaining continuity through digital technologies such as videoconferencing and communications technologies such as Slack, and saving on commuting time and focusing on well-being.
While it was clear digital technologies helped boost productivity of knowledge workers, there was an accelerated shift to greater automation in many other sectors, as workers had to remain home for their own safety and comply with lockdowns. Companies in industries ranging from meat processing to operations in restaurants, retail, and hospitality invested in automation, such as robots and automated order-processing and customer service, which helped boost their productivity.
But then there was yet another turn in the journey along the technology landscape.
The 2020-2021 surge in investments in the tech sector collapsed, as did the hype about autonomous vehicles and pizza-making robots. Other frothy promises, such as the metaverse’s revolutionizing remote work or training, also seemed to fade into the background.
In parallel, with little warning, “generative AI” burst onto the scene, with an even more direct potential to enhance productivity while affecting jobs – at massive scale. The hype cycle around new technology restarted.
Looking ahead: Social factors on technology’s arc
Given the number of plot twists thus far, what might we expect from here on out? Here are four issues for consideration.
First, the future of work is about more than just raw numbers of workers, the technical tools they use, or the work they do; one should consider how AI affects factors such as workplace diversity and social inequities, which in turn have a profound impact on economic opportunity and workplace culture.
For example, while the broad shift toward remote work could help promote diversity with more flexible hiring, I see the increasing use of AI as likely to have the opposite effect. Black and Hispanic workers are overrepresented in the 30 occupations with the highest exposure to automation and underrepresented in the 30 occupations with the lowest exposure. While AI might help workers get more done in less time, and this increased productivity could increase wages of those employed, it could lead to a severe loss of wages for those whose jobs are displaced. A 2021 paper found that wage inequality tended to increase the most in countries in which companies already relied a lot on robots and that were quick to adopt the latest robotic technologies.
Second, as the post-COVID-19 workplace seeks a balance between in-person and remote working, the effects on productivity – and opinions on the subject – will remain uncertain and fluid. A 2022 study showed improved efficiencies for remote work as companies and employees grew more comfortable with work-from-home arrangements, but according to a separate 2023 study, managers and employees disagree about the impact: The former believe that remote working reduces productivity, while employees believe the opposite.
Third, society’s reaction to the spread of generative AI could greatly affect its course and ultimate impact. Analyses suggest that generative AI can boost worker productivity on specific jobs – for example, one 2023 study found the staggered introduction of a generative AI-based conversational assistant increased productivity of customer service personnel by 14 percent. Yet there are already growing calls to consider generative AI’s most severe risks and to take them seriously. On top of that, recognition of the astronomical computing and environmental costs of generative AI could limit its development and use.
Finally, given how wrong economists and other experts have been in the past, it is safe to say that many of today’s predictions about AI technology’s impact on work and worker productivity will prove to be wrong as well. Numbers such as 300 million jobs affected or $4.4 trillion annual boosts to the global economy are eye-catching, yet I think people tend to give them greater credibility than warranted.
Also, “jobs affected” does not mean jobs lost; it could mean jobs augmented or even a transition to new jobs. It is best to use the analyses, such as Goldman’s or McKinsey’s, to spark our imaginations about the plausible scenarios about the future of work and of workers. It’s better, in my view, to then proactively brainstorm the many factors that could affect which one actually comes to pass, look for early warning signs and prepare accordingly.
The history of the future of work has been full of surprises; don’t be shocked if tomorrow’s technologies are equally confounding.

	Many U.S. entertainment industry workers have strong concerns about if and how generative AI technology will affect their role, company, industry and broader cultural environment, according to an exclusive Variety Intelligence Platform survey conducted by YouGov.

	Over a third (36%) of entertainment workers surveyed in late June were “very” or “somewhat concerned” about the impact gen AI will have on their own jobs. For context, respondent awareness of gen AI is high, with 87% at least aware of tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney, while two-thirds (65%) claim some knowledge of the technology (explored in depth in the recent VIP+ special report Generative AI & Entertainment).






	Among generative AI’s possible negative outcomes for the industry, the majority of professionals were either “very” or “somewhat” concerned about IP infringement across copyright, trademark and right of publicity; job losses due to employers’ use of gen AI; and cybersecurity and data privacy.




	Equally damning, 43% believe the use of generative AI will hurt the quality of the entertainment industry’s creative output, in contrast to 16% who feel it would improve.




	This industry moment is particularly fraught as gen AI’s rise coincides with expiring union contracts and negotiations with the studios, as the WGA, DGA and SAG-AFTRA each respectively demand new contract language that provides clarity, protections and restrictions on the use of generative AI regarding employment terms with writers, directors and actors.

Writers Guild of America: Nine weeks since their previous contract expired, striking WGA writers remain at a standstill with studios on their particular AI demands.

Directors Guild of America: The DGA ratified its new contract June 23, taking effect July 1. The agreement provides some guidance on AI, stating it isn’t a “person,” can’t take over ordinary duties of directors, and that studios can’t use AI without consulting directors.

SAG-AFTRA: The union and the AMPTP extended their current contract to July 12 to allow more time for negotiations. On June 5, guild actors had voted 98% in favor of authorizing a strike if both sides failed to reach an acceptable deal. On June 27, the actors sent an internal letter to union leaders, with over 1,000 signatures including many A-listers, demanding that the negotiations protect actor likenesses and ensure actors are compensated when any of their past work is used to train AI.

	Given the pace of change, a multiyear contract that lays out studios’ permitted AI use in vague or noncomprehensive terms seems likely to age quickly or lose any protective value it might’ve held. 

	Driving some concerns are the number of unknowns surrounding gen AI’s future capabilities, legality and use or misuse. As AI models rapidly improve, so will AI software’s capabilities to produce material at human-level creative skill.

	The future capabilities of generative AI, and when they will reach certain competency levels, are hard to predict. But there is clear and mounting evidence that gen AI is already effective for some uses.

	Asked to select various creative tasks they believed gen AI will be able to accomplish effectively in the next two to three years, entertainment workers were most likely to identify ones these tools are now demonstrably capable of, if not currently used in practice or trial already, including creating realistic sound effects for film, TV or games (58% of workers); autocompleting code to assist game programming (54%); and developing artwork for film, TV or game storyboards (52%).




	Notably, AI still has many flaws and reasons to forestall industry use, including for studios — not least of which includes murkiness around intellectual property law as it pertains to AI training data (input) and generated material (output). But that’s not exactly stopping companies across creative industries in the business of content from contemplating just how these tools might help them create new kinds of efficiencies.

	Of course, not all generative AI uses in the industry need be wholesale disenfranchising for human creatives. Indeed, some presumably stand to benefit human workers in certain roles, such as by automating rote or time-consuming manual VFX tasks to be able to deliver high-quality work faster.

	Entertainment workers are starting to use gen AI tools or expect they or their company will. Nearly a third (30%) of U.S. entertainment industry professionals workers said they, their team or their company are either currently using gen AI (13%) or planned to (17%).




	Some AI misuses impacting industry workers will take legal or regulatory fixes to address and shield against, likely requiring a complicated years-long effort as lawsuits are waged and legal and regulatory frameworks strive to catch up to the technology globally.

	But robust union protections will be a meaningful, likely first, line of defense against damage or labor unfairness that could result from studio employers’ or workplace uses of AI.

AI and the automation of work
ChatGPT and generative AI will change how we work, but how different is 
this to all the other waves of automation of the last 200 years? What does 
it mean for employment? Disruption? Coal consumption?



Pretty much everyone in tech agrees that generative AI, Large Language Models and ChatGPT are a generational change in what we can do with software, and in what we can automate with software. There isn’t much agreement on anything else about LLMs - indeed, we’re still working out what the arguments are - but everyone agrees there’s a lot more automation coming, and entirely new kinds of automation. Automation means jobs, and people. This is also happening very fast: ChatGPT has (apparently) over 100m users after just six months, and this data from Productiv suggests it’s already a top-dozen ‘shadow IT’ app. So, how many jobs is this going to take, how fast, and can there be new jobs to replace them?

We should start by remembering that we’ve been automating work for 200 years. Every time we go through a wave of automation, whole classes of jobs go away, but new classes of jobs get created. There is frictional pain and dislocation in that process, and sometimes the new jobs go to different people in different places, but over time the total number of jobs doesn’t go down, and we have all become more prosperous.

US Census, 1930





When this is happening to your own generation, it seems natural to worry that this time, there aren’t going to be those new jobs. We can see the jobs that are going away, but we can’t predict what the new jobs will be, and often they don’t exist yet. We know (or should know), empirically, that there always have been those new jobs in the past, and that they weren’t predictable either: no-one in 1800 would have predicted that in 1900 a million Americans would work on ‘railways’ and no-one in 1900 would have predicted ‘video post-production’ or ‘software engineer’ as employment categories. But it seems insufficient to take it on faith that this will happen now just because it always has in the past. How do you know it will happen this time? Is this different?At this point, any first-year economics student will tell us that this is answered by, amongst other things, the ‘Lump of Labour’ fallacy. The Lump of Labour fallacy is the misconception that there is a fixed amount of work to be done, and that if some work is taken by a machine then there will be less work for people. But if it becomes cheaper to use a machine to make, say, a pair of shoes, then the shoes are cheaper, more people can buy shoes and they have more money to spend on other things besides, and we discover new things we need or want, and new jobs. The efficiency gain isn’t confined to the shoe: generally, it ripples outward through the economy and creates new prosperity and new jobs. So, we don’t know what the new jobs will be, but we have a model that says, not just that there always have been new jobs, but why that is inherent in the process. Don’t worry about AI!The most fundamental challenge to this model today, I think, is to say that no, what’s really been happening for the last 200 years of automation is that we’ve been moving up the scale of human capability.

‘Barge haulers on the Volga’, Ilya Repin, 1870-73. (Note the steam boat on the horizon.)





We began with humans as beasts of burden and moved up: we automated legs, then arms, then fingers, and now brains. We went from farm work to blue-collar work to white-collar work, and now we’ll automate the white-collar work as well and there’ll be nothing left. Factories were replaced by call centres, but if we automate the call centres, what else is there? Here, I think it’s useful to look at another piece of economic and tech history: the Jevons Paradox. In the 19th century the British navy ran on coal. Britain had a lot of coal (it was the Saudi Arabia of the steam age) but people worried what would happen when the coal ran out. Ah, said the engineers: don’t worry, because steam engines keep getting more efficient, so we’ll use less coal. No, said Jevons: if we make steam engines more efficient, then they will be cheaper to run, and we will use more of them and use them for new and different things, and so we will use more coal. Innovation can connect to price elasticity. We’ve been applying the Jevons Paradox to white collar work for 150 years.

It’s hard to imagine jobs of the future that don’t exist yet, but it’s also hard to imagine some of the jobs of the past that have already been automated away. Gogol’s downtrodden clerks in 1830s St Petersburg spent their entire adult lives copying out documents, one at a time, by hand. They were human Xeroxes. By the 1880s, typewriters produced perfect text at twice the words-per-minute, and carbons gave half-a-dozen free copies as well. Typewriters meant a clerk could produce more than 10 times the output. A few decades later, adding machines from companies like Burroughs did the same for book-keeping and accounting: instead of adding up columns with a pen, the machine does it for you, five time faster, with no mistakes. What did that do to clerical employment? People hired far more clerks. Automation plus the Jevons Paradox meant more jobs. If one clerk with a machine can do the work of 10, then you might have fewer clerks, but you might also do far more with them. If, Jevons tells us, it becomes much cheaper and more efficient to do something, you might do more of it - you might do more analysis or manage more inventory. You might build a different and more efficient business that is only possible because you can automate its administration with typewriters and adding machines. This process keeps repeating. This is Jack Lemmon as CC Baxter in The Apartment in 1960, using an electro-mechanical adding machine from Friden fifty years after adding machines were new and exciting. 













Everyone in that shot is a cell in a spreadsheet, and the whole building is a spreadsheet. Once a week someone on the top floor presses F9 and they recalculate. But they already had computers, and in 1965 or 1970 they bought a mainframe, and scrapped all the adding machines. Did white collar employment collapse? Or, as IBM advertised, did a computer give you 150 extra engineers? 25 years later, what did the PC revolution, and the accounting department in a box, do to accounting?

Dan Bricklin invented the computer spreadsheet in 1979: until then, ‘spreadsheets’ were paper (you can still buy them on Amazon). He has some entertaining stories about early use: ‘People would tell me, “I was doing all this work, and coworkers thought I was amazing. But I was really goofing off because it only took an hour and then I took the the rest of the day off. People thought I was a wunderkind but I was using this tool.”’ So, what did Excel and the PC do to accounting employment? It went up.

40 years later, do spreadsheets mean you can goof off early? Not really.  

Younger people may not believe this but before spreadsheets investment bankers worked really long hours. It's only thanks to Excel that Goldman Sachs associates can get everything done and leave the office at 3pm on Fridays. Now LLMs mean they'll only have to work one day a week!— Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) May 5, 2023


New technology generally makes it cheaper and easier to do something, but that might mean you do the same with fewer people, or you might do much more with the same people. It also tends to mean that you change what you do. To begin with, we make the new tool fit the old way of working, but over time, we change how we work to fit the tool. When CC Baxter’s company bought a mainframe, they began by automating the way they already did things, but over time, new ways to run the business became possible. So, all of this is to say that by default, we should expect LLMs to destroy, displace, create, accelerate and multiply jobs just as SAP, Excel, Mainframes or typewriters did. It’s just more automation. The machine lets a person do 10x the work, but you need the person. I think there are two counter-arguments to this. The first is to say that yes, perhaps this is indeed just more of the same kind of change that we saw with the internet, PCs or computers, and perhaps again it will have no long-term effect on net employment, but this time it will happen much faster, and so that frictional pain will be much greater and it will be much harder to adjust. LLMs and ChatGPT certainly are happening a lot faster than things like iPhones or the Internet, or indeed PCs. The Apple II shipped in 1977, the IBM PC in 1981 and the Mac in 1984, but it took until the early 1990s before  there were 100m PCs in use: there are 100m ChatGPT users today after just six months. You don’t need to wait for telcos to build broadband networks, or consumers to buy new devices, and generative AI sits on top of the whole existing stack of cloud, distributed computing and indeed a lot of the machine learning stack itself that was built over the last decade. To a user, it’s just a website.However, your expectations might be different if you think about the implications of these charts, from Productiv again and from Okta (with a different methodology). They report that their typical customer now has hundreds of different software applications, and enterprise customers have almost 500.

And yet, enterprise cloud adoption is still barely a quarter of workflows.

What does that mean for generative AI in the workplace? Whatever you think will happen, it will take years, not weeks. The tools that people use to do their jobs, and the tasks that might now get a new layer of automation, are complicated and very specialised, and embody a lot of work and institutional knowledge. A lot of people are experimenting with ChatGPT, and seeing what it will do. If you’re reading this, you probably have too. That doesn’t mean that ChatGPT has replaced their existing workflows yet, and replacing or automating any of those tools and tasks is not trivial. There’s a huge difference between an amazing demo of a transformative technology and something that a big complicated company holding other people’s business can use. You can rarely go to a law firm and sell them an API key to GCP’s translation or sentiment analysis: you need to wrap it in control, security, versioning, management, client privilege and a whole bunch of other things that only legal software companies know about (there’s a graveyard of machine learning companies that learnt this in the last decade). Companies generally can’t buy ‘technology’.  Everlaw doesn’t sell translation and People.ai doesn’t sell sentiment analysis - they sell tools and products, and often the AI is only one part of that. I don’t think a text prompt, a ‘go’ button and a black-box, general purpose text generation engine make up a product, and product takes time.  Meanwhile, buying tools that manage big complicated things takes time even once the tool is built and has product-market fit. One of the most basic challenges in building an enterprise software startup is that startups run on an 18 month funding cycle and a lot of enterprises run on an 18 month decision cycle. SaaS itself accelerated this because you don’t need to get into the enterprise datacenter deployment schedule, but you still need purchase, integration and training, and companies with millions of customers and tens or hundreds of thousands of employees have very good reasons not to change things suddenly. The future takes a while, and the world outside Silicon Valley is complicated. The second counter-argument is that part of the paradigm shift of ChatGPT and LLMs is a shift in the layer of abstraction: this looks like a much more general purpose technology. Indeed, that’s why it’s exciting. It can answer anything, we are told. So, you could look at that chart of 473 enterprise SaaS apps and say that ChatGPT will disrupt that and collapse many those vertical apps into one prompt box. That would mean it would move faster, and also automate much more. I think that misunderstands the problem. If a partner at a law firm wants a first draft of a paper, they want to be able to shape the parameters in completely different ways to a salesperson at an insurance company challenging a claim, probably with a different training set and certainly with a bunch of different tooling. Excel is ‘general purpose’ too, and so is SQL, but how many different kinds of ‘database’ are there? This is one reason I think the future of LLMs is to move from prompt boxes to GUIs and buttons - I think ‘prompt engineering’ and ‘natural language’ are mutually contradictory. But either way, even if you can run everything as a thin wrapper on top of one giant foundational model (and there is very little agreement or clarity about this yet), even those wrappers will take time.Indeed, while one could suggest that LLMs will subsume many apps on one axis, I think it’s equally likely that they will enable a whole new wave of unbundling on other axes, as startups peel off dozens more use cases from Word, Salesforce and SAP, and build a whole bunch more big companies by solving problems that no-one had realised were problems until LLMs let you solve them. That’s the process that explains why big companies already have 400 SaaS apps today, after all. More fundamental, of course, there is the error rate. ChatGPT can try to answer ‘anything’ but the answer might be wrong. People call this hallucinations, making things up, lying or bullshitting - it’s the ‘overconfident undergraduate’ problem. I think these are all unhelpful framings: I think the best way to understand this is that when you type something into a prompt, you’re not actually asking it to answer a question at all. Rather, you’re asking it “what sort of answers would people be likely to produce to questions that look like this?” You’re asking it to match a pattern. Hence, if I ask ChatGPT4 to write a biography of myself, and then ask it again, it gives different answers. It suggests I went to Cambridge, Oxford or the LSE; my first job was in equity research, consulting or financial journalism. These are always the right pattern: it’s the right kind of university and the right kind of job (it never says MIT and then catering management). It is giving 100% correct answers to the question “what kinds of degrees and jobs are people like Benedict likely to have done?” It’s not doing a database lookup: it’s making a pattern. You can see something similar in this image I got from MidJourney. The prompt was “A photograph of advertising people discussing creativity on stage in a panel on a beach at Cannes Lions.”













It’s matched the pattern almost perfectly - that looks like the beach at Cannes, these people are dressed like advertising people, and they even have the right haircuts. But it doesn’t know anything, and so it doesn’t know that people never have three legs, only that it’s unlikely. This isn’t ‘lying’ or ‘making things up’ - it’s matching a pattern, imperfectly. Whatever you call it, if you don’t understand this, you can get into trouble, as happened to this unfortunate lawyer, who did not understand that when he asked for precedents, he was actually asking for things that looked like precedents. He duly got things that looked like precedents, but weren’t. It’s not a database. If you do understand this, then you have to ask, well, where are LLMs useful? Where is it useful to have automated undergraduates, or automated interns, who can repeat a pattern, that you might have to check? The last wave of machine learning gave you infinite interns who could read anything for you, but you had to check, and now we have infinite interns that can write anything for you, but you have to check. So where is it useful to have infinite interns? Ask Dan Bricklin - we’re back to the Jevons Paradox. This takes me, obviously, to AGI. The really fundamental objection to everything I’ve just said is to ask what would happen if we had a system that didn’t have an error rate, didn’t hallucinate, and really could do anything that people can do. If we had that, then you might not have one accountant using Excel to get the output of ten accountants: you might just have the machine. This time, it really would be be different. Where previous waves of automation meant one person could do more, now you don’t need the person.  Like a lot of AGI questions, though, this can become circular if you’re not careful. ‘If we had a machine that could do anything people do, without any of these limitations, could it do anything people can do, without these limitations?’Well, indeed, and if so we might have bigger problems than middle-class employment, but is that close? You can spend weeks of your life watching three hour YouTube videos of computer scientists arguing about this, and conclude only that they don’t really know either. You might also suggest that the idea this one magic piece of software will change everything, and override all the complexity of real people, real companies and the real economy, and can now be deployed in weeks instead of years, sounds like classic tech solutionism, but turned from utopia to dystopia. As an analyst, though, I tend to prefer Hume’s empiricism over Descartes - I can only analyse what we can know. We don’t have AGI, and without that, we have only another wave of automation, and we don’t seem to have any a priori reason why this must be more or less painful than all the others.

Generative AI is potentially the most transformative new technology since the introduction of the public internet, and it already has many exciting applications within enterprise service management (ESM). AI is known for enabling intelligent chatbots, predictive capabilities in ticket management, and the ability to identify emerging service issues long before they become problems. Generative AI promises an entirely new level of innovation. 
With generative AI, ESM platforms could not only understand the context of a user request in natural language but also comb through multiple knowledge bases to provide much more than links to information. Generative AI could deliver a clear solution that summarizes the most relevant and current information across multiple languages.
In fact, it could go well beyond simply providing information — it could automate the solution. If numerous employees are logging tickets about problems logging into the VPN, HelixGPT can analyze that data, determine a restart of the VPN is required, and kick that process off automatically. And regarding those knowledge bases, generative AI could automate much of their maintenance, eliminating outdated content and incorporating new information.
Despite the intense hype around ChatGPT, that instance of large language model (LLM) technology would not be appropriate for enterprise use. One of the biggest challenges with ChatGPT is controlling its output. Organizations want to make sure that the generative AI properly understands the tasks at hand to prevent incorrect responses and limit “hallucinations” or false information.
BMC Software addresses these limitations with HelixGPT, which enables the world described above through AI Service Management. LLMs like ChatGPT are built from publicly available knowledge, but enterprises operate within a specific domain and need generative AI to prioritize enterprise knowledge over world knowledge. Each company, for example, has its own policy for employee password renewal, making it difficult to nail down a universal standard.
Additionally, BMC enables HelixGPT to tune itself to enterprise-specific information with additional layers that prevent hallucinations. Of course, HelixGPT will not be limited to enterprise-specific information — if the query requires outside, public information, it will be able to draw on it.
“When it comes to generative AI and ESM, we see the potential for innovations everywhere,” said Ajoy Kumar, Chief AI Scientist, Service Management at BMC Software. “Users will see better search, better answers, and a more human-like virtual agent. And they won’t just get pointers to solutions. HelixGPT will provide action.”

Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which refers to the ability of artificial intelligence to create content and make decisions on its own, is having a significant impact on talent management. Susan Gunn and John Hazan, leaders of the Bain Chief People Officer Forum, recently conducted a session with chief human resource officers (CHROs) and chief people officers (CPOs) from different parts of the world to discuss this influence. Here is a summary of their conversation:
Recent developments in generative AI
We can attribute the rapid advancement of generative AI to recent breakthroughs, such as improved performance of graphic processing units (GPUs), new model designs, and the availability of large public data sets. In the future, generative AI will go beyond producing content and will be capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting independently in various situations. Organizations that actively engage with and embrace these emerging capabilities will have a strong advantage in achieving exceptional organizational performance and success.
According to a recent poll by Bain, 80% of CHROs agreed that generative AI has the potential to revolutionize talent management practices. However, there is a wide range of attitudes toward investing in generative AI. About 61% of respondents are neutral or unlikely to invest in the near future, while 39% report that they are likely to invest. This diversity of opinions indicates the need for further education and exploration of the opportunities and challenges that generative AI presents in the field of talent management.
Generative AI’s impact on talent
Generative AI’s versatile capabilities will potentially affect numerous aspects of talent and have a significant impact on white-collar jobs. We believe that the impact on talent practices can be grouped into three categories: job design, HR practices and jobs, and talent management practices.
Automation of repetitive tasks and the enhancement of human capabilities by generative AI may lead to more efficient and fulfilling roles for employees. However, it will also replace certain jobs, improve others, and create new ones, such as AI researchers and software engineers. Organizations will have the opportunity to completely rethink their operations and reshape their team structures, focusing more on cross-functional collaboration and agile work models.
With the integration of generative AI into various talent processes and tasks, new roles will emerge within HR practices. HR professionals will need to actively engage with and embrace the capabilities of this technology to stay ahead and utilize insights, predict trends, and make data-driven decisions. This will require them to become more strategic and proactive.
Generative AI offers significant opportunities to enhance the employee experience throughout the stages of their journey. By providing personalized and contextually relevant solutions, organizations can create a more engaging and growth-oriented work environment that fosters talent and drives success. With the potential to revolutionize talent management practices, generative AI can create employee copilots to provide personalized career paths. These sample prompts demonstrate how generative AI can be used as part of each phase of an employee’s development:

Onboarding: “Create a syllabus for me of useful materials to get up to speed.”
Engagement: “Which colleagues would be useful connections for me?”
Growth: “Identify available career opportunities in line with my development plan.”
Recognition: “Propose a team activity to celebrate our latest milestone.”
Support: “Suggest interesting benefits and wellness activities within the company.”
Transition: ""Recommend resources to help me prepare for my next move.""

Ensuring responsible use of generative AI and establishing governance
Assessing and managing the ethical risks associated with AI use can be addressed by developing guidelines and best practices to identify ethical dilemmas and make certain that generative AI aligns with organizational values and societal norms. Adherence to data privacy regulations, such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is necessary to maintain security and privacy standards and to protect the personal and sensitive data processed by AI systems. 
To fully harness the potential of generative AI in talent management, it is essential to establish a strong governance framework. Clear explanations of how AI systems work, make decisions, and derive insights, as well as defining who holds responsibility for AI’s actions, will provide transparency and accountability. Auditing AI algorithms, training data sets, and use cases can create a foundation from which to develop and implement strategies to minimize biases in AI models and decisions. Ensuring that the data used to train and refine AI models is accurate, representative, and up to date will also help to minimize bias while guaranteeing reliable and effective AI outcomes.
The chief people officer’s role in generative AI governance
The CPO will play a pivotal role in the ethical and responsible deployment of generative AI. They will contribute to the development of governance frameworks, promote transparency and fairness, and foster a culture of responsible AI use within the organization. Collaboration with other stakeholders and ongoing monitoring will be essential to effectively navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by generative AI in talent management.
The CPO will provide leadership and guidance to HR practitioners, ensuring generative AI’s appropriate and effective use within the HR function and among stakeholders. This includes planning for the future workforce, identifying new and important roles that may emerge due to generative AI, and assessing the impact on existing jobs. The CPO will also be responsible for providing employees the necessary development opportunities so they can adapt to their roles’ changing demands in the context of generative AI.

LamasDr. Lamas, a contributing Opinion writer, is a pulmonary and critical-care physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.When faced with a particularly tough question on rounds during my intern year, I would run straight to the bathroom. There, I would flip through the medical reference book I carried in my pocket, find the answer and return to the group, ready to respond.At the time, I believed that my job was to memorize, to know the most arcane of medical eponyms by heart. Surely an excellent clinician would not need to consult a book or a computer to diagnose a patient. Or so I thought then.Not even two decades later, we find ourselves at the dawn of what many believe to be a new era in medicine, one in which artificial intelligence promises to write our notes, to communicate with patients, to offer diagnoses. The potential is dazzling. But as these systems improve and are integrated into our practice in the coming years, we will face complicated questions: Where does specialized expertise live? If the thought process to arrive at a diagnosis can be done by a computer “co-pilot,” how does that change the practice of medicine, for doctors and for patients?Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Read 853 CommentsShare full article853Read in appAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTComments 853There’s One Hard Question My Fellow Doctors and I Will Need to Answer SoonSkip to CommentsThe comments section is closed.

",,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/global/logo-black.png'}",https://www.adweek.com/media/go-media-has-begun-using-ai-to-generate-content/,"Publisher G/O Media began using generative artificial intelligence to create editorial content on Wednesday, according to an internal memo seen by Adweek, making the company the latest in a growing list of publishers experimenting with the tech.



In an email shared with staff last week, editorial director Merrill Brown described the venture as a limited trial, which will produce only a handful of stories for the publishers AV Club, Gizmodo, The Takeout and Deadspin.



The company bills the technology as a means of generating the kinds of content its staff disliked producing in the first place, such as a rote list of the best sandwiches in every state. At least initially, the articles will not appear on sites’ home pages and are primarily intended to net search traffic.



One early product of the technology, an article titled A Chronological List of Star Wars Movies &amp; TV Shows published on tech website Gizmodo on Wednesday, received immediate criticism from its deputy editor, James Whitbrook, on Twitter.



One Year After Removing Its Paywall, Quartz’s Traffic Continues to Drop



The article, whose byline attributes the piece to Gizmodo Bot, contained a number of factual errors, such as messing up the chronology of the franchise.



“This is an early, modest test,” Brown said in the memo. “These will all be designed to complement our journalism and give our editorial teams new tools to serve our audiences.”



A representative for G/O Media confirmed the trial, though they wouldn't share specifics on the volume of content generated or whether any editorial roles will be impacted.&nbsp;



The GMG Union issued a response condemning the use of generative AI.



""The hard work of journalists cannot be replaced by unreliable AI programs notorious for creating falsehoods and plagiarizing the work of writers,"" the union said in a statement.



The experiment comes as the media industry attempts to reckon with the transformative potential of AI.

After launch of ChatGPT, swift reappraisal by investors

Generative artificial intelligence like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, not only generates text, images and code, but it also has the power to transform company valuations — rapidly, dramatically and in ways both predictable and surprising.
NVDA data by YCharts
Nvidia, maker of chips to power AI, gained 150% since ChatGPT’s release on Nov. 30, 2022. Meta, Facebook’s parent, came out of its long slump and rose 142%. Other big tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Apple gained, too. Even Google’s parent Alphabet, initially considered a potential loser from the spread of generative AI, joined the party, as did Tesla. Combined, these huge market-cap stocks have pulled the overall market up against strong economic headwinds.

In a working paper, UCLA Anderson’s Andrea L. Eisfeldt and Gregor Schubert and USC’s Miao Ben Zhang establish a measure of generative AI exposure across industries and firms, based on the mix of occupations held by each firm’s workforce, and then measured firm-level market reaction since the launch of ChapGPT. Portfolios based on their work outperformed by 9% in the initial four months following the ChatGPT debut. 
The researchers suggest that ChatGPT has had a large, positive effect on the firms most exposed to generative AI and that firms with the highest generative A. exposure scores outperform those with the lowest scores with an excess return of more than 0.4% per day in the two weeks following ChatGPT’s release.
Who Is at Risk?
The researchers propose that firms that score higher for exposure to generative AI are able to use AI to help their employees accomplish tasks faster. This allows them to save on costs and increase their free cash flow. 
One surprising finding was that the jobs most impacted are not the routine, monotonous tasks that past innovations in information technology affected, but those performing nonroutine, mentally challenging tasks. Examples are analyzing problems, recognizing patterns and drawing inferences, comprehending text, etc. As expected, jobs involving manual labor are the least impacted while tasks requiring communication between people fall somewhere in the middle. The table below shows the researchers’ calculated exposure scores for jobs with the highest and lowest exposures to generative AI.

In terms of industry sectors, the table below shows those most and least exposed to generative AI.

The researchers found that, in general, jobs with higher salaries are more exposed to AI. 

As a result, some larger firms are seeing the ranks of workers dwindle. On May 2, 2023, IBM announced it would stop hiring for 7,800 back-office roles that could be replaced by AI. This represents 30% of IBM’s back-office jobs. 
Schubert, from the research team, believes that such announcements will be an ongoing trend in the future. “A large impact will be on freelancing via platforms and international business service outsourcing, so the employment impact at big U.S. companies might be muted in the beginning,” Schubert suggests in an email exchange. He believes much of this will take place in the form of slower employment growth in some occupations, as firms simply stop replacing employees as they leave, rather than firing existing employees — but there is also a potential for accelerated employment growth in occupations that complement the new technologies.
Given this news, perhaps it makes sense that IBM ranked as the firm most exposed to generative AI when the researchers calculated exposure scores for each firm listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Below are the 15 firms with the highest exposure scores and the 15 with the lowest scores. 

Using ChatGPT to Research ChatGPT
Deriving the generative AI exposure scores began with a monstrous data task made a bit simpler by employing ChatGPT to do some of the work. The O*NET database, which lists jobs by their standard occupational classification as assigned by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, was the first stop for data. Job titles in the database are broken down by the tasks performed by that occupation. The researchers used ChatGPT to label these job tasks. The labels indicated whether ChatGPT or a future version of the software would be able to perform the tasks. With these labels, a final score for a job’s exposure to generative AI was produced based on the number of its tasks that could be handled by ChatGPT. 
The next step was to add firm-level and industry-level exposure scores using the job-level scores just calculated. For this, the researchers turned to Revelio Labs, which gathers data from employee profiles on LinkedIn and through other resources. This information enabled the researchers to see all of the job titles that make up the workforce at a particular firm. They gathered this data for each firm listed on the NYSE. Once they had the breakdown of jobs at a particular firm, they were able to map the job-level scores they previously calculated to those jobs and develop a score for the entire firm. The data was rolled up one more level by using the firm scores to also calculate industry-level scores.
The measure of firm-level generative AI exposure captures the relative degree to which tasks in a firm can be made more productive by advances in large language models. The researchers believe they are the first to develop such a measure with a focus on firms.
Eisfeldt, Schubert and Zhang tested their measures of firm AI exposure by examining 2023 earnings call transcripts. They contend they found a strong relationship between firms with high exposure scores and those discussing the topic of AI more frequently. In fact, they suggest that a 10 percentage point increase in generative AI exposure is associated with a 7.6 percentage point increase in the likelihood of mentioning the generative AI topic. This positive relationship held even when IT-related firms were removed from the data.
Buy the Winners, Short the Losers
With the generative AI exposure scores in place, the researchers sought to document the changes in valuation for firms after ChatGPT was released using daily stock returns from Nov.  15, 2022, to March 31, 2023.
Firms were sorted in order of their generative AI exposure and then broken into five equal value-weighted groups, or quintiles. The researchers looked at the performance of each quintile but were especially interested in the quintiles holding the firms with the highest and lowest exposures. 
A portfolio called “Artificial Minus Human” was created by buying the firms in the quintile with the highest exposure and selling short (making a bet they will go lower) the firms in the lowest exposure quintile, after adjusting each portfolio’s returns for its sensitivity to overall market returns. The returns of the AMH portfolio represented the difference in returns between the firms with the highest and lowest AI exposures. This portfolio had a 9.4% return from ChatGPT’s release to March 31, 2023.
Similarly, within-industry and industry-neutral portfolios were created. All firms were grouped by their respective industries, then sorted by AI exposure scores and grouped into five equal value-weighted quintiles within each industry. Next, the returns of the quintiles of the within-industry portfolios were market-capitalization-weighted and averaged across the industries to form the industry-neutral portfolios. This created portfolios that were useful for seeing the difference in AI’s impact on firms with high or low exposure levels relative to other firms in the same industry. Below, the industry-neutral portfolios and the AMH portfolio excess returns are shown for the two weeks following ChatGPT’s debut and over the Nov. 15, 2022, to March 31, 2023, period.
There were some sizable differences in performance even in these “industry-neutral” portfolios. The high exposure quintiles had excess returns up to more than 0.4% per day and the lowest exposure quintiles had excess returns as low as -0.25% per day. These differences illustrate that AI can have quite a difference in impact on firm valuations given the makeup of their workforce.

The ChatGPT announcement was a major shock, the researchers believe. Then reaction cooled. And more recently, as seen in the stock chart atop this article, investors again bid up company shares based on AI exposure.
Some Highly Exposed Companies Could be in Trouble
Within some industries, firms highly exposed to AI significantly outperform the returns of firms with low exposure to AI. These industries include: 

finance, 
manufacturing, 
administrative support and 
waste management



On the other hand, in the real estate, rental and leasing industries, highly exposed firms significantly underperform firms with lower exposures. This negative effect suggests that incumbent firms could be displaced by new entrants using generative AI.
What Might Dull the Impact of Generative AI?
Previous technology advances, such as the personal computer and the internet, held out the hope of big productivity leaps and then disappointed. Eisfeldt, Schubert and Zhang note that events could transpire that would change the course, or hamper the progress, of valuations of firms highly exposed to generative AI. Fears about the potential creation of artificial general intelligence  or privacy laws could cause government regulation that would halt or slow the productivity potential of AI.
Additionally, there’s the fact that generative AI models sometimes produce nonfactual statements, and firms will likely need to keep humans in the loop to control its outputs. This will dilute some of the cost savings from employing AI. And in the short run, companies might also need to spend on retooling and infrastructure in order to employ AI. This too may limit near-term gains for these firms.

(This article is part of a series on Artificial Intelligence for Board Members and Senior Executives.)


A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that generative AI like ChatGPT can increase workforce productivity by an average of 14%. Some companies are already reporting productivity increases of up to 400% as a result of generative AI. And Mckinsey says that Generative AI could add up to $4.4 trillion worth of output annually.

As a C-level manager or board director, you want your company to take advantage of this potential. But how? Where are the biggest opportunities to do more with less, reduce costs, and boost profit?

PROMOTED
In other words—What should you do with all that productivity?

Here’s how you can take advantage of the productivity benefits of AI now, without a multi-year project and tens of millions of dollars of investment:

Artificial Intelligence is Already Displacing Human Jobs
According to Goldman Sachs research, two of every three American occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI. Worldwide, 300 million jobs may be eligible for replacement in part or in whole by automation, potentially saving employers trillions of dollars.
That is not something that will come years down the road. A recent Challenger job report revealed that 3,900 jobs were eliminated by artificial intelligence in May, 2023. IBM froze hiring in the same period for 7,800 jobs it said could be replaced in AI in the coming years. And British Telecom announced that more than 10% of its team would be replaced by AI before 2030. (See “Using AI For Layoffs: 5 Benefits For Decision Making”)

While the productivity advantages differ for every organization, there are four key areas in most large companies where you can expect to see immediate disruption:
1. Customer operations:

Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE
McKinsey predicts that generative AI has the potential to increase productivity in customer care by as much as 45%. Much of that gain comes from the ability of AI to understand customer intent and sentiment, and give personnel—even new trainees—the information they need to resolve problems quickly. It can also offload low-level customer service demands to chatbots that are far more functional and human-like than ever before. That not only translates into better service provision, it also results in teams who feel less overwhelmed and therefore more cheerful and loyal. Some of the players leading the charge here are Qualtrics, Ultimate.ai, and Intercom.
2. Sales & Marketing:
Generative AI can analyze prospect behavior so that sales and marketing teams can optimize their strategic approach far more efficiently than ever before. But because of the specialized abilities of the technology, generative AI can also help create customized emails, social media posts, advertising artwork, product descriptions, landing pages, and so much more. Even small marketing and sales operations can now easily customize and personalize their efforts. Shortly after ChatGPT went live, Microsoft and Salesforce respectively introduced Viva Sales and Einstein GPT which put generative AI to work in sales. Phrasee, Persado, and Albert are just a few of the many solutions that are putting generative AI to work in digital marketing.
3. Software Development:
88% of software coders report increased productivity when using generative AI. The technology can execute repetitive tasks like inserting boilerplate code snippets. It can review human-generated code for bugs and security flaws. And it can create software documentation, eliminating the need for a human coder to spend time on what is considered a low-level task. GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, and Snyk are just a few of the many solutions that have emerged to increase productivity in software development
4. Research & Development:
A list of ways that generative AI can help in the wide-ranging field of R&D would consume the entirety of this article. From drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry to information analysis in virtually any research field, to industrial design in manufacturing, generative AI is a true game changer. (See How AI is Bringing back American Manufacturing)
Here’s how you can boost your productivity with generative AI
That just scratches the surface of how AI is already changing the productivity game in business. But from a business management point of view, how can you align your organization to get moving?
1. Adopt and adapt—now:
Assume that your competitors are using generative AI right now. You need to get on board before they are so far ahead that you can’t catch up. (See The AI Threat: Winner Takes All.) Assume that your own team is experimenting with generative AI as well, whether it is part of your formal strategy or not. When human beings see a way to get their jobs done more easily, with less work—they take advantage of it. So you need to lean in and decide where, how, and when you want to implement this technology. Rapid adoption and adaptation is the name of the game.
2. Keep a human in the loop:
While it may be tempting to believe that you can simply offload work to generative AI, given the technology’s impressive performance, that would be a mistake. While integrating this technology, you should always retain “adult supervision” to make sure that the output meets the quality standards and brand image of your organization. Whether it is marketing content, product design, or software code, output needs to have a human review to ensure accuracy, avoid bias and other ethical issues, and spot other problems that only humans can understand today.
3. Engage with your team:
In response to the productivity boost afforded by generative AI, you may choose to let people go or make fewer new hires. However, you may also discover that your customers expect more from you than ever before, and that you need every available body to help increase output. Either way, you must take a hard look at your organizational chart and immediately engage with your team on this subject. Instead of having people worry about losing their jobs, help them to adapt. Some roles will be eliminated, others will expand, while still others will remain unaffected. Communicate with your team, let them know what is expected of them, support them with retraining and change management. And make sure that old and new teams alike are ready to embrace generative AI as a copilot.
4. Lead from the top
The CEO, the senior executive team, and the board of directors can not be on the trailing end of this change. The changes that generative AI is driving within your organization and industry will make the last decade of digital transformation look positively quaint. You need to lead your organization’s internal AI revolution. That does not mean that every senior executive needs to become an expert in AI themselves. However, they do need to champion its use and become very adept at implementing it throughout the organization.
If you care about how AI is determining the winners and losers in business, how you can leverage AI for the benefit of your organization, and how you can manage AI risk, I encourage you to stay tuned.

         — 
    


            Many have raised alarms about the potential for artificial intelligence to displace jobs in the years ahead, but it’s already causing upheaval in one industry where workers once seemed invincible: tech.
    

            A small but growing number of tech firms have cited AI as a reason for laying off workers and rethinking new hires in recent months, as Silicon Valley races to adapt to rapid advances in the technology being developed in its own backyard. 
    

            Chegg, an education technology company, disclosed in a regulatory filing last month that it was cutting 4% of its workforce, or about 80 employees, “to better position the Company to execute against its AI strategy and to create long-term, sustainable value for its students and investors.”

            IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in an interview with Bloomberg in May that the company expects to pause hiring for roles it thinks could be replaced with AI in the coming years. (In a subsequent interview with Barrons, however, Krishna said that he felt his earlier comments were taken out of context and stressed that “AI is going to create more jobs than it takes away.”)

            And in late April, file-storage service Dropbox said that it was cutting about 16% of its workforce, or about 500 people, also citing AI.

Forget about the AI apocalypse. The real dangers are already here




            In its most-recent layoffs report, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said 3,900 people were laid off in May due to AI, marking its first time breaking out job cuts based on that factor. All of those cuts occurred in the tech sector, according to the firm.
    

            With these moves, Silicon Valley may not only be leading the charge in developing AI but also offering an early glimpse into how businesses may adapt to those tools. Rather than render entire skill sets obsolete overnight, as some might fear, the more immediate impact of a new crop of AI tools appears to be forcing companies to shift resources to better take advantage of the technology — and placing a premium on workers with AI expertise.
    

            “Over the last few months, AI has captured the world’s collective imagination, expanding the potential market for our next generation of AI-powered products more rapidly than any of us could have anticipated,” Dropbox CEO Drew Houston wrote in a note to staff announcing the job cuts. “Our next stage of growth requires a different mix of skill sets, particularly in AI and early-stage product development.” 
    

            In response to a request for comment on how its realignment around AI is playing out, Dropbox directed CNN to its careers page, where it is currently hiring for multiple roles focused on “New AI Initiatives.”
    

            Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School, told CNN that AI “will cause organizations to restructure,” but also doesn’t see it playing out as machines replacing humans just yet.

            “AI, as far as I see it, doesn’t necessarily replace humans, but rather enhances the work of humans,” Wang said. “I think that the kind of competition that we all should be thinking more about is that human specialists will be replaced by human specialists who can take advantage of AI tools.”
    

        A tale of two Silicon Valleys


            The AI-driven tech layoffs come amid broader cuts in the industry. Many tech companies have been readjusting to an uncertain economic environment and waning levels of demand for digital services more than three years into the pandemic.
    

            Some 212,294 workers in the tech industry have been laid off in 2023 alone, according to data tracked by Layoffs.fyi, already surpassing the 164,709 recorded in 2022. 
    

            But in the shadow of those mass layoffs, the tech industry has also been gripped by an AI fervor and invested heavily in AI talent and tech. 
    

            In January, just days after Microsoft announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees as part of broader cost-cutting measures, the company also confirmed it was making a “multibillion dollar” investment into OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. And in March, in the same letter to staff Mark Zuckerberg used to announce plans to lay off another 10,000 workers (after cutting 11,000 positions last November), the Meta CEO also outlined plans for investing heavily in AI.
    

            Even software engineers in Silicon Valley who once seemed uniquely in demand now appear to be at risk of losing their jobs, or losing out on salary gains to those with more AI expertise. 
    

            Roger Lee, a startup founder who has been tracking tech industry layoffs via his website Layoffs.fyi, also runs Comprehensive.io, which examines job listings and compensation data across some 3,000 tech companies. 
    

            Lee told CNN that a recent analysis of data from Comprehensive.io shows the average salary for a senior software engineer specializing in artificial intelligence or machine learning is 12% higher than for those who don’t specialize in that area, a data point he dubs “the AI premium.” The average salary for a senior software engineer specializing in AI or machine learning has also increased by some 4% since the beginning of the year, whereas the average salary for senior software engineers as a whole has stayed flat, he said.
    

            Lee noted Dropbox as an example of a company offering notably high pay for AI roles, citing a base salary listing of $276,300 to $373,800 for a Principal Machine Learning Engineer role. (By comparison, Comprehensive.io’s data puts the current average salary for a senior software engineer at $171,895.)
    

            Those looking to thrive in the tech industry and beyond may need to brush up on their AI skills.
    

            Wang, the professor at Columbia Business School, told CNN that starting this past spring semester, he began requiring his students to familiarize themselves with the new crop of generative AI tools on the market. “That type of exposure I think is absolutely critical for setting themselves up for success and once they graduate,” Wang said.
    

            It’s not that everyone needs to become AI specialists, Wang added, but rather that workers should know how to use AI tools to become more efficient at whatever they’re doing. 
    

            “That’s where the kind of a battleground for talent is really shifting,” Wang said, “as differentiation in terms of talent comes from creative and effective ways to integrate AI into daily tasks.”

Rather than render entire skill sets obsolete overnight, as some might fear, the more immediate impact of a new crop of AI tools appears to be forcing companies to shift resources to better take advantage of the technology — and placing a premium on workers with AI expertise. “Over the last few months, AI has captured the world’s collective imagination, expanding the potential market for our next generation of AI-powered products more rapidly than any of us could have anticipated,” Dropbox CEO Drew Houston wrote in a note to staff announcing the job cuts. “Our next stage of growth requires a different mix of skill sets, particularly in AI and early-stage product development.”  In response to a request for comment on how its realignment around AI is playing out, Dropbox directed CNN to its careers page, where it is currently hiring for multiple roles focused on “New AI Initiatives.” Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School, told CNN that AI “will cause organizations to restructure,” but also doesn’t see it playing out as machines replacing humans just yet. “AI, as far as I see it, doesn’t necessarily replace humans, but rather enhances the work of humans,” Wang said. “I think that the kind of competition that we all should be thinking more about is that human specialists will be replaced by human specialists who can take advantage of AI tools.” A tale of two Silicon Valleys The AI-driven tech layoffs come amid broader cuts in the industry. Many tech companies have been readjusting to an uncertain economic environment and waning levels of demand for digital services more than three years into the pandemic. Some 212,294 workers in the tech industry have been laid off in 2023 alone, according to data tracked by Layoffs.fyi, already surpassing the 164,709 recorded in 2022.  But in the shadow of those mass layoffs, the tech industry has also been gripped by an AI fervor and invested heavily in AI talent and tech.  In January, just days after Microsoft announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees as part of broader cost-cutting measures, the company also confirmed it was making a “multibillion dollar” investment into OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. And in March, in the same letter to staff Mark Zuckerberg used to announce plans to lay off another 10,000 workers (after cutting 11,000 positions last November), the Meta CEO also outlined plans for investing heavily in AI. Even software engineers in Silicon Valley who once seemed uniquely in demand now appear to be at risk of losing their jobs, or losing out on salary gains to those with more AI expertise.  Roger Lee, a startup founder who has been tracking tech industry layoffs via his website Layoffs.fyi, also runs Comprehensive.io, which examines job listings and compensation data across some 3,000 tech companies.  Lee told CNN that a recent analysis of data from Comprehensive.io shows the average salary for a senior software engineer specializing in artificial intelligence or machine learning is 12% higher than for those who don’t specialize in that area, a data point he dubs “the AI premium.” The average salary for a senior software engineer specializing in AI or machine learning has also increased by some 4% since the beginning of the year, whereas the average salary for senior software engineers as a whole has stayed flat, he said. Lee noted Dropbox as an example of a company offering notably high pay for AI roles, citing a base salary listing of $276,300 to $373,800 for a Principal Machine Learning Engineer role. (By comparison, Comprehensive.io’s data puts the current average salary for a senior software engineer at $171,895.) Those looking to thrive in the tech industry and beyond may need to brush up on their AI skills. Wang, the professor at Columbia Business School, told CNN that starting this past spring semester, he began requiring his students to familiarize themselves with the new crop of generative AI tools on the market. “That type of exposure I think is absolutely critical for setting themselves up for success and once they graduate,” Wang said. It’s not that everyone needs to become AI specialists, Wang added, but rather that workers should know how to use AI tools to become more efficient at whatever they’re doing.  “That’s where the kind of a battleground for talent is really shifting,” Wang said, “as differentiation in terms of talent comes from creative and effective ways to integrate AI into daily tasks.”","{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.article__content'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,1020.0,,,,https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230703141339-ai-tech-layoffs-stock-restricted.jpg?c=original,P0Y0M0DT0H4M32S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Will artificial intelligence replace physicians?

Andrew Wilner, MD



Tech




      July 6, 2023    





ShareTweetShareA recent Goldman Sachs report determined that artificial intelligence (AI) may wipe out 300 million jobs. Jobs that require advanced education, like mine, are particularly vulnerable. This isn’t welcome news for those of us who have invested a lifetime mastering our crafts and must work for a living.
Until recently, the primary goal of medical students has been to master the science of medicine. Students spend thousands of hours learning anatomy, biochemistry, histology, pathology, pharmacology, physiology, and much more. That knowledge is essential for the effective practice of medicine.

However, AI can memorize and regurgitate facts faster and more accurately than any student. Even a lifetime of study can’t compete with AI’s gigabytes of memory and archives of algorithms. Artificial intelligence will win memory contests every time. Now that AI is here, medical students must focus more than ever on the art of medicine.
An expert weighs in





For an upcoming podcast episode, I asked AI expert Manuj Aggarwal whether I would lose my job. Is it really time to buff up my LinkedIn profile?
A magnificent tool





Manuj’s answer was reassuring. AI will perform the grunt work that consumes much of the current patient/physician encounter. Artificial intelligence will summarize medical records, codify comorbidities, quantify adherence, compare therapeutic options, highlight medication side effects, calculate drug dosages, estimate treatment risk-benefit ratios, and provide prognosis-all in the blink of an eye. Artificial intelligence can already accomplish all these tasks.
I can easily imagine AI performing delicate brain tumor surgery with robotic arms. To follow up, AI prescribes the latest combination of evidence-based chemotherapy and radiation at appropriate doses for the patient’s body mass index, liver and renal function. AI calculates the patient’s 5-year survival based on the tumor’s pathological grade, molecular genetics, and the patient’s overall health. To conclude, AI summarizes its work and prints out a detailed bill complete with ICD-10 codes. Neurosurgeons would still direct therapy, but expert AI assistants would do the heavy lifting.
Harnessed properly, AI could free up time for physicians to develop deeper relationships with their patients. Physicians could enjoy greater job satisfaction, and patients would benefit from improved outcomes.
Limitations of artificial intelligence





For all its wonder, AI suffers from limitations. For example, I recently followed instructions from my car’s navigation system (a rudimentary form of AI) for the shortest route to my destination. The AI worked fine, but recent construction had transformed the preferred road into a dead-end street. A missed software update on my GPS is one thing, but out-of-date information could be catastrophic during a neurosurgical procedure.
Further, AI cannot apply the art of medicine to an individual patient. Can AI parse a patient’s responses to separate fact from fiction? Can AI ask the right question in the right way at the right time? Can AI distinguish what patients want from what they really need? Can AI approach each patient in a culturally sensitive way? Can AI navigate a patient’s fear? Perhaps someday AI will accomplish all of these tasks but not today and probably never.
Physicians must form a “therapeutic alliance” with each patient to obtain optimal results. The key to such a relationship is trust. No matter how sophisticated, a silicon chip is less likely to inspire confidence than a warm handshake and eye contact with a fellow human being. A human physician has another attribute AI can probably never achieve: compassion.





Conclusion
As AI integrates into routine medical care, it may replace health care providers who rush patient encounters and rely only on diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms. After all, algorithms are AI’s specialty. However, those who care for each patient with compassion, insight, and respect will never need to look for another job. Artificial intelligence can’t compete with physicians who practice the art of medicine.

The fear is that this transition could temporarily reverse the trend and potentially impede further advancements.While AI adoption may result in job losses for some, it also presents numerous new employment opportunities for everyone. The gender disparities highlighted in the study can be attributed to the varying composition of professions. Is AI putting your job at risk? (credit: PEXELS)Office-based jobs, which are more easily replaceable by AI systems, are predominantly held by women. In contrast, occupations involving physical tasks are less susceptible to automation. Although women&#x27;s representation in these fields has increased in recent years, they still remain largely male-dominated.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of working women aged 25 to 54 in the United States had reached a historic high of 77%. However, the outbreak and subsequent layoffs disproportionately affected women, leading to a decline in their share to 73.5%.While there has been a partial recovery since then, the rise of AI now threatens to hinder progress once again.

New York employers must now tell applicants when they encounter AI

AI job interviews becoming more common 











AI job interviews are becoming more common. Here's how to ace them.
05:02

Starting today, job-hunters in New York City will be let in on a formerly hidden part of the application process, learning whether — and how — artificial intelligence is being used to make hiring decisions. The city's automated employment decision tools law, enacted in 2021 and scheduled to be enforced beginning July 5, positions New York City as a leader in regulating the use of AI in hiring. Other cities and states expected to gradually follow suit. The narrowly tailored law is designed to offset potential misuses of AI in ways that could substantially affect workers' livelihoods. Specifically, it requires companies that lean on AI tools to make hiring decisions to disclose this fact to candidates. It also mandates that employers conduct annual third-party ""bias audits"" of the technology or software they use, in order to make public the ways in which the AI could be discriminating against certain types of candidates.  






""If in fact the employers are using an automated employment decision tool (AEDT), then the employer has to commission an independent audit, publish a summary, tell applicants and employees they're using it, and give applicants the opportunity to have an accommodation and pursue an alternative selection process,"" Domenique Camacho Moran, an employment attorney at Farrell Fritz, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""We are only talking about those tools that take the place of human people making decisions.""Amazon is using AI to summarize customer product reviewsFather of ChatGPT: AI could ""go quite wrong""The audits are meant to keep tabs on sometimes-controversial tools that companies themselves don't always understand. AI screening tools can save companies time — but automated decision-making has also been criticized for replicating stereotypes and disadvantaging women and people of color in some contexts.


""That's the risk in all of this, that left unchecked, humans sometimes can't even explain what data points the algorithm is picking up on. That's what was largely behind this legislation,"" said John Hausknecht, a professor of human resources at Cornell University's school of Industrial and Labor Relations. ""It's saying let's track it, collect data, analyze it and report it, so over time, we can make changes to the regulations.""But if potential hires don't like being judged by AI, their ability to opt out is limited. The law specifies that, while an AI screening disclosure ""must include instructions for how an individual can request an alternative selection process or a reasonable accommodation under other laws, if available,"" the hiring company isn't required to actually use a different screening process.

Replacing human decisionsThe law penalizes firms that fail to comply with it. First violations are subject to a $500 fine, with subsequent offenses carrying up to $1,500 fines.Importantly, the scope of the law is very narrow. 


""It's the very first law that's specifically calling out automated decision employment tools and regulating those specifically,"" Littler Mendelson employment attorney Niloy Ray told CBS MoneyWatch. ""This is narrowly focused on the use of AI in hiring or promoting employees but not any other employment lifecycle decisions.Just using an AI tool isn't enough to mandate disclosure: It must have a direct effect on hiring outcomes in order for the law to apply.""We are only talking about those tools that take the place of humans making decisions,"" Camacho Moran said. ""If you have an AI tool that runs through 1,000 applications and says, 'these are the top 20 candidates,' that is clearly a tool that falls within the definition of an AEDT.""She continued, ""if, on the other hand, the AI is designed to put people into buckets, like these candidates have relevant experience, these have relevant education – pick your criteria – that's not a tool that would fall within the AEDT definition.""In other words, if the AI flags candidates with relevant experience, but a human being views all of the applications and remains the ultimate decision-maker, the law likely wouldn't apply, according to Camacho Moran.

A hurdle for small businesses? Some critics of the law argue that its punitive nature — and the requirement of a bias audit — is burdensome, particularly to small and midsize employers experimenting with using AI to streamline and improve hiring processes. ""This requirement just adds one more cost to the process of hiring and promoting within New York City and it is a cumbersome one,"" said Ray, of Littler Mendelson. ""So it creates a certain amount of risk of somehow not complying because it wasn't crystal clear what you needed to do to comply and certainly there's the cost of compliance.""   


For one, Society of Human Resource Management chief of staff and head of public affairs Emily M. Dickens, objects to the fines. ""It was a good faith attempt to try to assign some regulatory guardrails around the issue that could impact some people adversely if it's not used correctly,"" she said. ""But we should assume good intent until we see something very egregious. It's the first law of its kind and is likely to be replicated in other jurisdictions and you don't want to start with penalizing people for trying to do the right thing.""She supports the responsible use of AI in hiring processes given that many employers still struggle to recruit diverse workforces and that qualified candidates have fallen through the cracks under the human-centric approach.""This process has been human-run for many years and we still have not solved the problem of creating more inclusive workplaces or accessing different talent and meeting the needs of firms struggling to find talent,"" Dickens said. ""We need guardrails but we don't need overregulation at the cost of workforce innovation.""

But it’s just a small piece of how AI is transforming hiring processes.Since November 2022, AI chatbot ChatGPT has enabled anyone with internet access to generate anything in the written form: think intricate essays and code, succinct memos or poetry. Even with basic prompts, ChatGPT can complete complex, written tasks in moments, and work as a creative tool to quickly produce efficient content.“I’ve had students use ChatGPT to write appeals for parking tickets,” says Vince Miller, reader in sociology and cultural studies at the University of Kent, UK. “But in general, the technology allows people who may not necessarily possess the best writing skills to suddenly have them.”Jobseekers are among those reporting such benefits. Leveraging a dataset containing 570 billion individual words, OpenAI’s ChatGPT can compose convincing cover letters on demand, or synthesise a few career details into a competent, bullet-pointed CV. Want to send an email to a hiring manager? Prompt the chatbot, then copy and paste the AI-generated text straight into the message.But hiring managers aren’t oblivious: they understand candidates are already leaning on generative AI to assist them, and may well do so even more as the technology grows in sophistication. This could create a shift in job applications as we know them, moving recruiters away from the traditional modes of evaluating candidates.Not all recruiters report the use of generative AI as a hiring red flag – or even a worrying development at all.Getty ImagesAI could create a shift in job applications as we know them, moving recruiters away from the traditional modes of evaluating candidates (Credit: Getty Images)Adam Nicoll, group marketing director at recruitment and job-consulting firm Randstad, based in Luton, UK, says time-poor hiring managers may be unlikely to distinguish between a cover letter written by a candidate and one generated by AI. “The language generated by ChatGPT reads clean, if formulaic. Compared to most cover letter writing, there are no idiosyncrasies; there are no red flags, but no personality,” he says.Despite this, he says he wouldn’t necessarily consider this cheating the hiring process. “It’s helping those who aren’t the best at writing and editing in producing a neat summary of career highlights. It’s the digitised version of asking a friend to review your CV.”Nicoll says that recruiters have already been relying less on traditional modes of evaluating candidates, anyway. “The cover letter has been on its way out for years: hiring managers skim read a resume for less than 10 seconds, let alone read a 200-word personal statement. At best, the cover letter is a box-ticking exercise that accompanies the CV – it’s virtually obsolete.”Instead, Nicoll says recruiters increasingly prefer viewing a candidate’s social media and LinkedIn profile to understand their personality instead. And as more candidates use generative AI to compose their written materials, he adds the importance of these application elements is becoming even more irrelevant. “If anyone can artificially enhance their pitching email to a hiring manager, then it becomes redundant,” says University of Kent’s Miller. As more candidates use generative AI to compose their written materials, the importance of these application elements is becoming even more irrelevantExperts say standard hiring processes may change as a result.For instance, since generative AI can create pre-interview presentations, employers may introduce harder assessments in response. “The onus is to test and evaluate what the machines can’t do,” says Miller. “While generative AI can arrange data in an interesting way, it’s not particularly creative – it can only work with what already exists. So, that could mean assessments demanding more creative and abstract thought from the candidate.”Additionally, there could be a greater emphasis on scrutinising candidates in face-to-face settings, says Brooke Weddle, partner at consulting firm McKinsey & Company, based in Washington, DC. “As opposed to cover letters, which typically convey little information critical to the actual hiring decision, employers look hard at cultural fit and soft skills during the interview process.” Furthermore, some recruiters are already embracing new AI tools on their side of the job hiring process. For instance, some large corporations are leveraging AI in the recruitment process to test job seekers’ qualities through skill- and personality assessments, which use data-driven behavioural insights to match candidates against vacancies and reveal their soft skills. These kinds of emerging platforms that give recruiters more data on candidates stand to change the job-application process, too, especially as “we move from degree certifications to skills-based hiring”, says Weddle. And this may be just the beginning of big changes to come.How we workFeatures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are valid concerns about using generative AI at work. But it's helpful to consider how it can empower our human potential.
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how we work.
According to a Fishbowl by Glassdoor survey, by late January 2023, 43 percent of professionals were using AI tools such as ChatGPT, a popular generative AI technology, for work-related tasks. Fifty-seven percent of employees who've used ChatGPT at work report that it boosts their productivity, according to a TalentLMS survey. From an HR standpoint, the market for generative AI is expected to be worth over $1.5 billion by 2032.
It's not hard to understand why generative AI is having an impact. Some of today's most popular generative AI tools are free, user-friendly and easy to access. Any HR practitioner or employee with an internet connection can use them to complete tasks, be more creative and satiate their curiosity. But along with the productivity and educational benefits generative AI offers, concerns have arisen, especially in the workplace.

Summer Dress Codes: Employers' Rights and Responsibilities


Before we dive in, let's define our terms.
What is generative AI?
According to the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), generative AI creates content, including text, images, audio or video, when prompted by a user. Generative AI tools generate responses using algorithms often trained on open-source information, such as text and images from the internet. These systems are not cognitive and do not possess human judgment.
""Generative AI is the next phase in data, AI and machine learning coming together,"" says Jack Berkowitz, chief data officer, ADP. ""It's based on this model that can predict the next word. It almost feels like magic.""
For today's employees and HR practitioners, this means getting used to having generative AI as a coworker.
Generative AI as a coworker
You might be wondering: What's it like having generative AI as a coworker? You may know the answer if you've used generative AI at work. Still, for those who don't know, it's like having a knowledgeable and articulate personal assistant, albeit one who might say dubious and offensive things.
""It's like the coworker who knows a lot, who you're pretty sure is smarter than you are, but who also tends to get really unfocused and has the potential to say things that might be a bit off — so you need to keep watch,"" says Helena Almeida, vice president, managing counsel, ADP. ""You have to make sure you're using it in the right way, but it's a great help.""
Empowering human potential
There are valid concerns about generative AI and its impact on the workplace and labor market. But it's also helpful to consider how generative AI can empower human potential at work today.
For example, generative AI can help HR practitioners and employees be more creative.
""We all have ways that we think about issues and problems. Generative AI has the potential to help us break through our own thinking about things and open up creativity around how we solve problems at work,"" Almeida says.
It can also help all employees, HR practitioners included, realize their potential and do more.
""Lots of people talk about the risks,"" says Jason Albert, global chief privacy officer, ADP. ""It has risks, but its ability to help people succeed and achieve more, that's what I'm really excited about.""
In other words, generative AI is a technology created by people that can ultimately be designed for people.
""Our role at ADP is to help companies flourish and help their employees flourish,"" Albert says. ""That's where this goes over time: making the technology better for people.""
Bias in AI remains a workplace problem
According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), it is illegal to discriminate against an applicant or employee because of their race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. These requirements aren't newsworthy, and many business leaders, HR practitioners and employees understand them. What remains newsworthy, however, is AI's potential to perpetuate — or mitigate — discrimination in hiring and employment decisions.
Bottom line: Discrimination is illegal, regardless of whether a human or system discriminates.
""There are concerns that if AI 'sees' that the last five successful candidates were white men, then it will 'learn' that a successful candidate is a white man,"" Almeida says. ""The advantage we have at ADP when we're talking about an AI algorithm is that we have data scientists focused on what data is going into the algorithms that are going to evaluate candidates. How do we monitor the algorithms to make sure the AI's not learning what we don't want it to learn? There are always steps being taken to make sure this bias doesn't seep in. When we're talking about AI, we have advantages that help us be better and make better decisions about bias.""
AI's potential for reducing workplace bias
While AI may lead to discriminatory outcomes, it may also help reduce them.
""Not only can we focus on AI from a data input, quality and monitoring standpoint, but AI can also help drive down bias because it can take the information and check for these things in a way that is harder to do for humans because we're fallible,"" Albert says.
AI can even help with discriminatory practices like pay inequity.
""Already behind the scenes of what makes ADP's pay equity technology work is a lot of AI,"" Berkowitz says. ""Instead of having to go and trundle through a bunch of information, you get simple questions and answers. AI is lifting our learnings about pay equity to make them more understandable.""
Despite AI's efficiency and benefits, monitoring for discriminatory practices should remain the responsibility of a human.
""Whether in recruiting or anything else, the person should always be in control. The locus of control should be the person, not the AI,"" Berkowitz says. ""AI's an advisor, but still, it's your decision. It's up to you to decide how you want to take its recommendation and use it. Being focused on that partnership is the essential point. We don't want to take control away from the person.""
How will generative AI change the workplace?
Generative AI has already changed the workplace. It helps HR practitioners and employees be smarter, more productive and more creative every day. But its evolution isn't finished. For example, it will get better at assisting HR practitioners and employees with tasks.
""We're going to see it go in a couple of interesting paths next,"" Albert says. ""There will be these levels of automation associated with it that none of us can really anticipate today, this notion of not only recommending a trip but booking that trip, of notifying your hotel that you're going to be late, of rebooking your rental car, of booking a dinner at an airport. These types of things will happen automatically. I'm excited about that.""
Personalization will also increase.
""When you use one of these models, they're stunning, but they're also generic,"" Albert says. There's this area of prompt engineering where you write a long request, but you get what you want. There's going to be growth in this area. The answers you get will be more specific to you. It's the personalization that will really take charge here.""
Generative AI at work: Guardrails, transparency
As AI evolves, new opportunities arise, but so does the potential for unintended consequences. These new tools must be used in a way that is ethical, secure and compliant. Organizations are already developing guidelines to ensure interactions with generative AI tools are done with security and privacy guardrails in place.
""With new technologies like generative AI, people aren't going to use it if they don't trust it,"" Almeida says. ""Making sure that the product is compliant will give people the trust they need to feel comfortable using the product. All of that is education. Part of that trust will come from educating people on all the steps companies are taking to protect their data and to make sure the AI is working as it should.""
The immediate solution? Enlist the help of a trusted partner.
""It's important to work with a vendor that enables you to meet your compliance obligations in this area,"" Berkowitz says. ""At ADP, we've added a human loop into our process, which means a human is ensuring high data quality and checking the output the AI generates.""
ADP has also adopted rigorous principles and processes to govern its use of generative AI and AI in general.

It is incredibly rare for any emerging technology to achieve these levels of adoption and frequency of usage so rapidly,” said Paul Lee, a Deloitte partner.The Deloitte survey of 4,150 UK adults found that just over half of the population had heard of generative AI, with around one in 10 respondents – the equivalent of approximately four million people – using it for work.ChatGPT became a sensation due to its ability to generate human-seeming responses to a range of queries in different styles, producing articles, essays, jokes, poetry and job applications in response to text prompts.It has been followed by Microsoft’s Bing chatbot, which is based on the same system as ChatGPT, Google’s Bard chatbot and, this week, Claude 2 from US firm Anthropic.Image generators have also taken off, exemplified by a realistic-looking picture of Pope Francis in a puffer jacket, produced by US startup Midjourney.However the ability of such systems to mass produce convincing text, image and even voice at scale has led to warnings that they could become tools for creating large-scale disinformation campaigns.The Deloitte survey found that of those who had used generative AI, more than four out of 10 believe it always produces factually correct answers. One of the biggest flaws in generative AI systems so far is that they are prone to producing glaring factual errors.“Generative AI technology is, however, still relatively nascent, with user interfaces, regulatory environment, legal status and accuracy still a work in progress,” said Lee.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatbotsChatGPTComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveNancy Pelosi endorses Kamala Harris for Democratic nomination as support for vice-president grows – livePilot, 26, dies as her plane crashes after skydiving flight over Niagara FallsBen Jennings on Joe Biden endorsing Kamala Harris – cartoonYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

I predicted that cloud providers would see a rise in demand for their services in 2024, given the push to use generative AI and the amount of resources (and money) this technology takes to operate. Now mainstream publications are also making this call, and we can all agree that generative AI will grow, and thus cloud computing will too. Simple math.
Like any change in a market, some will take advantage of the new opportunities, and some will be left behind. Recently, I’ve been getting many questions about what the workforce supporting cloud-powered generative AI will look like. More importantly, how can you take personal advantage?
Let’s explore some new roles that will likely emerge and how you can position yourself to serve in them.











 
 
 
AI cloud architect
Professionals specializing in designing and optimizing cloud architectures to support generative AI workloads will be in huge demand. How do I know? We don’t have enough cloud architects as is, and the mistakes occurring because of the lack of knowledge are starting to take their toll.

Companies will need trained, experienced cloud architects who understand how AI systems work and play well with existing cloud-based systems. If you’re interested, you’ll need training on how a cloud operates and the specific techniques that generative AI services use, such as data, knowledge models, APIs, and other forms of integration, plus how to ensure the scalability, security, and performance of AI systems.
AI data engineer
AI and data experts manage and preprocess large data sets used to train generative AI models. Most people understand that AI systems depend on high-quality, accurate data. AI data engineers ensure data quality, implement pipelines, and optimize data storage and retrieval. Their focus is more on data operations, but understanding how AI systems work, including training data, is essential. 











 
 
 
This position will require an excellent working knowledge of databases, data integration, and how AI systems ingest data for training. This role also needs to understand data curation, quality, security, and governance. I suspect that most AI data engineers will come from the data operations side of things, not the AI side.
AI model curator
These individuals curate and select the most relevant and effective generative AI models for specific applications. They need to deeply understand the AI landscape and stay updated on the latest advancements, including the most helpful third-party tools and how models can be streamlined.
Again, this is more focused on operations. However, it requires specialized operations skills that most current ops team members won’t have. These people will likely come from the data ops side, but deep AI experience is essential. 











 
 
 
AI ethicist
Yes, this is a thing. With generative AI’s potential ethical implications, AI ethicists are crucial in ensuring responsible AI usage. Duties will include assessing and mitigating biases, privacy concerns, and potential societal impacts of these new generative AI systems in the cloud.
This position could come from many different areas. They could be primarily nontechnical roles. I suspect that many will have a business ethics background, but understanding technology will be a vital component of this role, even if that is not understood now.
AI trainer
Not to be confused with those who train people about AI, these professionals specialize in fine-tuning and optimizing generative AI models. Specifically, they work with data scientists and domain experts to prepare models for specific tasks and improve their performance and accuracy.











 
 
 
AI business strategist
Think AI-focused CTO or professional who can bridge the gap between technical AI capabilities and business goals. Their role will be identifying opportunities for generative AI deployment, developing strategies, and managing AI projects to drive business outcomes.
Most of these people will come from IT leadership roles with some technical background. They may have been project leaders or worked for the CIO at some point. They will need an eclectic mix of skills to be successful. 
I suspect that I’m missing a few other roles that will be important, but they will likely be derivatives of the ones listed here. If any of these would be a good career move, then set up your training to head in that direction. Also, position yourself with existing or new jobs so you can move into these roles when they become available. Given that demand will outpace supply, these jobs will pay well, at least for the first few years.

But have you ever thought about how it can reshape construction? Regardless of the type of business, proprietors are always seeking strategies for operations improvement and efficiency enhancement. And with construction, the use cases are intriguing.

One could understandably presume that the methods for rebar laying or concrete pouring are limited. That's where AI enters the picture, adding a high-tech touch to the traditionally hands-on field.


What is AI?
Many people’s idea of what is AI comes from film and television, especially in recent years. AI, in its current form, is a computer that can perform complex tasks. It understands natural language, recognizes patterns, problem-solving, and decision-making.

An artificial intelligence system can learn from data sets to make predictions or find conclusions without human intervention.

One of the most common applications of AI is found on your phone. Voice-activated assistants like Siri and Google understand benign requests and deliver results (within a reasonable degree of scope).

Theoretically, AI can be used in the pre-construction phases. Through the application of historical data analysis, AI, which is trained on extensive past datasets, can examine data meticulously to make well-informed decisions. For instance, the data it can sort through are project type, downtime averages, scope of work, delivery methods, and more.

Parsing Through Building Codes
The world of building codes and permits can be a minefield.
With AI, parsing through building codes becomes as easy as pie. It can quickly identify relevant codes, saving companies from potential legal hassles and ensuring every construction job is up to code.
Remember the headaches you had the last time you went through the building permit process? Well, AI can help streamline this, making it more efficient and less of a hassle.
Project Lifecycle
Every construction project goes through several stages. Artificial intelligence can provide assistance in every aspect, largely due to the capabilities of neural networks.
‘A neural network is a computing model inspired by the brain's structure, used for machine learning tasks.’ – Explained by ChatGPT
AI can use neural networks to classify the progress of different sub-projects. It’s like having a virtual project manager keeping tabs on everything.
This means it can spot potential issues early on. Instead of reacting to problems, you'll be able to prevent them. Now, that's what we call a game-changer!
Ensuring On-Site Safety with AI
Perhaps, the most important way AI can help in construction is by improving safety.
Through photo recognition, AI can detect safety hazards, such as workers not wearing protective gear or hazardous working conditions. AI can be trained on how jobs are supposed to be performed to point out flaws in activities.
AI can look at the work area and past data to guess project risks. This can help you avoid risky situations.
With lots of building data, AI can use simulations to suggest ways to make structures and designs better for things like energy use and air quality.
Now What?
AI is growing quickly. It's tough to find an expert who can help with your ideas, especially an affordable construction AI expert.
While AI is already bringing significant benefits, it's not without challenges. Other issues include data privacy, technology cost, and the need for significant cultural shifts within construction companies.
Despite these challenges, the potential of AI in construction is immense. As technology continues to evolve, we can only imagine how much more it could reshape the industry.
We think the AI evolution opens the doors for huge potential and opportunity.

There’s a lot scientists don’t know. - Vox.com,2023-07-15,Vox.com,https://www.vox.com," “We built it, we trained it, but we don’t know what it’s doing.”",," “We built it, we trained it, but we don’t know what it’s doing.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Podcasts /UnexplainableEven the scientists who build AI can’t tell you how it works “We built it, we trained it, but we don’t know what it’s doing.”by  Noam HassenfeldJul 15, 2023, 7:00 AM EDTFacebookLinkArtificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT might disrupt or revolutionize many industries. But that doesn’t mean we understand what they’re doing. Frank Rumpenhorst/Picture Alliance via Getty ImagesNoam Hassenfeld is the host and senior producer of Unexplainable, Vox’s science podcast about everything we don’t know. He co-created the show and also composes the music.Artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT can do a wide range of impressive things: they can write passable essays, they can ace the bar exam, they’ve even been used for scientific research. But ask an AI researcher how it does all this, and they shrug. “If we open up ChatGPT or a system like it and look inside, you just see millions of numbers flipping around a few hundred times a second,” says AI scientist Sam Bowman. “And we just have no idea what any of it means.”Bowman is a professor at NYU, where he runs an AI research lab, and he’s a researcher at Anthropic, an AI research company. He’s spent years building systems like ChatGPT, assessing what they can do, and studying how they work. He explains that ChatGPT runs on something called an artificial neural network, which is a type of AI modeled on the human brain. Instead of having a bunch of rules explicitly coded in like a traditional computer program, this kind of AI learns to detect and predict patterns over time. But Bowman says that because systems like this essentially teach themselves, it’s difficult to explain precisely how they work or what they’ll do. Which can lead to unpredictable and even risky scenarios as these programs become more ubiquitous.I spoke with Bowman on Unexplainable, Vox’s podcast that explores scientific mysteries, unanswered questions, and all the things we learn by diving into the unknown. The conversation is included in a new two-part series on AI: The Black Box.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.Noam HassenfeldHow do systems like ChatGPT work? How do engineers actually train them?Sam BowmanSo the main way that systems like ChatGPT are trained is by basically doing autocomplete. We’ll feed these systems sort of long text from the web. We’ll just have them read through a Wikipedia article word by word. And after it’s seen each word, we’re going to ask it to guess what word is gonna come next. It’s doing this with probability. It’s saying, “It’s a 20 percent chance it’s ‘the,’ 20 percent chance it’s ‘of.’” And then because we know what word actually comes next, we can tell it if it got it right. This takes months, millions of dollars worth of computer time, and then you get a really fancy autocomplete tool. But you want to refine it to act more like the thing that you’re actually trying to build, act like a sort of helpful virtual assistant.There are a few different ways people do this, but the main one is reinforcement learning. The basic idea behind this is you have some sort of test users chat with the system and essentially upvote or downvote responses. Sort of similarly to how you might tell the model, “All right, make this word more likely because it’s the real next word,” with reinforcement learning, you say, “All right, make this entire response more likely because the user liked it, and make this entire response less likely because the user didn’t like it.”Noam HassenfeldSo let’s get into some of the unknowns here. You wrote a paper all about things we don’t know when it comes to systems like ChatGPT. What’s the biggest thing that stands out to you?Sam BowmanSo there’s two connected big concerning unknowns. The first is that we don’t really know what they’re doing in any deep sense. If we open up ChatGPT or a system like it and look inside, you just see millions of numbers flipping around a few hundred times a second, and we just have no idea what any of it means. With only the tiniest of exceptions, we can’t look inside these things and say, “Oh, here’s what concepts it’s using, here’s what kind of rules of reasoning it’s using. Here’s what it does and doesn’t know in any deep way.” We just don’t understand what’s going on here. We built it, we trained it, but we don’t know what it’s doing.Noam HassenfeldVery big unknown.Sam BowmanYes. The other big unknown that’s connected to this is we don’t know how to steer these things or control them in any reliable way. We can kind of nudge them to do more of what we want, but the only way we can tell if our nudges worked is by just putting these systems out in the world and seeing what they do. We’re really just kind of steering these things almost completely through trial and error.Noam HassenfeldCan you explain what you mean by “we don’t know what it’s doing”? Do we know what normal programs are doing?Sam BowmanI think the key distinction is that with normal programs, with Microsoft Word, with Deep Blue [IBM’s chess playing software], there’s a pretty simple explanation of what it’s doing. We can say, “Okay, this bit of the code inside Deep Blue is computing seven [chess] moves out into the future. If we had played this sequence of moves, what do we think the other player would play?” We can tell these stories at most a few sentences long about just what every little bit of computation is doing. With these neural networks [e.g., the type of AI ChatGPT uses], there’s no concise explanation. There’s no explanation in terms of things like checkers moves or strategy or what we think the other player is going to do. All we can really say is just there are a bunch of little numbers and sometimes they go up and sometimes they go down. And all of them together seem to do something involving language. We don’t have the concepts that map onto these neurons to really be able to say anything interesting about how they behave.Noam HassenfeldHow is it possible that we don’t know how something works and how to steer it if we built it?Sam BowmanI think the important piece here is that we really didn’t build it in any deep sense. We built the computers, but then we just gave the faintest outline of a blueprint and kind of let these systems develop on their own. I think an analogy here might be that we’re trying to grow a decorative topiary, a decorative hedge that we’re trying to shape. We plant the seed and we know what shape we want and we can sort of take some clippers and clip it into that shape. But that doesn’t mean we understand anything about the biology of that tree. We just kind of started the process, let it go, and try to nudge it around a little bit at the end.Noam HassenfeldIs this what you were talking about in your paper when you wrote that when a lab starts training a new system like ChatGPT they’re basically investing in a mystery box?Sam BowmanYeah, so if you build a little version of one of these things, it’s just learning text statistics. It’s just learning that ‘the’ might come before a noun and a period might come before a capital letter. Then as they get bigger, they start learning to rhyme or learning to program or learning to write a passable high school essay. And none of that was designed in — you’re running just the same code to get all these different levels of behavior. You’re just running it longer on more computers with more data. So basically when a lab decides to invest tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in building one of these neural networks, they don’t know at that point what it’s gonna be able to do. They can reasonably guess it’s gonna be able to do more things than the previous one. But they’ve just got to wait and see. We’ve got some ability to predict some facts about these models as they get bigger, but not these really important questions about what they can do. This is just very strange. It means that these companies can’t really have product roadmaps. They can’t really say, “All right, next year we’re gonna be able to do this. Then the year after we’re gonna be able to do that.” And it also plays into some of the concerns about these systems. That sometimes the skill that emerges in one of these models will be something you really don’t want. The paper describing GPT-4 talks about how when they first trained it, it could do a decent job of walking a layperson through building a biological weapons lab. And they definitely did not want to deploy that as a product. They built it by accident. And then they had to spend months and months figuring out how to clean it up, how to nudge the neural network around so that it would not actually do that when they deployed it in the real world.Noam HassenfeldSo I’ve heard of the field of interpretability. Which is the science of figuring out how AI works. What does that research look like, and has it produced anything?Sam BowmanInterpretability is this goal of being able to look inside our systems and say pretty clearly with pretty high confidence what they’re doing, why they’re doing it. Just kind of how they’re set up being able to explain clearly what’s happening inside of a system. I think it’s analogous to biology for organisms or neuroscience for human minds. But there are two different things people might mean when they talk about interpretability.One of them is this goal of just trying to sort of figure out the right way to look at what’s happening inside of something like ChatGPT figuring out how to kind of look at all these numbers and find interesting ways of mapping out what they might mean, so that eventually we could just look at a system and say something about it. The other avenue of research is something like interpretability by design. Trying to build systems where by design, every piece of the system means something that we can understand.But both of these have turned out in practice to be extremely, extremely hard. And I think we’re not making critically fast progress on either of them, unfortunately.Noam HassenfeldWhat makes interpretability so hard?Sam BowmanInterpretability is hard for the same reason that cognitive science is hard. If we ask questions about the human brain, we very often don’t have good answers. We can’t look at how a person thinks and explain their reasoning by looking at the firings of the neurons.And it’s perhaps even worse for these neural networks because we don’t even have the little bits of intuition that we’ve gotten from humans. We don’t really even know what we’re looking for. Another piece of this is just that the numbers get really big here. There are hundreds of billions of connections in these neural networks. So even if you can find a way that if you stare at a piece of the network for a few hours, we would need every single person on Earth to be staring at this network to really get through all of the work of explaining it.Noam HassenfeldAnd because there’s so much we don’t know about these systems, I imagine the spectrum of positive and negative possibilities is pretty wide.Sam BowmanYeah, I think that’s right. I think the story here really is about the unknowns. We’ve got something that’s not really meaningfully regulated, that is more or less useful for a huge range of valuable tasks, we’ve got increasingly clear evidence that this technology is improving very quickly in directions that seem like they’re aimed at some very, very important stuff and potentially destabilizing to a lot of important institutions. But we don’t know how fast it’s moving. We don’t know why it’s working when it’s working. We don’t have any good ideas yet about how to either technically control it or institutionally control it. And if we have no idea what next year’s systems are gonna do, and if next year we have no idea what the systems the year after that are gonna do. It seems very plausible to me that that’s going to be the defining story of the next decade or so.

Whether it’s text, images, video or, more likely, a combination of multiple models and services, taking advantage of generative AI is a ‘when, not if’ question for organizations.
Since the release of ChatGPT last November, interest in generative AI has skyrocketed. It’s already showing up in the top 20 shadow IT SaaS apps tracked by Productiv for business users and developers alike. But many organizations are limiting use of public tools while they set policies to source and use generative AI models. CIOs want to take advantage of this but on their terms—and their own data.
As so often happens with new technologies, the question is whether to build or buy. For generative AI, that’s complicated by the many options for refining and customising the services you can buy, and the work required to make a bought or built system into a useful, reliable, and responsible part of your organization’s workflow. Organizations don’t want to fall behind the competition, but they also want to avoid embarrassments like going to court, only to discover the legal precedent cited is made up by a large language model (LLM) prone to generating a plausible rather than factual answer.
 
 
 













 
 

From taking to making
Rather than a rigid distinction between building and buying such complex technology, Eric Lamarre, the senior partner leading McKinsey Digital in North America, suggests thinking in terms of taking, shaping and—in a very few cases—making generative AI models.

“As a ‘taker,’ you consume generative AI through either an API, like ChatGPT, or through another application, like GitHub Copilot, for software acceleration when you do coding,” he says. Finished apps that include generative AI may not offer much competitive differentiation, and answers they produce won’t always be perfect. But you want to adopt them to avoid competitive disadvantage, especially as they often arrive as new features in applications that staff already know how to use. “Every company will be doing that,” he adds. “In the shaper model, you’re leveraging existing foundational models, off the shelf, but retraining them with your own data.”
That reduces the ‘hallucination’ problem and gets you more accurate and relevant results.
 
 
 













 
 

“Contact center applications are very specific to the kind of products that the company makes, the kind of services it offers, and the kind of problems that have been surfacing,” he says. A general LLM won’t be calibrated for that, but you can recalibrate it—a process known as fine-tuning—to your own data. Fine-tuning applies to both hosted cloud LLMs and open source LLM models you run yourself, so this level of ‘shaping’ doesn’t commit you to one approach.
McKinsey tried to speed up writing evaluations by feeding transcripts of evaluation interviews to an LLM. But without fine-tuning or grounding it in the organization’s data, it was a complete failure, according to Lamarre. “The LLM didn’t have any context about the different roles, what kind of work we do, or how we evaluate people,” he says.
Generative AI models like ChatGPT and GPT4 with a plugin model let you augment the LLM by connecting it to APIs that retrieve real-time information or business data from other systems, add other types of computation, or even take action like open a ticket or make a booking. That includes curated data, like a legal database, in the same way you might add a commercial weather prediction service to a more traditional machine learning (ML) model for generating routes or predicting shipping times rather than build your own weather model from scratch.
 
 
 













 
 

Shaping will involve more than simply building an LLM into your own applications and processes, and organizations will need more sophisticated capabilities, Lamarre warned. “To get good output, you need to create a data environment that can be consumed by the model,” he says. “You need to have data engineering skills, and be able to recalibrate these models, so you probably need machine learning capabilities on your staff, and you need to be good at prompt engineering. So how do I coach my people to ask the right questions to get the best output?”

He cautioned CIOs against ‘shiny object syndrome’ with generative AI, especially if they haven’t already built up expertise in ML. “The reality that’s going to hit home in the next six to 12 months is generative AI is just as difficult as ‘traditional’ AI,” he says.
But with those skills, shaping generative AI systems created from existing models and services will deliver applications most likely to offer competitive differentiation. However, making will be even more challenging and, most likely, rare, Lamarre predicts.
 
 
 













 
 

Buy in or lose out
For smaller organizations like The Contingent, a non-profit supporting vulnerable children, families, and young professionals, even with 10 of its 60 staff working in technology and data research, building their own generative AI seems daunting to consider, according to CIO Peter Kim.
There’s a crisis in child welfare with support needs outpacing capacity, and he’s interested in how generative AI can help profile audiences, evaluate messaging around the continuum of opportunities for volunteering, match applicants with internships, and even reduce the time it takes to recruit new staff.
That will start with using the Copilot features Microsoft is introducing in many products, including in Cloud for Nonprofit. “It would seem almost foolish to pass this up, because it’s just going to become part of the norm,” he says. “If you’re not using it, you’re going to get left behind.”
 
 
 













 
 

But Kim also plans to customize some of the generative AI services available. He expects it to be particularly helpful for coding the many connectors the non-profit has to build for the disparate, often antiquated, systems government and private agencies use, and writing data queries. In addition, he hopes to understand nuances of geographical and demographic data, and extract insights from historical data and compare it to live data to identify patterns and opportunities to move quickly.
Rather than devote resources to replicate generative AI capabilities already available, that time and effort will go to automating existing manual processes and exploring new possibilities. “We’re not imagining utilizing AI to do the same things just because that’s the way we’ve always done it,” he says. “With this new superpower, how should we develop or refine refactoring these business processes?”
Buying rather than building will make it easier to take advantage of new capabilities as they arrive, he suggests. “I think one of the success of organizations in being able to utilize the tools that are becoming more readily available will lie in the ability to adapt and review.”
 
 
 













 
 

In a larger organization, using commercially available LLMs that come with development tools and integrations will allow multiple departments to experiment with different approaches, discover where generative AI can be useful, and get experience with how to use it effectively. Even organizations with significant technology expertise like Airbnb and Deutsche Telekom are choosing to fine-tune LLMs like ChatGPT rather than build their own.
“You take the large language model, and then you can bring it within your four walls and build that domain piece you need for your particular company and industry,” National Grid group CIDO Adriana Karaboutis says. “You really have to take what’s already there. You’re going to be five years out here doing a moonshot while your competitors layer on top of everything that’s already available.”
Panasonic’s B2B Connect unit used the Azure OpenAI Service to build its ConnectAI assistant for internal use by its legal and accounting teams, as well as HR and IT, and the reasoning was similar, says Hiroki Mukaino, senior manager for IT & digital strategy. “We thought it would be technically difficult and costly for ordinary companies like us that haven’t made a huge investment in generative AI to build such services on our own,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

Increasing employee productivity is a high priority and rather than spend time creating the LLM, Mukaino wanted to start building it into tools designed for their business workflow. “By using Azure OpenAI Service, we were able to create an AI assistant much faster than build an AI in-house, so we were able to spend our time on improving usability.”

He also views the ability to further shape the generative AI options with plugins as a good way to customize it to Panasonic’s needs, calling plugins important functions to compensate for the shortcomings of the current ChatGPT.
Fine-tuning cloud LLMs by using vector embeddings from your data is already in private preview in Azure Cognitive Search for the Azure OpenAI Service.
 
 
 













 
 

“While you can power your own copilot using any internal data, which immediately improves the accuracy and decreases the hallucination, when you add vector support, it’s more efficient retrieving accurate information quickly,” Microsoft AI platform corporate VP John Montgomery says. That creates a vector index for the data source—whether that’s documents in an on-premises file share or a SQL cloud database—and an API endpoint to consume in your application.
Panasonic is using this with both structured and unstructured data to power the ConnectAI assistant. Similarly, professional services provider EY is chaining multiple data sources together to build chat agents, which Montgomery calls a constellation of models, some of which might be open source models. “Information about how many pairs of eyeglasses the company health plan covers would be in an unstructured document, and checking the pairs claimed for and how much money is left in that benefit would be a structured query,” he says.
Use and protect data
Companies taking the shaper approach, Lamarre says, want the data environment to be completely contained within their four walls, and the model to be brought to their data, not the reverse. While whatever you type into the consumer versions of generative AI tools is used to train the models that drive them (the usual trade-off for free services), Google, Microsoft and OpenAI all say commercial customer data isn’t used to train the models.
 
 
 













 
 

For example, you can run Azure OpenAI over your own data without fine-tuning, and even if you choose to fine-tune on your organization’s data, that customization, like the data, stays inside your Microsoft tenant and isn’t applied back to the core foundation model. “The data usage policy and content filtering capabilities were major factors in our decision to proceed,” Mukaino says. 
Although the copyright and intellectual property aspects of generative AI remain largely untested by the courts, users of commercial models own the inputs and outputs of their models. Customers with particularly sensitive information, like government users, may even be able to turn off logging to avoid the slightest risk of data leakage through a log that captures something about a query.
Whether you buy or build the LLM, organizations will need to think more about document privacy, authorization and governance, as well as data protection. Legal and compliance teams already need to be involved in uses of ML, but generative AI is pushing the legal and compliance areas of a company even further, says Lamarre.
 
 
 













 
 

Unlike supervised learning on batches of data, an LLM will be used daily on new documents and data, so you need to be sure data is available only to users who are supposed to have access. If different regulations and compliance models apply to different areas of your business, you won’t want them to get the same results.
Source and verify
Adding internal data to a generative AI tool Lamarre describes as ‘a copilot for consultants,’ which can be calibrated to use public or McKinsey data, produced good answers, but the company was still concerned they might be fabricated. “We can’t be in the business of being wrong,” he says. To avoid that, it cites the internal reference an answer is based on, and the consultant using it is responsible to check for accuracy.

But employees already have that responsibility when doing research online, Karaboutis points out. “You need intellectual curiosity and a healthy level of skepticism as these language models continue to learn and build up,” she says. As a learning exercise for the senior leadership group, her team crated a deepfake video of her with a generated voice reading AI-generated text.
 
 
 













 
 

Apparently credible internal data can be wrong or just out of date, too, she cautioned. “How often do you have policy documents that haven’t been removed from the intranet or the version control isn’t there, and then an LLM finds them and starts saying ‘our maternity policy is this in the UK, and it’s this in the US.’ We need to look at the attribution but also make sure we clean up our data,” she says. 
Responsibly adopting generative AI mirrors lessons learned with low code, like knowing what data and applications are connecting into these services: it’s about enhancing workflow, accelerating things people already do, and unlocking new capabilities, with the scale of automation, but still having human experts in the loop.
Shapers can differentiate
“We believe generative AI is beneficial because it has a much wider range of use and flexibility in response than conventional tools and service, so it’s more about how you utilize the tool to create competitive advantage rather than just the fact of using it,” Mukaino says.
 
 
 













 
 

Reinventing customer support, retail, manufacturing, logistics, or industry specific workloads like wealth management with generative AI will take a lot of work, as will setting usage policies and monitoring the impact of the technology on workflows and outcomes. Budgeting for those resources and timescales are essential, too. It comes down to can you build and rebuild faster than competitors that are buying in models and tools that let them create applications straight away, and let more people in their organization experiment with what generative AI can do?

General LLMs from OpenAI, and the more specialized LLMs built on top of their work like GitHub Copilot, improve as large numbers of people use them: the accuracy of code generated by GitHub Copilot has become significantly more accurate since it was introduced last year. You could spend half a million dollars and get a model that only matches the previous generation of commercial models, and while benchmarking isn’t always a reliable guide, these continue to show better results on benchmarks than open source models.
Be prepared to revisit decisions about building or buying as the technology evolves, Lamarre warns. “The question comes down to, ‘How much can I competitively differentiate if I build versus if I buy,’ and I think that boundary is going to change over time,” he says.
If you’ve invested a lot of time and resources in building your own generative models, it’s important to benchmark not just how they contribute to your organization but how they compare to the commercially available models your competition could adopt today, paying 10 to 15 cents for around a page of generated text, not what they had access to when you started your project.
 
 
 













 
 

Major investments
“The build conversation is going to be reserved for people who probably already have a lot of expertise in building and designing large language models,” Montgomery says, noting that Meta builds its LLMs on Azure, while Anthropic, Cohere, and Midjourney use Google Cloud infrastructure to train their LLMs.
Some organizations do have the resources and competencies for this, and those that need a more specialized LLM for a domain may make the significant investments required to exceed the already reasonable performance of general models like GPT4.
Training your own version of an open source LLM will need extremely large data sets: while you can acquire these from somewhere like Hugging Face, you’re still relying on someone else having curated them. Plus you’ll still need data pipelines to clean, deduplicate, preprocess, and tokenize the data, as well as significant infrastructure for training, supervised fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment, as well as the deep expertise to make the right choices for every step.
There are multiple collections with hundreds of pre-trained LLMs and other foundation models you can start with. Some are general, others more targeted. Generative AI startup Docugami, for instance, began training its own LLM five years ago, specifically to generate the XML semantic model for business documents, marking up elements like tables, lists and paragraphs rather than the phrases and sentences most LLMs work with. Based on that experience, Docugami CEO Jean Paoli suggests that specialized LLMs are going to outperform bigger or more expensive LLMs created for another purpose.
“In the last two months, people have started to understand that LLMs, open source or not, could have different characteristics, that you can even have smaller ones that work better for specific scenarios,” he says. But he adds most organizations won’t create their own LLM and maybe not even their own version of an LLM.
Only a few companies will own large language models calibrated on the scale of the knowledge and purpose of the internet, adds Lamarre. “I think the ones that you calibrate within your four walls will be much smaller in size,” he says.
If they do decide to go down that route, CIOs will need to think about what kind of LLM best suits their scenarios, and with so many to choose from, a tool like Aviary can help. Consider the provenance of the model and the data it was trained on. These are similar questions that organizations have learned to ask about open source projects and components, Montgomery points out. “All the learnings that came from the open source revolution are happening in AI, and they’re happening much quicker.”
IDC’s AI Infrastructure View benchmark shows that getting the AI stack right is one of the most important decisions organizations should take, with inadequate systems the most common reason AI projects fail. It took more than 4,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train Microsoft’s Megatron-Turing NLG 530B model. While there are tools to make training more efficient, they still require significant expertise—and the costs of even fine-tuning are high enough that you need strong AI engineering skills to keep costs down.
Docugami’s Paoli expects most organizations will buy a generative AI model rather than build, whether that means adopting an open source model or paying for a commercial service. “The building is going to be more about putting together things that already exist.” That includes using these emerging stacks to significantly simplify assembling a solution from a mix of open source and commercial options.
So whether you buy or build the underlying AI, the tools adopted or created with generative AI should be treated as products, with all the usual user training and acceptance testing to make sure they can be used effectively. And be realistic about what they can deliver, Paoli warns. 
“CIOs need to understand they’re not going to buy one LLM that’s going to change everything or do a digital transformation for them,” he says.

Here are the 5 legal jobs that will be created as a result of generative AI

By Dawid Robert Kotur, Founder and CEO of Curvestone AI
Generative AI such as Chat GPT is rapidly changing the way we work, live, and interact with technology. While the media has shed light - sometimes overdramatically - on many of the challenges this transition comes with, I wanted to tackle one in particular: the idea that AI will replace many human jobs. I have worked in the broader field of AI for almost a decade and have first hand experience of how it is likely to impact the jobs market. While I’m not denying that the wide-ranging use of Generative AI will remove the need for some jobs - particularly in the legal market - I wanted to share my insight into the new job and upskilling opportunities AI is also going to create in that market in parallel.
Here are five of the jobs I foresee being created in the next ten years:
Legal Prompt Engineers
Legal Prompt Engineers will be responsible for developing and maintaining the AI algorithms that power chat bots and virtual assistants. They will work closely with data scientists and software engineers to ensure that these AI systems are efficient, accurate, and user-friendly. They will also work with lawyers and technical specialists to make sure that lawyers interact with Generative AI in a way that performs best and gives an output that a lawyer can use as part of their service to the client.
Legal AI Ethical Officers
With the increasing use of AI in various industries, especially legal, ethical concerns have risen. Legal AI Ethical Officers will be responsible for ensuring that AI systems are developed and used in an ethical and responsible manner. They will work closely with AI developers and business leaders to identify potential ethical issues and develop strategies to address them. It won’t be surprising if at some point all medium to large sized companies will have at least one of those people ensuring a compliant and ethical use of Generative AI.
Legal Bias Anthropologists
Bias Anthropologists will be experts in identifying and addressing biases in AI systems. They will work with data scientists and AI developers to identify potential biases in the data used to train AI systems and develop strategies to mitigate these biases. These people will be absolutely crucial in the legal sector where the use of Generative AI is growing exponentially - making sure, for instance, that the algorithms being used by the sector do not discriminate against certain groups or individuals.
Legal Generative AI Operators
Generative AI Operators will be responsible for operating AI systems that can generate legal documents, such as contracts and patents. They will work closely with legal professionals to ensure that these documents are accurate and legally binding. They will do this much faster and to a better standard than human lawyers can today. If done well, in a lot of places, paralegal can and should be upskilled to transition into such a role.
Legal AI Product Managers
AI Product Managers will be responsible for developing and managing Generative AI products and services. They will closely work with AI developers, business leaders, and customers to identify market opportunities and develop AI products that meet customer needs. It will be the Legal AI Product Managers who will ideally have both technical and legal training to help the industry transform. Most law firms will have many of those people hired directly in their teams, acting as the linchpins between lawyers and technical departments. I have met people who do this kind of work already, just without the title. They are usually technically-minded lawyers who see the industry progressing beyond the status quo and want to take innovation as an opportunity to diversify their skill set.
Despite what a lot of people think, Generative AI will not replace lawyers. Law firms that do not embrace technology early might see a lot of their business go elsewhere simply because of the enormous time and money losses associated with NOT using AI. But even knowing that, the transition will be slow, as the legal industry is based on relationships and trust. It will take a lot for clients of law firms to move to other more innovative providers just because of the price.
As legal services become cheaper due to leveraging Generative AI, however, we might actually see real job growth in the legal sector as more people will be able to afford legal services and therefore drive more demand for those services. The jobs created to fulfill that demand will probably be different to what we see on the market today, but it is also likely that soon universities will adjust their curriculum to incorporate how to use Generative AI in law, so everything is more or less moving in sync.
What’s certain is that a new generation of AI-enabled legal professionals is coming.

AI-Fueled Productivity: Generative AI Opens New Era of Efficiency Across Industries

  A watershed moment on Nov. 22, 2022, was mostly virtual, yet it shook the foundations of nearly every industry on the planet.
On that day, OpenAI released ChatGPT, the most advanced artificial intelligence chatbot ever developed. This set off demand for generative AI applications that help businesses become more efficient, from providing consumers with answers to their questions to accelerating the work of researchers as they seek scientific breakthroughs, and much, much more.
Businesses that previously dabbled in AI are now rushing to adopt and deploy the latest applications. Generative AI — the ability of algorithms to create new text, images, sounds, animations, 3D models and even computer code — is moving at warp speed, transforming the way people work and play.
By employing large language models (LLMs) to handle queries, the technology can dramatically reduce the time people devote to manual tasks like searching for and compiling information.
The stakes are high. AI could contribute more than $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to PwC. And the impact of AI adoption could be greater than the inventions of the internet, mobile broadband and the smartphone — combined.
The engine driving generative AI is accelerated computing. It uses GPUs, DPUs and networking along with CPUs to accelerate applications across science, analytics, engineering, as well as consumer and enterprise use cases.
Early adopters across industries — from drug discovery, financial services, retail and telecommunications to energy, higher education and the public sector — are combining accelerated computing with generative AI to transform business operations, service offerings and productivity.

Generative AI for Drug Discovery
Today, radiologists use AI to detect abnormalities in medical images, doctors use it to scan electronic health records to uncover patient insights, and researchers use it to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs.
Traditional drug discovery is a resource-intensive process that can require the synthesis of over 5,000 chemical compounds and yields an average success rate of just 10%. And it takes more than a decade for most new drug candidates to reach the market.
Researchers are now using generative AI models to read a protein’s amino acid sequence and accurately predict the structure of target proteins in seconds, rather than weeks or months.
Using NVIDIA BioNeMo models, Amgen, a global leader in biotechnology, has slashed the time it takes to customize models for molecule screening and optimization from three months to just a few weeks. This type of trainable foundation model enables scientists to create variants for research into specific diseases, allowing them to develop target treatments for rare conditions.
Whether predicting protein structures or securely training algorithms on large real-world and synthetic datasets, generative AI and accelerated computing are opening new areas of research that can help mitigate the spread of disease, enable personalized medical treatments and boost patient survival rates.
Generative AI for Financial Services
According to a recent NVIDIA survey, the top AI use cases in the financial services industry are customer services and deep analytics, where natural language processing and LLMs are used to better respond to customer inquiries and uncover investment insights. Another common application is in recommender systems that power personalized banking experiences, marketing optimization and investment guidance.
Advanced AI applications have the potential to help the industry better prevent fraud and transform every aspect of banking, from portfolio planning and risk management to compliance and automation.
Eighty percent of business-relevant information is in an unstructured format — primarily text — which makes it a prime candidate for generative AI. Bloomberg News produces 5,000 stories a day related to the financial and investment community. These stories represent a vast trove of unstructured market data that can be used to make timely investment decisions.
NVIDIA, Deutsche Bank, Bloomberg and others are creating LLMs trained on domain-specific and proprietary data to power finance applications.
Financial Transformers, or “FinFormers,” can learn context and understand the meaning of unstructured financial data. They can power Q&A chatbots, summarize and translate financial texts, provide early warning signs of counterparty risk, quickly retrieve data and identify data-quality issues.
These generative AI tools rely on frameworks that can integrate proprietary data into model training and fine-tuning, integrate data curation to prevent bias and use guardrails to keep conversations finance-specific.
Expect fintech startups and large international banks to expand their use of LLMs and generative AI to develop sophisticated virtual assistants to serve internal and external stakeholders, create hyper-personalized customer content, automate document summarization to reduce manual work, and analyze terabytes of public and private data to generate investment insights.
Generative AI for Retail
With 60% of all shopping journeys starting online and consumers more connected and knowledgeable than ever, AI has become a vital tool to help retailers match shifting expectations and differentiate from a rising tide of competition.
Retailers are using AI to improve customer experiences, power dynamic pricing, create customer segmentation, design personalized recommendations and perform visual search.
Generative AI can support customers and employees at every step through the buyer journey.
With AI models trained on specific brand and product data, they can generate robust product descriptions that improve search engine optimization rankings and help shoppers find the exact product they’re looking for. For example, generative AI can use metatags containing product attributes to generate more comprehensive product descriptions that include various terms like “low sugar” or “gluten free.”
AI virtual assistants can check enterprise resource planning systems and generate customer service messages to inform shoppers about which items are available and when orders will ship, and even assist customers with order change requests.
Fashable, a member of NVIDIA Inception’s global network of technology startups, is using generative AI to create virtual clothing designs, eliminating the need for physical fabric during product development. With the models trained on both proprietary and market data, this reduces the environmental impact of fashion design and helps retailers design clothes according to current market trends and tastes.
Expect retailers to use AI to capture and retain customer attention, deliver superior shopping experiences, and drive revenue by matching shoppers with the right products at the right time.
Generative AI for Telecommunications
In an NVIDIA survey covering the telecommunications industry, 95% of respondents reported that they were engaged with AI, while two-thirds believed that AI would be important to their company’s future success.
Whether improving customer service, streamlining network operations and design, supporting field technicians or creating new monetization opportunities, generative AI has the potential to reinvent the telecom industry.
Telcos can train diagnostic AI models with proprietary data on network equipment and services, performance, ticket issues, site surveys and more. These models can accelerate troubleshooting of technical performance issues, recommend network designs, check network configurations for compliance, predict equipment failures, and identify and respond to security threats.
Generative AI applications on handheld devices can support field technicians by scanning equipment and generating virtual tutorials to guide them through repairs. Virtual guides can then be enhanced with augmented reality, enabling technicians to analyze equipment in a 3D immersive environment or call on a remote expert for support.
New revenue opportunities will also open for telcos. With large edge infrastructure and access to vast datasets, telcos around the world are now offering generative AI as a service to enterprise and government customers.
As generative AI advances, expect telecommunications providers to use the technology to optimize network performance, improve customer support, detect security intrusions and enhance maintenance operations.
Generative AI for Energy
In the energy industry, AI is powering predictive maintenance and asset optimization, smart grid management, renewable energy forecasting, grid security and more.
To meet growing data needs across aging infrastructure and new government compliance regulations, energy operators are looking to generative AI.
In the U.S., electric utility companies spend billions of dollars every year to inspect, maintain and upgrade power generation and transmission infrastructure.
Until recently, using vision AI to support inspection required algorithms to be trained on thousands of manually collected and tagged photos of grid assets, with training data constantly updated for new components. Now, generative AI can do the heavy lifting.
With a small set of image training data, algorithms can generate thousands of physically accurate images to train computer vision models that help field technicians identify grid equipment corrosion, breakage, obstructions and even detect wildfires. This type of proactive maintenance enhances grid reliability and resiliency by reducing downtime, while diminishing the need to dispatch teams to the field.
Generative AI can also reduce the need for manual research and analysis. According to McKinsey, employees spend up to 1.8 hours per day searching for information — nearly 20% of the work week. To increase productivity, energy companies can train LLMs on proprietary data, including meeting notes, SAP records, emails, field best practices and public data such as standard material data sheets.
With this type of knowledge repository connected to an AI chatbot, engineers and data scientists can get instant answers to highly technical questions. For example, a maintenance engineer troubleshooting pitch control issues on a turbine’s hydraulic system could ask a bot: “How should I adjust the hydraulic pressure or flow to rectify pitch control issues on a model turbine from company X?” A properly trained model would deliver specific instructions to the user, who wouldn’t have to look through a bulky manual to find answers.
With AI applications for new system design, customer service and automation, expect generative AI to enhance safety and energy efficiency, as well as reduce operational expenses in the energy industry.
Generative AI for Higher Education and Research
From intelligent tutoring systems to automated essay grading, AI has been employed in education for decades. As universities use AI to improve teacher and student experiences, they’re increasingly dedicating resources to build AI-focused research initiatives.
For example, researchers at the University of Florida have access to one of the world’s fastest supercomputers in academia. They’ve used it to develop GatorTron — a natural language processing model that enables computers to read and interpret medical language in clinical notes that are stored in electronic health records. With a model that understands medical context, AI developers can create numerous medical applications, such as speech-to-text apps that support doctors with automated medical charting.
In Europe, an industry-university collaboration involving the Technical University of Munich is demonstrating that LLMs trained on genomics data can generalize across a plethora of genomic tasks, unlike previous approaches that required specialized models. The genomics LLM is expected to help scientists understand the dynamics of how DNA is translated into RNA and proteins, unlocking new clinical applications that will benefit drug discovery and health.
To conduct this type of groundbreaking research and attract the most motivated students and qualified academic professionals, higher education institutes should consider a whole-university approach to pool budget, plan AI initiatives, and distribute AI resources and benefits across disciplines.
Generative AI for the Public Sector
Today, the biggest opportunity for AI in the public sector is helping public servants to perform their jobs more efficiently and save resources.
The U.S. federal government employs over 2 million civilian employees — two-thirds of whom work in professional and administrative jobs.
These administrative roles often involve time-consuming manual tasks, including drafting, editing and summarizing documents, updating databases, recording expenditures for auditing and compliance, and responding to citizen inquiries.
To control costs and bring greater efficiency to routine job functions, government agencies can use generative AI.
Generative AI’s ability to summarize documents has great potential to boost the productivity of policymakers and staffers, civil servants, procurement officers and contractors. Consider a 756-page report recently released by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. With reports and legislation often spanning hundreds of pages of dense academic or legal text, AI-powered summaries generated in seconds can quickly break down complex content into plain language, saving the human resources otherwise needed to complete the task.
AI virtual assistants and chatbots powered by LLMs can instantly deliver relevant information to people online, taking the burden off of overstretched staff who work phone banks at agencies like the Treasury Department, IRS and DMV.
With simple text inputs, AI content generation can help public servants create and distribute publications, email correspondence, reports, press releases and public service announcements.
The analytical capabilities of AI can also help process documents to speed the delivery of vital services provided by organizations like Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, USPS and the State Department.
Generative AI could be a pivotal tool to help government bodies work within budget constraints, deliver government services more quickly and achieve positive public sentiment.
Generative AI for Media and Entertainment
A typical film must generate more than 2x its production budget in box office revenues to be profitable. And with lofty production costs, even major movies like Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, The Flash and Shazam! Fury of the Gods struggled to turn a profit.
Media and entertainment companies must optimize and accelerate production pipelines to stay competitive. Deloitte research showed that 72% of M&E leaders believe AI will be crucial over the next five years.
In media and entertainment, AI can assist artists, developers and business decision-makers.
For content creation, generative AI can help artists and developers reduce the time needed for concept art, previsualization, and creating environments with 3D content placement, crowds, and set dressing. This will free up artists’ time to achieve the most ideal shots and sequences.
By using LLMs to power voice generation and audio- or text-generated animation, studios and broadcasters can create personalized, immersive experiences with existing characters and sports heroes. Sports legends can interact with fans, superheros can talk about their comic series and droids can become augmented reality assistants. These experiences can create greater customer engagement and new revenue streams.
To reduce distribution costs, streaming services and live broadcasters can use generative AI and data analytics to monitor and visualize quality of service, predict when and where to preload content, mitigate piracy, recommend content and more. Ad content or product placement can also be inserted dynamically into content at the point of consumption, improving relevance for both consumers and advertisers.
Whether reducing content costs, creating new revenue streams or optimizing user experiences, generative AI has emerged as a key tool to help the media and entertainment industry reinvent itself while delighting audiences with new forms of entertainment.
Generative AI – A Key Ingredient for Business Success 
Across every field, organizations are transforming employee productivity, improving products and delivering higher-quality services with generative AI.
To put generative AI into practice, businesses need expansive amounts of data, deep AI expertise and sufficient compute power to deploy and maintain models quickly. Enterprises can fast-track adoption with the NeMo generative AI framework, part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, running on DGX Cloud. NVIDIA’s pretrained foundation models offer a simplified approach to building and running customized generative AI solutions for unique business use cases.

Artificial intelligence is recasting career advancement opportunities in new and interesting ways. For technology professionals, it means getting more analytical. For business leaders, it means getting more creative.


There are three types of impacts AI will have on executive career opportunities:




AI may promise (or threaten) to reduce workforce sizes, but, at the same time, it is creating a huge demand for skilled professionals to design, build, maintain, and train AI models and associated data.
AI may assume many decision-making roles, but the organizations and individuals that will succeed are those who can apply AI to new business situations, create new markets, disrupt existing markets, and put the unprecedented insights that AI is capable of delivering the work for organizations and then world.
AI-infused organizations may be so highly automated they need few employees. But the cost of entry will be so low that small, nimble, entrepreneurial organizations that find new ways to deliver services via AI will flourish.



“Since new-age opportunities will be in the areas of machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and artificial intelligence, technical professionals will need to redirect their careers towards data analysis and programming,” remarks Dharmesh Mistry, vice president and head of the technology market unit at Capgemini Americas. “At the same time, business-oriented professionals should redirect themselves towards creative problem-solving and critical thinking, which are areas where AI is yet to make significant advances.”
PROMOTED
History may be repeating itself ‘in that the jobs that will be lost due to these tech breakthroughs will be more than made up for by tech-forward roles, functions, and even entire departments that will exist in the coming years that don’t exist today,” says Adam Samples, president of staffing for Atrium. “Society will evolve. It already has. And the emerging generations are already showing clear signs of little to no interest in certain labor roles, food services and retail roles, and transactional administrative support roles. Employers are showing signs of no longer wanting to incur the cost and risk of employing people in these categories.”
In high demand will be “’bilingual’ leaders who can speak to both technical and business stakeholders,” says Bjorn Austraat, senior vice president and head of AI Acceleration at Truist: Such leaders and professionals need to be “fluent in ‘data science-ese’ and ‘executive-ese.’ An over-reliance on purely technical skills can lead to disjointed science experiments without a clear business return and an excessive focus on business outcomes — especially early on in sometimes lengthy data science and model ops lifecycles — can squelch disruptive innovation.”

Understand the basics of AI: “While executives don't need to understand the intricacies or the inner working of any AI programs that they are trying to embark on, they need to understand the basics,” says Andy Thurai, vice president and principal analyst with Constellation Research. For example, he outlines, “what capabilities does AI programs they are considering have? This will help them think about business use cases that they can solve and come up with ideas on how to solve some pain points and which areas they can use AI.”
Ramp up your critical thinking: In the age of AI, managers need to be adept at “analyzing information and evaluating arguments to make informed decisions,” Mistry says. “This skill is becoming more important as the amount of information available in the digital age increases. It has become a massive asset to be able to filter out relevant information from a sea of data. Moreover, although new forms of AI, such as ChatGPT, can generate answers quickly based on prompts, it often generates incorrect or outright false statements – hallucinations —and critical thinking will be required to parse the true from the false.”
Understand that AI is taking up the heavy lifting for low-level tasks: “Between AI and robotics, many of the mundane tasks — and quite frankly workplace functions that the modern generations find undesirable — have been and will continue to be automated into obscurity,” says Samples. “Transactional accounting, repeatable administrative support tasks, and legal support functions are just a few of many examples. I believe we will see the modern employment landscape transition from a balanced transactional and strategic workplace to a workplace that places more emphasis on strategic aspects.”
Focus on bringing out more of your creativity: “With automation taking over many routine and repetitive tasks, creativity will be an essential skill for managers to differentiate themselves in the job market,” says Mistry. “Moreover, AI can only build based on what it has been trained on, and therefore, can never truly be creative and generate truly novel ideas.”
Estimate the payback and measure the results: AI is no different than any other technology that has entered the business landscape, in that it needs to deliver tangible business gains. Ask if “AI can solve this specific problem better than the way it is done currently,” says Thurai. “Evaluate efficiency, cost, and skills needed. After all implementing and maintaining AI is not going to be easy. It must be proven worthy. Return on investment and total cost of ownership must be justified before it can be approved. This will also allow executives to invite the right solution to demonstrate their capabilities rather than just trying ChatGPT for everything.”


Not on this list, at least from a business professionals’ perspective, is a need for extremely deep technical knowledge of AI or any of its variations. ”Non-technical business professionals are not expected to know how to build or deploy AI apps,” says Mistry. “However, it is essential for these professionals to understand the fundamentals of AI, the potential applications of AI, the knowledge of how to build a business case around AI, and a basic understanding of the technicalities involved.”

In this analysis, I lay out a brief overview of that schema so that you can make more informed decisions in an age where large language models (LLMs) are becoming ubiquitous and necessary elements of products or operations. Ultimately, base-level models, whether LLMs like GPT-4 or image generators like DALL-E-2, are priced by computational consumption, just like most cloud services. The biggest difference is the unit of measurement. Before diving into prices there are a few key terms to know:      Tokens are basic units of text or code that LLMs use to process and generate language. These can be individual characters, parts of words, words, or parts of sentences. These tokens are then assigned numbers which, in turn, are put into a vector that becomes the actual input to the first neural network of the LLM. How the tokens look depends on your tokenization scheme. As a rule of thumb, however, 1,000 tokens is about 750 words in English.Tokenization is the act of splitting larger input or output texts into smaller units for LLMs to ‘digest.’ OpenAI and Azure OpenAI use a tokenization scheme called ‘Byte-Pair Encoding’ that merges the most frequently occurring pairs of characters or bytes into a single token.A prompt is the text instruction you give to a model.Completion means the response of the model. With any generative AI model, there is always a tradeoff between computational load and performance. Best-in-class models like GPT-4 are extremely powerful but require much more computation than simple models. This is, in part, due to the different tokenization schemes.  Which companies are the most important vendors in AI and hyperautomation? Check out the Acceleration Economy AI/Hyperautomation Top 10 Shortlist.  Case Study: Breaking Down Anthropic’s LLM Pricing The prices of different models vary greatly. Below is a screenshot from Anthropic, a competitor of OpenAI: Source: https://www.anthropic.com/product In this example, Anthropic has two different LLMs, Claude Instant and Claude-v1. Their price differs by nearly 10 times, which underscores the point that you need to be very selective about where each model is applied. The best way to see if a model meets your needs is to try it in a test environment first. In the table, you also see a column for ‘Context Window.’ This indicates how long your prompt can be, measured in tokens. 100,000 tokens equate to about 75,000 words, which is equivalent to a full-length novel. ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 have a context of only a few thousand tokens, a ceiling you will quickly bump into if you copy and paste long texts into the prompting bar. One version of GPT-4, called gpt-4-32k, supports up to 32,768 tokens. This is very high for a model that also has great performance — a combination that makes GPT-4 one of the most expensive options. You will also notice that Anthropic charges per Prompt and per Completion. This means for every interaction with an LLM, you will be charged for the length of the input you give as well as the length of the output. This is because computation must be done to convert your natural language input into a vector format that an LLM can understand, then run the input through the neural network itself to receive an output.  This double charge is very common across LLM providers, and it’s worth noting that the Prompt charge is always less than the Completion charge. This is because more computation goes into completion than in preparing the prompt for completion. Case Study: Microsoft OpenAI Service Pricing Breakdown With Microsoft’s OpenAI Services, you can use OpenAI’s models, including DALL-E and the GPT-n series, right within Azure. Note: ChatGPT and ChatGPT Plus have very different pricing structures; the numbers in this section are for direct API calls. You will also notice a table for standard vs fine-tuned models. Fine-tuned models are custom-trained models, in which you influence the model’s behavior by training it with your own dataset. Fine-tuned models are priced by hour deployed as well as by tokens: Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/ All in all, the pricing structure of Azure OpenAI Services is very similar to the rest of the Azure services. Before its partnership with OpenAI, Microsoft also started offering its Cognitive Language Services — things like sentiment analysis, summarization, and more — which are priced in chunks of 1,000 characters and model training priced by the hour. Other cognitive services like computer vision are priced by ‘transaction’ which is, in almost all cases, the same as an API call. Another enterprise-friendly LLM provider to check out is Cohere, which recently announced a partnership with Oracle. For its text generation tool, Cohere charges $15 for 1 million tokens. For reference, the model behind ChatGPT, gpt-35-turbo, costs around $2 for 1 million tokens. However, Cohere has more offerings around enterprise security, flexibility, and privacy that might justify this cost. Guidebook: The Ethical & Workforce Impacts of Generative AI Cost Minimization You can do a number of things to minimize the cost you incur from LLM providers: Use cost management tools like Microsoft Cost ManagementChoose the right model. Unfortunately, this requires some trial and error, which is worth doing before putting a model into production and incurring high costs for performance that isn’t needed for your use case. Again, costs vary greatly. Gpt-35-turbo is 10 times less expensive than GPT-4, and (in most cases) just as good.Reduce the prompt length. Providers will charge based on the length of your prompt and the output.Limit maximum response length in your prompt itself.Consolidate prompts by combining information with questions and requests, in order to reduce the prompt length and number of outputs required.Consider using prompt management software or token cost tracking software. Final Thoughts This analysis should increase clarity around LLM pricing. The field of generative AI is still very new, and pricing is bound to change in the future. The main point to emphasize is the need to get hands-on with different models and different providers before jumping into production, to not only select the right model to minimize the cost but also to understand how your business will be charged for your unique use case. Different providers also have different strengths. OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft brings it right into Azure. Anthropic places more value on AI safety and ethics. Cohere’s products are designed for the enterprise. It also seems like a new AI startup is coming out every day. All in all, it’s important for companies considering building AI products or embedding AI into their offering to look at multiple providers — including startups — to better manage cost but also make sure organizational values are aligned with your provider.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can facilitate the abilities of machines, digital computers or computer-controlled robots to perform different tasks that have traditionally required human intelligence. AI allows machines to represent or improve the capabilities of human minds. It can also include natural language processing, speech recognition, machine learning, robotics, deep learning, expert systems and more.


The attention around AI has accelerated as many business owners, entrepreneurs and technology experts have welcomed and embraced the technology. AI enables an organization to function effectively and accurately with little to no actual human supervision. The technology is currently being used in certain businesses to automate tasks such as customer service work, lead generation, quality control, content writing and fraud detection.
Many believe that AI can perform many assignments more proficiently than humans. When it comes to repetitive tasks, AI tools often finish jobs quickly and with fewer errors. Due to the extensive data sets it can process, AI can also provide insights to enterprises regarding operations or functions they might not have been aware of.
According to a Statista survey conducted in 2020 regarding the use of artificial intelligence technology in businesses in Asia Pacific, 62% of respondents said that in 2019, AI was most actively used in IT management in their respective businesses. Further, 11%, the lowest, said that AI technology was being used for legal and compliance purposes in their businesses.
Will AI Cause Job Layoffs in Asia?
A previous study titled ""Technology and the Future of ASEAN Jobs,"" conducted by Cisco and Oxford Economics, examined the effects of AI on workers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) six largest economies.
""Over the next decade, innovations in digital technology will present vast opportunities to ASEAN economies to boost their productivity and prosperity. The more widespread adoption of existing technologies, coupled with advances in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) through software, hardware and robotics, has the potential to transform business capabilities,"" the study explained.
""As a youthful region (half the 630 million inhabitants are aged under 30) with an internationally competitive manufacturing sector and innovative enterprises, ASEAN is poised to take advantage. However, digital transformation will also mean that many of the region's workers face considerable upheaval.""
The research model concluded that, by 2028, 28 million fewer workers across these economies will be required to provide the same level of output as today. ""This constitutes substantial productivity gains from more widespread technology adoption, which will drive growth and create new demands for workers.""
The study also noted that the overall job landscape will look different. For about 6.6 million workers across the ASEAN-6 region, the new technology scenario will render their job roles redundant. To be specific, the agriculture sector will be the primary source of these redundancies. Overall, the research found that there will be 5.7 million net fewer FTE workers in the agriculture sector by 2028 across the six economies.
Current Global Job Reductions 
Online marketplace Carousell announced that it was reducing its team to about 10% of its headcount — approximately 110 positions. In November, Indonesia’s GoTo Group — a merger between ride-hailing giant Gojek and e-commerce marketplace Tokopedia — cut a total of 1,300 jobs, or about 12% of its headcount. Both companies stated challenging macroeconomic conditions as the reason for such reductions.
According to Crunchbase data, the launch of ChatGPT on the last day of November punctuated what was, at the time, the largest layoff month of 2022. As an aside, funding for AI startups constituted almost 10% of global startup funding.
In May 2023, United States-based employers confirmed 80,089 job cuts, a 20% increase from the 66,995 just one month prior. This May figure also stands at 287% higher than the 20,712 cuts announced in the same month of 2022, according to the global firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc.
Google's parent company, Alphabet, also caused a stir after cutting approximately 12,000 people from its workforce. The CEO of Google and Alphabet, Sundar Pichai, emailed Google employees regarding the layoff, saying that he took ""full responsibility"" for the decisions.
""I am confident about the huge opportunity in front of us thanks to the strength of our mission, the value of our products and services, and our early investments in AI. To fully capture it, we'll need to make tough choices. So, we've undertaken a rigorous review across product areas and functions to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company. The roles we're eliminating reflect the outcome of that review,"" he explained.
AI is continuously evolving, and its new uses are being discovered every day. Many are firmly convinced that AI can be used to solve many of the world's most pressing problems. From curing diseases to creating efficient transportation systems and providing better access to the internet and education, the potential of AI is immense. This technology has the capability to revolutionize many aspects of society as well as create all-new industries that can provide solutions for various industry problems. How this will affect the traditional employment landscape is yet to be fully seen.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) report also suggests it is highly skilled occupations that could be more at risk. “While firms’ adoption of AI is still relatively low, rapid progress including with generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT), falling costs and the increasing availability of workers with AI skills suggest that OECD countries may be on the brink of an AI revolution,” the organisation’s  2023 Employment Outlook  said. The OECD is a 38-member bloc that includes mostly wealthy countries such as the UK, Japan, Germany, the US, Australia and Canada. According to the OECD, AI is expected to have the most impact on highly skilled jobs in fields such as medicine, law and finance, which may lead to major disruptions in the job market. “Occupations in finance, medicine and legal activities which often require many years of education, and whose core functions rely on accumulated experience to reach decisions, may suddenly find themselves at risk of automation from AI,”  said  the OECD. A survey, which was conducted back in 2022 by the OECD, covered different reactions from workers amidst AI emergence in the job market. The survey included 5,300 workers in 2,000 companies in the fields of manufacturing and finance within seven of the 38 OECD countries. The results showed that three out of five of the workers fear that they could lose their job to AI over the next 10 years. Interestingly, despite the fear of job displacement, the survey also indicates that 63 per cent of workers who have integrated AI into their daily tasks reported increased satisfaction and enjoyment in their jobs. Additionally, a majority of workers using AI reported improved job performance along with a positive impact on their mental health. However, the Paris-based organisation emphasised that “urgent action” is needed to prepare for the emergence of AI in the workplace. “These rapid developments, combined with the falling costs of producing and adopting these new technologies, suggest that OECD economies may be on the cusp of an AI revolution which could fundamentally change the workplace,” the OECD said. The OECD also highlighted the importance of closely monitoring data regarding AI implementation in the workplace and gaining a better understanding of how it is expected to change, create, or eliminate jobs.

(Shuran Huang for The Washington Post) By  Gerrit De VynckJuly 16, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. EDTSAN FRANCISCO — An increasingly vocal group of artists, writers and filmmakers are arguing that artificial intelligence tools like chatbots ChatGPT and Bard were illegally trained on their work without permission or compensation — posing a major legal threat to the companies pushing the tech out to millions of people around the world.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeOpenAI’s ChatGPT and image-generator Dall-E, as well as Google’s Bard and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, were all trained on billions of news articles, books, images, videos and blog posts scraped from the internet, much of which is copyrighted.This past week, comedian Sarah Silverman filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Facebook parent company Meta, alleging they used a pirated copy of her book in training data because the companies’ chatbots can summarize her book accurately. Novelists Mona Awad and Paul Tremblay filed a similar lawsuit against OpenAI. And more than 5,000 authors, including Jodi Picoult, Margaret Atwood and Viet Thanh Nguyen, have signed a petition asking tech companies to get consent from and give credit and compensation to writers whose books were used in training data.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTwo class-action lawsuits were filed against OpenAI and Google, both alleging the companies violated the rights of millions of internet users by using their social media comments to train conversational AIs. And the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into whether OpenAI violated consumer rights with its data practices.💻Follow TechnologyFollowMeanwhile, Congress held the second of two hearings focusing on AI and copyright Wednesday, hearing from representatives of the music industry, Photoshop maker Adobe, Stability AI and concept artist and illustrator Karla Ortiz.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextAppeals court blocks Biden’s student loan repayment planSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.The Persian Gulf is enduring life-threatening heat indexes above 140 degreesSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Paul Hollywood is right: Don’t refrigerate breadSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Bob Newhart, who went from standup comedy to sitcom star, dies at 94SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Social anxiety can be limiting.

Not Photoshop, not 3D, not the camera, nothing comes close to this technology.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe wave of lawsuits, high-profile complaints and proposed regulation could pose the biggest barrier yet to the adoption of “generative” AI tools, which have gripped the tech world since OpenAI launched ChatGPT to the public late last year and spurred executives from Microsoft, Google and other tech giants to declare the tech is the most important innovation since the advent of the mobile phone.Scrolling through social media can be addictive in similar ways to cocaine or alcohol. And it’s contributing to a growing mental health crisis among youths. (Video: Luis  Velarde, Brian Monroe/The Washington Post)Artists say the livelihoods of millions of creative workers are at stake, especially because AI tools are already being used to replace some human-made work. Mass scraping of art, writing and movies from the web for AI training is a practice creators say they never considered or consented to.But in public appearances and in responses to lawsuits, the AI companies have argued that the use of copyrighted works to train AI falls under fair use — a concept in copyright law that creates an exception if the material is changed in a “transformative” way.“The AI models are basically learning from all of the information that’s out there. It’s akin to a student going and reading books in a library and then learning how to write and read,” Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs, said in an interview Friday. “At the same time you have to make sure that you’re not reproducing other people’s works and doing things that would be violations of copyright.”The movement of creators asking for more consent over how their copyrighted content is used is part of a larger movement as AI shifts long-standing ground rules and norms for the internet. For years, websites have been happy to have Google and other tech giants scrape their data for the purpose of helping them show up in search results or access digital advertising networks, both of which helped them make money or get in front of new customers.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThere are some precedents that could work in the tech companies’ favor, like a 1992 U.S. Appeals Court ruling that allowed companies to reverse engineer other firms’ software code to design competing products, said Andres Sawicki, a law professor at the University of Miami who studies intellectual property. But many people say there’s an intuitive unfairness to huge, wealthy companies using the work of creators to make new moneymaking tools without compensating anyone.“The generative AI question is really hard,” he said.The battle over who will benefit from AI is already getting contentious.In Hollywood, AI has become a flash point for writers and actors who have recently gone on strike. Studio executives want to preserve the right to use AI to come up with ideas, write scripts and even replicate the voices and images of actors. Workers see AI as an existential threat to their livelihoods.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe content creators are finding allies among major social media companies, which have also seen the comments and discussions on their sites scraped and used to teach AI bots how human conversation works.On Friday, Twitter owner Elon Musk said the website was contending with companies and organizations “illegally” scraping his site constantly, to the point where he decided to limit the number of tweets individual accounts could look at in an attempt to stop the mass scraping.“We had multiple entities trying to scrape every tweet ever made,” Musk said.Other social networks, including Reddit, have tried to stop content from their sites from being collected as well, by beginning to charge millions of dollars to use their application programing interfaces or APIs — the technical gateways through which other apps and computer programs interact with social networks.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSome companies are being proactive in signing deals with AI companies to license their content for a fee. On Thursday, the Associated Press agreed to license its archive of news stories going back to 1985 to OpenAI. The news organization will get access to OpenAI’s tech to experiment with using it in its own work as part of the deal.A June statement released by Digital Content Next, a trade group that includes the New York Times and The Washington Post among other online publishers, said that the use of copyrighted news articles in AI training data would “likely be found to go far beyond the scope of fair use as set forth in the copyright act.”“Creative professionals around the world use ChatGPT as a part of their creative process, and we have actively sought their feedback on our tools from day one,” said Niko Felix, a spokesman for OpenAI. “ChatGPT is trained on licensed content, publicly available content, and content created by human AI trainers and users.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSpokespeople for Facebook and Microsoft declined to comment. A spokesperson for Stability AI did not return a request for comment.“We’ve been clear for years that we use data from public sources — like information published to the open web and public data sets — to train the AI models behind services like Google Translate,” said Google General Counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado. “American law supports using public information to create new beneficial uses, and we look forward to refuting these baseless claims.”Fair use is a strong defense for AI companies, because most outputs from AI models do not explicitly resemble the work of specific humans, Sawicki, the copyright law professor, said. But if creators suing the AI companies can show enough examples of AI outputs that are very similar to their own works, they will have a solid argument that their copyright is being violated, he said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCompanies could avoid that by building filters into their bots to make sure they don’t spit out anything that is too similar to an existing piece of art, Sawicki said. YouTube, for example, already uses technology to detect when copyrighted works are uploaded to its site and automatically take it down. In theory, AI companies could build algorithms that could spot outputs that are highly similar to existing art, music or writing.The computer science techniques that enable modern-day “generative” AI have been theorized for decades, but it wasn’t until Big Tech companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft combined their massive data centers of powerful computers with the huge amounts of data they had collected from the open internet that the bots began to show impressive capabilities.By crunching through billions of sentences and captioned images, the companies have created “large language models” able to predict what the logical thing to say or draw in response to any prompt is, based on their understanding of all the writing and images they’ve ingested.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn the future, AI companies will use more curated and controlled data sets to train their AI models, and the practice of throwing heaps of unfiltered data scraped from the open internet will be looked back on as “archaic,” said Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at AI start-up Hugging Face. Beyond the copyright problems, using open web data also introduces potential biases into the chatbots.“It’s such a silly approach and an unscientific approach, not to mention an approach that hits on people’s rights,” Mitchell said. “The whole system of data collection needs to change, and it’s unfortunate that it needs to change via lawsuits, but that is often how tech operates.”Mitchell said she wouldn’t be surprised if OpenAI has to delete one of its models completely by the end of the year because of lawsuits or new regulation.OpenAI, Google and Microsoft do not release information on what data they use to train their models, saying that it could allow bad actors to replicate their work and use the AIs for malicious purposes.A Post analysis of an older version of OpenAI’s main language-learning model showed that the company had used data from news sites, Wikipedia and a notorious database of pirated books that has since been seized by the Department of Justice.Not knowing what exactly goes into the models makes it even harder for artists and writers to get compensation for their work, Ortiz, the illustrator, said during the Senate hearing.“We need to ensure there’s clear transparency,” Ortiz said. “That is one of the starting foundations for artists and other individuals to be able to gain consent, credit and compensation.”Share394 CommentsArtificial-IntelligenceHAND CURATEDThese four searches show how Google is changing with AI and shoppingMay 14, 2024These four searches show how Google is changing with AI and shoppingMay 14, 2024How the authoritarian Middle East became the capital of Silicon ValleyMay 14, 2024How the authoritarian Middle East became the capital of Silicon ValleyMay 14, 2024Web publishers brace for carnage as Google adds AI answersMay 13, 2024Web publishers brace for carnage as Google adds AI answersMay 13, 2024View 3 more storiesNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Scam calls using AI to mimic voices of people you might know are being used to exploit unsuspecting members of the public. These calls use what’s known as generative AI, which refers to systems capable of creating text, images or any other media such as video, based on prompts from a user. 
Deepfakes have gained notoriety over the last few years with a number of high-profile incidents, such as actress Emma Watson’s likeness being used in a series of suggestive adverts that appeared on Facebook and Instagram. 
There was also the widely shared – and debunked – video from 2022 in which Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to tell Ukranians to “lay down arms”.
Now, the technology to create an audio deepfake, a realistic copy of a person’s voice, is becoming increasingly common. To create a realistic copy of someone’s voice you need data to train the algorithm. This means having lots of audio recordings of your intended target’s voice. The more examples of the person’s voice that you can feed into the algorithms, the better and more convincing the eventual copy will be.
Many of us already share details of our daily lives on the internet. This means the audio data required to create a realistic copy of a voice could be readily available on social media. But what happens once a copy is out there? What is the worst that can happen? A deepfake algorithm could enable anyone in possession of the data to make “you” say whatever they want. In practice, this can be as simple as writing out some text and getting the computer to say it out loud in what sounds like your voice.
Major challenges
This capability risks increasing the prevalence of audio misinformation and disinformation. It can be used to try to influence international or national public opinion, as seen with the “videos” of Zelensky.
But the ubiquity and availability of these technologies poses significant challenges at a local level too – particularly in the growing trend of “AI scam calls”. Many people will have received a scam or phishing call that tells us, for example, that our computer has been compromised and we must immediately log in, potentially giving the caller access to our data.



Real versus deepfake voices can be distinguished from their spectrogram, or voiceprint.

It is often very easy to spot that this is a hoax, especially when the caller is making requests that someone from a legitimate organisation would not. However, now imagine that the voice on the other end of the phone is not just a stranger, but sounds exactly like a friend or loved one. This injects a whole new level of complexity, and panic, for the unlucky recipient.
A recent story reported by CNN highlights an incident where a mother received a call from an unknown number. When she answered the phone, it was her daughter. The daughter had allegedly been kidnapped and was phoning her mother to pass on a ransom demand. 
In fact, the girl was safe and sound. The scammers had made a deepfake of her voice. This is not an isolated incident, with variations of the scam including a supposed car accident, where the victim calls their family for money to help them out after a crash.
Old trick using new tech
This is not a new scam in itself, the term “virtual kidnapping scam” has been around for several years. It can take many forms but a common approach is to trick victims into paying a ransom to free a loved one they believe is being threatened. 
The scammer tries to establish unquestioning compliance, in order to get the victim to pay a quick ransom before the deception is discovered. However, the dawn of powerful and available AI technologies has upped the ante significantly – and made things more personal. It is one thing to hang up on an anonymous caller, but it takes real confidence in your judgement to hang up on a call from someone sounding just like your child or partner. 
There is software that can used to identify deepfakes, and will create a visual representation of the audio called a spectrogram. When you are listening to the call it might seem impossible to tell it apart from the real person, but voices can be distinguished when spectrograms are analysed side-by-side. At least one group has offered detection software for download, though such solutions may still require some technical knowledge to use. 
Most people will not be able to generate spectrograms so what can you do when you are not certain what you are hearing is the real thing? As with any other form of media you might come across: be sceptical. 
If you receive a call from a loved one out of the blue and they ask you for money or make requests that seem out of character, call them back or send them a text to confirm you really are talking to them. 
As the capabilities of AI expand, the lines between reality and fiction will increasingly blur. And it is not likely that we will be able to put the technology back in the box. This means that people will need to become more cautious.

ThompsonSheera Frenkel and Stuart Thompson report on online misinformation and digital data.July 15, 2023For more than 20 years, Kit Loffstadt has written fan fiction exploring alternate universes for “Star Wars” heroes and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” villains, sharing her stories free online.But in May, Ms. Loffstadt stopped posting her creations after she learned that a data company had copied her stories and fed them into the artificial intelligence technology underlying ChatGPT, the viral chatbot. Dismayed, she hid her writing behind a locked account.Ms. Loffstadt also helped organize an act of rebellion last month against A.I. systems. Along with dozens of other fan fiction writers, she published a flood of irreverent stories online to overwhelm and confuse the data-collection services that feed writers’ work into A.I. technology.“We each have to do whatever we can to show them the output of our creativity is not for machines to harvest as they like,” said Ms. Loffstadt, a 42-year-old voice actor from South Yorkshire in Britain.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFan fiction writers are just one group now staging revolts against A.I. systems as a fever over the technology has gripped Silicon Valley and the world. In recent months, social media companies such as Reddit and Twitter, news organizations including The New York Times and NBC News, authors such as Paul Tremblay and the actress Sarah Silverman have all taken a position against A.I. sucking up their data without permission.Their protests have taken different forms. Writers and artists are locking their files to protect their work or are boycotting certain websites that publish A.I.-generated content, while companies like Reddit want to charge for access to their data. At least 10 lawsuits have been filed this year against A.I. companies, accusing them of training their systems on artists’ creative work without consent. This past week, Ms. Silverman and the authors Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey sued OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and others over A.I.’s use of their work.ImageThe actress Sarah Silverman is among the creative professionals who have sued A.I. companies over copyright infringement.Credit...Mark Sommerfeld for The New York TimesAt the heart of the rebellions is a newfound understanding that online information — stories, artwork, news articles, message board posts and photos — may have significant untapped value.The new wave of A.I. — known as “generative A.I.” for the text, images and other content it generates — is built atop complex systems such as large language models, which are capable of producing humanlike prose. These models are trained on hoards of all kinds of data so they can answer people’s questions, mimic writing styles or churn out comedy and poetry.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThat has set off a hunt by tech companies for even more data to feed their A.I. systems. Google, Meta and OpenAI have essentially used information from all over the internet, including large databases of fan fiction, troves of news articles and collections of books, much of which was available free online. In tech industry parlance, this was known as “scraping” the internet.More In TechnologyWhen Tech Fails, It Is Usually With a Whimper Instead of a Bang July 20, 2024An Algorithm Told Police She Was Safe. Then Her Husband Killed Her. July 18, 2024More Gas Cars and Trucks, Fewer E.V.s as Automakers Change Plans July 18, 2024OpenAI’s GPT-3, an A.I. system released in 2020, spans 500 billion “tokens,” each representing parts of words found mostly online. Some A.I. models span more than one trillion tokens.The practice of scraping the internet is longstanding and was largely disclosed by the companies and nonprofit organizations that did it. But it was not well understood or seen as especially problematic by the companies that owned the data. That changed after ChatGPT debuted in November and the public learned more about underlying A.I. models that powered the chatbots.“What’s happening here is a fundamental realignment of the value of data,” said Brandon Duderstadt, the founder and chief executive of Nomic, an A.I. company. “Previously, the thought was that you got value from data by making it open to everyone and running ads. Now, the thought is that you lock your data up, because you can extract much more value when you use it as an input to your A.I.”The data protests may have little effect in the long run. Deep-pocketed tech giants like Google and Microsoft already sit on mountains of proprietary information and have the resources to license more. But as the era of easy-to-scrape content comes to a close, smaller A.I. upstarts and nonprofits that had hoped to compete with the big firms might not be able to obtain enough content to train their systems.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn a statement, OpenAI said ChatGPT was trained on “licensed content, publicly available content and content created by human A.I. trainers.” It added, “We respect the rights of creators and authors, and look forward to continuing to work with them to protect their interests.”Google said in a statement that it was involved in talks on how publishers could manage their content in the future. “We believe everyone benefits from a vibrant content ecosystem,” the company said. Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.The data revolts erupted last year after ChatGPT became a worldwide phenomenon. In November, a group of programmers filed a proposed class action lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI, claiming the companies had violated their copyright after their code was used to train an A.I.-powered programming assistant.In January, Getty Images, which provides stock photos and videos, sued Stability A.I., an A.I. company that creates images out of text descriptions, claiming the start-up had used copyrighted photos to train its systems.Then in June, Clarkson, a law firm in Los Angeles, filed a 151-page proposed class action suit against OpenAI and Microsoft, describing how OpenAI had gathered data from minors and said web scraping violated copyright law and constituted “theft.” On Tuesday, the firm filed a similar suit against Google.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The data rebellion that we’re seeing across the country is society’s way of pushing back against this idea that Big Tech is simply entitled to take any and all information from any source whatsoever, and make it their own,” said Ryan Clarkson, the founder of Clarkson.ImageThe lawyers Ryan Clarkson, Tim Giordano, Tracey Cowan and Yana Hart of Clarkson Law Firm in Los Angeles.Credit...Maggie Shannon for The New York TimesEric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, said the lawsuit’s arguments were expansive and unlikely to be accepted by the court. But the wave of litigation is just beginning, he said, with a “second and third wave” coming that would define A.I.’s future.Larger companies are also pushing back against A.I. scrapers. In April, Reddit said it wanted to charge for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which third parties can download and analyze the social network’s vast database of person-to-person conversations.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSteve Huffman, Reddit’s chief executive, said at the time that his company didn’t “need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”ImageSteve Huffman, the founder and chief executive of Reddit.Credit...Amy Lombard for The New York TimesThat same month, Stack Overflow, a question-and-answer site for computer programmers, said it would also ask A.I. companies to pay for data. The site has nearly 60 million questions and answers. Its move was earlier reported by Wired.News organizations are also resisting A.I. systems. In an internal memo about the use of generative A.I. in June, The Times said A.I. companies should “respect our intellectual property.” A Times spokesman declined to elaborate.For individual artists and writers, fighting back against A.I. systems has meant rethinking where they publish.Nicholas Kole, 35, an illustrator in Vancouver, British Columbia, was alarmed by how his distinct art style could be replicated by an A.I. system and suspected the technology had scraped his work. He plans to keep posting his creations to Instagram, Twitter and other social media sites to attract clients, but he has stopped publishing on sites like ArtStation that post A.I.-generated content alongside human-generated content.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It just feels like wanton theft from me and other artists,” Mr. Kole said. “It puts a pit of existential dread in my stomach.”At Archive of Our Own, a fan fiction database with more than 11 million stories, writers have increasingly pressured the site to ban data-scraping and A.I.-generated stories.In May, when some Twitter accounts shared examples of ChatGPT mimicking the style of popular fan fiction posted on Archive of Our Own, dozens of writers rose up in arms. They blocked their stories and wrote subversive content to mislead the A.I. scrapers. They also pushed Archive of Our Own’s leaders to stop allowing A.I.-generated content.Betsy Rosenblatt, who provides legal advice to Archive of Our Own and is a professor at University of Tulsa College of Law, said the site had a policy of “maximum inclusivity” and did not want to be in the position of discerning which stories were written with A.I.For Ms. Loffstadt, the fan fiction writer, the fight against A.I. came as she was writing a story about “Horizon Zero Dawn,” a video game where humans fight A.I.-powered robots in a postapocalyptic world. In the game, she said, some of the robots were good and others were bad.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut in the real world, she said, “thanks to hubris and corporate greed, they are being twisted to do bad things.”Sheera Frenkel is a prize-winning technology reporter based in San Francisco.

Amid a huge amount of hype around generative AI, a new study from researchers at MIT sheds light on the technology’s impact on work, finding that it increased productivity for workers assigned tasks like writing cover letters, delicate emails, and cost-benefit analyses.
The tasks in the study weren’t quite replicas of real work: They didn’t require precise factual accuracy or context about things like a company’s goals or a customer’s preferences. Still, a number of the study’s participants said the assignments were similar to things they’d written in their real jobs — and the benefits were substantial. Access to the assistive chatbot ChatGPT decreased the time it took workers to complete the tasks by 40 percent, and output quality, as measured by independent evaluators, rose by 18 percent.
The researchers hope the study, which appears today in open-access form in the journal Science, helps people understand the impact that AI tools like ChatGPT can have on the workforce.
“What we can say for sure is generative AI is going to have a big effect on white collar work,” says Shakked Noy, a PhD student in MIT’s Department of Economics, who co-authored the paper with fellow PhD student Whitney Zhang ’21. “I think what our study shows is that this kind of technology has important applications in white collar work. It’s a useful technology. But it’s still too early to tell if it will be good or bad, or how exactly it’s going to cause society to adjust.”
Simulating work for chatbots
For centuries, people have worried that new technological advancements would lead to mass automation and job loss. But new technologies also create new jobs, and when they increase worker productivity, they can have a net positive effect on the economy.
“Productivity is front of mind for economists when thinking of new technological developments,” Noy says. “The classical view in economics is that the most important thing that technological advancement does is raise productivity, in the sense of letting us produce economic output more efficiently.”
To study generative AI’s effect on worker productivity, the researchers gave 453 college-educated marketers, grant writers, consultants, data analysts, human resource professionals, and managers two writing tasks specific to their occupation. The 20- to 30-minute tasks included writing cover letters for grant applications, emails about organizational restructuring, and plans for analyses helping a company decide which customers to send push notifications to based on given customer data. Experienced professionals in the same occupations as each participant evaluated each submission as if they were encountering it in a work setting. Evaluators did not know which submissions were created with the help of ChatGPT.
Half of participants were given access to the chatbot ChatGPT-3.5, developed by the company OpenAI, for the second assignment. Those users finished tasks 11 minutes faster than the control group, while their average quality evaluations increased by 18 percent.
The data also showed that performance inequality between workers decreased, meaning workers who received a lower grade in the first task benefitted more from using ChatGPT for the second task.
The researchers say the tasks were broadly representative of assignments such professionals see in their real jobs, but they noted a number of limitations. Because they were using anonymous participants, the researchers couldn’t require contextual knowledge about a specific company or customer. They also had to give explicit instructions for each assignment, whereas real-world tasks may be more open-ended. Additionally, the researchers didn’t think it was feasible to hire fact-checkers to evaluate the accuracy of the outputs. Accuracy is a major problem for today’s generative AI technologies.
The researchers said those limitations could lessen ChatGPT’s productivity-boosting potential in the real world. Still, they believe the results show the technology’s promise — an idea supported by another of the study’s findings: Workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were twice as likely to report using it in their real job two weeks after the experiment.
“The experiment demonstrates that it does bring significant speed benefits, even if those speed benefits are lesser in the real world because you need to spend time fact-checking and writing the prompts,” Noy says.
Taking the macro view
The study offered a close-up look at the impact that tools like ChatGPT can have on certain writing tasks. But extrapolating that impact out to understand generative AI’s effect on the economy is more difficult. That’s what the researchers hope to work on next.
“There are so many other factors that are going to affect wages, employment, and shifts across sectors that would require pieces of evidence that aren’t in our paper,” Zhang says. “But the magnitude of time saved and quality increases are very large in our paper, so it does seem like this is pretty revolutionary, at least for certain types of work.”
Both researchers agree that, even if it’s accepted that ChatGPT will increase many workers’ productivity, much work remains to be done to figure out how society should respond to generative AI’s proliferation.
“The policy needed to adjust to these technologies can be very different depending on what future research finds,” Zhang says. “If we think this will boost wages for lower-paid workers, that’s a very different implication than if it’s going to increase wage inequality by boosting the wages of already high earners. I think there’s a lot of downstream economic and political effects that are important to pin down.”
The study was supported by an Emergent Ventures grant, the Mercatus Center, George Mason University, a George and Obie Shultz Fund grant, the MIT Department of Economics, and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Grant.

The HillThe Hill reporter Tobias Burns spotlights the efforts of a number of MIT researchers to better understand the impact of generative AI on productivity in the workforce. One research study “looked as cases where AI helped improved productivity and worker experience specifically in outsourced settings, such as call centers,” explains Burns. Another research study explored the impact of AI programs, such as ChatGPT, among employees.

ForbesResearchers from MIT have found that using generative AI chatbots can improve the speed and quality of simple writing tasks, but often lack factual accuracy, reports Richard Nieva for Forbes. “When we first started playing with ChatGPT, it was clear that it was a new breakthrough unlike anything we've seen before,” says graduate student Shakked Noy. “And it was pretty clear that it was going to have some kind of labor market impact.”

Companies scratching for capital have learned that they need only claim an AI connection to bring investors to their doors, much as startups typed “dot-com” onto their business plans a couple of decades ago. Nvidia Corp. has acquired a trillion-dollar market value on the strength of a chip it makes that’s deemed crucial for the data-crunching required by AI chatbots.AI promoters are giddy about their products’ capabilities (and potential profits).Here’s venture capitalist Marc Andreessen: Among the boons in “our new era of AI,” he wrote recently, “every child will have an AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful”; every person “an AI assistant/coach/mentor/trainer/advisor/therapist”; every scientist “an AI assistant/collaborator/partner”; every political leader the same superintelligent aide.        Business   Column: The artificial intelligence field is infected with hype. Here’s how not to get duped  AI sounds great, but it has never lived up to its promise. Don’t fall for the baloney.Oct. 7, 2022  There isn’t much to be said about this prediction, other than that it’s endearing in its childlike naivete, given that in today’s world we still can’t get broadband internet connections, which originated in the 1990s, to millions of Americans. Would it surprise you to know that Andreessen’s venture firm has sunk investments into more than 40 AI-related companies? Me neither. Advertisement    Andreessen also wrote: “Anything that people do with their natural intelligence today can be done much better with AI.” That’s provably untrue. Examples of AI confounding its users’ expectations have been piling up on almost a weekly basis. Among the most famous instances is that of a New York lawyer who filed a brief in a federal court lawsuit citing or quoting dozens of fictitious suits generated by ChatGPT. When the judge ordered the lawyer to verify the citations, he asked ChatGPT if they were for real, which is a bit like asking a young mother if her baby is the most adorable baby ever. The bot said, sure they are, another “hallucination.” In the end, the lawyer and his associates were fined $5,000 and ordered to write abject letters of apology to the opposing parties and all the judges the bot had falsely identified with the fake cases. He also lost the lawsuit.Reports of other similar fiascos abound. An eating disorder association replaced the humans staffing its helpline with a chatbot, possibly as a union-busting move — but then had to take the bot offline because, Vice reported, it was encouraging callers to undertake “unhealthy eating habits.” A Texas professor flunked an entire class because ChatGPT had claimed to be the author of their papers. The university administration exonerated almost all the students after they proved the bot was wrong; someone even submitted the professor’s PhD dissertation to the bot, which claimed to have written that, too.    Technology and the Internet   Birth of a Thinking Machine  For 17 years, a team has been trying to develop the most sophisticated artificial intelligence system ever. This summer, the public will be able to see its work.June 21, 2001  Claims made for the abilities or perils of AI chatbots have often turned out to be mistaken or chimerical. A team of MIT researchers purported to discover that ChatGPT could ace the school’s math and computer science curricula with “a perfect solve rate” on the subject tests; their finding was debunked by a group of MIT students. (The original paper has been retracted.) An eye-opening report that an AI program in an Air Force simulation “killed” its human operator to pursue its programmed goals (HAL-style) turned out to be fictitious.So it’s useful to take a close look at what AI chatbots can and can’t do. We can start with the terminology. For these programs, “artificial intelligence” is a misnomer. They’re not intelligent in anything like the sense that humans and animals are intelligent; they’re just designed to seem intelligent to an outsider unaware of the electronic processes going on inside. Indeed, using the very term distorts our perception of what they’re doing.That problem was noticed by Joseph Weizenbaum, the designer of the pioneering chatbot ELIZA, which replicated the responses of a psychotherapist so convincingly that even test subjects who knew they were conversing with a machine thought it displayed emotions and empathy. “What I had not realized,” Weizenbaum wrote in 1976, “is that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.” Weizenbaum warned that the “reckless anthropomorphization of the computer” — that is, treating it as some sort of thinking companion — had produced a “simpleminded view ... of intelligence.”Even the most advanced computers had no ability to acquire information other than by being “spoon-fed,” Weizenbaum wrote. That’s true of today’s chatbots, which acquire their data by “scraping” text found on the web; it’s just that their capacity to gorge on data is so much greater now, thanks to exponential improvements in computing power, than it was in 1976. The chatbots attracting so much interest today are what AI researchers call “generative” AI — which uses statistical rules to answer queries by extrapolating from data they’ve previously acquired. At its heart, says Australian technologist David Gerard, ChatGPT is “a stupendously scaled-up autocomplete,” like a word-processing program predicting the end of a word or sentence you’ve started typing. The program “just spews out word combinations based on vast quantities of training text.”        Business   Column: This artificial intelligence chatbot turns out to be a plagiarist — and an idiot  The tech site CNET brought in an artificial intelligence bot to write financial articles, but the product turned out to be worthless and even unethical. Jan. 25, 2023  The professional enthusiasm for these programs — predictions that they’ve moved us a step closer to true artificial intelligence, or that they’re capable of learning, or that they harbor the potential to destroy the human race — may seem unprecedented. But it’s not. The same cocksure predictions — what Weizenbaum called “grandiose fantasies” — have been part of the AI world since its inception. In 1970, Marvin Minsky of MIT, one of the godfathers of AI, told Time magazine that “In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being ... a machine that will be able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, and have a fight. ... In a few months, it will be at genius level and a few months after that its powers will be incalculable.”Minsky and his contemporaries ultimately had to recognize that the programs that seemed to show limitless potential were adept only within narrow confines. That’s still true. ChatGPT can turn out doggerel poetry or freshman and sophomore essays, pass tests on some technical subjects, write press releases, compile legal filings with a veneer of professionalism. But these are all generic classes of writing; samples turned out by humans in these categories often have a vacuous, robotic quality. Asked to produce something truly original or creative, chatbots fail or, as those hapless lawyers discovered, fabricate. (When Charlie Brooker, creator of the TV series “Black Mirror,” asked ChatGPT to write an episode, the product was of a quality he described with an unprintable epithet.)That may give pause to businesses hoping to hire chatbots to cut their human payrolls. When they discover that they may have to employ workers to vet chat output to avoid attracting customer wrath or even lawsuits, they may not be so eager to give bots even routine responsibilities, much less mission-critical assignments. In turn, that may hint at the destiny of the current investment frenzy. “The optimistic AI spring of the 1960s and early 1970s,” writes Melanie Mitchell of the Santa Fe Institute, gave way to the “AI winter” in which government funding and popular enthusiasm collapsed. Another boom, this time over “expert systems,” materialized in the early 1980s but had faded by the end of the decade. (“When I received my PhD in 1990, I was advised not to use the term ‘artificial intelligence’ on my job applications,” Mitchell writes.) Every decade seemed to have its boom and bust.Is AI genuinely threatening? Even the terrifying warnings issued about the perils of the technology and the need for regulation look like promotional campaigns in disguise. Their ulterior motive, writes Ryan Calo of the University of Washington, is to “focus the public’s attention on a far-fetched scenario that doesn’t require much change to their business models” and to convince the public that AI is uniquely powerful (if deployed responsibly). Interestingly, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has lobbied the European Union not to “overregulate” his business. EU regulations, as it happens, would focus on near-term issues related to job losses, privacy infringements and copyright violations. Some of those concerns are motivations of the writers’ and actors’ strikes going on now in Hollywood — the union members are properly concerned that they may lose work to AI bots exploited by cheapskate producers and studio heads who think audiences are too dumb to know the difference between human and robotic creativity.What’s scarcely acknowledged by today’s AI entrepreneurs, like their predecessors, is how hard it will be to jump from the current class of chatbots to genuine machine intelligence. The image of human intelligence as the product merely of the hundred trillion neural connections in the human brain — a number unfathomable by the human brain — leads some AI researchers to assume that once their programs reach that scale, their machines will become conscious. It’s the last hard problems in achieving intelligence, much less consciousness, that may be insurmountable: Human researchers haven’t even agreed on a definition of intelligence and have failed to identify the seat of consciousness. Is there a reasonable role in our lives for chatbots? The answer is yes, if they’re viewed as tools to augment learning, not for cheating; teachers are worried about identifying chat-generated assignments, but in time they’ll use the same techniques they have to identify plagiarism — comparing the product to what they know of their student’s capabilities and rejecting those that look too, too polished (or have identifiable errors). ChatGPT can help students, writers, lawyers and doctors organize large quantities of information or data to help get ideas straight or produce creative insights. It can be useful in the same way that smart teachers advise students to use other web resources with obvious limitations, such as Wikipedia: They can be the first place one consults in preparing an assignment, but they better not be the last.

Interestingly, however, when it comes to the real usage of the technology, it has been found that Gen Z workers are generally more at ease putting generative AI tools to work than the other age groups in the workforce. Gen Z has also proactively learnt how to use this tool to enhance their own outputs. For example, resourceful Gen Z students at schools and colleges have already offloaded their homework onto generative AI. In all likelihood, they would be carrying over the same expectations into the workplace also, when they enter the workforce and with the recent release of OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-4, the transition will happen way faster than we anticipated. &ldquo;Gen Z was born in the middle of a technology revolution, and are well positioned to find use cases that help do regular things 10x faster,&rdquo; points out Aayush Ghosh Choudhury, Co-founder &amp; CEO, Scrut Automation. &ldquo;The Gen Z workforce is digital-native, mobile-first, and more tech-savvy than the previous generations. It wants to focus on value added work instead of spending time on repetitive and non-productive tasks that generative AI can easily perform. They expect the employers to provide the latest technology products, tools, and hardware to perform their jobs efficiently,&rdquo; explains Sumit Sabharwal, CEO of TeamLease HRtech. In such a scenario, availing the most advanced generative AI tool can be a small step towards improving retention, he believes. Now, GPT-4 is definitely the best version as users can feed it images along with text. This capability will enable the users to feed more nuanced prompts to the system, which was not possible with text-only support. It&rsquo;ll be even better for the Gen Z workforce as it is strong at multimedia communication. &ldquo;I have seen my design and marketing team use GPT-3 and how excited they are with GPT-4. The glee in their eyes is real,&rdquo; says Manavjeet Singh, MD &amp; CEO of CLXNS, an AI-based debt collection platform. As generative AI technology continues to advance further, it is likely to play an increasingly important role in the business landscape, empowering businesses of all types and sizes to operate more efficiently and effectively. Businesses run by Gen Z leaders stand to gain considerably from this evolution and insane productivity boost.Manoj Shastrula, Founder&#8297; and CEO of SaaS startup Socly.io says, ""The appeal of generative AI lies in its adaptability- it can be tailored to satisfy the unique requirements of various industries. For instance, generative AI is being used in retail to develop simulated try-on experiences, and in healthcare, AI is facilitating the development of customized treatment plans and new drugs. Generative AI is also revolutionizing how companies operate, and as Gen Z leaders adopt this technology, we can anticipate increased innovation, growth, and positive effects in the future.&rdquo;With their innate digital fluency and natural affinity for technology, Gen Z leaders are poised to lead the charge in leveraging generative AI for unparalleled business success. &ldquo;Given that Gen Z leaders are digital natives, they are likely to be at the forefront of harnessing generative AI to drive business success,&rdquo; says Rikant Pittie, Co-founder, EaseMyTrip. Also, generative AI has revolutionized the way people function, as demonstrated by ChatGPT. Organizations equipped with advanced tools like GPT-4 can attract and retain the tech-savvy Gen Z workforce by offering them cutting-edge technology to take progressive steps, he believes.But all is not hunky-dory here. There is a lurking challenge too. CLXNS&rsquo; Manavjeet Singh says, &ldquo;For Gen Z leaders this brings out a different challenge &ndash; the growth in impostors and fake experts and how could one differentiate between a real expert and fake one? Similar to how Instagram filters enable users to present themselves as significantly more attractive than they are in reality, GPT3 and GPT4 will enable many employees to sound significantly brighter. Many impostors will be drawn to this and Gen Z leaders will need to develop their ability to distinguish the wheat from the chaff. But besides these issues, overall the workforce will become more efficient and more productive in day to day tasks.&rdquo; However, there are some difficulties with generative AI acceptance, cautions Shastrula. &ldquo;Business leaders must make sure AI-powered systems are moral, open, and responsible,&rdquo; he concludes.",,,,contactus@etcio.com,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But do you know, despite all the artificial intelligence at work, the Bard is highly dependent on humans, and they are overworked, underpaid, and frustrated?There are a group of contract workers who work behind the scenes to support generative AI. If you think it is all AI, then you are wrong, human intelligence is as important as artificial intelligence as they are the ones who make sure the chatbot spits out accurate and reliable answers.Amidst Google's AI race with OpenAI, the ones to suffer are these contract workers. The workload of these workers has increased in size and complexity.Take the case of Bard. It offers prompt responses to a variety of questions. Whether you are asking for help in your mathematics assignment or making it write a whole new book, it can do it all. Nevertheless, the chatbot and the companies depend on human reviewers to improve the quality of these responses and maintain consistency. These individuals evaluate the answers, provide feedback on errors, and remove traces of partiality.Those working on the Bard are from companies such as Appen and Accenture. Despite working under strict time constraints with minimal training and earning as little as $14 an hour, these contractors have expressed concerns about the standard of their work and worry about facing the consequences of speaking up, reports Bloomberg. These staffers have been working since January on AI-related tasks to prepare for the public release of Google's AI products.According to six current Google contract workers, their job has become increasingly challenging. Even without specialised knowledge, these workers are responsible for evaluating responses on a variety of topics, including medication dosages and state regulations. They must follow complex instructions and complete tasks with tight deadlines, some as short as three minutes. One of the contractors said the current situation is causing fear, stress, and uncertainty among people, resulting in underpaid work and a lack of cohesiveness. The contractor believes that this culture of apprehension is not helpful in achieving the desired quality and teamwork from everyone.Contractors working for Google have expressed concerns about their working conditions, both privately and publicly. They claim that the conditions affect the quality of content that users see. In May, a contract worker for Appen wrote a letter to Congress, stating that the speed at which they are required to review content could make Bard a ""faulty"" and ""dangerous"" product.The workers claimed that their work was evaluated through automated means that were difficult to understand. They could not communicate directly with Google and only provided feedback through a ""comments"" section for each task. Additionally, workers had to work quickly as they were flagged by an AI system that urged them to work faster.According to the workers, they have come across disturbing content such as bestiality, war footage, child pornography, and hate speech as part of their job evaluating the quality of Google's offerings. Some workers at Accenture said they were temporarily assigned to review inappropriate and offensive prompts. However, after one worker filed an HR complaint, the project was suddenly stopped for the US team. Nevertheless, teams at other locations are still continuing this practice.Accenture employees were also asked to provide creative responses to prompts for Google's AI chatbot, Bard. They were given tasks such as writing a Shakespearean-style poem about dragons or debugging code. Sources familiar with the situation revealed this information anonymously.Last month, six contract workers at Appen who trained Google's new AI chatbot claimed they were unjustly fired for speaking out about low pay and unreasonable deadlines. The employer, Appen, is accused of illegally firing the workers for organizing. Despite advocating for better pay and working conditions for almost a year, they were terminated just two weeks after warning Congress about potential danger from the chatbot, Bard. Appen cited ""business conditions"" as the reason for termination and has not commented further.In a statement, Google said the company is not the employer of any of the workers in question. Instead, the suppliers are responsible for setting the working conditions, such as pay, benefits, hours, tasks assigned, and employment changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-101699924,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-8164,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/101699642'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an indication that the skills gap will be bridged by AI-based automation tools over time unless employers and their team members are not upskilling and reskilling themselves with time.Google and Microsoft already use language models to improve the accuracy of their search engines and the natural language processing (NLP) cloud services they sell.According to a study by the IMF, 85 million jobs would be displaced by 2025, as a direct consequence of the tug of war between machine and human.

We are aware of the challenges such as data security and algorithmic biases,&rdquo; said Naganagouda S J, Chief People Officer, Tally Solutions.While generative AI tools offer various benefits and opportunities, their intervention also raises concerns. Ethical considerations such as bias, privacy and the impact on employment needs to be addressed to ensure responsible and beneficial use of these technologies across industries.  Wipro to spend $1 bn to train entire staff in AIThe spending, over the next three years, also involves bringing 30,000 employees from cloud, data analytics, consulting and engineering teams together to embed the technology into all internal operations and solutions offered to clients.See More DetailsBuilding a resilient future workforce through AITo cope with the changing workplace requirements, Genpact has launched Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) training for its 1,15,000 global workforce, including HR professionals.To help its employees prepare for the future AI-driven world, the company recently launched generative AI skill on Genome.

Artificial intelligence can be a valuable tool for employers in functions such as hiring, but it also poses significant risks of inadvertent discrimination, experts warn.
The use of generative AI tools — including ChatGPT — which learn patterns and relationships from massive amounts of data, has exploded to more than 100 million users, according to a report released in June by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. 
In the employment context, AI is most likely to be used in hiring but is expected to play a greater role in related functions, including layoffs, promotions and succession planning.
“It’s quicker to have an AI source review all (job candidates’) resumes and sort them than pre-interview candidates. It makes the process quicker” and involves fewer human resources staff, said Mary Anne Mullin, New York-based senior vice president at QBE Insurance Group Ltd.
But it still requires some human oversight, experts say. The issue has attracted the attention of Congress and federal regulators as well as some state and local legislative bodies (see related story below). 
Its use will increase as the technology becomes more sophisticated, said Joni Mason, New York-based senior vice president and national executive and professional risk solutions practice leader for USI Insurance Services Inc. 
Employers “want to make sure that their algorithm doesn’t discriminate against different groups,” said Scott M. Nelson, a partner with Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP in Houston. 
He said a general, if simplistic, rule of thumb is the “4/5 rule,” under which a selection practice is considered to have a disparate impact if the selection rate for a certain group is less than 80% that of the group with the highest rate.
In a putative class-action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Oakland, California, in February, Derek L. Mobley blamed Pleasanton, California-based Workday Inc.’s AI systems and screening tools for his failure to find employment despite applying for at least 100 positions since 2018. 
Mr. Mobley charged that the tools administered by Workday and used by employers rely upon “subjective practices” that have had a disparate impact on applicants who are African-American, older than 40, and/or disabled.
There will be more lawsuits, experts say. 
“Wrongful employment decisions and, in particular, claims around discrimination are in the offing,” said Kelly Thoerig, Marsh LLC’s New York-based U.S. employment practices liability product leader.
She said that while there has not been a notable volume of AI-related employment claims to date, “the framework is there” for a creative plaintiffs bar.
Observers say employers will generally be held responsible for any perceived discrimination. 
“It’s incumbent upon these companies to not just rely on the vendor that supplies the AI program,” Ms. Mullin said.
“It’s going to come down to having a very diverse and strong set of data,” said David Derigiotis, Detroit-based chief insurance officer for insurtech Embroker. “It has to be tested and tested and must be reported and the results found to be satisfactory before live production,” he said. 
Employment practices liability policies will likely provide coverage if there is litigation, observers say.
“What insureds might want to look at is what kind of computer-related exclusions could be on the policy, and they need to talk with their broker to make sure that any wrongful claim that arises from AI is covered under the definition of wrongful employment, including claims and settlements,” Ms. Mullin said.
Technology errors and omissions coverage may also come into play, Mr. Derigiotis said.
“We have seen some questions around employers’ utilization of AI and AI-related technologies come up with more regularity” during underwriting, but generally speaking ‘’it hasn’t created any outsize problems,” Ms. Thoerig said.

Lawmakers, regulators set rules on using Ai as a recruitment tool 
Artificial intelligence’s use in employment decisions has drawn the attention of federal, state and local regulators and legislators.
This includes:

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in May issued guidance on how to avoid discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when using AI.
During a June 13 hearing on AI, U.S. Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Human Rights & the Law, said AI’s potential impact on work could include fundamental shifts in recruitment, candidate screening and hiring.
A New York City law, Local Law 144, which took effect July 5, requires employers and employment agencies that use AI to conduct a bias audit within one year of its use, make information about the audit publicly available, and provide employees or job candidates with certain notices about its use.
Illinois’ Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, which became effective Jan. 1, 2020, regulates AI’s use in job applicant video interviews.
Maryland’s Facial Recognition Services Law, which became effective Oct. 1, 2020, prohibits employers from using facial recognition technology during pre-employment job interviews without the applicant’s consent. 

In addition, the European Union has passed draft rules governing AI’s use for functions including making hiring decisions. No comparable U.S. federal legislation is imminent.
Europe is taking a more unified approach than the United States, said Ernest Paskey, Washington-based partner and head of assessment solutions, North America, for Aon PLC. 
AI-related uses have also been the focus of many state legislatures (see chart). 


Some of the proposed legislation pinpoints hiring, while other measures are framed more broadly, addressing issues such as housing or credit, said Michael Fetzer, Brunswick, Georgia-based associate partner, global science and analytics, for Aon.

After all, 78% of those surveyed earned an interview after taking advantage of it and 59% were hired!The survey also uncovered the fact that four out of 10 interviewers were unable to identify candidates that had used it. However, the surveyed job seekers did state that 35% of them didn’t get the job because their interviewer was aware of their usage.The landscape is a bit confusing.Is ChatGPT a detractor from quality application materials? Are certain job seekers simply using it incorrectly? Are some recruiters discounting its abilities?There are positives to this new innovation, but the technology is tempered by laziness in some applicants and prejudice in some talent acquisition professionals.Let’s dive in deeper.The upsideChatGPT can generate a solid start for candidates as long as they provide the correct prompt. Candidates need to know what they require of the AI, provide what it needs to be successful at the task (such as their résumé, goals and the role they are applying for). Essentially, candidates can execute their application process faster if they spend time working out the right prompt and if they tailor the output afterward.In addition to providing a head start with proper prompt usage, ChatGPT might allow English as a second language (ESL) candidates to more clearly present their value proposition to recruiters. It can be difficult for people whose first language isn’t English to fine tune a résumé, but that doesn’t mean they are any less qualified.Finally, ChatGPT can pair up a candidate’s skills with the requirements in a job description and then candidates can modify the output from there. That is, in our minds, the best use case for the new technology.Red flagsSo with the upsides in mind, let’s examine how to identify a poorly executed ChatGPT résumé.advertisementFirst off, if the résumé directly mirrors the asks in the job description without personality, it has probably been generated (badly) using ChatGPT.Second, if the résumé you receive showcases a completely different style of writing than the other application materials, ChatGPT (or another similar tool) is likely at play.Third, if you start seeing résumés come through that seem oddly familiar, for example, two nearly identical résumés, they are likely from ChatGPT, and, quite frankly, lying is afoot. Speaking of lies, when ChatGPT is unable to find a point of reference, it can fabricate “facts” fairly convincingly. Inaccurate or false information is par for the course and should be on your radar.Fourth, ChatGPT was trained on information prior to 2021, so if you are sourcing for a role that is newer, “ChatGPT may not fully understand the context and nuance of [the required] work experience, achievements and career goals.”Some other red flags to look out for are generic phrasing, strange formatting , and repetitive language.Identification strategiesThe fact is, if executed well, it can be pretty difficult to flag all applicants who have utilized generative AI technology (and it’s not always productive to do so). But if you want to make sure you are getting a quality candidate, here are some strategies you can employ.Ask personal, experience-based questions as a part of your application process.Try to learn whether they have the practice experience or potential to solve the problems you need help with by posing questions designed with that specific candidate in mind.Lean heavily into reference checks.Don’t disregard the power of praise. Contact all the references on their list but also consider the testimonials on their LinkedIn profile when you are doing your vetting.Pay close attention to the skills section.Are their skills identical to the job description with little deviation? That could be a desperate ploy to earn the job and a major indicator of applicants who are faking it.Implement phone screens.Screening through a phone call can be a great tool to see whether you’re speaking with a real-deal candidate. Ask them some introductory questions and see how they respond. The truth will reveal itself most times.Observe their in-person or email presentation.If you bring in a candidate for an interview or if you contact the candidate via email, take note of potential discrepancies between their résumé writing style and presentation. The difference can be quite stark.Cross-check what they have written versus how they are positioned on LinkedIn and other platforms.Again, different writing styles and inconsistently represented qualifications are major indications of falsification in applications. Take the time to compare materials if you want the full picture.Consider including other options (ideally something proprietary to your company) beyond résumés and cover letters in your application process to guarantee human involvement and potential fit. Practical exercises can help you further assess that a candidate can do the work they say they can do. For analytical roles, this could take the form of solving a problem using sample data, or for creative roles, you might ask a candidate to create something that showcases a relevant skill.This article originally appeared on Beacon Hill Staffing’s blog and is reprinted with permission.

And with more tools popping up every day that help potential hires appear more skilled than they may actually be, it\'s tougher than ever.\n\n\n\nAt this point in time, talent acquisition professionals are well aware that a large quantity of people are using generative AI tools like ChatGPT for résumés, but not all of them know how to combat the increased volume of unqualified applicants. This article will provide the lay of the land and upsides of AI assistance as well as a list of red flags to look out for and strategies to mitigate mis-hires.\n\n\n\nJob seekers are likely using AI\n\n\n\nRecently,&nbsp;COMPUTERWORLD surveyed 2,153 job seekers&nbsp;about their experience using ChatGPT in their job search. A resounding&nbsp;88%&nbsp;of them said they are either somewhat or highly likely to use it for their future application materials.\n\n\n\nWe can\'t blame modern job seekers for using the new technology. After all,&nbsp;78%&nbsp;of those surveyed earned an interview after taking advantage of it and&nbsp;59%&nbsp;were hired!\n\n\n\nThe survey also uncovered the fact that&nbsp;four out of 10&nbsp;interviewers were unable to identify candidates that had used it. However, the surveyed job seekers did state that&nbsp;35%&nbsp;of them didn’t get the job because their interviewer was aware of their usage.\n\n\n\nThe landscape is a bit confusing.\n\n\n\nIs ChatGPT a detractor from quality application materials?

By 2021, there were 20,505.Credit: Stephen KiprillisAmid the rapid acceleration of AI applications such as ChatGPT, the federal government last month outlined plans to regulate the use of the technology.The new research by economics advisory firm Mandala Partners showed private sector investment in AI was growing, with banks, consultancies and accounting firms leading the way. The federal government, Commonwealth Bank, Deloitte, Amazon and Macquarie Bank were employing the most workers with skills in the technology.But the study revealed a gap between different states and industries in the development of the technology.NSW, Victoria and the ACT were outperforming on the development of the technology, while Queensland and WA were below expected baselines.NSW accounted for 49 per cent of AI jobs and Victoria had 27 per cent, while Queensland and WA each had 8 per cent of AI-related workers.The study measured job advertisements over the past decade to identify which industries and organisations were seeking skills in artificial intelligence, and compared the results with overall labour force figures for each state.AdvertisementRelated ArticleOpinionAIAnother robo-debt disaster’s inevitable if we give AI too much autonomyRachael FalkCEO of the Cyber Security Cooperative Research CentreMandala Partners managing partner Amit Singh said investment in AI needed to be encouraged across the country so that the productivity gains and benefits from the technology are more evenly spread.“This is not just a technology for people in Sydney and Melbourne,” he said. “It is also for farmers, doctors, miners, teachers in regional Australia. It’s for all of us.”The research also showed large firms were competing for AI talent with the Commonwealth public service.The federal government posted at least 2728 AI job advertisements over the past seven years, followed by the Commonwealth Bank on 1739, Deloitte on 1287, Amazon on 1077, Macquarie Bank on 983, and the NSW government on 867.As AI has moved from theory to practice, investment had moved from universities to the private sector in Australia, the research found.In 2012, there were 756 jobs advertised referencing AI skills, while in 2021 there were 20,505.A decade ago, investment was dominated by universities and sectors like financial services and mining. But then over the next five years, professional services and technology firms ramped up their investment to provide AI services to their clients.Over the past year, firms in other industries like logistics and manufacturing had begun to invest in AI capabilities.The professional services industry now has the most AI jobs, followed by financial services, education and then IT and media.The research also highlighted a sharp downturn in AI jobs being advertised during last year’s tech layoffs, but that had since been reversed.“It’s clear that more and more roles need AI skills,” Singh said.“This is not new, it’s been happening for 10 years. But what is new is that after the tech downturn, the AI skills trend is accelerating again.”Related ArticleExclusiveAILabor to take first steps in writing AI rule bookThe government has begun consultations with industry and AI experts as it formulates a new policy for regulating the technology.A spokesman for Industry and Science Minister, Ed Husic, said the government wanted to see the benefits of AI maximised while mitigating risks.“The government is in the midst of consultations with industry and other stakeholders about the appropriate regulation of AI to this end,” the spokesman said.“Further steps will be outlined when submissions have been considered.”Opposition science spokesman Paul Fletcher said the new study showed there was strong demand for people with AI skills across the economy.Related ArticleExplainerRobots‘Die as a human or live forever as a cyborg’: Will robots rule the world?“Of course we need to be alive to potential risks and whether our regulatory frameworks need updating,” he said.“But the bigger challenge when it comes to AI is making sure that Australia does not fall behind globally in this competitive field.“Australia produces fewer than 200 PhDs a year in AI; we need to build the number of skilled AI professionals.”Cut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis from Jacqueline Maley.

Is AI a good stock to buy?
Presently, AI as a revenue segment earns lesser income than the other larger divisions for tech companies in India. So investors hoping to enter a tech company in the hope of an AI boom must take this into account. Unlike in the US, there is not any listed stock in India that earns a majority of its revenues from an AI product.
Thus, at this point in time, investors should take a holistic approach to investing in companies instead of being solely focused on their AI capabilities.
In Closing 
The current technological swing towards AI has attracted several companies to invest in the technology. This also has resulted in investors wanting a piece of the action. Investing in the right Artificial Intelligence stocks will be extremely fruitful in the long term.

However, as we delve deeper into the AI landscape, we must acknowledge and understand its distinct forms. Among the emerging trends, generative AI, a subset of AI, has shown immense potential in reshaping industries. But how does it differ from traditional AI? Let's unpack this question in the spirit of Bernard Marr's distinctive, reader-friendly style.
The Difference Between Generative AI And Traditional AI: An Easy Explanation For AnyoneAdobe Stock

Traditional AI: A Brief Overview

Traditional AI, often called Narrow or Weak AI, focuses on performing a specific task intelligently. It refers to systems designed to respond to a particular set of inputs. These systems have the capability to learn from data and make decisions or predictions based on that data. Imagine you're playing computer chess. The computer knows all the rules; it can predict your moves and make its own based on a pre-defined strategy. It's not inventing new ways to play chess but selecting from strategies it was programmed with. That's traditional AI - it's like a master strategist who can make smart decisions within a specific set of rules. Other examples of traditional AIs are voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation engines on Netflix or Amazon, or Google's search algorithm. These AIs have been trained to follow specific rules, do a particular job, and do it well, but they don’t create anything new.

Generative AI: The Next Frontier

Generative AI, on the other hand, can be thought of as the next generation of artificial intelligence. It's a form of AI that can create something new. Suppose you have a friend who loves telling stories. But instead of a human friend, you have an AI. You give this AI a starting line, say, 'Once upon a time, in a galaxy far away...'. The AI takes that line and generates a whole space adventure story, complete with characters, plot twists, and a thrilling conclusion. The AI creates something new from the piece of information you gave it. This is a basic example of Generative AI. It's like an imaginative friend who can come up with original, creative content. What’s more, today’s generative AI can not only create text outputs, but also images, music and even computer code. Generative AI models are trained on a set of data and learn the underlying patterns to generate new data that mirrors the training set.
PROMOTED
Consider GPT-4, OpenAI’s language prediction model, a prime example of generative AI. Trained on vast swathes of the internet, it can produce human-like text that is almost indistinguishable from a text written by a person.
The Key Difference
The main difference between traditional AI and generative AI lies in their capabilities and application. Traditional AI systems are primarily used to analyze data and make predictions, while generative AI goes a step further by creating new data similar to its training data.

In other words, traditional AI excels at pattern recognition, while generative AI excels at pattern creation. Traditional AI can analyze data and tell you what it sees, but generative AI can use that same data to create something entirely new.

Practical Implications
The implications of generative AI are wide-ranging, providing new avenues for creativity and innovation. In design, generative AI can help create countless prototypes in minutes, reducing the time required for the ideation process. In the entertainment industry, it can help produce new music, write scripts, or even create deepfakes. In journalism, it could write articles or reports. Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize any field where creation and innovation are key.

On the other hand, traditional AI continues to excel in task-specific applications. It powers our chatbots, recommendation systems, predictive analytics, and much more. It is the engine behind most of the current AI applications that are optimizing efficiencies across industries.
The Future of AI
While traditional AI and generative AI have distinct functionalities, they are not mutually exclusive. Generative AI could work in tandem with traditional AI to provide even more powerful solutions. For instance, a traditional AI could analyze user behavior data, and a generative AI could use this analysis to create personalized content.
As we continue to explore the immense potential of AI, understanding these differences is crucial. Both generative AI and traditional AI have significant roles to play in shaping our future, each unlocking unique possibilities. Embracing these advanced technologies will be key for businesses and individuals looking to stay ahead of the curve in our rapidly evolving digital landscape.
We have only just started on the journey of AI innovation. Recognizing the unique capabilities of these different forms of AI allows us to harness their full potential as we continue on this exciting journey.

According to the Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra), 87% of the guild’s actors make less than $26,000 per year.‘Bargaining for our very existence’: why the battle over AI is being fought in HollywoodRead moreThe use of AI in the production of film and television – either to write scripts, generate actors’ likenesses, or cut corners in paying creative work, has been a major point of contention in negotiations between the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) and Sag and the Writers Guild of America (WGA). Writers have been striking since May; the actors joined earlier this month. The first joint strike since 1960 threatens to bring Hollywood to a complete standstill.The position, first reported by the Intercept, is a new role to “increase the leverage of our machine learning platform”, billed as “the foundation for all of this innovation”. The job lists vague qualifications related to machine learning, but alludes to the company’s farther-reaching goals for AI in “all areas of business”. A separate “machine learning” section on the company’s website says the company will use AI to “shape our catalog of movies and TV shows by learning characteristics that make content successful” and to “optimize the production of original movies and TV shows”.This is not the only new AI position sought by Netflix. The Intercept reported that the company is also seeking to hire a technical director for generative AI at its gaming studio for up to $650,000 a year. Generative AI can produce text, images and video from input data, which could be used to create original content or for advertising purposes. The company’s generative AI efforts have already borne fruit: earlier this month, Netflix premiered a new Spanish reality dating series, Deep Fake Love, in which scans of contestants’ faces and bodies are used to create “deepfake” simulations of themselves, and the company’s gaming department has used AI to produce narratives and dialogue.Disney has also listed several machine learning-related positions, though it has not specified the salary range. During a recent earnings call, chief executive Bob Iger, who has called actors’ and writers’ demands for greater compensation “unrealistic”, hinted at potential issues the company could face in integrating AI into their business model. “In fact, we’re already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers,” he said, as reported by journalist Lee Fang.“But it’s also clear that AI is going to be highly disruptive, and it could be extremely difficult to manage, particularly from an IP management perspective.”AI has been an intense flashpoint in the first few weeks of the joint strike, especially after Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Sag-Aftra’s chief negotiator, said that studios had “proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get paid for one day’s pay, and their company should own that scan, their image, their likeness, and to be able to use it for rest of eternity, on any project they want, with no consent and no compensation”.The AMPTP has disputed that description as a “mischaracterization” of their proposal meant to “garner support for its work stoppage.”Explore more on these topicsCultureUS actors' strike 2023Artificial intelligence (AI)NetflixUS writers' strike 2023Film industryComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveKamala Harris campaign announces raising record $81m in first 24 hours of candidacy – livePilot, 26, dies as her plane crashes after skydiving flight over Niagara FallsBen Jennings on Joe Biden endorsing Kamala Harris – cartoonYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

What generative AI really means for the economy, jobs and education

LIKE IT or not, the age of generative AI is upon us. Anyone with an internet connection now has access to tools that can answer almost every question under the sun, write everything from university essays to computer code and produce art or photorealistic images.
The jury is still out on whether all this represents a stride towards super-intelligent AI. Even if progress stagnates, however, the capabilities available today could profoundly affect the economy, jobs, education, culture and more. So how is the current generation of AI going to reshape the world, and your life, in the next five to 10 years?
Broadly speaking, forecasters are predicting that generative AI will boost economic productivity and growth in advanced economies. A report released by Goldman Sachs in March predicts that generative AI could, within a decade, raise annual global GDP by 7 per cent, which translates to a roughly $7 trillion increase. “The combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation and a productivity boost for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a labor productivity boom like those that followed the emergence of earlier general-purpose technologies like the electric motor and personal computer,” says the report.
The idea is that AI will make millions of “knowledge workers”, like scientists, editors, lawyers and doctors, more productive within a few years. But the truth is that these things are hard to predict and assess, especially as the output of such workers is notoriously difficult to measure.
One area where generative AI is stoking anxiety is employment, but the picture could be different to previous waves of automation, says Avi Goldfarb…

Changing Workforce Underscores Growth of Artificial Intelligence


Ben Hernandez




              July 26, 2023            











As a disruptive technology, artificial intelligence is also looking to disrupt the workforce, altering the demand for more skilled labor that supplements the use of AI.
According to a HR Today article, a Cengage Group’s 2023 Employability Report surveyed 1,000 graduates who completed a degree or non-degree program in the last 12 months along with 1,000 U.S. hiring decision makers. As AI technology comes to the forefront and is permeating business operations in various sectors, over half of graduates said that AI is forcing them to re-think their skillset and how to best prepare for this technological revolution.
“The workplace has changed rapidly in the last few years, and now we are witnessing a new shift as AI begins to reshape worker productivity, job requirements, hiring habits and even entire industries,” said Michael Hansen, CEO of Cengage Group. “With new technology comes both new uncertainties and new opportunities for the workforce, and educators and employers must do more to prepare today’s workers for these technological shifts.”
As the trend continues and companies are shifting to hiring AI-related skills, it opens up opportunities for exchange traded fund (ETF) investors. Short-term traders looking to capitalize on the moves can also take advantage of the shift as well.



Trade the AI Trend
In particular, for the short term, consider the Direxion Daily Robotics, Artificial Intelligence & Automation Index Bull 2X ETF (UBOT). UBOT seeks daily investment results equal to 200% of the daily performance of the Indxx Global Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index, which aims to provide exposure to exchange-listed companies in developed markets expected to benefit from the adoption and utilization of robotics and/or artificial intelligence.
Key characteristics of UBOT:

The Indxx Global Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index (IBOTZNT) is designed to provide exposure to exchange-listed companies in developed markets that are expected to benefit from the adoption and utilization of robotics and/or artificial intelligence, including companies involved in developing industrial robots and production systems, automated inventory management, unmanned vehicles, voice/image/text recognition, and medical robots or robotic instruments, as determined by the index provider, Indxx.

Plans on the agenda to develop artificial intelligence


Society


July 25, 2023 - 16:42






TEHRAN - The Vice Presidency for Science and Technology has prepared three comprehensive plans to develop artificial intelligence in different sectors.Currently, artificial intelligence is the first priority for the development of technology and is pursued with three programs, IRNA quoted Rouhollah Dehqani-Firouzabadi, the vice president for science and technology, as saying.
Artificial intelligence is a comprehensive technology and affects all other areas of technology, he highlighted.
“The plans in the field of artificial intelligence include scientific development programs that are mostly pursued in universities. The second plan is technology development programs that are pursued in companies that work in the field of artificial intelligence. And the third plan is the creation of a national technology hub in the field of artificial intelligence.""
AI roadmap
Last year, the roadmap for the development of artificial intelligence was drafted after a year of scientific work with the participation of academic and industrial figures from both the public and the private sectors.
The study of the national artificial intelligence development roadmap document started in 2021 at the Research Institute of Information and Communication Technology and was officially completed by the end of November 2022.
The document is presented in two general sections, “application development” and “development of enablers”, Mohammad-Shahram Moein, head of the innovation and development center of artificial intelligence at the Research Institute of Information and Communication Technology, said.
“In the application development section, the main goal is to use artificial intelligence in priority areas such as health, transportation, and agriculture, and in the next priorities, areas such as education, industry, and environment have been considered.
In the development of enablers, we have considered the training of specialized manpower, the development of infrastructure, and the development of the innovation system,” he explained.
The AI roadmap document includes 10 major goals, 9 strategies, and 156 activities for which a ten-year horizon is envisaged, he said.
In order to develop the processing infrastructure, we have started equipping the ultra-fast processing center of the Center for Innovation and Development of Artificial Intelligence. We have also addressed the issues of regulation and standardization, which are very important, in addition to the implementation of service delivery platforms and infrastructures, data markets, and open data.
Moein expressed hope that in the framework of ethical issues while protecting the privacy of individuals, implement the document with the participation of all related institutions and witness its positive impact on the country’s ecology and employment.
Iran’s progress in artificial intelligence
Iran is in 13th place among the top countries in artificial intelligence by the total number of publications in 2021, according to the Nature Index database.
The SCImago ranking database at the University of Granada, Spain, ranks countries and universities based on the number of scholarly articles from higher education institutions in the Scopus database. This ranking uses three indicators of research, innovation, and society in combination.
In the 2020 version of SCImago, the subject of artificial intelligence is a subcategory of computer science, which ranks Iran as 15th in the world and first in West Asia.
Also, in cognitive sciences as a subset of psychology, which is one of the disciplines related to artificial intelligence, Iran ranks 36th in the world and third in West Asia.
In electrical and electronic engineering, which has a part of artificial intelligence, Iran is ranked 15th in the world and first in West Asia.
AI potential to accelerate human development
The UN Secretary-General addressed the Security Council on Tuesday, emphasizing the potential of artificial intelligence to accelerate human development while also cautioning against the malicious use of what is revolutionary new technology.
António Guterres said that if AI became primarily a weapon to launch cyberattacks, generate deepfakes, or for spreading and hate speech, it would have very serious consequences for global peace and security. “Look no further than social media.
Tools and platforms that were designed to enhance human connection are now used to undermine elections, spread conspiracy theories, and incite hatred and violence,” he said.
“Malfunctioning AI systems are another huge area of concern. And the interaction between AI and nuclear weapons, biotechnology, neurotechnology, and robotics, is deeply alarming.”
Importance of science and technology
In July 2022, Peyman Salehi, the deputy science minister, said despite U.S. sanctions, the international activities of Iranian scientists have increased year by year so that more than 35 percent of Iranian articles in Scopus have been multi-national projects.
Science diplomacy is the use of scientific collaborations among nations to address common problems and build constructive international partnerships.
It is a form of new diplomacy and has become an umbrella term to describe a number of formal or informal technical, research-based, academic, or engineering exchanges, within the general field of international relations.
The national budget bill for the current Iranian calendar year 1402, which started on March 21, has earmarked about 37 trillion rials ($75 million) for science and technology.
The bill increased the budget by 35 percent compared to the past year’s budget, ISNA reported.
The Vice Presidency for Science and Technology was formed in 2006 with the aim of creating an environment for supporting knowledge-based companies and providing the ground for the development of technological industries.
A total of 8,034 knowledge-based companies have so far been established across the country.
Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei designated the current Iranian calendar year as the year of “Production: Knowledge-Based and Job-Creating.”
Over the past couple of years, the concept of a ‘knowledge-based company’ has changed to a ‘knowledge-based society’, meaning that supporting knowledge-based companies will lead to many social and economic advantages for the public.
The Leader reemphasized the importance of boosting domestic production, as he had done in past years, saying the reason he placed so much emphasis on production was “because it boosts economic growth, it creates employment, it reduces inflation, it increases per capita income and it improves public welfare.”
To this end, the Vice Presidency for Science and Technology has executed and supported several projects toward the goal of boosting knowledge-based production.
Moreover, the development of an innovation ecosystem is on the agenda, according to which 65 houses of innovation have been set up across the country.
The Innovation and Prosperity Fund has paid a total of 240 trillion rials (nearly $500 million) to support knowledge-based companies over the [Iranian calendar] year 1400 (March 2021-March 2022). MG

Signed by more than 9,000 writers, including prominent authors like George Saunders and Margaret Atwood, it asked the likes of Alphabet, OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft “to obtain consent, credit, and fairly compensate writers for the use of copyrighted materials in training AI.” The plea is just the latest in a series of efforts by creatives to secure credit and compensation for the role they claim their work has played in training generative AI systems.You DiedGenerative AI in Games Will Create a Copyright CrisisWill BedingfieldStage LeftWhy Hollywood Really Fears Generative AIWill BedingfieldArtificial IntelligenceHollywood’s Screenwriters Are Right to Fear AIWill BedingfieldThe training data used for large language models, or LLMs, and other generative AI systems has been kept clandestine. But the more these systems are used, the more writers and visual artists are noticing similarities between their work and these systems’ output. Many have called on generative AI companies to reveal their data sources, and—as with the Authors Guild—to compensate those whose works were used. Some of the pleas are open letters and social media posts, but an increasing number are lawsuits.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTIt’s here that copyright law plays a major role. Yet it is a tool that is ill equipped to tackle the full scope of artists’ anxieties, whether these be long-standing worries over employment and compensation in a world upended by the internet, or new concerns about privacy and personal—and uncopyrightable—characteristics. For many of these, copyright can offer only limited answers. “There are a lot of questions that AI creates for almost every aspect of society,” says Mike Masnick, editor of the technology blog Techdirt. “But this narrow focus on copyright as the tool to deal with it, I think, is really misplaced.”Featured VideoPro Interpreters vs. AI Challenge: Who Translates Faster and Better?The most high-profile of these recent lawsuits came earlier this month when comedian Sarah Silverman, alongside four other authors in two separate filings, sued OpenAI, claiming the company trained its wildly popular ChatGPT system on their works without permission. Both class-action lawsuits were filed by the Joseph Saveri Law Firm, which specializes in antitrust litigation. The firm is also representing the artists suing Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt for similar reasons. Last week, during a hearing in that case, US district court judge William Orrick indicated he might dismiss most of the suit, stating that, since these systems had been trained on “five billion compressed images,” the artists involved needed to “provide more facts” for their copyright infringement claims.The Silverman case alleges, among other things, that OpenAI may have scraped the comedian’s memoir, Bedwetter, via “shadow libraries” that host troves of pirated ebooks and academic papers. If the court finds in favor of Silverman and her fellow plaintiffs, the ruling could set new precedent for how the law views the data sets used to train AI models, says Matthew Sag, a law professor at Emory University. Specifically, it could help determine whether companies can claim fair use when their models scrape copyrighted material. “I'm not going to call the outcome on this question,” Sag says of Silverman’s lawsuit. “But it seems to be the most compelling of all of the cases that have been filed.” OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment.At the core of these cases, explains Sag, is the same general theory: that LLMs “copied” authors’ protected works. Yet, as Sag explained in testimony to a US Senate subcommittee hearing earlier this month, models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 do not “copy” work in the traditional sense. Digest would be a more appropriate verb—digesting training data to carry out their function: predicting the best next word in a sequence. “Rather than thinking of an LLM as copying the training data like a scribe in a monastery,” Sag said in his Senate testimony, “it makes more sense to think of it as learning from the training data like a student.”Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenThis is pertinent to fair use, the part of US copyright law that generally protects the unlicensed use of copyrighted works for things like scholarship and research. Because if the analogy is correct, then what’s going on here is akin to how a search engine builds its index—and there’s a long history of Google using exactly this argument to defend its business model against claims of theft. In 2006 the company defeated a suit from Perfect 10, an adult entertainment site, for providing hyperlinks and thumbnails of subscriber-only porn in its search results. In 2013 it convinced a New York court that scanning millions of books, and making snippets of them available online, constituted fair use. “In my view, Google Books provides significant public benefits,” US circuit judge Denny Chin wrote in his ruling. In 2014, a judge found in favor of HathiTrust Digital Library, a spinoff of Google Books, in a similar case.Sag reckons that defendants in similar generative AI lawsuits will use a similar augment: Yes, data goes in, but what comes out is something quite different. Therefore, while it might seem commonsensical that a human reading and a machine “reading” are inherently different activities, it’s not clear the courts will see it that way. And there’s another question mark lingering over whether a machine can make a derivative work at all, says Daniel Gervais, a professor of intellectual property and AI law at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee: The US Copyright Office maintains that only humans can produce “works.”If the arguments from the defense hold, then there’s the matter of where those books came from. Several of the experts WIRED spoke to agree that one of the more compelling arguments against OpenAI centers on the secretive data sets the company allegedly used to train its models. The claim, appearing verbatim in both of the recent lawsuits, is that the Books2 data set, which the lawsuits estimate contains 294,000 books, must, by its very size, hold pirated material. “The only internet-based books corpora that has ever offered that much material are notorious ‘shadow library’ websites like Library Genesis (aka LibGen), Z-Library (aka B-ok), Sci-Hub, and Bibliotik,” the lawsuits claim.The reason OpenAI would plunder pirated data is simple: These sites contain a bounty of the highest-quality writing, on a massive range of subjects, produced by a diverse range of authors. Sag argues that the use of copyrighted works such as books may have helped make LLMs “more well-rounded,” something that may have been difficult if, say, they were only trained on Reddit posts and Wikipedia articles.There's no precedent in the US that directly links fair use with whether the copyrighted works were obtained legally or not. But, says Sag, there's also no stipulation that unlawful access is irrelevant in such cases. (In the European Union, it's stipulated that data-mining operations must get legal access to the information they use.)Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenOne way to look at this problem is to claim that lawful access is irrelevant to inspiration, an argument Masnick recently made on Techdirt. “If a musician were inspired to create music in a certain genre after hearing pirated songs in that genre, would that make the songs they created infringing?” he wrote.Masnick’s worry is that some stricter imagining of copyright infringement, aiming to rein in generative AI, could have an unintended chilling effect on creativity. Earlier this year, the US Copyright Office launched an initiative to investigate AI issues. “I fear that saying ‘we can’t learn from these other artists without compensating them,’ creates really big problems for the way that that art is created and the way that content creators learn,” he says. “The normal way that content creators of all stripes become their own content creators is they see someone else and they are inspired by them.”On the other hand, if someone spends years writing a novel, shouldn't copyright ensure that they are compensated if someone else uses their works for commercial purposes? “You could frame this as undermining the incentives of the copyright system,” says Sag. Simply put, if generative AI systems can scrape copyrighted works without compensating writers and churn out something in a similar style, does that lower the incentives for people to create such works in the first place?These lawsuits, even if they are unsuccessful, are likely to provoke generative AI companies into taking steps to avoid them. These steps are unlikely to make happy reading for artists. These firms could, for example, obtain licensing agreements to use copyrighted works in their training data. It's been widely reported that this would be analogous to how, say, Spotify licenses music—albeit on controversial terms—in a way the original version of Napster didn’t. Drake, for example, could license out his discography so fans can conjure Drake-like AI croonings of their own.Another possible future sees artists asked to opt in to allowing their work to be used as training data. Roblox, which has been cautious with its in-house tools, is considering a model like this for content made by its users, while Adobe has been similarly careful with Firefly, training it on Adobe Stock images and licensed and public domain content. The Associated Press also recently announced a deal to license its news stories to OpenAI.Ultimately, though, the technology is not going away, and copyright can only remedy some of its consequences. As Stephanie Bell, a research fellow at the nonprofit Partnership on AI, notes, setting a precedent where creative works can be treated like uncredited data is “very concerning.” To fully address a problem like this, the regulations AI needs aren't yet on the books.",,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-copyright-law/'}","The training data used for large language models, or LLMs, and other generative AI systems has been kept clandestine.

And there’s another question mark lingering over whether a machine can make a derivative work at all, says Daniel Gervais, a professor of intellectual property and AI law at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee: The US Copyright Office maintains that only humans can produce “works.”
The reason OpenAI would plunder pirated data is simple: These sites contain a bounty of the highest-quality writing, on a massive range of subjects, produced by a diverse range of authors. Sag argues that the use of copyrighted works such as books may have helped make LLMs “more well-rounded,” something that may have been difficult if, say, they were only trained on Reddit posts and Wikipedia articles.
There's no precedent in the US that directly links fair use with whether the copyrighted works were obtained legally or not. But, says Sag, there's also no stipulation that unlawful access is irrelevant in such cases. (In the European Union, it's stipulated that data-mining operations must get legal access to the information they use.)
One way to look at this problem is to claim that lawful access is irrelevant to inspiration, an argument Masnick recently made on Techdirt. “If a musician were inspired to create music in a certain genre after hearing pirated songs in that genre, would that make the songs they created infringing?” he wrote.
Masnick’s worry is that some stricter imagining of copyright infringement, aiming to rein in generative AI, could have an unintended chilling effect on creativity. Earlier this year, the US Copyright Office launched an initiative to investigate AI issues. “I fear that saying ‘we can’t learn from these other artists without compensating them,’ creates really big problems for the way that that art is created and the way that content creators learn,” he says. “The normal way that content creators of all stripes become their own content creators is they see someone else and they are inspired by them.”
On the other hand, if someone spends years writing a novel, shouldn't copyright ensure that they are compensated if someone else uses their works for commercial purposes? “You could frame this as undermining the incentives of the copyright system,” says Sag. Simply put, if generative AI systems can scrape copyrighted works without compensating writers and churn out something in a similar style, does that lower the incentives for people to create such works in the first place?
Another possible future sees artists asked to opt in to allowing their work to be used as training data. Roblox, which has been cautious with its in-house tools, is considering a model like this for content made by its users, while Adobe has been similarly careful with Firefly, training it on Adobe Stock images and licensed and public domain content. The Associated Press also recently announced a deal to license its news stories to OpenAI.
Ultimately, though, the technology is not going away, and copyright can only remedy some of its consequences. As Stephanie Bell, a research fellow at the nonprofit Partnership on AI, notes, setting a precedent where creative works can be treated like uncredited data is “very concerning.” To fully address a problem like this, the regulations AI needs aren't yet on the books.",,,,,,,,,Writers and artists want compensation from AI firms that they claim have trained their models on copyrighted works.

How is generative AI relevant to telecom operators?

Discussion around generative AI has quickly become a mainstay in conference presentations and earnings calls. The predominant thinking is that if you’re an enterprise, including a mobile network operator or other communications service provider, you’ve got to have a plan to put generative AI to work. So, to start, are generative AI tools like ChatGPT relevant to the telecoms set? 
Speaking on a recent webinar hosted by RCR Wireless News, VIAVI Solutions Regional CTO for EMEA Chris Murphy explained that solutions like ChatGPT, Midjourney and the like have garnered so much attention because their outputs are “readily tangible and visualizable…but this is just a start…In specialized areas such as telecoms, generative models are starting to have quite an impact and that impact is only going to grow as time goes on.” Murphy was also quick to point out that these types of generative AI tools are “part of a whole ecosystem of the technology of machine learning and artificial intelligence.” 
Before digging deeper, let’s take a moment to recap types of classic machine learning algorithms that have reached a comparatively high degree of maturity, new innovations in machine learning, and new innovations effectively upgrading tech that’s been around for decades. Mature machine learning algorithms include things like regression, classification, clustering and dimensionality reduction. Newer machine learning innovations–which are also giving a material boost classic approaches–include things like transfer learning, reinforcement learning, automated machine learning and, of course, content generation. 
As Murphy put it, “There are whole new disruptions in the technology from transfer learning allowing us to train models in a general sense and then apply them to a particular focus area. Reinforcement learning where we can learn to interact with the system in an optimal way, and auto ML where we can automate, to some degree, the generation of the machine learning models and the way we train it to take away some of the expertise that’s needed to generate some of these very interesting applications.” This idea of taking a large, general model then honing the focus for a particular type of business or type of business process aligns with how enterprises are actually using generative AI; enterprises are using models trained on domain-specific, proprietary data rather than the collective knowledge of humanity as it exists online. 
Back to the relevance of ChatGPT and similar generative AI tools to the telecom industry: “We’re starting to see operators implementing large language models for helping their to do their jobs in better, more creative ways.” AT&T, for instance, in June announced Ask AT&T, an internal tool that uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT functionality that uses corporate data in a dedicated cloud tenant provide by Microsoft’s Azure. AT&T employees are using Ask AT&T to streamline software development and coding, and language translation. Other use cases the operator is “exploring” are network optimizing, updating legacy code, customer care effectiveness, HR support, “and fundamentally changing the way we work with the ability to reduce employee meeting time by providing automated summaries and action items.” 
What else can generative AI do for operators? 
The big idea behind generative AI is predicting what’s next. You give ChatGPT a text-based prompt and it tells you which words come next, whether that’s to write a poem, draft an academic essay, supplement web searches or assist in developing code or HR documentation. “When we can predict the future,” Murphy said, “we can come prepared for it ahead of time in spinning up the resources required. If we anticipate an increase in demand, we can run what-if scenarios, for example, to measure our resilience to certain scenarios.”

He continued: “We can generate synthetic data, which is tremendously valuable, for example, for training our models using realistic data without having to collect that realistic data in large volumes. And this all leads into things like digital twin, which is an enabler for all sorts of training scenarios of optimization to drive our telecommunication networks to the next level…ChatGPT is in the collective consciousness, but I guess what I’m saying is that this is just one small piece of what’s going on in the technology, and there’s a lot more that will be at least as important as the large language models are for telecommunications.” For more on this idea of creating a digital twin of the network, read “From real to lab to live—continuous testing in the era of AI.”
Generative AI at the edge
Big picture, 5G is continuing to evolve and continuing to become more complex. Virtualization and disaggregation are happening in tandem with deployment of network workloads in hybrid cloud environments, including distributed clouds deep in the network at radio sites or even at customer premises. This is prompting organizational overhauls wherein operators are establishing DevOps workflows and setting up CI/CD pipelines to take advantage of the network’s flexibility. And all of this is in service of delivering new types of (largely) enterprise-facing services that set the stage for new lines of revenue and more effective network monetization.
Against this dynamic, complex backdrop, data is king. “The data can be aggregated in different ways, everything from subscriber level, the individual user level through to aggregated by network function and network components,” Murphy said. “So we’ve got a lot of data. That’s good news because we’ve got some interesting models, but we have to be careful about how we use the data…If we’re making decisions about how to schedule our data or how to adapt our MIMO, these decisions need to be made right at the edge because those are very short-term decisions based on the channel conditions, for example, and we need to be able to react to those changes.” 
With the goal of leveraging data to predict the future then prepare to react accordingly, the edge is an important focal point in the larger context of 5G monetization. 5G is designed to support low-latency applications over the air interface, but to do this requires moving compute out of centralized data centers and  closer to the people and devices creating the data. “There’s an interesting challenge here of how to deal with the data that we have to squeeze the maximum value out of…So the data that we use for training, it may be generated at the edge and be in large volumes. And we might want to be careful about transferring [that data] to the datacenter for training models which then need to be operated at the edge.” Hence the importance of AI optimized for edge deployments. 
In summary, “We’re lucky to have a lot of data that we can draw on to build the best models, train in the right place, in the optimal place, operate in the optimal place to deliver performance improvements and the ability to deliver the interesting and disruptive services,” Murphy said.

As some of the work done by humans will be taken over by artificial intelligence then perhaps there will be an opportunity to reduce working hours for humans.

But for healthcare providers, &#x22;paperwork&#x22; expands. For a doctor to perform services and be paid by various insurance or reimbursment systems, the doctor may now have to provide documentation about WHY a treatment was chosen as the appropriate measure, what is the literature or experimental justification for the medical procedure? The incremental value of this extra effort is by no means obvious, but a complex medical system may drift towards requiring such new things.

For example if we look upon the working of the IIOT(Industrial Internet of Things), all the manual work or the physical work is done by the robots or the machines or even the M2M level machines if smart devices are not required. In such ecosystems the humans are only only keeping the supervisory controllers or the cyber physical system controllers. They make the algorithm, models, etc. for the machines, this saves a lot of time and human efforts. There are still such jobs that work on the physical layer but are quite scarce, these people are mainly into the maintenance of the machines. We will take another an example that is related to the medical sciences, The drug testing would be faster  and safer if we use AI, for example, if a drug has to be tested on a tissue for let&#x27;s say the researchers are finding a drug that would be more cytotoxic for the tumor that has been growing on the tissue and would be a safer alternative than the existing drugs. To do this process manually it would take many days to find out the results and would be more costly as they have to maintain the health of the tissue artificially int the lab, but if we do it with the help of AI the prediction models would take significantly less time to analyze and predict the result as well as less man power would be needed and it would be more cost efficient.\nConclusion: With the increasing popularity in the field of AI the people won&#x27;t lose jobs, if they are kept updated with the modern technical knowledge. The AI will definitely decrease the number of manual jobs but will open many other. In my perspective the people should adapt to the modern technology and the knowledge associated with it. There is too much more to explore in this field that the people won&#x27;t get chance to reduce their workload. Also the growth in all the sectors would increase exponentially with AI.\n\nThank you\nadityaajmi@gmail.com', 'dateCreated': '2023-07-28T18:19:50+00:00', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/post/Will_the_increase_in_the_scale_of_artificial_intelligence_applications_make_it_possible_to_reduce_human_labor_hours#view=64c406c618d1274fb9095196', 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Aditya Ingole', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aditya-Ingole-4'}}, {'@type': 'Answer', 'upvoteCount': 1, 'text': 'For the first time since 1960, actors and screenwriters are on strike at the same time.\nAs with many of the other strikes that have rippled across the United States over the past three years, this walkout is over demands for better pay and restrictions on their employers&#x2019; use of technology to replace paid work...\nAlthough residuals and the number of episodes have until now been negotiable, perhaps the strike&#x2019;s biggest issue is the studios&#x2019; use of artificial intelligence.\nActors fear studios will use AI to replace actors in the future.

Let&#x27;s delve into this paradigm shift in the milieu of human work engagement.\nAI&#x27;s potential in redefining work hours is a premise we cannot sidestep. With an increasing array of tasks capable of automation, the quantum of human engagement reduces, positing a potential shift to a shorter work week and enhanced leisure space. Nonetheless, the following critical considerations warrant attention:\nOccupational Transmutation: While AI is capable of driving efficiency, it&#x27;s also a catalyst for job displacement, particularly for roles centered around manual and routine tasks. This necessitates societal constructs that help transition individuals impacted by this metamorphosis.\nSectoral Disparity: The penetration and impact of AI vary across industries and job roles. Occupations requiring multifaceted decision-making, innovative ideation, or superior interpersonal skills are less prone to full automation. Consequently, a homogeneous reduction in working hours may not be applicable across the board.\nEconomic Shift: Implementing a reduction in work hours demands a significant alteration in our prevailing economic structures. Despite the potential for augmented leisure, it may concomitantly cause a contraction in income unless remuneration models are recalibrated.\nSociocultural Adaptation: A significant dimension is the societal value associated with work, transcending pure economics to encompass social and psychological constructs. A sizable reduction in work hours would demand a concomitant transition in societal attitudes encompassing work and leisure.\nConsidering these multifaceted elements, the proposition of reduced work hours in light of AI advancements is fascinating, albeit layered with complexity. The viability of such a transformation would likely hinge on myriad factors - the rate of AI evolution, institutional responses, societal adaptation to evolving work-leisure paradigms, and more.\nThis topic undoubtedly merits ongoing scholarly discourse and empirical research.', 'dateCreated': '2023-07-31T18:27:03+00:00', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/post/Will_the_increase_in_the_scale_of_artificial_intelligence_applications_make_it_possible_to_reduce_human_labor_hours#view=64c7fcf64a266d60fe06b825', 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Subharun Pal', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Subharun-Pal'}}, {'@type': 'Answer', 'upvoteCount': 5, 'text': 'AI has already begun to impact the job and work environment, and this trend will continue.

How does ChatGPT work and do AI-powered chatbots “think” like us?
The large language models behind the new chatbots are trained to predict which words are most likely to appear together – but “emergent abilities” suggest they might be doing more than that

Illustronaut/Alamy
The current whirlwind of interest in artificial intelligence is largely down to the sudden arrival of a new generation of AI-powered chatbots capable of startlingly human-like text-based conversations. The big change came last year, when OpenAI released ChatGPT. Overnight, millions gained access to an AI producing responses that are so uncannily fluent that it has been hard not to wonder if this heralds a turning point of some sort.
There has been no shortage of hype. Microsoft researchers given early access to GPT4, the latest version of the system behind ChatGPT, argued that it has already demonstrated “sparks” of the long-sought machine version of human intellectual ability known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). One Google engineer even went so far as to claim that one of the company’s AIs, known as LaMDA, was sentient. The naysayers, meanwhile, insist that these AIs are nowhere near as impressive as they seem.
All of which can make it hard to know quite what you should make of the new AI chatbots. Thankfully, things quickly become clearer when you get to grips with how they work and, with that in mind, the extent to which they “think” like us.
At the heart of all these chatbots is a large language model (LLM) – a statistical model, or a mathematical representation of data, that is designed to make predictions about which words are likely to appear together.
LLMs are created by feeding huge amounts of text to a class of algorithms called deep neural networks, which are loosely inspired by the brain. The models learn complex linguistic patterns by playing a simple game:…

(Bloomberg)By  Annabelle TimsitJuly 26, 2023 at 11:09 a.m. EDTMore women than men stand to lose their jobs by the end of the decade because of the rise of artificial intelligence and automation, according to a new report by the McKinsey Global Institute.The report, published Wednesday, finds that nearly a third of hours worked in the United States could be automated by 2030.Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.Industries that are expected to shrink the most because of automation are food services, customer service and sales, and office support. Women are overrepresented in these sectors — and hold more low-paying jobs than men — so they stand to be more affected, the report finds.Black and Hispanic workers, workers without college degrees, and the youngest and oldest workers also are more likely to have to find new jobs by 2030, the study says.Story continues below advertisementAccording to the report, by 2030, at least 12 million workers will need to change jobs as the industries in which they work shrink — 25 percent more than the institute predicted in a report published in February 2021. Most of those workers will be at the low end of the pay scale, and they probably will need to acquire new skills before they can transition into new industries.AdvertisementThe report says the labor market also will be upended over the next decade by the government’s investments in green technology, the growing demand for health-care workers as the U.S. population ages and the structural changes to the workforce brought about by the pandemic. It says these trends will converge with advancements in artificial intelligence to increase demand for some existing jobs, create new jobs for new industries and make other jobs obsolete.How artificial intelligence could affect the workforce and the global economyToday’s low-wage workers are the most vulnerable to job losses by 2030 across all categories, according to the McKinsey report. It finds that workers earning less than $38,200 could account for almost 80 percent of all potential career transitions in that period. This means that retail salespeople, cashiers and other low-wage workers — among whom a larger proportion are women — are particularly vulnerable.Story continues below advertisementAlthough advances in artificial intelligence will make some jobs obsolete, it also could have some positive effects on existing jobs and create new work opportunities, according to the report. For white-collar workers, automation could mean less time doing rote or technical tasks, and more time spent on creative or strategic work that artificial intelligence cannot do — yet. The report finds that lawyers and civil engineers are among the workers who stand to benefit most. But workers in more-manual fields, such as health care or agriculture, do tasks that cannot be automated as easily.Advertisement“We see generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright,” the authors wrote.💻Follow TechnologyFollowBut these fields are male-dominated. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2022, women accounted for only 17.1 percent of civil engineers and 38.5 percent of lawyers.AI learned from their work. Now they want compensation.While new technologies are expected to create new jobs, those jobs may not all be desirable, says Kerry McInerney, a research fellow at the Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence at Cambridge University. Workers who are more likely to be in low-paying jobs with long hours or difficult conditions today could in the future “get pushed into areas like data labeling,” which is the process of adding labels to videos, images or audio that teach machine learning models to recognize what is in them. Those jobs “can be psychologically very harmful,” because of the nature of the material that has to be identified, McInerney says.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe findings align with existing research showing that women will be affected by the waves of workforce automation differently from men.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextAppeals court blocks Biden’s student loan repayment planSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.The Persian Gulf is enduring life-threatening heat indexes above 140 degreesSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Paul Hollywood is right: Don’t refrigerate breadSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Bob Newhart, who went from standup comedy to sitcom star, dies at 94SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Social anxiety can be limiting.

It also could be an opportunity, they argue, to “recruit from populations that are often overlooked,” such as older workers, workers without college degrees, workers with disabilities or employment gaps, and those who have been incarcerated.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementEmployers also could use AI to find and hire these kinds of candidates, the report suggests.But research on the current use of artificial intelligence in hiring suggests that AI “doesn’t grapple very well with different kinds of life experiences, different patterns of coming in to work,” McInerney says. It may ask a candidate who has just had a baby what she does in her spare time, for instance, and rank that candidate on the basis of her answer without taking into account that the candidate may not have as much time for hobbies, she says.Automated hiring systems that are based on AI may be able to find candidates with nontraditional backgrounds, she says, “but they’re not necessarily going to treat them equitably.”Share51 CommentsNewsletterWednesdaysThe Color of MoneyAdvice on how to save, spend and talk about your money for the short and long term from Michelle Singletary.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Here’s How Digital Double Tech WorksMotion capture and detailed face scans allow TV and film production teams to replicate a performer’s likeness. Generative AI is making the process faster and easierBy Lauren LefferAn employee stands in a cage in which dozens of cameras simultaneously capture his image during a presentation of a photogrammetry process at the headquarters of French video games developer and publisher Quantic Dream in Paris. The photogrammetry process is used to develop video games. Christophe Archambault/AFP via Getty ImagesArtsInside the orb, the world is reduced to a sphere of white light and flashes. Outside the orb’s metallic, skeletal frame is darkness. Imagine you are strapped into a chair inside this contraption. A voice from the darkness suggests expressions: ways to pose your mouth and eyebrows, scenarios to react to, phrases to say and emotions to embody. At irregular intervals, the voice also tells you not to worry and warns that more flashes are coming soon.“I don’t think I was freaked out, but it was a very overwhelming space,” says an actor who asked Scientific American to withhold his name for privacy reasons. He’s describing his experience with “the orb,” his term for the photogrammetry booth used to capture his likeness during the production of a major video game in 2022. “It felt like being in [a magnetic resonance imaging machine],” he says. “It was really very sci-fi.” This actor’s experience was part of the scanning process that allows media production studios to take photographs of cast members in various positions and create movable, malleable digital avatars that can subsequently be animated to perform virtually any action or motion in a realistic video sequence.Advances in artificial intelligence are now making it steadily easier to produce digital doubles like this—even without an intense session in the orb. Some actors fear a possible future in which studios will pressure them to sign away their likeness and their digital double will take work away from them. This is one of the factors motivating members of the union SAG-AFTRA (the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) to go on strike. “Performers need the protection of our images and performances to prevent replacement of human performances by artificial intelligence technology,” the union said in a statement released a few days after the strike was announced in mid-July.Although AI replacement is an unsettling possibility, the digital doubles seen in today’s media productions still rely on human performers and special effects artists. Here’s how the technology works—and how AI is shaking up the established process.How Digital Double Tech WorksOver the past 25 years or so, it has become increasingly common for big-budget media productions to create digital doubles of at least some performers’ face and body. This technology almost certainly plays a role in any movie, TV show or video game that involves extensive digital effects, elaborate action scenes or an actor’s portrayal of a character at multiple ages. “It’s become kind of industry standard,” says Chris MacLean, visual effects supervisor for the Apple TV show Foundation.*The photogrammetry booth is an area surrounded by hundreds of cameras, sometimes arranged in an orb shape and sometimes around a square room. The cameras capture thousands of intentionally overlapping two-dimensional images of a person’s face at a high resolution. If an actor’s role involves speaking or showing emotion, pictures of many different facial movements are needed. For that reason, starring performers require more extensive scans than secondary or background cast members. Similarly, larger setups are used to scan bodies.With those data, visual effects (VFX) artists take the model from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. The overlap of the photographs is key. Based on camera coordinates—and those redundant overlapping sections—the images are mapped and folded in relation to one another in a process akin to digital origami. Artists can then rig the resulting 3-D digital double to a virtual “skeleton” and animate it—either by directly following an actor’s real-world, motion-captured performance or by combining that performance with a computer-generated series of movements. The animated figure can then be placed in a digital landscape and given dialogue—technically, it’s possible to use a person’s scans to create photorealistic video footage of them doing and saying things that actor never did or said.Curated by Our EditorsAI Promises Humanity One Last Job.

AcarHumans Find AI-Generated Faces More Trustworthy Than the Real ThingEmily WillinghamGhost in the Sell: Hollywood's Mischievous Vision of AILarry GreenemeierPoem: ‘An Ars Poetica’Allison FunkSpecial effects artists can also apply an actor’s digital performance to a virtual avatar that looks completely different from the human person. For instance, the aforementioned video game actor says he made faces in the orb and recorded his lines in a recording booth. He also physically acted out many scenes in a separate studio with his fellow performers for motion capture, a process similar to photogrammetry but designed to record the body’s movements. When players engage with the final product, however, they won’t see this actor on-screen. Instead his digital double was modified to look like a villain with a specific appearance. The final animated character thus manifested both the actor’s work and the video game character’s traits.Film and television productions have used this process for decades, although it has historically been both labor intensive and expensive. Despite the difficulty, digital doubles are common. Production teams frequently use them to make small adjustments that involve dialogue and action. The tech is also employed for larger edits, such as taking a group of 100 background actors and morphing and duplicating them into a digital crowd of thousands. But it’s easier to accomplish such feats in a convincing way if the original footage is close to the desired final output. For instance, a background actor scanned wearing a costume meant to replicate clothing worn in 19th-century Europe would be difficult to edit into a dystopian future in which their digital double wears a space suit, MacLean says. “I don’t think there’s any way that the studios would have that much patience,” he adds.Yet generative artificial intelligence, the same sort of machine-learning technology behind ChatGPT, is starting to make aspects of the digital double process quicker and simpler.AI Swoops InSome VFX companies are already using generative AI to speed up the process of modifying a digital double’s appearance, MacLean notes. This makes it easier to “de-age” a famous actor in films such as Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which includes a flashback with a younger-looking version of now 81-year-old Harrison Ford. AI also comes in handy for face replacement, in which an actor’s likeness is superimposed over a stunt double (essentially a sanctioned deepfake), according to Vladimir Galat, chief technology officer of the Scan Truck, a mobile photogrammetry company.Galat says advances in AI have made some photogrammetry scans unnecessary: A generative model can be trained on existing photographs and footage—even of someone no longer living. Digital Domain, a VFX production company that worked on Avengers: Endgame, says it’s also possible to create fake digital performances by historical figures. “This is a very new technology but a growing part of our business,” says Hanno Basse, Digital Domain’s chief tech officer.So far living humans have still been involved in crafting performances “by” the deceased. A real-word actor performs a scene, and then effects artists replace their face with that of the historical person. “We feel the nuances of an actor’s performance, in combination with our AI and machine learning tool sets, is critical to achieving photorealistic results that can captivate an audience and cross the uncanny valley,” Basse says, referring to the eerie sensation sometimes caused by something that looks almost—but not quite—human.Sign Up for Our Daily NewsletterEmail AddressBy giving us your email, you are agreeing to receive the Today In Science newsletter and to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Sign UpThank you for signing up! Check out our other newslettersFears of Robot ReplacementThere’s a difference between adjusting a digital double and replacing a person’s performance entirely with AI, says computer engineer Jeong Joon “JJ” Park, who currently researches computer vision and graphics at Stanford University and will be starting a position at the University of Michigan this fall. The uncanny valley is wide, and there’s not yet a generative AI model that can produce a complete, photorealistic, moving scene from scratch—that technology is not even close, Park notes. To get there, “there needs to be a major leap in the intelligence that we’re developing,” he says. (AI-generated images may be hard to tell from the real thing, but crafting realistic still images is much easier than creating video meant to represent 3-D space.)Still, the threat of abuse of actors’ likeness looms. If one person’s face can be easily swapped over another’s, then what’s to stop filmmakers from putting Tom Cruise in every shot of every action movie? What will prevent studios from replacing 100 background actors with just one and using AI to create the illusion of many? A patchwork of state laws means that, in most places, people have legal ownership over their own likeness, says Eleanor Lackman, a copyright and trademark attorney. But she notes that there are broad exceptions for artistic and expressive use, and filmmaking could easily fall under that designation. And regardless of the law, a person could legally sign a contract giving their own likeness rights over to a production company, explains Jonathan Blavin, a lawyer specializing in media and tech. When it comes to protecting one’s digital likeness, it all comes down to the specifics of the contract—a situation SAG-AFTRA is well aware of.The actor who played the video game villain felt comfortable being scanned for his role last year. “The company I worked with was pretty aboveboard,” he says. But in the future, he may not be so quick to enter agreements. “The capabilities of what AI can do with face capture, and what we saw from the [prestrike negotiations], is scary,” he says. The actor loves video games; he was excited to act in one and he hopes to do so again. But first, he says, “I would double-check the paperwork, check in with my agency—and possibly a lawyer.”*Editor’s Note (7/25/23): This sentence was edited after posting to clarify Chris MacLean’s position at the Apple TV show Foundation.Rights & PermissionsLauren Leffer is a contributing writer and former tech reporting fellow at Scientific American.

BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Smartsheet (NYSE:SMAR), the enterprise work management platform, today unveiled a suite of new capabilities that apply generative AI (GenAI) to Smartsheet’s secure, scalable platform to help enterprises tackle their mission-critical work more strategically and efficiently. The new features are now available to select customers in private beta.


“We believe GenAI will dramatically–and positively–impact how work gets done, from planning to execution to scaling”Post this

As the leader in enterprise work management, Smartsheet is integrating its new GenAI features across its platform to improve how enterprises plan, do, and scale their work. By connecting large language models (LLMs) to customers’ private business data, Smartsheet can securely deliver insights and data visualizations and help build project and portfolio management solutions in response to simple natural language questions.


Smartsheet optimizes its platform to enable our enterprise customers to meet their security and governance needs now and into the future, and it is taking the same approach when applying GenAI. Customers own their information, and that information is never available for other customers to see or use, nor will it be available as training data to underlying LLMs. As Smartsheet continues to apply GenAI to its platform, it will build in ways to ensure customers understand the recommendations and insights AI provides so they can confidently take action without any additional work on their end.


“We believe GenAI will dramatically–and positively–impact how work gets done, from planning to execution to scaling,” said Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO. “Our platform is inherently flexible so it can adapt to how our customers want to work. As we apply powerful GenAI capabilities across the Smartsheet platform, we’re focused on maintaining customer trust through accurate and actionable insights and recommendations.”


From solving real business challenges faster to quickly finding new insights to inform critical business decisions to scaling work across an entire organization, Smartsheet is unleashing the power of its platform with GenAI to deliver even greater value for customers.



Actionable insights in seconds: The new insights feature connects LLMs with customers’ private business data in Smartsheet to deliver sheet-level insights and data visualizations in seconds, while applying a comprehensive approach to security, compliance, and privacy so their data always stays secure. New AI insights synthesize data into helpful insights and visual charts via simple conversational prompts like, “Which programs were over budget last month by department?” Initially, customers can tap into insights about an individual sheet; in the future, insights will be derived from data across thousands of active projects and data stores, unlocking new portfolio-level insights.

Smartsheet has data store capabilities designed to house millions of rows so customers can leverage their large external datasets from other platforms like ERPs and CRMs within the Smartsheet platform. This creates a more connected work environment and the potential for rich new insights into a customer’s business.



Get answers fast–in the context of your work: Need help building, configuring, or extending a solution? The new AI-powered help assistant will enable customers to get a customized response based on where they are in the context of their work. The help assistant provides natural language responses based on the platform’s help, online Community, and supplemental materials. It can also prompt users on how to get started with different features based on where they are in Smartsheet and what they’ve been working on, helping anyone take their Smartsheet solution to the next level.



Accelerate productivity: Smartsheet helps enterprises transform how work gets done across their organization. Smartsheet customers will now be able to tap into GenAI to quickly build sophisticated solutions that fit their unique needs.

The new AI solution builder will quickly find and personalize the right template so customers can get started building sophisticated solutions in seconds. The AI help assistant will also generate formulas based on a simple description of what information a user wants. Formulas drive processes and automation in Smartsheet, but they take time to master. With this new feature, anyone will be able to generate advanced formulas to power their work at scale. Additionally, users will be able to effortlessly generate video captions and image descriptions while easily manipulating images for quick editing in Brandfolder by Smartsheet, streamlining their content management process and saving hours of work.



""There has been tremendous investment in generative AI, but especially in the collaborative work management space,"" according to Wayne Kurtzman, Research VP for social and collaboration at IDC. ""Smartsheet’s generative AI capabilities align with the market need to use generative AI with a wide array of business data to create new forms of efficiencies, productivity, and alignment across an enterprise that were previously not possible.""


“I am very impressed by capabilities demonstrated by the Smartsheet GenAI features, and would be excited to use these in my everyday work at Vertiv,” said Joshua Schnack, VP of Program Management and Business Initiatives at Vertiv. “Based on what I’ve seen so far, these new AI features are powerful and could provide unique value to my Smartsheet experience. I expect that these upleveled capabilities would give me and my whole organization more confidence and insights that will help us make better decisions, more quickly.”


The new GenAI features announced today are only the latest in AI at Smartsheet. The platform’s first AI innovation came over five years ago, and AI fuels experiences across Smartsheet today, like building workflows without writing code and tagging images behind the scenes.


Committed to Developing AI Responsibly

The Smartsheet mission is to empower anyone to drive meaningful change. Integral to that mission is the commitment to developing AI responsibly and ensuring Smartsheet GenAI capabilities are people-centric, fair, trustworthy, and understandable.


Smartsheet customer data will not be commingled, and no customer data will be included in a training data set used by third-party AI model providers. Smartsheet also performs due diligence to ensure the AI model providers it partners with have comprehensive data privacy and security standards that align with its AI principles. Additionally, Smartsheet is committed to ensuring its AI recommendations and insights are easily understood. In the future, customers will be able to ask Smartsheet questions like, “Why did you make that recommendation?” or “How did you reach that conclusion?”


To learn more about how Smartsheet is applying GenAI throughout its platform:

 Generative AI tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are producing increasingly convincing visuals. Yet, they rely on vast databases of creatives' work to generate their content. At this point, you might be wondering whether there’s a way to protect your work from AI tools and the answer is: it’s complicated. 







 How Do Generative AI Tools Use Artists' Work? 
 Generative AI tools use machine learning models that are trained to perform actions using large datasets. Let’s say we’re talking about an AI image generator like Midjourney. In this case, the datasets used for training include billions of image and text pairs—from the work of legendary artists like Picasso to pro and amateur creatives alike. 

 AI art generators use these media-text pairings to generate visual content in response to user text prompts. Basically, they use the work of existing artists and match patterns to text pairings (social posts, captions, alt-text, etc.) so users can generate new visuals from prompts like “a starry night sky in the style of Vincent van Gogh” or “a neo-noir scene of a detective drinking whiskey in 1950s Downtown LA”. 



 Why Are So Many Artists Upset? 
 The biggest complaint from creatives is that generative AI tools use their work without permission. They’re not simply using their work to train algorithms, either. 





 The marketing talk about generative AI suggests these tools create unique content, but they don’t. What they really do is combine data from multiple pieces of art and splice it together to generate something that matches the user’s prompt. 

 The term AI generation itself is misleading. AI replication would be more accurate, and the trick with these tools is they replicate large volumes of artwork and blend them together. 

    

 Generative AI tools are designed to replace creatives—and they're doing so by using their artwork. And, as if that's not bad enough, most AI tools do all of this without asking permission, offering any compensation, or even crediting the original creators. 







 Can You Stop Generative AI Tools Accessing Your Artwork? 
 Unfortunately, the only way to prevent AI tools from accessing any of your content is to publish nothing online. It may sound extreme, but this is the reality. Sure, you can use the robots.txt file on your website to block AI tools from scraping your website, or protect your images from AI by opting out of training datasets, but these methods have several limitations. 

 Firstly, commands in the robots.txt file are advisory, meaning sites are under no legal obligation to adhere. Secondly, you would have to block a company like Google from crawling your website, which is basically SEO suicide. And lastly, the robots.txt file only gives you (limited) control over access to your website, it does nothing to protect the content you publish elsewhere: social media, cloud services, and so on. 

 Unfortunately for creatives, the landscape is going to get worse before it gets better. 






 Google's Privacy Policy Could Mean It Uses All Online Content to Train Its AI Algorithms 
 In July 2023, Google updated its privacy policy to say it will use online content to train its AI systems, including Brad, Google Translate, and others. Google uses the phrasing “publicly accessible sources”. Here’s the quote that raised some alarm bells following the update: 


 “For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features, like Google Translate, Bard and Cloud AI capabilities.” – 
Google Privacy Policy



 In other words, Google is now saying that anything you publish online is up for grabs. At the very least, Google makes it easy to compare updates to its privacy policy by highlighting the most recent changes: 






    

 As you can see, the changes in wording are quite subtle, but the implications are significant. Previously, the primary functions of Google’s language models were interpreting search queries and translating text into other languages. 

 Now, the company says it may use all publicly accessible sources to train its full suite of AI models. This includes its generative AI system, Bard, and expands beyond language models to include all of Google's AI tools/features—the most obvious example being image generation. 

 Social Networks Can Use Any Content You Publish on Their Platforms 
 Meta also has unfettered access to everything published on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. This is standard practice for social platforms if you read the T&Cs. As soon as you upload anything to a social network, they have the rights to use and reuse it in any fashion they wish. 





 Plenty of social users have found companies using their images in ads without permission, including creatives. Unfortunately, if that company happens to be the social network you uploaded the image to, the network's parent company, or another brand owned by the same parent company, you're out of luck. 

 For most people, the chances of a platform like Instagram using one of their images for an ad campaign are seriously low. However, Meta is almost certainly using your images, videos, and posts to train its AI algorithms. 

 Services Like Adobe May Access and Use Your Work to Train Their Algorithms 
 In January 2023, Adobe caught some heat for an update to its T&Cs. The language appeared to suggest Adobe could use images uploaded to its cloud services by photographers to train its AI algorithms. 

 The specific wording was as follows: 


 “Adobe may analyze your content using techniques such as machine learning (e.g. for pattern recognition) to develop and improve our products and services.” 






 To make matters worse, Adobe was automatically opting users into this content analysis system, meaning they had to manually switch it off in their account settings. Understandably, creatives didn’t respond too kindly and Adobe fanned the flames by not initially responding to criticism. 

 Weeks later, Adobe stated that no customer data is being used to train its generative AI tools. The company called the incident a wake-up call and vowed to clear up any confusion by making the wording of its policy more specific. 

 Either way, the fact remains that if Adobe wants to use customer data to train its AI systems, there’s nothing anyone can do about it—other than boycott. At the same time, Adobe is getting its data for tools like Generative Fill from somewhere, so it's using artists’ work, one way or another. 






 Tech Companies Have Almost Unlimited Access to Your Data... for Now 
 As things stand, tech giants like Google and Meta have almost unlimited access to creatives’ data. Scrutiny over their handling of user data is almost as old as the internet, yet privacy regulations are still playing catch-up. 

 It took the European Union until 2018 to implement its GDPR privacy guidelines and they've done little to protect user data. 

 Generative AI is a new minefield altogether with almost no regulations in place to restrict the actions of technology companies in this space. For the time being, companies like Google and OpenAI can do almost anything they want with our data, and this isn’t going to change any time soon. 



 Ultimately, It Will Take Lawsuits and Regulations to Protect Artists From AI 
 Until generative AI and its access to user data are regulated, creatives are almost powerless to stop the technology. The most likely scenario would be changes to copyright laws or, potentially, new data protections related to creative ownership. In either case, it will take a long time to see any new regulations introduced and, then, enforced. 





 The silver lining for creatives is that the lawsuits against generative AI are piling up fast and this could speed up the legal response. The bad news is that some of the tech companies involved have the legal funds to drag these cases through the most time-consuming avenues of due process. 

 In the meantime, the ethical questions hanging over AI art generation will linger.

AWS unveils generative AI tools for QuickSight BI platform


The tech giant introduced two natural language processing features aimed at making dashboard developers more efficient and enabling more business users to work with data.

Published: 26 Jul 2023


 
AWS on Wednesday unveiled new generative AI features for Amazon QuickSight Q aimed at enabling developers and business users to work with data more efficiently by using exclusively natural language.







The capabilities are part of QuickSight Q, a natural language query tool within the QuickSight analytics platform first launched in September 2021. The features were revealed during AWS Summit New York, an in-person event for AWS customers.
AWS is calling the Ask Q and Build for Me options -- which the tech giant said will be generally available soon -- within QuickSight's dashboard creation environment generative BI.
Both were developed using Amazon Bedrock, an AWS service first introduced in April 2023 that provides access to generative AI and large language model capabilities.

New capabilities
One of the main potential benefits of generative AI is enabling more than just data experts to work with their organization's data. Another is increased efficiency by enabling data experts to work more easily with their organization's data.
QuickSight Q's new generative AI features address both.
The Build for Me option is aimed at dashboard developers. By clicking an icon, developers will be able to build and add to dashboards by simply typing commands in natural language, doing in minutes what previously might have taken hours.
Ask Q is a data storytelling tool aimed at business analysts who often need to put in hours to summarize their work in order to share it with colleagues and develop presentations.
By clicking on Ask Q and using natural language to describe the data to summarize, such as sales figures for a given period, narrative summaries are automatically generated that can then be shared and presented. In addition, users are given filtering options that address, for example, the length of summaries and the style, such as full sentences and paragraphs or bullet points.



Natural language query is a significant addition for any business intelligence tool. It makes analytics accessible to a much larger portion of the organization.


David Menninger Analyst, Ventana Research




The simplicity the features enable, meanwhile, make them useful, according to David Menninger, an analyst at Ventana Research.
""Natural language query is a significant addition for any business intelligence tool,"" he said. ""It makes analytics accessible to a much larger portion of the organization.
""No need to know SQL and the concept of joins and subqueries,"" Menninger added, referring to coding terms.
As a result, QuickSight will become usable by more people within organizations already deploying the platform, he continued.
""Building or tuning visualizations with natural language will expand the use of QuickSight in organizations,"" he said. ""For decades, business intelligence tools have been built for analysts, not for the mainstream line-of-business personnel. These new features help address that shortcoming.""
Beyond simplifying the use of QuickSight and enabling more people to use the platform, adding Ask Q and Build for Me to QuickSight's authoring environment make the platform's generative AI capabilities comparable with those introduced by some of QuickSight's competitors, according to Menninger.
To date, BI platforms including Microsoft Power BI, Qlik, Tableau and ThoughtSpot are among the many with generative AI capabilities in the works. Now, QuickSight is also among them.
""Several vendors have delivered or are delivering similar types of natural language features,"" Menninger said. ""These new features put Amazon out front with the leaders -- perhaps leading in some respects, such as building visualizations with natural language and fast followers in natural language query.""
The essential aim of QuickSight's new generative AI capabilities is to both make current BI users more efficient and enable more people within organizations to work with data, according to QuickSight general manager Tracy Daugherty.
For decades, due to a combination of factors including platforms aimed at data experts rather than self-service users and organizations' own lack of data literacy training, BI use within the enterprise has been stuck at around a quarter of employees.
Generative AI has the potential to change that, given its understanding of true natural language rather than a limited set of business terms and commands.
""The motivation is to create a situation where less people need to be trained on BI tools,"" Daugherty said. ""I want every user within an organization to be able to make data-driven decisions. The motivation is to provide tools for individuals in the places they are, so they can get insights from data.""
He added that customer requests provided the impetus for developing generative AI capabilities for QuickSight Q and adding the Build for Me and Ask Q options.
Daugherty noted that dashboard developers wanted to save time while business users wanted to be able to author their own additions to dashboards and more easily develop narratives to share and present their work.

AWS

Amazon QuickSight customers can now build and edit dashboards using natural language rather than code.







Future plans
While Build for Me and Ask Q represent QuickSight's first generative AI capabilities, they are just the start of the generative AI plans AWS has for QuickSight, according to Daugherty.
He declined to divulge specific plans but noted that the roadmap for QuickSight includes adding generative AI throughout the platform.
""We're going to infuse this technology throughout the BI experience,"" Daugherty said. ""This is the starting place. Right now, we're starting with the authoring experience and the stories experience. In BI, there are many other things we can leverage on this front as well.""
Menninger, meanwhile, noted that while QuickSight is now in line with its competitors with respect to generative AI, there are still areas where the platform has room for improvement.
When first introduced in 2016, QuickSight was a basic BI platform but not as full-featured as some others. Its main differentiators were price and its native connection to the rest of the AWS ecosystem. In recent years, additions such as Q and embedded analytics capabilities have added depth to the platform.
Still, however, QuickSight still has room to grow relative to its competition, according to Menninger.
In particular, he noted that QuickSight doesn't yet have some of the decision intelligence capabilities some other platforms now have as central pillars.
""Where I'd like to see more from Amazon is in the area of decision intelligence [such as] helping organizations evaluate different scenarios and how they would impact the business,"" Menninger said. ""As it stand now, with QuickSight and many other vendors, that part of the process needs to be conducted outside of the business intelligence tools and often in spreadsheets.""

Apple is quietly working on artificial intelligence tools that could challenge those of OpenAI, Alphabet’s Google and others, but the company has yet to devise a clear strategy for releasing the technology to consumers.
The iPhone maker has built its own framework to create large language models — the AI-based systems at the heart of new offerings like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard — according to people with knowledge of the efforts. With that foundation, known as “Ajax,” Apple also has created a chatbot service that some engineers call “Apple GPT.”
In recent months, the AI push has become a major effort for Apple, with several teams collaborating on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The work includes trying to address potential privacy concerns related to the technology.
Apple shares gained as much as 2.3 per cent to a record high of $198.23 after Bloomberg reported on the AI effort Wednesday, rebounding from earlier losses. Microsoft, OpenAI’s partner and main backer, slipped about one percent on the news.
A spokesman for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.
The company was caught flat-footed in the past year with the introduction of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google Bard and Microsoft’s Bing AI. Though Apple has woven AI features into products for years, it’s now playing catch-up in the buzzy market for generative tools, which can create essays, images and even video based on text prompts. The technology has captured the imagination of consumers and businesses in recent months, leading to a stampede of related products.
Apple’s AI integration
Apple has been conspicuously absent from the frenzy. Its main artificial intelligence product, the Siri voice assistant, has stagnated in recent years. But the company has made AI headway in other areas, including improvements to photos and search on the iPhone. There’s also a smarter version of auto-correct coming to its mobile devices this year.
Publicly, chief executive officer Tim Cook has been circumspect about the flood of new AI services hitting the market. Though the technology has potential, there are still a “number of issues that need to be sorted,” he said during a conference call in May. Apple will be adding AI to more of its products, he said, but on a “very thoughtful basis.”
In an interview with Good Morning America, meanwhile, Cook said he uses ChatGPT and that it’s something that the company is “looking at closely.”
Apple’s Ajax
Behind the scenes, Apple has grown concerned about missing a potentially paramount shift in how devices operate. Generative AI promises to transform how people interact with phones, computers and other technology. And Apple’s devices, which produced revenue of nearly $320bn in the last fiscal year, could suffer if the company doesn’t keep up with AI advances.
That’s why Apple began laying the foundation for AI services with the Ajax framework, as well as a ChatGPT-like tool for use internally. Ajax was first created last year to unify machine learning development at Apple, according to the people familiar with the effort.
The company has already deployed AI-related improvements to search, Siri and maps based on that system. And Ajax is now being used to create large language models and serve as the foundation for the internal ChatGPT-style tool, the people said.
The chatbot app was created as an experiment at the end of last year by a tiny engineering team. Its rollout within Apple was initially halted over security concerns about generative AI, but has since been extended to more employees. Still, the system requires special approval for access. There’s also a significant caveat: Any output from it can’t be used to develop features bound for customers.
Even so, Apple employees are using it to assist with product prototyping. It also summarises text and answers questions based on data it has been trained with.
Apple isn’t the only one taking this approach. Samsung Electronics and other technology companies have developed their own internal ChatGPT-like tools after concerns emerged about third-party services leaking sensitive data.
Apple employees say the company’s tool essentially replicates Bard, ChatGPT and Bing AI, and doesn’t include any novel features or technology. The system is accessible as a web application and has a stripped-down design not meant for public consumption. As such, Apple has no current plans to release it to consumers, though it is actively working to improve its underlying models.
Beyond the state of the technology, Apple is still trying to determine the consumer angle for generative AI. It’s now working on several related initiatives — a cross-company effort between its AI and software engineering groups, as well as the cloud services engineering team that would supply the infrastructure for any significant new features. While the company doesn’t yet have a concrete plan, people familiar with the work believe Apple is aiming to make a significant AI-related announcement next year.
John Giannandrea, the company’s head of machine learning and AI, and Craig Federighi, Apple’s top software engineering executive, are leading the efforts. But they haven’t presented a unified front within Apple, said the people. Giannandrea has signaled that he wants to take a more conservative approach, with a desire to see how recent developments from others evolve.
Around the same time that it began developing its own tools, Apple conducted a corporate trial of OpenAI’s technology. It also weighed signing a larger contract with OpenAI, which licenses its services to Microsoft, Shutterstock and Salesforce.
Apple’s Ajax system is built on top of Google Jax, the search giant’s machine learning framework. Apple’s system runs on Google Cloud, which the company uses to power cloud services alongside its own infrastructure and Amazon.com’s AWS.
As part of its recent work, Apple is seeking to hire more experts in generative AI. On its website, it is advertising for engineers with a “robust understanding of large language models and generative AI” and promises to work on applying that technology to the way “people communicate, create, connect and consume media” on iPhones and its other devices.
An ideal spot for Apple to integrate its LLM technology would be inside Siri, allowing the voice assistant to conduct more tasks on behalf of users. Despite launching in 2011, before rival systems, Siri lagged competitors as Apple focused on other areas and adopted fewer features in favor of privacy.
In his May remarks, Cook defended the company’s AI strategy, saying the technology is used across much of its product lineup, including in features like car-crash and fall detection. More recently, Cook said that LLMs have “great promise,” while warning about the possibility of bias and misinformation. He also called for guardrails and regulation in the space.
The company expanded its artificial intelligence efforts in 2018 with the hiring of Giannandrea, who previously led search and AI at Google. Since then, Apple hasn’t released many splashy new AI features, but at least two initiatives could help put it on the map.
The company is planning a new health coaching service codenamed Quartz that relies on data from an Apple Watch and uses AI to personalise plans, Bloomberg reported in April. And the company’s future electric car will use artificial intelligence to power the vehicle’s self-driving capabilities.

AI is pretty good at producing C-level writing, but it’s almost never good enough to publish on its own (and doing so can carry with it a host of copyright-related risks.) With a smart human editor/co-author, however, AI-generated work can act as a springboard to quickly producing quality work.
Here’s how to polish, fact-check and rewrite content from ChatGPT and other generative AI technology from prompt to publish
And for the record, except where indicated, this story is 100% human authored.

Write specific prompts.

Better inputs lead to better outputs. The more specific you can be in your initial request to your robot friend, the stronger your results will be.
Rather than simply asking it, “write a blog post about why you should donate to charity,” instead try something like: “Write a 300-word persuasive story explaining why Gen Z should donate to charities that help with food insecurity. Include information about how many people in Indiana are food insecure, the effects of food insecurity on children, and end with a strong call-to-action to donate. Your target audience is people aged 18-25 living in Indianapolis who have never donated to charity before. Cite your sources at the end. Use AP style.”
Yes, this means you’ll take a bit more time on the front-end crafting your prompt, but you’re more likely to get a helpful, effective output.

Ask it to cite sources — and check those sources.

If you ask ChatGPT to cite sources, it will usually append them at the end of the article. Using the prompt above, I got these three sources:
Feeding America. (2021). “Indiana Food Insecurity Rate.” feedingamerica.org/your-local-foodbank/indiana/.
Feeding Indiana’s Hungry. (2022). “Childhood Hunger.” feedingindianashungry.org/childhood-hunger/.
USDA. (2021). “Household Food Security in the United States in 2020.” ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/104600/err-275.pdf.
Take the time to visit each website it offers. Ensure that they exist and that they say what the chatbot says they said — hallucinations are very real. Additionally, see if there might be other interesting nuggets you can pull out with your human judgement that might better suit your needs. Use that research as a springboard to go deeper. Make sure to properly credit the work in your piece as needed using hyperlinks or in-line citation.

Add specific details, anecdotes and emotion.

ChatGPT can only give you general writing, and what separates OK writing from great writing is specificity. It’s why one of the first rules of reporting is to always get the dog’s name. These little details of personality and depth help forge emotional connections — and no robot can do that. Yet.
Think of what generative AI gave you to be an outline. It’s up to you to put meat on the bones. Add specific stories — in our example above, maybe that’s about someone whose life was changed by a food pantry, or a specific organization that needs more help. Add more details that can appeal to your target audience, like emotional triggers that will specifically resonate with people who live in Indianapolis. Give your AI tinman a beating heart.

Edit extensively and skeptically.

AI can be terrible at following directions. For instance, it often flagrantly ignores word count, giving you more than double what you’ve requested. I’ve yet to see it properly follow AP style in a meaningful way. So it’s up to you to hold it accountable and ensure it meets your specifications. Do not trust and always verify. To repeat an analogy, think of AI as an intern on their first day. They can produce some great stuff, but they need strong oversight and guidance to succeed to your specifications.
If a certain phrase strikes you as really strong — Google it. Make sure it isn’t plagiarism. Fact check everything, beyond merely the citations you’ve been given.
And take the time to punch up the language. Remember that generative AI works by guessing the right word to put in a sentence, one after the other. That doesn’t often contribute to scintillating, unique text that gets readers to sit up and take notice. It’s on you to take some time to add your brand voice and the value and insight only you can bring to a piece
By the time you’ve completed these steps, you should have a finished piece that bears little resemblance to what ChatGPT gave you. That’s by design. This unique, factchecked piece stands on the shoulders of ChatGPT, but is your handiwork.
Nice job.

As Hollywood executives insist it is “just not realistic” to pay actors — 87 percent of whom earn less than $26,000 — more, they are spending lavishly on AI programs.
While entertainment firms like Disney have declined to go into specifics about the nature of their investments in artificial intelligence, job postings and financial disclosures reviewed by The Intercept reveal new details about the extent of these companies’ embrace of the technology.
In one case, Netflix is offering as much as $900,000 for a single AI product manager. 
Hollywood actors and writers unions are jointly striking this summer for the first time since 1960, calling for better wages and regulations on studios’ use of artificial intelligence. 



Just after the actors’ strike was authorized, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers — the trade association representing the TV and film companies negotiating with the actors and writers unions — announced “a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors’ digital likenesses for SAG-AFTRA members.” 
The offer prompted comparisons to an episode of the dystopian sci-fi TV series “Black Mirror,” which depicted actress Salma Hayek locked in a Kafkaesque struggle with a studio which was using her scanned digital likeness against her will. 
“Having been poor and rich in this business, I can assure you there’s enough money to go around; it’s just about priorities.”
“So $900k/yr per soldier in their godless AI army when that amount of earnings could qualify thirty-five actors and their families for SAG-AFTRA health insurance is just ghoulish,” actor Rob Delaney, who had a lead role in the “Black Mirror” episode, told The Intercept. “Having been poor and rich in this business, I can assure you there’s enough money to go around; it’s just about priorities.”
Among the striking actors’ demands are protections against their scanned likeness being manipulated by AI without adequate compensation for the actors. 
“They propose that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get paid for one day’s pay and their company should own that scan, their image, their likeness, and to be able to use it for the rest of eternity in any project they want with no consent and no compensation,” Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, chief negotiator for the actors’ union, SAG-AFTRA, said. 
Entertainment writers, too, must contend with their work being replaced by AI programs like ChatGPT that are capable of generating text in response to queries. Writers represented by the Writers Guild of America have been on strike since May 7 demanding, among other things, labor safeguards against AI. John August, a screenwriter for films like “Big Fish” and “Charlie’s Angels,” explained that the WGA wants to make sure that “ChatGPT and its cousins can’t be credited with writing a screenplay.”

Protecting Actors’ Likenesses
The daily rate for background actors can be around $200, per the SAG-AFTRA contract. A job posting by the company Realeyes offers slightly more than that: $300 for two hours of work “express[ing] different emotions” and “improvis[ing] brief scenes” to “train an AI database to better express human emotions.”
Realeyes develops technology to measure attention and reactions by users to video content. While the posting doesn’t mention work with streaming companies, a video on Realeyes’s website prominently features the logos for Netflix and Hulu. 
The posting is specially catered to attract striking workers, stressing that the gig is for “research” purposes and therefore “does not qualify as struck work”: “Please note that this project does not intend to replace actors, but rather requires their expertise,” Realeyes says, emphasizing multiple times that training AI to create “expressive avatars” skirts strike restrictions.
“The ‘research’ side of this is largely a red herring. Industry research goes into commercial products.”
Experts question whether the boundary between research and commercial work is really so clear. “It’s almost a guarantee that the use of this ‘research,’ when it gets commercialized, will be to build digital actors that replace humans,” said Ben Zhao, professor of computer science at the University of Chicago. “The ‘research’ side of this is largely a red herring.” He added, “Industry research goes into commercial products.”
“This is the same bait-switch that LAION and OpenAI pulled years ago,” Zhao said, referring to the Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network, a German nonprofit that created the AI chatbot OpenAssistant; OpenAI is the nonprofit that created AI programs like ChatGPT and DALL-E. “Download everything on the internet and no worries about copyrights, because it’s a nonprofit and research. The output of that becomes a public dataset, then commercial companies (who supported the nonprofit) then take it and say, ‘Gee thanks! How convenient for our commercial products!’”
Netflix AI Manager
Netflix’s posting for a $900,000-a-year AI product manager job makes clear that the AI goes beyond just the algorithms that determine what shows are recommended to users. 
The listing points to AI’s uses for content creation:“Artificial Intelligence is powering innovation in all areas of the business,” including by helping them to “create great content.” Netflix’s AI product manager posting alludes to a sprawling effort by the business to embrace AI, referring to its “Machine Learning Platform” involving AI specialists “across Netflix.” (Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)
A research section on Netflix’s website describes its machine learning platform, noting that while it was historically used for things like recommendations, it is now being applied to content creation. “Historically, personalization has been the most well-known area, where machine learning powers our recommendation algorithms. We’re also using machine learning to help shape our catalog of movies and TV shows by learning characteristics that make content successful. We use it to optimize the production of original movies and TV shows in Netflix’s rapidly growing studio.”

Netflix is already putting the AI technology to work. On July 6, the streaming service premiered a new Spanish reality dating series, “Deep Fake Love,” in which scans of contestants’ faces and bodies are used to create AI-generated “deepfake” simulations of themselves. 
In another job posting, Netflix seeks a technical director for generative AI in its research and development tech lab for its gaming studio. (Video games often employ voice actors and writers.)
Generative AI is the type of AI that can produce text, images, and video from input data — a key component of original content creation but which can also be used for other purposes like advertising. Generative AI is distinct from older, more familiar AI models that provide things like algorithmic recommendations or genre tags. 
“All those models are typically called discriminatory models or classifiers: They tell you what something is,” Zhao explained. “They do not generate content like ChatGPT or image generator models.”

“Generative models are the ones with the ethics problems,” he said, explaining how classifiers are based on carefully using limited training data — such as a viewing history — to generate recommendations. 
Netflix offers up to $650,000 for its generative AI technical director role. 
Video game writers have expressed concerns about losing work to generative AI, with one major game developer, Ubisoft, saying that it is already using generative AI to write dialogue for nonplayer characters.
Netflix, for its part, advertises that one of its games, a narrative-driven adventure game called “Scriptic: Crime Stories,” centered around crime stories, “uses generative AI to help tell them.”
Disney’s AI Operations
Disney has also listed job openings for AI-related positions. In one, the entertainment giant is looking for a senior AI engineer to “drive innovation across our cinematic pipelines and theatrical experiences.” The posting mentions several big name Disney studios where AI is already playing a role, including Marvel, Walt Disney Animation, and Pixar.
In a recent earnings call, Disney CEO Bob Iger alluded to the challenges that the company would have in integrating AI into their current business model. 
“In fact, we’re already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers,” Iger said, as recently reported by journalist Lee Fang. “But it’s also clear that AI is going to be highly disruptive, and it could be extremely difficult to manage, particularly from an IP management perspective.”
Iger added, “I can tell you that our legal team is working overtime already to try to come to grips with what could be some of the challenges here.” Though Iger declined to go into specifics, Disney’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings provide some clues.
“It seems clear that the entertainment industry is willing to make massive investments in generative AI.”
“Rules governing new technological developments, such as developments in generative AI, remain unsettled, and these developments may affect aspects of our existing business model, including revenue streams for the use of our IP and how we create our entertainment products,” the filing says. 
While striking actors are seeking to protect their own IP from AI — among the union demands that Iger deemed “just not realistic” — so is Disney. 
“It seems clear that the entertainment industry is willing to make massive investments in generative AI,” Zhao said, “not just potentially hundreds of millions of dollars, but also valuable access to their intellectual property, so that AI models can be trained to replace human creatives like actors, writers, journalists for a tiny fraction of human wages.”
For some actors, this is not a struggle against the sci-fi dystopia of AI itself, but just a bid for fair working conditions in their industry and control over their own likenesses, bodies, movements, and speech patterns. 
“AI isn’t bad, it’s just that the workers (me) need to own and control the means of production!” said Delaney. “My melodious voice? My broad shoulders and dancer’s undulating buttocks? I decide how those are used! Not a board of VC angel investor scumbags meeting in a Sun Valley conference room between niacin IV cocktails or whatever they do.”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



“Through our partnership with Microsoft, we’re allowing employees globally to leverage Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service technology and expedite the development of new solutions that empower enterprises to strategically use gen AI for business value,” Harsh Kar, Genpact’s global business leader for data and AI told VentureBeat. “Genpact’s strength in AI and advanced analytics, coupled with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure and the flexibility of Azure OpenAI Service, will be a key differentiator for us and critical to how we drive innovation and outsized impact for clients.”
Providing comprehensive training and resources
To support employees accessing Microsoft Azure’s AI tools and foster a culture of continuous learning and innovation, the company said that it will provide employees with comprehensive training programs and resources. 
These resources include Genpact’s online learning platform Genome, its proprietary data literacy initiative DataBridge and a machine learning (ML) incubator. 
As part of its ongoing commitment to invest in AI capabilities, Genpact has also partnered with Google Cloud to establish a gen AI practice. 
Through this partnership, the company will combine its industry and process expertise with Google Cloud’s gen AI capabilities to build custom enterprise LLMs, business processes and augment operations.
The new practice will bring together a cohesive team of Genpact and Google data scientists, data engineers and domain experts. The primary focus will be capitalizing on their shared clients’ cloud, data and analytics modernization journeys. 
Leveraging generative AI to streamline employee productivity
Genpact aims to empower business teams with gen AI use cases, enhancing employee productivity, operational efficiency and agility while addressing day-to-day challenges faced by enterprises. 
The integration of Azure’s cloud infrastructure and the flexibility of the Azure OpenAI Service is expected to accelerate the development of these solutions.advertisement
“As part of Genpact’s gen AI strategy, we consider different stages of AI adoption within the company: incubation of processes, people tools and technology, and eventually democratization,” Kar told VentureBeat. “To keep up with today’s accelerated pace of innovation, equipping all employees with the necessary skills and knowledge to harness gen AI is not good-to-do, but a must-have.”
Genpact expressed a keen interest in employee experience in its collaboration with Microsoft. 
The company highlighted that its experience agency Rightpoint is a leading Microsoft partner responsible for developing and delivering Microsoft-based applications, services and devices to enhance employee experience.
Strengthening gen AI capabilities
Through the new partnership, Genpact aims to further strengthen its gen AI capabilities and collaborate closely with Microsoft to drive actionable business insights and deliver significant impact for its clients.advertisement
Kar emphasized that LLMs form the core of gen AI at Genpact. The company actively utilizes LLM centers of excellence (CoEs) as a central hub for change management, facilitating the design, integration, scaling and democratization of gen AI prototypes into robust enterprise-grade solutions. 
“These LLM CoEs will enable us to develop AI guidelines, evaluate use cases, implement pilot projects and train our employees in new roles of prompt engineers, prompt compliant checkers and customer protection officers — all of which are critical to continue driving value for our clients in today’s data and AI-driven world,” he said. 
Gen AI upskilling
Genpact recently launched a gen AI skill on Genome, which is part of its flagship tech skilling program TechBridge. This initiative aims to prepare employees for the future AI-driven world by enabling them to master LLMs like ChatGPT through compelling use cases and practical applications. 
The company said that more than 10,000 employees have already been trained, with an additional 25,000 actively learning new gen AI skills.
Moreover, the company has unveiled a data literacy initiative called DataBridge, empowering employees to become proficient in data science techniques — the foundational skills needed to leverage gen AI. 
Genpact asserts that more than 78,000 employees have been trained through this program, enabling them to understand and visualize data effectively and utilize this knowledge to guide decision-making for clients and the company.
Ensuring responsible AI development
The company emphasized its commitment to responsible development and utilization of gen AI tools, recognizing their qualitative differences and potential risks compared to traditional AI. 
To address these concerns, the company has invested in a comprehensive strategy that guides all stakeholders from development to production, integrating four key components: data, foundation models, prompt templates and gen AI application.
Genpact acknowledges that foundation models may produce unintended results, sometimes leading to enterprise-grade solutions that pose challenges when deployed. To mitigate this, the company’s safety framework prioritizes diligent engineering to address privacy risks associated with model selection, ensuring consistent and reliable outputs.
Mitigating data drift
Furthermore, the company said its approach addresses data drift issues by employing metrics that engineers evaluate in collaboration with subject matter experts (SMEs) and industry specialists. These evaluations encompass data quality, anonymization and overall performance, leading to improved data drift mitigation.
“We continuously partner with engineers and other stakeholders to conduct due diligence on the data collected for fine-tuning models,” said Kar. “Our framework applies guardrails to mitigate risks arising due to biases of pre-trained models in the outputs. For instance, the output robustness test for fairness ensures that the AI-generated output complies with fairness and legal frameworks.”
What’s next for Genpact?
Kar revealed that Genpact is witnessing robust client demand for leveraging generative AI, LLMs, ML technologies and AI more broadly in their business operations. Looking ahead, the company aims to further refine talent in data science, AI, ML and engineering. 
Additionally, Genpact plans to train its current employees through upskilling programs, ensuring a steady stream of skilled professionals to meet evolving client requirements.
“We remain bullish on investing in and identifying ways to leverage AI to improve client value creation and internal efficiency,” Kar told VentureBeat. “To increase our opportunities to collaborate with clients and boost our productivity, we plan to invest consistently in R&D and strategic partnerships with leading technology providers and further enhance our capabilities in AI and generative AI. This includes our partnerships with Google Cloud to launch a gen AI practice and Microsoft to leverage its Azure OpenAI Service platform.”

Paul DavidsonUSA TODAYPlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:002:07AD0:15SKIPClosedCaptionOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenAutomation was already expected to wipe out millions of jobs. The pandemic has accelerated their demise.Nearly 9 million workers switched occupations during the health crisis – from 2019 to 2022 – 50% more than in the prior three years, according to a new study by McKinsey Global Institute.Most left low-wage jobs in food services, customer service, office support and production. Meanwhile, high-wage positions grew in fields such as science, technology, health care, business, legal and management, the report says.By 2030, another 12 million workers are likely to change jobs as low-wage positions continue to dwindle and higher-paying professional roles flourish. All told, that would amount to 25% more occupational shifts in the 2020s than McKinsey predicted just two years ago.""This is an opportunity to help drive upwards economic mobility if we can solve mismatches and connect workers with the training they need for these roles,"" says Saurabh Sanghvi, a McKinsey partner and coauthor of the report.Generative artificial intelligence is hastening the effects of automation but will likely alter the nature of professional jobs rather than eliminate them, at least in the short term, the study says.The far-reaching transformation of the labor market is likely to require a big ramp-up in training programs and new hiring practices, the study says.What is the effect of COVID-19 on the workforce?COVID has driven the faster timetable. Many customer-facing jobs, such as in food service and office support, are going away as Americans shift purchases to e-commerce and fewer workers come to offices. Such industries will account for 10 million of the 12 million occupational changes.By 2030, employment is projected to fall by 1.6 million for clerks, 830,000 for retail associates, 710,000 for administrative assistants and 630,000 for cashiers. All those jobs involve repetitive tasks that could be replaced by automation, the report says.So far, openings for such low-wage jobs have actually increased recently but that’s because many workers in those fields are quitting and fewer are taking positions.Meanwhile, managerial and professional jobs paying more than $57,000 a year have grown by about 3.5 million since the pandemic.But it doesn’t necessarily mean workers in lower-paying fields are climbing to higher levels.“It is unclear how many higher-paying roles were filled by people who moved up and how many were filled by new entrants to the labor force,” the study says.What is generative AI?Generative AI is turbocharging the effects of automation. While AI analyzes data to make forecasts, generative AI can identify patterns to create new content, such as software code, products, images, video and conversations, in the case of ChatGPT.That means automation will affect more types of jobs, including professional, technical and managerial positions. But rather than replace jobs, generative AI should allow workers to do more creative, higher-level tasks, the study says.“When managers automate more of their administrative and reporting tasks, for example, they can spend more time on strategic thinking and coaching,” the report says. “Similarly, researchers could speed up projects by relying on automation tools to sort and synthesize large data sets.""Even without generative AI, automation was projected to take over tasks accounting for 21.5% of hours worked by 2030. With the new technology, that share has jumped to 29.5%, the study says.Generative AI, and automation broadly, should provide a big boost to productivity, or output per worker, the study says. That should mean a faster-growing economy that ultimately bolsters hiring, though probably in new occupations.But workers must receive the training needed to land better jobs and skilled workers must be connected to jobs in other parts of the country, the study says. Rather than focus on credentials, employers should evaluate candidates ""on their capacity to learn, their intrinsic capabilities, and their transferable skills,"" the study says.SherumSecret Revealed: How Gardeners Remove Gravel Weeds 'Faster' Than Other MethodsfSherum|AdAdLearn MoreUndoSumatra Slim Belly TonicSumatra Tonic Awakens Metabolism and Burns Fat OvernightSumatra Slim Belly Tonic|AdAdLearn MoreUndoHotels Bookings | search ads Find the Best Hotels Bookings For Your VacationReady to get away?

They say it helps you get past the first screening when an artificial intelligence bot or digital filter might scan résumés and look for keywords.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.Subscribe“White fonting” in recent years has garnered renewed interest across social media like TikTok with influencers suggesting that it will make a big difference for job hunters. It’s also ruffled the feathers of many recruiters who have publicly denounced it.The concept is simple: Copy a list of relevant keywords or the job description itself, paste it in a résumé and change the font color to white. The hope is that AI bots or digital filters in applicant tracking systems read the white text and surface the résumé for human review. Because keywords are in white, the résumé will look normal to human reviewers.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe practice’s revival comes at a time when many job seekers are finding it difficult to get hired. The U.S. labor market has tightened, the volume of job applications has exploded with new easy-to-apply processes and employers are increasingly turning to technology, including artificial intelligence, for help. But employment experts say the shortcut is risky.💻Follow TechnologyFollow“The question is what sits behind” choosing to white font, said Andreea Macoveschi, senior director of the recruitment process outsourcing practice for global consulting firm Korn Ferry. “Is it lack of integrity or being savvy with tech?”A large majority of recruiters use applicant tracking systems, or software platforms that help manage job openings and candidates, according to market research firm Gartner. And up to half of employers are using AI in some part of the hiring process, Gartner estimates. The result? Technology is speeding up the hiring process but also making it harder for candidates to break through.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“There’s a significant amount of people looking for work, a lot more résumés are coming in and there’s fewer [hiring] resources because most companies have made cuts,” said Jason Walker, co-founder of Thrive HR Consulting. “So the ability for a candidate to get seen is pretty low.”GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextAppeals court blocks Biden’s student loan repayment planRepublican-led states have challenged the Save program’s legality.

SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.See moreExpand contentSome people started using white font decades ago to help their résumés surface in recruiter searches on online job boards. But the practice is gaining traction again as job screenings become more automated.“I don’t think it’s ever gone away,” said Sachit Kamat, chief product officer at hiring and talent platform Eightfold AI. “It’s probably popular [again] because competition for jobs is high.”How applicant tracking systems workApplicant tracking systems are the job platforms employers use to collaborate on one service. Often, these systems allow for hiring managers and recruiters to find and prioritize candidates based on fit. Some have AI that contextualizes and rates a résumé based on experience and skillsets. Others provide digital filters or searches to help find specific keywords like skills, job titles or certifications. Some systems might automatically prioritize referrals or internal candidates.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWhether white font can bypass filters and bots entirely depends on the system an employer is using and how.“Does it work? Yeah,” Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, chief innovation officer at staffing firm ManpowerGroup, said about some systems recruiters use. “But it might contribute 10 percent or 15 percent of the variability between a résumé that is ultimately accepted versus one that is rejected.”But candidates need to know that their white text may not be hidden. Sometimes applicant tracking systems will input sections of a résumé into the application. If it does that, the text will no longer be white, meaning the recruiter may see whatever you pasted into your résumé if you don’t edit it.Story continues below advertisement“The system doesn’t care what color font you write it in,” said Allyn Bailey, executive director of hiring success services at hiring software company SmartRecruiters. “If it matches a field, it puts it in.”AdvertisementIn the case of SmartRecruiters, the AI ranks résumés beyond just keywords, Bailey said. So if an employer wants a senior-level candidate, it can determine which job titles should be included.New York-based Greenhouse, which supplies hiring software, doesn’t automatically prioritize candidates, as it says this may lead to bias. But it does let recruiters search for keywords. But keyword searches aren’t as common as people may think, said Jon Stross, the company’s president and co-founder.Story continues below advertisement“Generally, they’re looking in chronological order,” he said of recruiters. “They’re just looking at résumés until they get to 10 that look good enough.”Santa-Clara, Calif.-based Eightfold AI’s system would likely read white-colored keywords as extraneous text, Kamat said. That’s because AI is basing its decisions on the entirety of someone’s résumé. So if a keyword is missing, the AI might determine that candidate likely has that skill based on the listed jobs.Advertisement“In the world of AI, the fundamental approach is different,” he said about AI hiring software. “You’re using big data.”Can a system automatically reject my job application?Systems can automatically reject candidates, but someone has to set the parameters first.Story continues below advertisementSome applicant tracking systems have options that let employers automatically reject a candidate who may not be old enough for a specific job or lacks the years of experience.In cases where a system ranks candidates, it only pushes some ahead of others vs. rejecting anyone, software providers said. SmartRecruiters allows employers to set specific parameters to narrow down candidates. So if someone has a qualification, the system might additionally look for a particular skill.“It does not knock anybody out,” Bailey said. “It screens people in.”AdvertisementNot all recruiters use their software’s features. Two recruiters said they review every application, even if it’s only for a minute, to ensure they don’t miss a qualified candidate. Regardless of how recruiters work, a person ultimately decides who gets hired, software providers said. And not all employers have the time or process to send rejections.Story continues below advertisement“People assume that an evil black box is making judgments about them,” Stross said. “What’s really happening is the company is getting a lot of applications, and they’re not getting back to everyone.”Will white fonting help me get a job?White fonting may help your résumé reach human eyes, but it’s not necessarily going to present you as a good candidate. It might actually hurt your chances.“If your résumé doesn’t stand up well, it will quickly be discarded,” said Reynaldo Ramirez, co-founder of Thrive HR. “That could be viewed as very dishonest.”AdvertisementThere’s a good chance recruiters may check for white font by highlighting the entire résumé, said Walker of Thrive. And it could prevent recruiters from forwarding your résumé to others, which happens often.Story continues below advertisement“You might pass the filter,” Chamorro-Premuzic of Manpower said. “But once the recruiter looks at it, they’re going to say … ‘Why should I waste time with them if they’re not even interested?’”Some recruiters say they won’t automatically disqualify a candidate for white fonting if the person is a good fit. But they will ensure you have the actual skills and experience.“If you’re qualified, you’re qualified,” said Tejal Wagadia, who is a senior technical recruiter for a big tech company and is not permitted to disclose her employer. “But if someone told me they [used the technique], I’d have a serious conversation with them about why.”AdvertisementInstead of white fonting, spend five minutes tweaking your résumé to include the experiences, skills and results applicable to the job, says Wagadia. Use the job description as a guide for your résumé. The company will likely list the most important qualifications and experiences first.Focus your efforts on a handful of jobs vs. mass applying, go the extra mile to network and stay away from tricks — as not everyone will view them the same way, experts say.“You want to be trustworthy from the beginning,” said Marisol Maloney, a tech recruiter at defense contractor Firebird AST. “The truth always comes out.”Help Desk: Making tech work for youHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and take control of the technology used in everyday life.Take control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and advice on how to make your tech a force for good.Tech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation onlineData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.

ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI have exploded in popularity in recent years, and we are witnessing the start of a new order for how the world – and the workplace – works.Boston Consulting group recently surveyed nearly 13,000 people — ranging from executive suite leaders to middle managers and frontline employees — in 18 countries to understand their thoughts, emotions, and fears about AI.They found that overall, people were more optimistic than concerned about AI. But there were major differences in opinions on AI between leaders at the top and employees on the frontline.Leaders were much more optimistic than frontline employees about AI (62% vs. 42%), with 80% of leaders saying they use generative AI regularly.Advertisement:“This tale of two cities should inform organizations as they implement AI and generative AI,” the report said. “Leaders should make sure that they do not get ahead of their people and leave their frontline behind.” close dialogAdvertisementclose dialogAs a life sciences and technology hub, Boston is poised to be a major beneficiary of AI jobs, according to a report from the Brookings Institution.

									Boston.com readers are anxious over artificial intelligence									






In the past 10 months, Boston and five other metro areas, including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle, accounted for 47% of advanced or generative AI job postings, according to Brookings. As recently as May, Brookings found 60% of new generative AI jobs posted in the top 15 markets, including Boston.Apart from working in the AI sector, incorporating AI into the workplace has become something of a hot-button issue, both for those who fear their jobs will be taken over by the new technology, as well as for those who need AI to leverage their hireability.Among software developers, having knowledge about AI has become so desirable that “the artificial intelligence specialist has become the new ‘it’ girl in Silicon Valley,” Vox reported.“If you take a look at job openings right now on job boards, the job listings are more emphasized on software engineers who have a background in AI,” technical recruiter Eddiana Rosen told Vox. Advertisement:For many, however, AI is something not to be revered, but to be feared in the workplace.Journalists, legal workers, and white collar workers are among some of those most at risk for AI to replace, according to Insider.This is because AI is able to read, write, and understand text-based data well, and many of these jobs are language-oriented roles susceptible to automation.Eager to go directly to the source, Boston Globe columnist Larry Edelman recently asked one of the new chatbots, Google’s Bard, if it would soon be forcing him into retirement.“AI is unlikely to make newspaper columnists obsolete in the near future,” the bot replied. “While AI can be used to automate some tasks, such as writing basic news stories, it cannot yet replace the human skills and judgment that are essential for in-depth reporting and analysis.”But Edelman’s fears weren’t easily appeased: “My gut tells me I’m being gaslighted,” he wrote.And he’s in good company. In May, more than 400 Boston.com readers told us they are anxious over artificial intelligence, with the vast majority expressing concern over the speed with which AI is developing.Advertisement:We want to know how you feel about AI in the workplace. Do you think AI will take over your current job?

New GrammarlyGO Features Empower Students to Use Generative AI Responsibly




Grammarly furthers its commitment to learning with student-focused prompts, guardrails, and the ability to cite generative AI transparently






July 25, 2023 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Grammarly, the company delivering AI communication assistance to over 30 million people, 50,000 professional teams, and 3,000 educational institutions daily, today announced new features that guide students in leveraging generative AI to augment—not replace—their critical thinking and communication skills. These features will start rolling out in late August in GrammarlyGO, the on-demand, generative AI-powered tool that works everywhere students do, in time for the 2023/24 school year.


“evaluate the strength of a thesis statement”Post this

With these new features coming to GrammarlyGO, students can learn to use generative AI conscientiously—helping educational institutions uphold academic integrity and prepare students for the AI-connected workplace:



Suggested ideation prompts encourage students to collaborate with generative AI—not let it do the work for them: Academic-focused GrammarlyGO prompts for students will focus on constructive and contextually relevant use cases aimed at helping students overcome the blank page problem, like “brainstorm topics for my assignment” or “build a research plan for my paper.”



Feedback prompts and output explanations support student learning as they write: With GrammarlyGO’s suggested prompts for feedback, students can “evaluate the strength of a thesis statement,” “explore counterarguments,” and more. The outputs will include explanations, giving students a deeper understanding of GrammarlyGO’s recommendations so they can improve their critical thinking and communication skills over time.



Auto-citations simplify citing generative AI, enabling ethical use and transparency for educators: Grammarly will now offer customers the ability to generate a citation for text generated by tools such as GrammarlyGO and ChatGPT. Grammarly already provides auto-citations for popular research websites and plagiarism detection from billions of web pages and ProQuest’s academic databases, helping students cite all their resources effectively and efficiently while in the flow of work.



AI guideline reminders assist students in responsibly using generative AI: GrammarlyGO will discourage students from generating long-form text if they attempt to do so, with messaging within the product that redirects them to ideate with GrammarlyGO instead while reminding them to adhere to their institution’s or instructor’s policies.



""Generative AI is here to stay, but the education industry is grappling with how to approach new technologies in ways that enhance student learning—not detract from it,” said Jenny Maxwell, Head of Grammarly for Education. “When educators prioritize fostering the responsible use of AI in their institutions and courses, they ensure students build critical thinking abilities and AI literacy that the workforce of today demands. With these new GrammarlyGO features, Grammarly demonstrates its continued commitment to higher education, helping institutions and educators set their students up for success through their academic careers and beyond.”


Grammarly has long provided real-time, best-in-class writing suggestions to help students communicate with clarity and confidence wherever they write. Grammarly can now support students throughout their entire writing journey—from early ideation of an essay outline to writing and organizing arguments, revising for clarity and correctness, and more.


Thousands of leading educational institutions, like Berkeley, Cornell University, Harvard Medical School, Howard University, Johns Hopkins University, and IIM Ahmedabad, already trust Grammarly to empower students to achieve better outcomes through effective communication. Grammarly holds enterprise-grade attestations and certifications and a suite of compliances and certifications that put customers first—never selling or renting data. GrammarlyGO also upholds Grammarly’s long-standing commitment to security, privacy, and responsible AI development.

Login This content is produced in commercial partnership with Salesforce AustraliaAs AI and automation usher in a new economic era, every CEO recognises the need to invest to stay competitive. The risk of inertia has ratcheted up as competitive pressures increase and the economic picture darkens.Leaders are challenged to consider how best to use this revolutionary technology and, more importantly - how to do so safely.Harnessing the power of AI, data, and CRM has enormous potential to transform customer experiences. iStockIncorporating AI-enhanced capabilities across the workforce can achieve greater employee satisfaction and improve productivity and decision-making. Salesforce research shows 71 per cent of Australian employees use or plan to use generative AI at work, but nearly 60 per cent of those who plan to use this technology don’t know how to do so using trusted data sources or while ensuring sensitive data is kept secure.Today, every CEO needs a digital strategy that builds resilience, drives efficiency and growth, and provides trust, security and reliability. Combining AI, data, and CRM has enormous potential to transform customer experiences, better anticipating their needs and delivering personalisation across every interaction.AdvertisementPractical applications for generative AIMarketers, for example, are already using generative AI to transform how they connect with their customers by powering more automated and personalised campaigns — quickly and at scale. In addition to basic content creation and writing copy, they’re transforming the way marketers analyse data and personalise messaging content.Frank Fillmann is country leader at Salesforce Australia. Sales teams are consolidating their organisations’ data on a single platform and auto-crafting personalised emails tailored to their customers’ needs, making how they work faster, smarter, and more efficient. Personalisation is informed by CRM data, freeing sales reps to focus on building customer relationships, closing new business, and driving revenue.Customer service teams are using generative AI to increase their productivity by providing suggested replies to customer enquiries and by automatically summarising the customer conversation once complete.This additional human capacity can then be redirected towards other revenue-generating areas of the business, increasing staff engagement and retention and increasing business performance.The real power of this technology is that AI can analyse and act on the most valuable data from a company’s most trusted resource, helping teams work smarter and make informed decisions faster. Slack’s State of Work research shows workers adopting AI are 90 per cent to report higher productivity levels. Yet, just 27 per cent of companies currently use AI tools to help increase efficiency.The role of data: avoiding garbage in, garbage outThe next wave of AI innovation is only as good as its data. While leaders understand the importance of data, many struggle to harness its power for better outcomes and decision-making. For many, it’s too complex, not accessible enough and often, they’re unable to generate impactful insights across their organisations.Generative AI will make it exponentially more accessible for everyone to tap into immense troves of trusted data to do their jobs more effectively and efficiently.Integrating AI, real-time data, and CRM allows for personalised content generation and tailored experiences across sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT. This enables businesses to anticipate customer needs, engage prospects, and optimise their operations, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.Take, for instance, a sales leader who can generate visualisations based on natural language prompts that display real-time progress against their quota, along with recommendations for helping them meet goals. Such insights, based on patterns and trends in data that might be too vast or complex for humans to analyse manually, will give employees invaluable time back to focus on getting the job done.We believe the right data strategy will lead to better decision-making, empower greater creativity and boost productivity.The role of trust in the AI revolution There is a real risk for generative AI, if used improperly, to do harm. To limit the potential for bias, hallucinations, and toxic outputs - generated content must be pulled from relevant, representative, and complete sources.It’s crucial to keep a human in the loop on all customer interactions to validate outputs and recommendations before being used. Training workers to take full advantage of the technology and instilling an ethics-first approach is essential for companies wanting to use generative AI to deliver against growing customer expectations.To help other companies with these considerations, Salesforce has released updated guidelines for how to approach responsible generative AI product development. As we have integrated generative AI into our products, these principles have been at the heart of our decision-making.The cost of inertia is rising for companies slow to adopt generative AI. Leaders need to act now to balance risk and innovation. With the right strategy and governance, CEOs can reduce risk, increase their pace of innovation and embrace the advantages of this revolutionary technology.Frank Fillmann is country leader at Salesforce AustraliaGain insights into the week’s biggest tech stories, deals and trends. Sign up to The Download newsletter.Sponsored by Salesforce AustraliaThis content has been funded by an advertiser and written by the Nine commercial editorial team.SaveLog in or Subscribe to save articleShareCopy linkCopiedEmailLinkedInTwitterFacebookCopy linkCopiedShare via...Gift this articleSubscribers can give anyone free access to articles.Gift this article NewSubscribe to gift this articleGift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.Subscribe nowAlready a subscriber?

Paylocity’s New Features Include More Generative AI, Pay Data and Self-Scheduling

By Mark Feffer -   July 26, 2023   





Paylocity launched new features including an updated mobile app and enhancements to its generative AI and LMS, as well as a premium product to provide market pay data to aid employers in developing fair and compliant pay strategies.
The new Market Pay product provides data in real time, within the Paylocity platform. The module allows customers to accurately evaluate pay for specific roles, as well as comply with pay equity and job posting requirements in multiple states.
With Market Pay, Paylocity’s pursuing a growing market. The company said at least three-quarters of organizations with 40 – 250 employees, and 80% of businesses with more than 500 workers, use market data to justify their compensation decisions.
The company also extended its generative AI capabilities to help create “compelling and compliant” job descriptions. The newly streamlined process is designed to save time as it supports talent acquisition efforts.
“Paylocity has purposefully built AI and machine learning into our platform to not only improve efficiency, but also improve effectiveness,” said Co-CEO Steve Beauchamp. Learning as it goes, he said, the system uses more data to make real-time recommendations that can have a direct impact on business outcomes.
Employee-Centric Scheduling
Another new premium feature, Advanced Scheduling, allows businesses to build schedules for multiple locations, and includes real-time insights to help ensure coverage and minimize overtime by anticipating the hours needed for future shifts. It also enables companies to identify employees who are approaching or have already reached overtime thresholds.
From the employee’s point of view, Advanced Scheduling’s mobile app offers workers more influence over their schedules by allowing them to swap shifts, claim open shifts and manage their availability, all without manager involvement.
Meanwhile, Paylocity’s LMS now allows employees to create training content – including videos – and easily share it via the platform’s Community function. Once customers assign a course, the LMS takes over learning management by issuing notices and reminders, tracking progress and reporting on course completion. Learning information is tied back to each employee’s individual record, allowing managers to track learning as they would any other task in the system.  
In January, Paylocity integrated Cloudsnap, a solution for joining disparate business applications, into its broader platform. At the time, Paylocity said its goal was to create a source for employee data that can be leveraged across an entire organization.

SHOP-T

-0.58%decrease


 is going all in on artificial intelligence, launching a suite of new AI products for the businesses that pay for its e-commerce platform, as it also automates its own labour force to reduce the work being done by humans.At a semi-annual online product showcase Wednesday, dubbed Shopify Editions, the Ottawa-based company positioned several new tools – out of the nearly 100 updates and features being released – as important steps in a direction that chief executive officer Tobias Lütke had called “the dawn of the AI era” in a recent note to employees.“Shopify believes that there isn’t any corner of the internet that will benefit more from AI than the pursuit of people building and growing their own businesses,” Miqdad Jaffer, Shopify’s director of product for AI, told The Globe and Mail. “There is still so much untapped potential for AI and entrepreneurs, and we’re both excited and deeply committed to making the power of AI accessible to businesses of all sizes.”In February, Shopify first began to dabble in the world of large-language models and neural networks by introducing a new product-description tool called Shopify Magic. It used similar underlying technology that powers ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that has become incredibly popular since its launch late last year by employing computer programs to distribute probability over large sequences of words and generating results in real time based on its learnings.Now, the e-commerce company is adding to Shopify Magic, joining a chorus of global businesses that are striving to cash in on the buzz surrounding fast-growing AI technology.A new AI feature called Sidekick will allow Shopify merchants to perform administrative tasks and tackle creative challenges, such as responding to customer inquiries or helping out with marketing. Earlier this month, when Mr. Lütke released a teaser video for Sidekick, his short clip went viral on Twitter, gaining traction among many retailers.

Shopify is also launching AI-driven e-mail campaigns for its businesses: The new service will require “just a few words to produce engaging, tailored e-mail newsletters, announcements and more,” Mr. Jaffer said. This is expected to reduce the manpower and overhead for many small businesses around the world, according to Shopify, which provides merchants in around 170 countries with services to set up their online stores.But as Shopify announces new AI tools for its merchants, the company is also undergoing a rapid transition as an organization itself, automating several tasks, such as translation and customer services. Many people who work at Shopify have been worried about losing their jobs because of AI-induced redundancies, especially since the company slashed more than 20 per cent of its work force in May – less than a year after Mr. Lütke first apologized for a previous round of job cuts in 2022 and after president Harley Finkelstein had said in February that no more cuts were coming.Still, Mr. Lütke had eased some audience concerns about AI in May at the Elevate tech conference in Toronto, stating that it “replaces tasks, not jobs,” as he spoke on stage with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who is behind the advent of ChatGPT and other industry-leading tools such as GPT-4 and DALL-E.Mr. Jaffer would not provide details about Shopify’s plans for further automation at the company and how AI will affect its employment structure.“We’re positive sum thinkers,” he said. “AI technology is creating new opportunities and driving demand for highly skilled software engineers who can design, develop and maintain AI systems and applications.”Gil Luria, managing director and senior software analyst for American investment bank D.A. Davidson, said many companies are incorporating AI into their products and that the new technology will be most helpful for small merchants, which form the bulk of Shopify’s clientele.“A small merchant may not have customer-service capabilities, so the tools Shopify is introducing can help them handle customer engagement in a more automated and professional manner,” Mr. Luria said.Apart from AI, Shopify also unveiled several upgrades in other areas on Wednesday, including its checkout; a new credit card for eligible merchants in the U.S.; and Marketplace Connect, which is a new centralized hub for merchants to connect their operations from different marketplaces where they sell their products, such as Amazon, Walmart, eBay and Etsy.Sign up for our new Business Brief newsletter.A daily look at the most important business stories that are making news and moving markets, written by Chris Wilson-SmithRegister to sign upExplore newsletters",,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-shopify-new-ai-products-e-commerce/'}",,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.l-article'}",,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@context': 'http://schema.org', 'name': 'The Globe and Mail', '@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'url': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/', 'inLanguage': 'en'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The Globe and Mail'}",2023.0,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'The Globe and Mail', 'productID': 'theglobeandmail.com:access'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/JPIEMJCG35NXHKPTERAGCVEZ5E.JPG?auth=8f96baab278ff7c865e7b63dcbe811c1623a31b93c144869eb9399af4ca4aab3&width=640&quality=80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rapid growth of artificial intelligence is already changing the jobs market. We already witness the different ways in which AI creates art or performs tasks for different professional categories, like architects. But now, we witness an entire man-machine shift. Tasks that only humans could do a few years ago can now be partially or fully automated by simple web tools that anyone can access.
This compilation of data puts all the AI replacing jobs chatter into worrying perspective.






AI Replacing Jobs Statistics: Most Shocking Findings
While there are a few positive predictions among the doom and gloom, the following stats suggest there will be a great and painful upheaval in the jobs market:

AI could replace 300 million full-time jobs.
80% of the US workforce will have at least 10% of their tasks affected by AI.
77% of businesses are already using or exploring AI.
75% of Chinese citizens would replace politicians with AI.
CEOs of AI firms like OpenAI have signed an open letter warning about the risk of extinction from AI.

AI already in the workplace statistics
These tools replacing human jobs statistics look at how AI is already being used in the workplace.
1. 77% of businesses are already using or exploring AI.
(Source: IBM)
Fears of AI replacing jobs are warranted when 35% of businesses are already using it and 42% are exploring how to use it in the near future. While this doesn’t mean workers are being sacked, this becomes more likely as AI technology advances and is less reliant on human collaboration.
2. Large businesses are twice as likely to use AI than small businesses.
(Source: IBM)
Larger organizations spend more on research and development and have the capital to adopt new technology like AI. However, 41% of small businesses are developing an AI strategy for the future.






3. IT professionals use AI the most in the workplace.
(Source: IBM)
It should come as no surprise that IT professionals are the largest AI user group in the workplace (54%). They are followed by 35% of Data Engineers, 29% of Developers and Data Scientists, 26% of Security Professionals, and 25% of Customer Service staff.
4. There is a 37% rate of adoption of Generative AI in Marketing and Advertising.
(Source: Statista – AI Adoption)
When looking at specific industries, marketing & advertising show the highest rate of adoption of Generative AI (37%). This is followed by Technology (35%), Consulting (30%), Teaching (19%), Accounting (16%), and Healthcare (15%).
5. 81% of office workers think AI improves their job performance.
(Source: SnapLogic)
Of 400 surveyed office workers using AI, the majority felt it was improving their overall performance at work. This includes 61% who say it makes them more efficient and productive, while 49% felt it improved their decision-making.
Meanwhile, 51% say they believe AI enables them to achieve a better work/life balance.
AI replacing jobs statistics: Now and the future
These stats and facts reveal the current landscape of job losses and some shocking predictions for the years ahead.
6. 14% of workers claim to have already lost a job to ‘robots’.
(Source: Socius) 
Research at Brigham Young University in Utah, suggests fears outweigh current reality, but 14% of workers have already had a role replaced by automation. Those who had, suspected the number to be as high as 47%, while those that hadn’t predicted 29%. However, it’s potential job losses in the future that’s drumming up the most fear.






7. In May 2023, 3,900 US job losses were linked directly to AI.
(Source: Challenger Report)
This made up 5% of all job losses in May and was the seventh-highest contributor. In tech, there have been 136,831 job losses this year, the biggest round of layoffs since 2001.
8. British Telecom aims to replace 10,000 staff with AI within 7 years.
(Source: Daily Mail)
As part of a broader program of layoffs, telecom giant BT has announced plans to cut 10,000 staff over the next 7 years with help from AI and other automation strategies. Part of this is due to expanding AI-based customer service technology like help chat bots.
9. Early AI and automation have already driven down wages by up to 70% since 1980.
(Sources: Business Insider, Forbes)
It’s argued that before AI replaces jobs it levels the playing field. Creatives in writing, graphic design, and music, now face less talented competitors who can use AI to improve the quality of their work. In turn, this drives down wages.
This experiment has already been played out since 1980. Between 50% and 70% of decreased wages have been among blue-collar workers who were replaced or degraded by automation and primitive AI.
10. Now it’s Educated, white-collar workers that will be impacted by automation.
(Source: Business Insider)
If it was blue-collar workers that bore the brunt of technology before, it’s educated, white-collar workers making up to $80,000 a year that will be impacted by generative AI.






This is because jobs that use programming and writing skills fall under this bracket and are being automated by the likes of ChatGPT.
11. Overall, AI could replace 300 million full-time jobs.
(Source: Goldman Sachs) 
Due to its ability to produce content indistinguishable from human-output, generative AI systems could degrade or completely replace 300 million jobs with automation. This is the equivalent of a quarter of all work tasks in the US and Europe.
However, due to increased productivity, it could also increase global GDP by 7%. Bots are simply more efficient than humans.
12. 80% of the US workforce will have at least 10% of their tasks affected by AI.
(Source: OpenAI) 
Research by ChatGPT creators OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania reveals that the majority of the US labor market will be affected, even if it’s just 10% of day-to-day tasks. A smaller percentage of workers (19%) may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted.
13. Administrative jobs will be hit the hardest, while manual labor is safe.
(Source: Goldman Sachs) 
Some jobs are more easily automated than others, with administrative tasks to be hit the hardest (46%), and monotonous tasks in the legal profession (44%), as an example. On the other hand, manual labor such as construction (6%) and maintenance (4%), are relatively safe from data-based generative AI.
14. Women may be affected more than men.
(Source: Kenan Institute)
As high as 80% of women’s jobs could be at risk due to 70% of women’s jobs being white-collar and administrative – the main target of AI technology.
Fears about AI replacing jobs statistics
These stats look closer at people’s fears of job losses at the hands of AI.






15. 30% of workers fear their job will soon be replaced by technology.
(Source: PwC) 
In a survey of 52,000 people across 44 countries and territories, almost a third of respondents were concerned that their job could be replaced by tech such as AI within the next 3 years.
39% are worried that their employer is not giving sufficient training in emerging digital and technology skills.
16. In India alone, the fear of AI job losses jumps to more than 70%.
(Source: Microsoft)
Microsoft’s India results for its 2023 Work Trend Index finds that 74 % of Indian workers fear AI will replace their jobs. Nonetheless, as AI continues to roll out, 83% say they will delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen their workloads.
17. More than half of 18 to 24-year-olds are concerned about AI taking jobs.
(Source: BMG Research)
Young people are more concerned than older people, with 52% of 18 to 24-year-olds worried about how AI will impact their future careers. Older workers may reach retirement before it affects them.
18. 81.6% of digital marketers believe content writers will lose jobs because of AI.
(Source: Authority Hacker)
With the highest AI adoption rate, fears about job replacement are especially high in the marketing industry.  Content writers, in particular, now face competition from AI chatbots that can create passable content from simple topic prompts.






19. CEOs of AI firms like OpenAI have signed an open letter warning about the risk of extinction from AI.
(Source: Safe.AI)
It’s not just job losses we should be concerned about according to AI scientists and other notable figures. Bill Gates, Sam Alman, the CEO of OpenAI, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Stability AI’s Emad Mostaque, and many others have all signed an open letter and ‘statement of risk’.
It states: Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.
AI creating jobs statistics
Although it might not counter the worst predictions of job losses, the explosion of AI will create millions of new jobs too.
20. 72% of companies using AI think it will make their jobs easier.
(Source: PwC)
There is some positivity within companies that have already adopted AI. The vast majority believe it will make work easier rather than taking over roles entirely.
21. AI could create 97 million new jobs by 2025.
(Source: World Economic Forum)
These new jobs will require training and collaborative AI skills as we begin working alongside the technology.
22. Four UK industries are expected to see net job gains due to AI.
(Source: GOV.uk – AI Jobs)






Research in the UK forecasts that the health and social care industry will benefit the most from AI jobs, with approximately 800,000 extra positions created over the next 20 years. Professional & Scientific, Education, and Information & Comms are also expected to see net job gains from AI.
23. 64% of managers and executives plan to hire more professionals to fill AI roles.
(Source: UpWork)
A survey of 1,400 US senior managers through C-suite executives by Freelancer platform UpWork, found that two-thirds will be increasing hiring as a result of generative AI.
AI jobs and government statistics
The role of governments in developing and implementing AI cannot be ignored. Nor can the role of AI within governments themselves.
24. Governments are spending billions on AI research.
(Sources: FedScoop, GOV.UK – AI Spending)
Despite fears from citizens, governments in the US, UK, and other nations are spending heavily on artificial intelligence. US federal spending on AI contracts hit $3.3 billion in 2022, a 250% increase from 2017.
In March 2023, the UK government pledged £1 billion for supercomputing and AI research, as part of a broader £3.5 billion science and tech budget.
25. The United States ranks highest in the Global AI Index.
(Source: Tortoise Media)
The Global AI Index is a ranking of 62 countries that have invested in AI, based on analysis, investment, innovation, and implementation.
The United States is ranked number 1, followed by China, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Kenya ranks at the bottom of the 62-country list.






26. The US government is best equipped to deploy AI within government itself.
(Source: Statista – Government AI)
The US also ranks number 1 on the Government AI Readiness Index, which measures the countries best equipped to deploy AI within public services. Singapore comes in second, followed by the UK, and Finland.
China ranks 17th on the index for readiness, but that’s because it is already ahead of most countries in implementation.
27. 75% of Chinese citizens would replace politicians with AI.
(Source: CNBC)
Politicians may be usurped by AI too. Of 2,769 people surveyed from 11 countries, 75% of Chinese citizens would happily reduce the number of parliamentarians in their country and replace them with AI.
51% of Europeans said they would support such a move, while only 40% of Americans would hand over the government to AI.
28. US and EU legislation aims to regulate AI-based job hiring.
(Source: Computer World)
While there isn’t much legal pressure against AI replacing jobs themselves, the US and EU are in the early stages of regulating AI being used in the hiring process. This includes the federal Algorithmic Accountability Act and the EU AI Act.
Ironically, this may save the jobs of recruiters.
Conclusion
Artificial intelligence isn’t going anywhere and will only get more sophisticated as time goes on.
As with any disruptive technology, job losses cannot be avoided. However, the transition will still require human collaboration and there are opportunities for those that learn the AI landscape early.

What do hiring managers think? Can you really automate a CV?

Now, it’s the turn of the recruitment sector, as hiring managers battle it out over the latest hot topic: should job seekers be allowed to apply to a job using AI?Across the country, candidates are employing free generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, as their own personal job coach. With just a simple prompt, the tools will write out their resumes and cover letters, research interview questions, and draft email messages in mere seconds.Clearly, there are benefits aplenty for the candidate. Hiring managers, however, are less enthused. The sudden upswing in AI usage has caught many off guard, with several of the biggest advantages and drawbacks yet to be uncovered.We spoke to various HR experts about the conundrum, each of whom hold different views about the role of AI in job applications. Below, we’ll explore each line of reasoning to see if ChatGPT belongs in today’s interview room.The arguments forSupporters of AI in recruitment present a wide-range of arguments to back their claims. Largely, most of the people we spoke to said the adoption of the technology was inevitable. They contend it should be mined for its significant opportunities and growth potential.“AI removes bias in the application process”One recurring compliment given to AI was its ability to remove bias within the hiring process. Robot recruiters, supporters say, are blind to demographics and can appraise a candidate without human prejudices.This might be too bold a claim. After all, the software can only be as impartial as the data it is trained on, and there are plenty of examples of AI recruiting tools that have been swayed towards certain groups. Statistical bias is still a threat.The technology is more defensible, however, when it comes to applications. Specifically, the idea of accessibility. Generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, can assist people who don’t have the type of personality skills commonly relied upon to wow in an interview.Richard Collins is cofounder of CV Wallet, a career management app. He praises the democratisation of AI tools as a positive step towards fairer hiring practices.“Traditional application processes have been biased towards native speakers and those from certain educational backgrounds” he argues. “Someone’s ability to write a cover letter is no indicator of their ability to do the job. With AI, we can focus on a candidate’s true potential.”“It shows smart thinking”It might be tempting to view the use of AI as an example of laziness from the candidate. After all, why can’t they just write a cover letter themselves? However, this argument is a bit like asking why the inventor of the typewriter couldn’t just write by hand.Technology is constantly coming up with new ways to disrupt our traditional way of working by helping us to do things faster and more efficiently. Proponents of AI ask: shouldn’t we be congratulating those that are smart enough to take advantage of it?Charlotte is a 25 year old job seeker. She says she has been using ChatGPT to help create a large volume of cover letters at speed. According to her, this approach is evidence of lateral thinking, not laziness.“Engaging with the latest technology to streamline repetitive tasks shows good time management and an openness to changing work style,” she argues. “It also makes sure you’re hitting all the key job requirements recruiters are looking for.”Collins agrees. He admits that CV Wallet recently hired a candidate who gave a presentation written by AI during the interview process.“They were honest about it, and we found it quite intriguing,” he recalls. “We ended up hiring them because we value their honesty, and we believe that using AI could make them more productive in their role.”“Hirers are using it already”The use of AI in job submissions might have caught some recruiters unawares. But it is hardly a new addition to the industry. Tons of innovative startups have cropped up in the past few years to supercharge company hiring practices.Take the recruitment platform, Gigged.ai. Deployed in the early stages of the application process, it uses machine learning to capture information from hundreds of documents at a glance. Inarguably, this is making the process much smoother for the employer.Given the high volume of work required to apply to a job, AI can prevent applicants from spending hours labouring on a submission that might not bear career fruit. So are they simply playing catch up with their potential employers?Charlotte says she started using AI after writing several cover letters from scratch, but then hearing nothing back. “It felt like a complete waste of time to have dedicated a couple of hours to never even receiving an email of rejection,” she says.As a result of her efforts, she’s had more reward than pushback. “I’ve been called back for more follow ups and interviews as I’ve been able to complete applications faster,” she divulges.The arguments againstStartups has reported on the ‘AI skills gap’, referring to the disconnect between the availability of AI software and jobs-ready talent.Most of the arguments against allowing AI to apply to a job posting revolved around misapplication, as individuals and businesses struggle to get to grips with the technology.“Information could be inaccurate”One big concern for recruiters when it comes to the use of AI to apply for jobs is the phenomenon of hallucinations. This is when an AI tool generates false or misleading information.Since many people already include some white lies in their CVs, there is a risk that AI could worsen the problem by creating exaggerated skills and qualifications.Collins admits this could create challenges for employers looking for the right candidates. He proposes that, to tackle the problem, managers must be educated on proper verification techniques during the selection process.“Job applicants need to show their CVs are accurate and authentic to improve their chances, and employers need access to a complete overview of the verified elements such as identity, right to work, skills, qualifications, and experience,” he sets out.“If we provide jobseekers with an easy way to verify their credentials, this can minimise the impact of hallucinations, as employers will have already confirmed the candidate’s authenticity before the interview stage.”“AI applications sound the same”Artificial intelligence so far lacks human agency and creativity. If every applicant is using the same platform, they will no doubt struggle to stand out amidst a sea of uniform, automated responses.Neil Armstrong is Chief Commercial Officer at Tribepad, a recruitment tech company. Armstrong echoes the belief that using AI too much could result in a boring application.“If the company receives 100 emails that all sound the same, and one that shows a real passion and flair, who do you think they will choose?” he questions.Armstrong says that recruiters will be looking out for job seekers who are using ChatGPT to ‘fake’ interview answers, work histories, or test results. He says applicants should review and personalise anything produced by generative AI to ensure it sounds 100% human.“ChatGPT can save time, but it’s not a reliable tool,” he adds. “Rather than just use it blind, candidates should use critical thinking to question the output and elaborate and enhance to add personality, nuance and create bespoke tailoring.”If you think this seems obvious – think again. One recruiter we spoke to told us about an applicant who had pasted ‘generated by ChatGPT’ into their submission in error.“Companies might hire the wrong candidate”When it comes to AI in recruitment, the biggest threat to small business owners is that its adherents might use it to win a job they are unsuitable for.There is no guarantee that an AI tool will accurately assess a job seeker’s suitability for a role. Businesses risk wasting time and money on onboarding and employing an individual who is wrong for the role; potentially leading to hiring regret for the employer.Similarly, a company could just as easily miss out on identifying the correct candidate amongst a pool of brilliant, but ultimately fictional, contenders.Ian Nicholas is Global Managing Director at Reed. Nicholas warns that if interviewees do not factcheck AI responses, companies may end up issuing incorrect job rejections. This could cause them to miss out on qualified talent during an already disastrous labour shortage.“The AI may outline experiences which the candidate may not truly have, or it could easily undersell them,” he expands. “With more and more people using AI to help build their CV, users must be aware of best practices.”Does the job application process need updating?We’ve weighed the pros and cons of wielding AI to apply to a job. In truth, there is little that recruiters can do to stop the freewheeling artificial intelligence bandwagon. But this could be an opportunity to steer it in another direction.Indeed, Charlotte says recruiters who oppose the use of AI for job applications should adapt or be left behind. “If they don’t want people to use ChatGPT it might be time to update the application process for jobs and ask questions that AI can’t help with,” she shrugs.She might have a point. We’ve highlighted the mistakes and outdated practices that today’s managers commonly make during the hiring process. Many, such as ghosting applicants or setting overly-long assessment tasks, could be behind AI’s surging popularity.Bosses should use the advent of AI to audit their own talent strategy. Do your questions invite unique responses? Are you properly vetting a candidate’s CV? Blindly embracing AI is not the answer here, but neither is rejecting it outright.That ChatGPT is now an open tab on job seekers’ laptops proves the market is adapting. It’s time for business owners to do the same.More on this: uncover how AI can help you manage the hiring pipeline with our guide to using AI in project management.

Need to send an email? Generative AI can write it. Need to review a press release? Generative AI can edit it. Don’t want to review your meeting notes? Generative AI can summarize them.  It also didn’t take long for businesses to recognize the limitations of the public large language models (LLMs) that consumer generative AI technologies like ChatGPT are based on, leaving them and their employees searching for a secure and reliable generative AI tool.  The solution: C3 Generative AI — it’s designed for the enterprise and is distinct from consumer LLMs in several ways. It provides:  Security for an enterprise’s IP:  Yes, consumer LLMs can summarize meeting notes, but that information is at risk of being leaked since your data gets stored on external servers. C3 Generative AI eliminates LLM-leakage by isolating a business’s proprietary data from the LLM. This allows workers to submit queries and conduct data processing and analysis without fear of jeopardizing their business’s privacy and security.  Accurate answers:  While consumer generative AI can quickly return facts and figures, their answers are predicted based on the public, unverified data they are trained on, making them prone to generating false information, known as hallucinations. Relying on an enterprise’s proprietary data, C3 Generative AI ensures that answers come from the appropriate sources. When a user asks an unanswerable question, a safeguard blocks the application from hallucinating and generating an incorrect answer.  Consistent responses:  Two people can ask a consumer LLM like ChatGPT the same question, yet the LLM can produce two different answers. Rather than having the LLM predict an answer, C3 Generative AI employs a separate system, like a vector store connected to a retrieval model or a retrieval model connected to a database, to source relevant information from an enterprise’s data, which gets summarized by the LLM. Full traceability:  Even if consumer LLMs generated accurate and consistent information, workers have no way of tracing its source. With C3 Generative AI, the system shows which documents it’s using to generate answers. Complete access control:  Consumer LLMs give everyone equal access to all underlying data. This doesn’t suit the needs of a business or government agency, where what documents people can access are tied to their role. C3 Generative AI gives enterprises total control over which employees can see what. In a webinar on generative AI in the workplace, C3 AI’s lead product manager, Michael Haines, showcased these features, demonstrating how an investment banking analyst could review a lengthy financial bond document. C3 Generative AI sources information directly from a financial bond document to answer specific questions.  Through his queries, C3 Generative AI identified the purpose of the bond and located crucial information scattered throughout the document, completing the hours-long review process in seconds. If Haines wanted to further investigate where in the document answers are sourced from, the responses provide links to their exact locations.  Professionals want to use generative AI at work, but it’s important that they do so in a trustworthy and secure manner. Only by adopting generative AI designed specifically for the needs of the enterprise will professionals realize its full potential to help them work securely, efficiently, and effectively. In turn, workers can spend more time focusing on the high value and high complexity tasks that demand their attention.

Overview

        Generative Artificial Intelligence tools have been around for a while, but it was the release of ChatGPT that enabled this technology to be used by the masses on an everyday basis – an “iPhone moment” for generative AI. What impact will the increased use of (generative) AI have on our working
      














Have you found yourself asking which of your daily tasks could be done by artificial intelligence (AI) – whether at home or at the workplace? I can think of a few things. For example, I could have used ChatGPT to write this blog post for me (but I didn’t).

While artificial intelligence sifts through, structures and analyzes vast amounts of (unstructured) data, generative AI can even draw conclusions and create new content, based on the data that’s been used to train it. Since the AI-based chatbot ChatGPT was released to the general public at the end of November 2022, the topic of (generative) AI has been on everyone’s lips. After just five days, one million people had registered for ChatGPT; after two months, the number of registered users had reached 100 million. By comparison, Spotify took over four and a half years to cross the 100 million user threshold; Instagram took two and a half years and even TikTok took nine months. Only Threads, the new microblogging service, grew even faster than ChatGPT in its initial weeks.

Many people are therefore saying that artificial intelligence is having an “iPhone moment”, which is when, practically overnight, an already well-known technology is used by the masses on an everyday basis because a new, relatively simple product makes it easy for anyone to operate.

How will the increasing use of ChatGPT and other (generative) AI applications impact our working environment? And how will it change the nature of our work? Of course, at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, we are also faced with these questions. I would like to summarize my insights in four hypotheses:

1.    Automation of work processes is yesterday’s news – today, AI supports well-trained knowledge workers

Using AI is not about automated production processes in factories, i.e. robots, taking over people’s jobs. It is rather a matter of AI gathering and processing unstructured data and information. As such, it also has the potential to support well-trained knowledge workers.

A study by Goldman Sachs concludes that a good two thirds of occupations could be partially automated by AI in the future; only around 7% of jobs would be completely replaced by AI. Scientists at OpenAI – the start-up that developed ChatGPT – and the University of Pennsylvania assume that AI language models will change most jobs in some way or another. Around 80% of employees in the United States work in jobs in which at least one task could be carried out faster by generative AI. The scientists expect around 19% of employees to see at least half of their work tasks affected. Both studies conclude that AI applications will increasingly be used in offices and in administration but will see less use in skilled trades and in the operation of plants and machines where many processes are already automated.

2.    Job profiles are changing – from “creator” to “reviewer”

As AI supports our work to an ever-greater extent, the challenges we face will change. After all, some of the tasks that we’ve always had to do ourselves will be taken over by AI in the future, at least to a certain point. In the future, we will work less as “creators” of content such as letters, inventory lists and production plans because the AI can do this much quicker. Instead, we will increasingly take on a “reviewer” role and check whether the content created by the AI is correct and logical.

3.    Enabling instead of prohibiting – the management is paving the way

Since the AI can relieve us of many time-consuming activities, we need to learn to delegate tasks to it and use it as productively as possible. In other words, saying “no” to AI is not an option; quite the contrary, everyone should include these applications in their portfolio of work tools wherever they are useful and helpful.

Some companies are still trying to prohibit the use of ChatGPT out of fear that internal or even confidential information could be shared in a public network. This is understandable but also too short-sighted. Instead of blocking these innovations, I believe the more promising path forward is to enable employees to use them productively within the company in accordance with the rules. This is the path we have chosen at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, having recently installed our own version of ChatGPT. Incidentally, we’re one of the first companies to do this.

4.    ChatGPT is just the beginning – connecting it with other systems gives rise to unimaginable possibilities

Even if companies can’t get around ChatGPT, plug-ins give them a chance to freestyle. Using plug-ins – i.e., extensions that enable ChatGPT to access other programs – ChatGPT can obtain search engine results, create travel itineraries, compare prices, execute code, access documents, and much more. For example, connecting an internal chatbot, to an ERP system that manages the business processes of a company gives rise to completely new possibilities in manufacturing, logistics, supply chain, and accounting.

All of this is coming – the development towards artificial intelligence cannot be stopped. The dynamism and speed with which new AI applications are coming onto the market is massive and the expectations associated with it are great. AI will sharply increase the productivity of humans and processes and ultimately, the quality, innovative capacity, and delivery reliability of our products. We therefore see AI as a crucial instrument for maintaining a competitive edge.

Of course, increased use of (generative) AI is also associated with risks – especially of an ethical nature. For example, users looking at images and texts may no longer be able to distinguish between fact and fiction, or they might not know whether they’re interacting with a human or an AI – which can generally lead to a loss of trust in communication. At Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, we have therefore developed a Code of Digital Ethics, which provides our colleagues with clear principles on how they should handle ethical issues in a digital context. Moreover, these principles are integrated into critical processes, meaning the ethical issues are taken into consideration right from the start.

This just leaves one crucial question: How will AI impact the employment situation? At the beginning of this blog post, I quoted studies indicating that AI will change jobs rather than causing them to disappear completely. I am convinced that AI, in most cases, will not replace humans, but humans who can deal with AI will replace those who can’t or won’t.

AI has the potential to become an important part of the quantitative trading process at hedge funds and this shows in their recruitment. It also shows in their pay.

/news/2022/11/leave-goldman-sachs-for-a-fintech, the former Goldman Sachs salesman turned global head of financial services at tech infrastructure firm, Databricks says he's seen hedge funds paying ""top AI talent $320-$430k out of college."" AI guys are catching up with investment professionals in terms of pay, says Nakai.  Tech has moved ""from a cost center to THE source of competitive advantage"" he adds. 

Most big hedge funds are hiring in AI. Citadel, for example, is looking for experience in any one of ""machine learning, time-series analysis, pattern recognition or NLP.""

Steve Cohen's hedge fund, Point72, has AI quant roles plus multiple roles dedicated to enhancing research in the field, such as intern and graduate machine learning researchers. It's also hiring for an associate of its private equity division to specialize in 'deep tech.'

/news/2019/07/technology-jobs-banksBanks, having more employees than hedge funds, should have a lot more AI roles on offer, right? Not necessarily. It depends how you measure it, but some banks are barely hiring AI professionals. The graph below shows how many job listings banks have that specify a number of AI related terms in the name of the role. 

/news/2023/05/jpmorgan-data-science-machine-learning-jobs has made its /news/2023/05/jpmorgan-ai-engineering-jobs-fintechclear, and has the most jobs (although it's not yet hiring for its investment advice chatbot IndexGPT). Goldman's pursuit of NLP staff is also noticeable in its current job ads.  Citi's numbers are somewhat underwhelming given its plans to /news/2023/07/technology-jobs-banks this year, however the jobs it has are interesting - including an engineering and a research lead for a generative AI project in London.

Banks have more AI jobs on offer when they're categorised as jobs with an AI tag. JPMorgan has 132 jobs with this tag, while Goldman have 23 and Morgan Stanley have 10. However, many of the listings put AI experience down as a 'nice-to-have' rather than a necessity.

AI jobs in banks pay less than AI jobs in hedge funds. A senior associate graduate hire in AI research at JPMorgan with a master's or a PhD can earn $195k, but the lower end of the salary range is just $133k. There are still high earning opportunities out there however; Goldman has advertised for a NLP engineering VP for a ""new, scalable and resilient Generative AI platform"" capable of earning up to $250k

AI jobs in Fintech

/news/2023/07/how-to-get-a-job-in-fintech is another area where machine learning is appreciated, and it's no surprise that payments giant Stripe is one of the top companies hiring. It currently has 9 unique machine learning engineer listings and its highest paying, a staff engineer/technical leader, can earn a staggering $484.6k... as /news/2023/06/fintech-pay

It's not just Stripe though, on eFinancialCareers there are 65 jobs for/jobs/%22machine-learning%22?q=%22machine+learning%22&countryCode=US&radius=50&radiusUnit=mi&pageSize=15&filters.sectors=FINTECH&currencyCode=USD&language=en&includeUnspecifiedSalary=true, with companies like Monzo, Plaid and Ramp all hiring.

Artificial Intelligence has sparked an unprecedented transformation across the global landscape. As we inch closer to a future where AI includes not just technical tasks but roles necessitating interpersonal intelligence, we find ourselves at a crucial juncture. “In all activities of life, the secret of efficiency lies in an ability to combine two seemingly incompatible states: a state of maximum activity and a state of maximum relaxation,” once said Aldous Huxley, famous English writer and philosopher.

If we were to follow the current trajectory of AI, and assuming the pace of progress continues unhampered (projected to reach $1,345.2 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 36.62 percent according MarketsandMarkets June 2023 report), we could witness a precipitous decline in the labor participation rate by the 2030s. We could very well be steering towards a post-work society. As my fellow Forbes contributor, Rob Toews recently wrote in this very publication: “There will not be nearly enough meaningful jobs to employ every working-age person. More radically, we will not need people to work in order to generate the material wealth necessary for everyone’s healthy subsistence.”

At first stroke, a world devoid of labor participation seems dystopian, according to current experts and ethicists. The fear of being relegated to idle spectators in an AI-dominated world is palpable.

However, this perspective warrants reevaluation. It is very flawed.
The seismic shift towards a post-work society does not signify an end to human productivity or purpose. Instead, it presents an opportunity to redefine 'work' and untangle our identities from traditional employment as we see it today.

Unleashing the Human Renaissance in a Post-Work Society
Work has transformed over the centuries from being a matter of survival to becoming an economic imperative. The next evolutionary leap could reshape work as a channel for self-expression and fulfillment. The dawn of a post-work era could herald a liberation from simple tasks and a celebration of qualities that make us uniquely human: creativity, empathy, innovation, and complex social interaction.

Imagine an AI-managed hotel that delivers impeccable service but where human hosts infuse the stay with warmth and personal connection. Imagine a restaurant where AI-assisted culinary precision meets the human touch of a sommelier who personalizes your dining experience with intimate knowledge of your preferences. We will be there to enhance and delight, no longer responsible for so-called “grunt work.”
Venturing Into the Uncharted
The advent of AI does not herald an end but opens a new frontier of opportunities. By handling tasks currently beyond our imagination, AI clears the path for humans to explore careers yet to be envisioned. Consider that 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years  according April 2023 Goldman Sachs research can be attributed to technological advances creating new positions.
As the sun rises on the post-work society, we may find ourselves investing more time in activities that underscore our humanity: focusing on social needs, creating art, sharing and consuming narratives, building passion humanity projects, and even turning our sights skyward, with the colonization of the Moon and Mars transforming from distant dreams to tangible realities.
The Future is an Enhanced Human ExperienceAI (Artificial Intelligence) concept. Deep learning. Visual contents.getty
In this audacious new era, our thirst for purposeful and challenging endeavors will persist. This transition isn't about AI replacing humans; it's about AI emancipating us to focus on being more human.
The shift towards a post-work society signifies a progression from surviving to thriving. It’s about shifting from living to work, to working to live, in the most profound sense. Our future will be less about competing with AI and more about leveraging it to amplify our human experience.
As we traverse the precipice of this extraordinary future, one truth holds firm: our ability to adapt, innovate, and infuse technology with our quintessentially human spirit will guide us into this limitless era of humanity’s next evolution. Are we close to realizing Huxley’s vision of true efficiency? I believe the answer is yes, and that AI is the tool that will take us there.

If someone can type my name [into an AI tool] to make a book cover and not hire me, that affects my career and so many other people.""The new wave of generative AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data -  text, images, video, and audio files, all scraped from the internet. Content can be created within seconds of a simple text prompt.Kelly McKernanKelly McKernan has joined other artists in a lawsuit against generative AI organisationsWhat is artificial intelligence and will it take jobs?However, artists like Ms McKernan are fighting back.Together with cartoonist Sarah Anderson and illustrator Karla Ortiz, Ms McKernan has filed a lawsuit against Stability AI, the company behind Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DeviantArt, an online art community with its own generator called DreamUp.It adds to a growing stack of lawsuits against AI firms, which are testing issues of copyright.Earlier this year Getty Images filed a case against Stability AI, alleging that the company unlawfully copied and processed 12 million of the company's images without permission.Eva Toorenent, an artist creating mostly creature design, monster and fantasy illustrations, says she became concerned about AI after attending a gallery where she was surprised to see a piece of art with similarities to her own - which she describes as a ""corrupted version"". ""I remember thinking, if this can happen on a small scale, it can happen on a giant scale,"" says the artist from Zandvoort in the Netherlands. Aggrieved by the lack of protection for artists, she grouped together with five other artists to set up the European Guild of Artificial Intelligence Regulation.""The aim is to create legislation and regulation to protect copyright holders and artists from predatory AI companies,"" she says.Eva ToorenentArtist Eva Toorenent is campaigning for AI regulationMs McKernan agrees that there needs to be more regulation and protection for artists. ""As it is, copyright can only be applied to my complete image. I hope it [the lawsuit] encourages protection for artists so AI can't be used to replace us. If we win, I hope a lot of artists are paid. It's free labour and some people are profiteering from exploiting.""In December, Stability AI said that artists could opt out of the next version of Stable Diffusion, a statement that did not go down well with artists who felt that the default should be ""opt-in"".In response, Ms Toorenent says: ""Firstly, I would never put my work into it. But if artists do want to, it should be opt in. If I'm the owner, I should decide what happens to my art.""Stability AI said is not able to comment on ongoing legal proceedings, but in December 2022 chief executive Emad Mostaque tweeted that future models would be ""fully licensed"".Performing arts and entertainment union Equity says AI has become an increasing threat to artists. ""There is a legitimate fear,"" says Liam Budd, industrial official for audio and new media at Equity.He says the current rights framework for artists does not reflect the business opportunities of generative AI.Mr Budd says an artist might receive a one-off payment of £300 ($390) to have their image or voice reproduced using AI, but that original work might be used thousands or millions of times, with no financial benefit to the artist. ""We need more clarity in law and are campaigning for the Copyright Act to be updated,"" he says.Last year Equity launched a toolkit to help performers understand the issues and protect themselves.More technology of business:Do you need a degree to work in tech?Lean times hit the vertical farming businessThe quest to grow the perfect strawberryHow an autopilot could handle an emergency descentCan Amsterdam make the circular economy work?Countries are scrambling to react to these new powerful forms of AI.The EU appears to be taking the lead, with the EU AI Act proposing that AI tools will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to train their systems.In the UK, a global summit on AI safety will take place this autumn. ""AI throws up lots of intellectual property queries and because machines are trained on a lot of data and information that's protected by intellectual property, I'm not sure users or AI [companies] understand that,"" says Arty Rajendra, an IP lawyer and partner at law firm Osborne Clarke.""Courts haven't been asked to determine it yet but there's several cases in the UK and US including Getty now which will determine if it is infringement and who is liable. There's data protections and moral questions that have to be answered as well. What we might see is some kind of settlements, and maybe some licence fees.""She says there has been a number of litigation cases from photographers using small claims tracks.So what can other artists do in the meantime?Ms Rajendra explains that the giant photography firm Getty watermarked its images. So, when used in AI generative images, the watermark still shows up and it enables them to track usage of their images. She says artists could do the same.Artists could also approach the AI entity and ask for a license fee and if they don't' agree they could pursue legal action through a small claims tracker which is cheaper than a fancy law firm, she says.While regulators play catch up, some tools are emerging to help protect artists. University of ChicagoBen Zhao has developed software which can help protect an artist's workIn March, Ben Zhao, professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and his team launched a free software tool called Glaze to help protect artists against generative AI models. Glaze exploits a fundamental difference between how humans and AI models view images, says Prof Zhao.""For each image, we are able to compute a small set of pixel level changes that dramatically change how an AI art model ""sees"" the art while minimising visual changes to how humans see the art,"" he says.""When artists glaze their art, and that art is then used to train a model to mimic then the model sees an incorrect representation of the art style, and its mimicry would be useless and not match the artist.""He says Glaze is suitable for a wide range of art including black and white cartoons, classical oil paintings, flat art styles, and professional photography.He says Glaze has had 938,600 downloads and the team have received thousands of emails, tweets, messages from artists across the globe. ""The reaction has been overwhelming,"" he says.Ms Toorenent is feeling optimistic that artists may just win this fight. ""I was pretty scared at the start due to the amount of online harassment but because we united and have good support network to all this mess.""I know we're moving in right direction. Public opinion has changed a lot. Originally people were saying 'adapt or die', and now everyone like 'oh wait, this isn't cool'.""CopyrightArtificial intelligence",,,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66231268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17304/production/_130408949_kellycopy.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DDN says generative AI/ML work needs balanced read/write IO mix

Analysis: DDN says storage for generative AI and other AI work needs a balance of read and write speed, claiming its own storage provides the best balance because of its write speed superiority over competing systems.
Update. Dell PowerScale F600 write bandwidth performance added. 31 July 2023.
The company supplies its Exascaler AI400X2 array with Magnum I/O GPUDirect certification for use with Nvidia’s DGX SuperPod AI processing system. It uses 60TB QLC (4bits/cell) SSDs and has a compression facility to boost effective capacity. Some 48 AI400X2 arrays are in use with Nvidia’s largest SuperPODs according to DDN, which said it shipped more AI storage in the first quarter of this year than in all of 2022. 
SVP for Products at DDN, James Coomer, has written a blog, Exascale? Let’s Talk, in which he says that an AI storage system has to support all stages of the AI workload cycle. “That means ingest, preparation, deep learning, checkpointing, post-processing, etc, etc, and needs the full spectrum of IO patterns to be served well.”



AI processing read-write mix
What IO patterns? Coomer cites an OSTI.GOV whitepaper, Characterizing Machine Learning I/O Workloads on Leadership Scale HPC Systems, which studied: ”the darshan logs of more than 23,000 HPC ML I/O jobs over a time period of one year running on Summit – the second-fastest supercomputer in the world”. Darshan is an HPC IO characterization tool. Summit’s storage was the GPFS (Storage Scale) parallel filesystem.
The whitepaper says: “It has been typically seen that ML workloads have small read and write access patterns,” and “Most ML jobs are perceived to be read-intensive with a lot of small reads while a few ML jobs also perform small writes.” But, “from our study, we observe that ML workloads generate a large number of small file reads and writes.” 
The paper says  ~99% of the read and write calls “are less than 10MB calls. … ML workloads from all science domains generate a large number of small file reads and writes.”A chart shows their finding with GPFS-using workloads: 


There is a roughly even balance between read and write IO. Coomer’s blog has a chart showing the balance between read and write IO calls with small calls (less than 1MB) dominating the scene:

The paper’s authors say: “The temporal trend of ML workloads shows that there is an exponential increase in the I/O activity from ML workloads which is indicative of the future which will be dominated by ML. Therefore better storage solutions need to be designed that can handle the diverse I/O patterns from future HPC ML I/O workloads.”
Armed with this balanced and small read/write preponderance finding Coomer looks at the IO capabilities of different QLC flash systems using NFS compared to the DDN AI400X2 storage.
He contrasts a part-rack DDN AI400X2 system that can provide 800GBps of write bandwidth with a competing but un-named system needing 20 racks to do the same.

Coomer’s graphic showing DDN (right) and competing supplier’s QLC/NFS system (left) needed to meet his 800GBps write target. The white rectangles represent empty rack space
Coomer told us: “The servers and storage are all there (embedded inside the AI400NVX2) and no switches are needed for the back end. We plug directly into the customer IB or Ethernet network. The DDN write performance number is a measured one by a customer not just datasheet.”
What competing system?
We looked at various QLC flash/NFS systems to try and find out more. For reference, an AI400X2 system can deliver 90 GBps of read bandwidth and 65 GBps write bandwidth from its 2RU chassis. Twelve of them hit 1.08 TBps read and 780 GBps write. Thirteen would reach 1.17 TBps read and 845 GBps write bandwidth from 26 RU of rack space.
It’s necessary to include the servers and switches in the alternative systems to make a direct comparison with the DDN system.
VAST Data Lightspeed storage nodes provides 50 GBps from a 44RU configuration. We would need 16 of these to achieve 800 GBps write speed, plus the associated compute nodes and switches. Say ~20 racks roughly; it depends upon the storage node-compute node balance.
A newer VAST Data Ceres system provides 680 GBps from 14 racks, 48.6 GBps per rack, meaning 17 racks would be needed to reach the 800 GBps write speed level:
 

The slide captioning at the bottom mentions 680 GBps write bandwidth. 
A Pure Storage FlashArray//C60 has up to 8 GBps throughput from its 6RU chassis. If we assume that is write bandwidth and we have 1.3 GBps per RU and will need 14 or so racks to reach 800 GBps write speed.
Update. Forty eight Dell PowerScale F600s demonstrated 56.4GiBps sending data to 48 Nvidia GPUs, 1.175GiB/node (1.26GB/node). A node is 1RU in size and, therefore, to achieve 800GBps write bandwidth there would need to be 635 nodes; about 15 fully populated racks.
Scale-out NFS inefficiency
In Coomer’s view scale-out NFS system architectures are inefficient because they are complex:


DDN’s Exascaler AI400X2 system does away with the server-interconnect-buffer complexity because its client nodes know where the data is located:


It can provide, Coomer argues, the balanced small read and write IO performance that ML workloads, like generative AI, need, according to the OSTI.GOV research. It can do this from significantly less rackspace than alternative QLC flash/NFS systems. And that means less power and cooling is needed in AI data centers using the DDN kit.

What can you do about it?by  Sara MorrisonJul 27, 2023, 7:15 AM EDTFacebookLinkGetty Imagespart ofThe rise of artificial intelligence, explainedsee all  Sara Morrison is a senior Vox reporter who has covered data privacy, antitrust, and Big Tech’s power over us all for the site since 2019.When the White House revealed its list of voluntary safety and societal commitments signed by seven AI companies, one thing was noticeably missing: anything related to the data these AI systems collect and use to train this powerful technology. Including, very likely, yours.There are many concerns about the potential harm that sophisticated generative AI systems have unleashed on the public. What they do with our data is one of them. We know very little about where these models get the petabytes of data they need, how that data is being used, and what protections, if any, are in place when it comes to sensitive information. The companies that make these systems aren’t telling us much, and may not even know themselves.Vox TechnologyGet weekly dispatches from Vox writers about how technology is changing the world — and how it's changing us.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.You may be okay with all of this, or think the good that generative AI can do far outweighs whatever bad went into building it. But a lot of other people aren’t. Two weeks ago, a viral tweet accused Google of scraping Google Docs for data on which to train its AI tools. In a follow-up, its author claimed that Google “used docs and emails to train their AI for years.” The initial tweet has nearly 10 million views, and it’s been retweeted thousands of times. The fact that this may not even be true is almost beside the point. (Google says it doesn’t use data from its free or enterprise Workspace products — that includes Gmail and Docs — to train its generative AI models unless it has user permission, though it does train some Workspace AI features like spellcheck and Smart Compose using anonymized data.) “Up until this point, tech companies have not done what they’re doing now with generative AI, which is to take everyone’s information and feed it into a product that can then contribute to people’s professional obsolescence and totally decimate their privacy in ways previously unimaginable,” said Ryan Clarkson, whose law firm is behind class action lawsuits against OpenAI and Microsoft and Google. Google’s general counsel, Halimah DeLaine Prado, said in a statement that the company has been clear that it uses data from public sources, adding that “American law supports using public information to create new beneficial uses, and we look forward to refuting these baseless claims.”Exactly what rights we may have over our own information, however, is still being worked out in lawsuits, worker strikes, regulator probes, executive orders, and possibly new laws. Those might take care of your data in the future, but what can you do about what these companies already took, used, and profited from? The answer is probably not a whole lot.Generative AI companies are hungry for your data. Here’s how they get it.Simply put, generative AI systems need as much data as possible to train on. The more they get, the better they can generate approximations of how humans sound, look, talk, and write. The internet provides massive amounts of data that’s relatively easy to gobble up through web scraping tools and APIs. But that gobbling process doesn’t distinguish between copyrighted works or personal data; if it’s out there, it takes it. “In the absence of meaningful privacy regulations, that means that people can scrape really widely all over the internet, take anything that is ‘publicly available’ — that top layer of the internet for lack of a better term — and just use it in their product,” said Ben Winters, who leads the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s AI and Human Rights Project and co-authored its report on generative AI harms. Which means that, unbeknownst to you and, apparently, several of the companies whose sites were being scraped, some startup may be taking and using your data to power a technology you had no idea was possible. That data may have been posted on the internet years before these companies existed. It may not have been posted by you at all. Or you may have thought you were giving a company your data for one purpose that you were fine with, but now you’re afraid it was used for something else. Many companies’ privacy policies, which are updated and changed all the time, may let them do exactly that. They often say something along the lines of how your data may be used to improve their existing products or develop new ones. Conceivably, that includes generative AI systems. Not helping matters is how cagey generative AI companies have been about revealing their data sources, often simply saying that they’re “publicly available.” Even Meta’s more detailed list of sources for its first LLaMA model refers to things like “Common Crawl,” which is an open source archive of the entire internet, as well as sites like Github, Wikipedia, and Stack Exchange, which are also enormous repositories of information. (Meta hasn’t been as forthcoming about the data used for the just-released Llama 2.) All of these sources may contain personal information. OpenAI admits that it uses personal data to train its models, but says it comes across that data “incidentally” and only uses it to make “our models better,” as opposed to building profiles of people to sell ads to them.Google and Meta have vast troves of personal user data they say they don’t use to train their language models now, but we have no guarantee they won’t do so in the future, especially if it means gaining a competitive advantage. We know that Google scanned users’ emails for years in order to target ads (the company says it no longer does this). Meta had a major scandal and a $5 billion fine when it shared data with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, which then misused it. The fact is, these companies have given users plenty of reasons not to take their assurances about data privacy or commitments to produce safe systems at face value.“The voluntary commitments by big tech require a level of trust that they don’t deserve, and they have not earned,” Clarkson said.Copyrights, privacy laws, and “publicly available” dataFor creators — writers, musicians, and actors, for instance — copyrights and image rights are a major issue, and it’s pretty obvious why. Generative AI models have both been trained on their work and could put them out of work in the future. That’s why comedian Sarah Silverman is suing OpenAI and Meta as part of a class action lawsuit. She alleges that the two companies trained off of her written work by using datasets that contained text from her book, The Bedwetter. There are also lawsuits over image rights and the use of open source computer code.The use of generative AI is also one of the reasons why writers and actors are on strike, with both of their unions, the WGA and SAG-AFTRA, fearing that studios will train AI models on artists’ words and images and simply generate new content without compensating the original human creators. But you, the average person, might not have intellectual property to protect, or at least your livelihood may not depend on it. So your concerns might be more about how companies like OpenAI are protecting your privacy when their systems scoop it up, remix it, and spit it back out.Regulators, lawmakers, and lawyers are wondering about this, too. Italy, which has stronger privacy laws than the US, even temporarily banned ChatGPT over privacy issues. Other European countries are looking into doing their own probes of ChatGPT. The Federal Trade Commission has also set its sights on OpenAI, investigating it for possible violations of consumer protection laws. The agency has also made it clear that it will keep a close eye on generative AI tools. But the FTC can only enforce what the laws allow it to. President Biden has encouraged Congress to pass AI-related bills, and many members of Congress have said they want to do the same. Congress is notoriously slow-moving, however, and has done little to regulate or protect consumers from social media platforms. Lawmakers may learn a lesson from this and act faster when it comes to AI, or they may repeat their mistake. The fact that there is interest in doing something relatively soon after generative AI’s introduction to the general public is promising.“The pace at which people have introduced legislation and said they want to do something about [AI] is, like, 9 million times faster than it was with any of these other issues,” Winters said.But it’s also hard to imagine Congress acting on data privacy. The US doesn’t have a federal consumer online privacy law. Children under 13 do get some privacy protections, as do residents of states that passed their own privacy laws. Some types of data are protected, too. That leaves a lot of adults across the country with very little by way of data privacy rights.We will likely be looking at the courts to figure out how generative AI fits with the laws we already have, which is where people like Clarkson come in.“This is a chance for the people to have their voice heard, through these lawsuits,” he said. “And I think that they’re going to demand action on some of these issues that we haven’t made much progress through the other channels thus far. Transparency, the ability to opt out, compensation, ethical sourcing of data — those kinds of things.”In some instances, Clarkson and Tim Giordano, a partner at Clarkson Law Firm who is also working on these cases, said there’s existing law that doesn’t explicitly cover people’s rights with generative AI but which a judge can interpret to apply there. In others, there are things like California’s privacy law, which requires companies that share or sell people’s data to give them a way to opt out and delete their information. “There’s currently no way for these models to delete the personal information that they’ve learned about us, so we think that that’s a clear example of a privacy violation,” Giordano said. ChatGPT’s opt out and data deletion tools, for example, are only for data collected by people using the ChatGPT service. It does have a way for people in “certain jurisdictions” to opt out of having their data processed by OpenAI’s models now, but it also doesn’t guarantee it will do so and it requires that you provide evidence that your data was processed in the first place.Although OpenAI recently changed its policy and has stopped training models off data provided by its own customers, another set of privacy concerns crops up with how these models use the data you give them when you use them and the information they release into the wild. “Customers clearly want us not to train on their data,” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, told CNBC, an indicator that people aren’t comfortable with their data being used to train AI systems, though only some are given the chance to opt out of it, and in limited circumstances. Meanwhile, OpenAI has been sued for defamation over a ChatGPT response that falsely claimed that someone had defrauded and stolen money from a non-profit. And this isn’t the only time a ChatGPT response levied false accusations against someone.So what can you currently do about any of this? That’s what’s so tricky here. A lot of the privacy issues now are the result of a failure to pass real, meaningful privacy laws in the past that could have protected your data before these datasets and technologies even existed. You can always try to minimize the data you put out there now, but you can’t do much about what’s already been scraped and used. You’d need a time machine for that, and not even generative AI has been able to invent one yet.A version of this story was also published in the Vox technology newsletter.

You’ve no doubt heard of ChatGPT, the amazing chatbot that can produce remarkably high quality text on any number of topics. When it first hit the scene, social media was filled with fun but non-essential uses for it, like writing bedtime stories featuring your kids, hammering out last minute wedding speeches or helping cheat on college essays. 
But it wasn’t long before ChatGPT had passed the SAT, GRE and LSAT — scoring in the 90th percentile on the bar exam. Lawyers started to take note, some cautiously experimented, while others took a more foolhardy approach preparing a court filing with it to catastrophic results. Regardless, it quickly became clear that this technology’s enormous store of knowledge, seeming ability to reason and its textual interface make it ideally suited to the legal domain.
In the coming months and years, generative AI is going to transform legal work at companies. In-house lawyers, legal operations, contract managers and paralegals will all be affected, but so will every team that interacts with legal, from sales and procurement to finance and IT. Legal is a big field so I’ll focus primarily on the day-to-day legal tasks that affect most companies.
 
How Generative AI Will Impact Legal Teams
AI is not new to in-house legal teams. Several companies, mine included, have been building AI tools for the legal domain for years, saving people thousands of hours of manual work, extracting key dates, parties and terms from tens of thousands of agreements automatically. Generative AI promises to open up a whole new set of amazing capabilities.
One of the most remarkable abilities of generative AI-powered tools is their ability to automatically review and redline a contract according to a company’s existing playbook, with a high degree of accuracy. For instance, if a company requires that all vendors must be paid 90 days after an invoice, they aren’t allowed to use the company’s logo in marketing and they must agree to the state of Delaware to settle disputes, the AI can immediately read the vendor’s contract and flag language that violates these rules and propose edits without human intervention. It can then provide a fully redlined Word document to send to the counterparty and draft an email summarizing the main points of contention. 
If this seems too good to be true, there is a catch: No matter how well generative AI performs these surprisingly challenging tasks, it doesn’t always get it right. This is why the features should be used as an assistant to an attorney who can review and correct any mistakes. Even though the AI summaries provide a great first draft, only your lawyer understands the business and relationship context required to edit unnecessary details and focus on the points that will close the deal.
Still, AI assistants are already showing time-savings of 30-to-80 percent when reviewing contracts. In addition to automatic redlining, these assistants can help draft new clauses by providing suggested legal text, modifying existing contract language based on simple directions and learning proper clause language from your existing corpus of contracts. 
When you consider how many contracts are reviewed and signed across all companies annually, it’s easy to see how much of a difference just this one feature can make.

How Generative AI-Powered Legal Tools Impact the Company
Generative AI won’t just benefit legal teams, but also all other teams that work closely with legal, such as finance, IT, and HR, and who rely on them to get critical business deals done (such as sales and procurement).
With generative AI, legal teams can create automations that can understand an email or a Microsoft Teams message requesting legal forms like a non-disclosure agreement, a customer order, offer letter, vendor agreement, generate the appropriate document, route it to the right person for review, seek approval, obtain signatures and file it away once signed. It has the ability to coordinate this whole flow efficiently, without waiting for someone to route it manually.
This has the potential to make it easier for other teams to get immediate help on simple questions with low legal risk. 
For instance, before meeting a major customer, you need to understand what they’ve been buying from you, the pricing, payment schedules, penalties on missing delivery dates and any other aspects of the deal. Instead of emailing the legal team and waiting for context, generative AI can immediately show you the relevant contracts, summarize their key details and act as a live chatbot to help you understand any nuances. With the right integrations, these insights and automations can be available in the systems your teams already use, such as CRMs used by sales teams, procure-to-pay platforms used by procurement organizations, or HRIS systems used by HR teams.
The same assistants that can review contracts within Word, can also be trained to help automatically fill out request for proposals (RFPs), data protection agreements (DPAs), and security questionnaires based on your company’s prior answers. Given that these are often negotiated, reviewed and signed together with contracts, GenAI assistants can speed up the process for legal teams as well as the IT and finance teams that are often part of the deal-making process.
AI is imperfect, however, and can sometimes provide incorrect information. This is why tools that appropriately scope answers to minimize and flag legal risk are critical. But given how these tools allow business users to self-serve, tasks that previously required legal teams to interrupt their work may now be completed more efficiently and faster.

How to Take Advantage of Generative AI-Powered Legal Tools
While generative AI has the potential to automate many different legal tasks, it’s no time to panic. Instead, lawyers should celebrate. GenAI means no more gophering to find contracts for teammates, or answering basic questions about marketing logos. And no more reviewing the same basic aspects of a contract.
Instead, it will provide legal team members with more time to coach the business on legal issues and negotiate the finer points of the deal. Like all technological waves, you can either ride on top of it, shedding the rote parts of your job to focus on higher value, or get swept under by not adapting. 
Find the time to get educated on available tools by speaking with peers at events and watching free vendor webinars. Tap into legal and legal operations communities to learn what’s coming, and what early adopters are saying. Recognize this as an incredible growth opportunity. It’s not the AI that will win vs. the human, but the human-AI partnership that will win overall.
For business leaders, this is the time to recognize that up-leveling your teams, and giving them access to these tools will build lasting competitive advantages and allow you to scale efficiently as you grow. Give your teams the time to learn, and the autonomy to invest in proof-of-concepts that focus on one or two critical pain points to test the waters, instead of boiling the ocean or decision-by-committee projects that take too long to come to fruition.

A jargon-free explanation of how AI large language models work
Want to really understand large language models? Here’s a gentle primer.

For example, one researcher asked GPT-4 to draw a unicorn using an obscure graphics programming language called TiKZ. GPT-4 responded with a few lines of code that the researcher then fed into the TiKZ software. The resulting images were crude, but they showed clear signs that GPT-4 had some understanding of what unicorns look like.

The researchers thought GPT-4 might have somehow memorized code for drawing a unicorn from its training data, so they gave it a follow-up challenge: They altered the unicorn code to remove the horn and move some of the other body parts. Then they asked GPT-4 to put the horn back on. GPT-4 responded by putting the horn in the right spot:Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

GPT-4 was able to do this even though the training data for the version tested by the authors was entirely text-based. That is, there were no images in its training set. But GPT-4 apparently learned to reason about the shape of a unicorn’s body after training on a huge amount of written text.
At the moment, we don’t have any real insight into how LLMs accomplish feats like this. Some people argue that such examples demonstrate that the models are starting to truly understand the meanings of the words in their training set. Others insist that language models are “stochastic parrots” that merely repeat increasingly complex word sequences without truly understanding them. Ars VideoHow Scientists Respond to Science Deniers
This debate points to a deep philosophical tension that may be impossible to resolve. Nonetheless, we think it is important to focus on the empirical performance of models like GPT-3. If a language model can consistently get the right answer for a particular type of question, and if researchers are confident that they have controlled for confounds (e.g., ensuring that the language model was not exposed to those questions during training), then that is an interesting and important result, whether or not the model understands language in exactly the same sense that people do.
Another possible reason that training with next-token prediction works so well is that language itself is predictable. Regularities in language are often (though not always) connected to regularities in the physical world. So when a language model learns about relationships among words, it’s often implicitly learning about relationships in the world, too.
Further, prediction may be foundational to biological intelligence as well as artificial intelligence. In the view of philosophers like Andy Clark, the human brain can be thought of as a “prediction machine” whose primary job is to make predictions about our environment that can then be used to navigate that environment successfully. Intuitively, making good predictions benefits from good representations—you’re more likely to navigate successfully with an accurate map than an inaccurate one. The world is big and complex, and making predictions helps organisms efficiently orient and adapt to that complexity.
Traditionally, a major challenge for building language models was figuring out the most useful way of representing different words—especially because the meanings of many words depend heavily on context. The next-word prediction approach allows researchers to sidestep this thorny theoretical puzzle by turning it into an empirical problem. It turns out that if we provide enough data and computing power, language models end up learning a lot about how human language works simply by figuring out how to best predict the next word. The downside is that we wind up with systems whose inner workings we don’t fully understand.

AI has set its sights on 300 million jobs around the globe, about 9.1% of all the world’s jobs, and here in the U.S., 24% of the workforce is concerned about being replaced by AI.


Yes, AI will take your job; however, it will gift two or three new jobs in its place. The thing is, we can’t be certain what those new jobs will be.

Remember when the big news was that high school students would grow up to pursue careers that didn’t exist yet? Technology promised to do that, and it kept its word. The kids rode the wave and rolled comfortably into the evolving technology economies of the past three decades. Some older workers retooled; some fell through the cracks. Innovation does that. And those high school kids? Some of them grew up to create technologies that are introducing new waves of employment unknowns.

Humans have likely been toolmakers for a solid 2.6 million years. Many of our innovations reduce the need for labor (jobs). When we mastered farming, a few people could make sure that the rest of us had enough to eat. Urban civilization bloomed. Many quit or were pushed out of their hunter-gatherer jobs. New roles emerged, including the prestigious scribe, whose descendants now fear being replaced by generative AI.

In fact, no occupation is immune. This time, it’s not just about robots taking over manufacturing. The new threat of replacement extends to college-educated white-collar positions. These roles are now vulnerable to replacement by AI.
Bank tellers, postal clerks, cashiers, and data entry workers have long had reason to worry about job obsolescence. As AI use expands, workers in marketing and advertising, accountants and tax preparers, mathematicians, various analysts, writers, web designers, lawyers, and many others may be displaced. And those robots that will keep taking jobs from humans are now supercharged with AI.

The World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report offers some insight into the pace at which AI is moving. The report gathered input from 803 companies with a collective population totaling 11.3 million employees. It examined 27 industry clusters and 45 economies. What was generally found is that in the post-COVID-19 world, there are still significant barriers to job creation, and high unemployment persists in low-income economies. Innovation, environmental factors, and economic trends are shaking up employment around the globe. This May 2023 report confirms that technology, in particular AI, is reshaping job markets.

Many economies are experiencing cost-of-living crises. Women and minimally educated individuals face high unemployment. But AI is finding work. Wages are declining in many places while, elsewhere, investments in emerging technologies are on the rise. More than 85% of businesses examined for the report see adoption of big data, cloud computing, and AI as central to their development and success. And with the focus on AI, the nature of work itself is changing.
Technology has long been the giver and taker of jobs. When John Deere developed the Hawkeye Riding Cultivator in 1863, it took a job away from many (relieved) horses, oxen, and humans. It delivered new jobs in manufacturing, maintenance, repair, advertising, and many other areas. Whenever we innovate to reduce steps, lighten loads, save time, or reduce the need for manual labor, jobs are lost. But new jobs lie just beyond the innovation horizon. In the meantime, lost jobs are lost business.
If the changes are too disruptive, they can reshape purchasing power. Even in a high-income nation, the loss of jobs to AI can send negative ripple effects across the economy.
Leaders can make choices that empower their people and position their businesses to take advantage of emerging trends.
Businesses can devise scenarios and projects that let their people pilot and extend their AI skills. Exposing every level of your organization to AI can be achieved at low costs. Individual and collaborative assignments can get workers accustomed to partnering with tools like ChatGPT. Introductory use can be tied to existing tasks. But treat it like real training.
1. Capture feedback and analyze results.
2. Identify team and individual strengths and weaknesses.
3. Create and implement plans for improvement.
Upskilling your workers will benefit your bottom line. It will also enhance your reputation as some of these employees leave and go to work at other companies. Wherever they find themselves, their familiarity and skills can help reduce disruption as AI becomes more deeply integrated into work. Little improvements help keep the workforce employable and partly inoculate the economy against future talent shortage.
The fact that many people will be performing jobs that do not yet exist is way less than half of the story. The really big news is the talent shortage. In the U.S., there are not enough appropriately skilled workers or available labor to fill many technological and other positions. Fearing more than preparing may result in AI widening that talent gap.
For organizations and individuals, surviving major transitions usually means reinvention and building new skills. Brace yourself and your business. The unpredictable impact of AI will require old fashioned change management. Even if your business is not involved in areas that are directly affected, changes to paradigms and ecosystems will set off ripple effects. There is no place to hide from AI.
Areas like agriculture and education will continue to welcome humans. Analytical and creative thinking are still highly desirable and enhance employability. Someone has to create the content that the chatbots will draw from, as they generate their responses to our prompts. And remember those jobs that could not work from home during the pandemic—security, healthcare, law enforcement, firefighting, warehouse management, and logistics? They’re safe, for now. AI can enhance them, streamline them, but it cannot eliminate them.
The Future of Jobs Report indicates that businesses plan to meet their goals by training new hires and current staff and by using AI and other forms of automation. People’s fear that AI will replace them still has some merit. But what is coming looks more like a deepening partnership between humans and digital technology. AI extends individuals’ capabilities and can filter out distractions. Targeted upskilling can close the training gaps, ensure that workers transition to the emerging economy, help businesses thrive, and reduce the talent shortage that can weaken the workforce and slow down economic growth.
1. Innovation and technological advancement have often introduced new jobs and eliminated a few, so remain flexible, prepare your people, train them, and let them practice.
2. Find ways to get your workforce accustomed to using AI by applying generative AI tools to existing functions, projects, and tasks.
3. Don’t even think about opting out or dismissing AI as a passing fad or trend of the moment; AI, chatbots, and most of the high-investment emerging technologies are here for the foreseeable future, so make a plan, and engage as soon as possible.

The Future Of Art: Generative AI, Web3 And The Immersive InternetAdobe Stock

Artists have always been at the forefront of innovation and creativity, and the metaverse provides them with a new canvas to express themselves. The future internet will give artists the ability to create innovative new work, share their art with a global audience, and get compensated more fairly for their efforts.

Let’s dig into what future internet technology will mean for artists and collectors, explore its possibilities, and discuss how artists can adapt to this new digital world.

Navigating the Intersection of Art and Web3 Technologies

PROMOTED
As we venture deeper into the digital age, the canvas of creativity is becoming increasingly virtual. Artists, no longer confined to the traditional tools and spaces of their craft, are exploring and embracing new technologies that redefine their creative boundaries. In the forefront of this avant-garde movement are Web3 technologies — a set of decentralized, blockchain-based systems that promise to reconfigure the contours of artistic creation, ownership, and consumption.
Here are three of the biggest ways web3 technologies — particularly NFTs — will enable artists to take back control of their art, including how they get paid and how their work is used:


With NFTs and automatically executing smart contracts, artists can receive a portion of the sale every time their work is sold and resold among collectors.
Blockchain records will potentially add value to pieces of NFT artwork because artists and collectors will be able to see where each piece of art came from and who has owned it since it was initially sold.
Digital art will create a new class of assets that will be a better fit for people who live in the digital world just as much as they do in the physical world.

In this process, artists design algorithms or rules that AI follows to generate art pieces, leading to an exciting blend of human creativity and machine efficiency. The resulting artwork, inherently unpredictable due to the nature of algorithms, often possesses a unique dynamism, complexity, and scale that could not be achieved by human hand alone.

This innovative process can result in a near-infinite variety of art pieces; each one imbued with a singular identity by its algorithmic genesis. By tying generative AI art to Web3 infrastructure, artists can issue each of these unique pieces as NFTs, underscoring their digital authenticity and singularity. This not only redefines the concept of originality in art but also opens up exciting new avenues for artists to monetize their creativity in the digital realm. Thus, the melding of generative AI with the burgeoning technologies of NFTs, blockchain, and smart contracts is forging a vibrant new frontier in the digital art landscape.
One example comes from Art Blocks, an Ethereum-based platform where collectors can invest in unique, generative art NFTs. The platform has already facilitated over $1 billion in primary and secondary sales.
Transforming the Traditional Art Gallery
We already have metaverse galleries — virtual exhibitions where artists can showcase their work to a global audience without the limitations of physical space. Metaverse galleries can take many forms, from VR environments to simple 2D websites.
Metaverse galleries can offer immersive and interactive experiences for visitors. Viewers can explore the virtual gallery space, interact with the artwork, and even attend events and openings. This makes the experience of visiting a metaverse gallery more engaging and memorable than simply viewing artwork online.
Some NFT marketplaces (like SuperRare) are also opening physical galleries where people can look at digital art in frames on the wall. These types of physical NFT exhibitions are still experimental, but they illustrate how the metaverse can intersect with real-world experiences.
As metaverse technology continues to evolve, we will likely see more sophisticated and innovative metaverse galleries emerging, offering new and exciting possibilities for artists and art lovers alike.
Sotheby’s Enters the World of NFT Auctions
Sotheby's, one of the world's leading auction houses, has been at the forefront of the NFT market. The organization has already hosted several high-profile NFT auctions. These auctions feature curated collections of NFTs from prominent artists, musicians, and other cultural figures. Sotheby's has partnered with various NFT marketplaces and platforms, such as Nifty Gateway and OpenSea, to host these auctions.
The NFTs offered in these auctions can include digital art, music, collectibles, and other forms of digital media. The auction process typically involves a pre-sale exhibition, where potential buyers can view and inspect the NFTs, followed by a bidding period, in which buyers can place bids on the NFTs they are interested in purchasing. The auction culminates with the sale of the NFTs to the highest bidder.
Sotheby's involvement in the NFT market has been seen as a significant milestone in the mainstream adoption of NFTs. The fact that one of the world's most prestigious auction houses is now offering NFTs for sale is a testament to the growing legitimacy and value of this new form of digital asset.

Artificial intelligence is already changing the workplace in ways we never could've imagined.Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT, its conversational AI chatbot, in November, many have used it to lose weight, plan vacations, and even land dates.Now, some companies are embracing AI — though not without precaution — as business leaders begin to wake up to the technology's impressive capabilities. In a 2023 IBM study surveying 3000 executives on generative AI, 75% of respondents said it would give their businesses a competitive edge and 43% are using AI to make strategic business decisions. But not all workers are ready to use AI. In the IBM study, 57% of the executives said they had reservations about data security, while 48% said they were also concerned about bias.

Nevertheless, workers and companies are starting to deploy AI for business purposes in myriad ways. Here are 10 ways AI is changing the workforce:1. Workers are using ChatGPT to help do their jobs Workers across industries — from education to law — are using AI technology such as ChatGPT to automate their workflows to save time and boost productivity. Nick Patrick, the owner of the music-production company Primal Sounds Productions, told Insider he used ChatGPT to fine-tune legal contracts for clients. Shannon Ahern, a high-school math and science teacher, said she used the AI chatbot to generate quiz questions and lesson plans.Others have used the chatbot to write listings for luxury real estate, assist in recruiting efforts, draft social-media posts, and develop code.

In fact, many workers are even secretly using AI to help do their jobs.At the beginning of the year, Fishbowl, a workplace-discussion app, surveyed more than 11,700 workers, including those from companies such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Twitter, to gauge whether they used AI at work. Out of the 43% of respondents who said they used AI to accomplish their work tasks, 68% of them said they hadn't told their bosses they were using them.2. Companies are looking for ChatGPT expertise in their workers Companies across various industries — including healthcare, education, and insurance — are looking to hire workers with experience using AI.As of June, more than a dozen of companies were hiring workers on sites such as Indeed and LinkedIn with ChatGPT expertise listed in their job postings, paying as much as $800,000 a year for the skill. Executives at these companies told Insider that job candidates with knowledge of AI might be more productive, creative, and open to change than those without AI expertise.

The move to hire AI-savvy workers seems to be gaining traction. In a recent survey from the job site Resume Builder of business leaders who were hiring, 91% of respondents said they wanted to bring on workers who knew how to use OpenAI's chatbot to save time and enhance productivity.3. Employers are encouraging workers to learn how to use AI Executives are asking their workers to integrate AI into their workflows. That way, companies can save time and money on their business processes.

Akash Nigam, the CEO and founder of Genies, an avatar-tools company, previously told Insider he purchased ChatGPT Plus accounts for all of his 120 employees and encouraged them to make learning the AI chatbot a priority so they could ""effectively accelerate"" their departments.""You really got to find time to, like, learn this skill,"" Nigam previously told Insider. 4. Job applicants are using AI to write their résumés and improve their applications AI can help you land your next gig by improving your job application.To test his company's recruiting efforts, Neil Taylor, the founder of Schwa, a communications consultancy, said that he secretly submitted a job application written by ChatGPT to recruiters at his firm and later learned that ChatGPT was one of the few applicants chosen for an interview.

""It was more competent than a lot of the bad people who apply to us,"" Taylor told Sky News.Insider's Beatrice Nolan conducted a similar experiment, in which she asked ChatGPT to write cover letters for real jobs and sent the letters to hiring managers for them to review. The managers told Nolan they would've offered her an interview even though they said the letters lacked personality.AI enthusiasts have also expressed on social media how impressed they are with ChatGPT's ability to write cover letters, resurfacing a long-held debate on whether cover letters should be removed from the job-application process. 5. AI is being used to make hiring decisions AI-assisted hiring is nothing new.

For years, companies have used AI tools to screen résumés and cover letters, interview job candidates, and even analyze the speech and facial expressions of applicants to get a read on their personalities — processes that experts say might not be fair when making hiring decisions. But some human-resources professionals say that generative-AI tools have helped them do their jobs better. Jasmine Cheng, a recruiter who left Amazon to start her own recruiting firm called Topknack, said she used ChatGPT to do things such as finding job candidates and creating interview questions, which she said saved her at least 10 hours a week. ""With those hours back, I can reach more candidates, network, and even conduct more business development to get more clients, which leads to making more money,"" Cheng previously told Insider.6. Companies are using AI to write their performance reviews Managers may find writing performance reviews for their employees a tough task. But what if AI could do it for you?

Companies behind HR-management software are starting to integrate AI features that can help managers write performance reviews that are fair, accurate, and personalized for their direct reports. For instance, Textio, an HR-management tool with an AI-assistant feature for performance reviews, is used by companies such as Hulu, Spotify, T-Mobile, and McDonald's, WorkLife reported.

AI-generated performance reviews are nothing new. In 2018, the cloud giant Oracle launched Digital Assistant, an AI chatbot that HR professionals can use to complete employee evaluations.AI expertise may also be taken into consideration during a performance review. Nigam, the CEO of the avatar-tools company, expects to make decisions on who gets promoted based on how well they know ChatGPT, he told Insider.

7. Experts say AI could help make the 4-day workweek possibleA four-day workweek may be on the horizon thanks to ChatGPT.AI tools can help workers be more productive, which, in turn, cuts down the time it takes to accomplish any given task — a ""necessary condition for us to work less,"" Oded Netzer, a professor at Columbia Business School, previously told Insider.Carl Benedikt Frey, an Oxford economist, echoed the sentiment. He told Insider: ""Any technology that increases productivity, ChatGPT included, makes a shorter workweek more feasible."" But some experts say that AI's prospective productivity gains may not shorten the workweek. Michael Chu, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, previously told Insider that employers might expect employees to work even harder to maximize their output because of AI.

8. Companies are restricting their employees from using AI at workSome companies have set rules around how their employees can use AI in the workplace, in part, to protect their confidential data from being leaked. While firms such as Apple and Spotify have been said to restrict their workers from using AI, other companies, such as JPMorgan and Northrop Grumman, appear to have outright barred their employees from using the tech. ""Although AI, including ChatGPT and other 'conversational' AIs, can be enormously helpful and truly transformative, we want to be smart about how we implement these tools to protect ourselves, our partners, our company's information and our user data,"" executives at iHeartMedia wrote in a June memo explaining why it's restricting its workers from using AI. 9. Many are questioning whether AI will replace their jobs As AI becomes more advanced, many workers may be wondering whether the tech will replace their jobs down the line.

A recent Goldman Sachs report on the state of AI found that generative-AI tools could lead to a ""significant disruption"" in the labor market and affect 300 million full-time jobs worldwide. White-collar workers — particularly people in law and those part of an administrative staff — are most likely to be affected by new AI tools, Goldman found. Other labor experts told Insider that workers in media, marketing, and finance — jobs that require writing and number crunching — were at risk of replacement by AI. AI job replacement may already be occurring. Suumit Shah, the CEO of the e-commerce platform Dukaan, tweeted earlier this month that ""we had to layoff 90% of our support team"" because an AI chatbot was able to do its work faster. But not all experts believe AI will wipe out jobs.

Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, told Insider that AI should be viewed as an imperfect productivity-enhancing tool that could produce bias and error. Richard Baldwin, an economist, said at the 2023 World Economic Forum's Growth Summit that while AI might not replace your job, workers who know how to use AI may replace those who don't.  10. Workers are striking against the use of AI While some workers seek to embrace AI in their roles, others are speaking out against the ways the technology can harm workers. For the past three months, thousands of Hollywood writers in the Writers Guild of America have been on strike, in part, to express their concerns over the potential for AI to replace their jobs. Now actors from the SAG-AFTRA guild have joined the strike, urging studios to be extra careful with how they use AI. ""Artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions, and all actors and performers deserve contract language that protects them from having their identity and talent exploited without consent and pay,"" Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA, said during a press conference this month.

Journalists are also pushing back against the use of AI in newsrooms. In late June, the GMG Union of G/O Media — the company behind sites such as Gizmodo and Jezebel — released a statement pleading with the parent company to put the brakes on experimenting with AI-generated content. ""We urge G/O Media to cease its plans to litter our sites with AI-generated content and invest in real journalism done by real journalists,"" the letter said.

",,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-transforming-the-workplace-examples-2023-7'}","Artificial intelligence is already changing the workplace in ways we never could've imagined.Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT, its conversational AI chatbot, in November, many have used it to lose weight, plan vacations, and even land dates.Now, some companies are embracing AI — though not without precaution — as business leaders begin to wake up to the technology's impressive capabilities. In a 2023 IBM study surveying 3000 executives on generative AI, 75% of respondents said it would give their businesses a competitive edge and 43% are using AI to make strategic business decisions. But not all workers are ready to use AI. In the IBM study, 57% of the executives said they had reservations about data security, while 48% said they were also concerned about bias. Nevertheless, workers and companies are starting to deploy AI for business purposes in myriad ways. Workers across industries — from education to law — are using AI technology such as ChatGPT to automate their workflows to save time and boost productivity. Nick Patrick, the owner of the music-production company Primal Sounds Productions, told Insider he used ChatGPT to fine-tune legal contracts for clients. Shannon Ahern, a high-school math and science teacher, said she used the AI chatbot to generate quiz questions and lesson plans.Others have used the chatbot to write listings for luxury real estate, assist in recruiting efforts, draft social-media posts, and develop code.In fact, many workers are even secretly using AI to help do their jobs.At the beginning of the year, Fishbowl, a workplace-discussion app, surveyed more than 11,700 workers, including those from companies such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Twitter, to gauge whether they used AI at work. Out of the 43% of respondents who said they used AI to accomplish their work tasks, 68% of them said they hadn't told their bosses they were using them.Companies across various industries — including healthcare, education, and insurance — are looking to hire workers with experience using AI.As of June, more than a dozen of companies were hiring workers on sites such as Indeed and LinkedIn with ChatGPT expertise listed in their job postings, paying as much as $800,000 a year for the skill. Executives at these companies told Insider that job candidates with knowledge of AI might be more productive, creative, and open to change than those without AI expertise. The move to hire AI-savvy workers seems to be gaining traction. In a recent survey from the job site Resume Builder of business leaders who were hiring, 91% of respondents said they wanted to bring on workers who knew how to use OpenAI's chatbot to save time and enhance productivity.Executives are asking their workers to integrate AI into their workflows. That way, companies can save time and money on their business processes.Jensen Huang, the CEO of the chip giant Nvidia, said workers should learn how to use AI to improve their performance.""Everyone is a programmer now,"" Huang said during this year's Computex conference in Taipei, Taiwan. ""You just have to say something to the computer."" Akash Nigam, the CEO and founder of Genies, an avatar-tools company, previously told Insider he purchased ChatGPT Plus accounts for all of his 120 employees and encouraged them to make learning the AI chatbot a priority so they could ""effectively accelerate"" their departments.""You really got to find time to, like, learn this skill,"" Nigam previously told Insider. AI can help you land your next gig by improving your job application.To test his company's recruiting efforts, Neil Taylor, the founder of Schwa, a communications consultancy, said that he secretly submitted a job application written by ChatGPT to recruiters at his firm and later learned that ChatGPT was one of the few applicants chosen for an interview. ""It was more competent than a lot of the bad people who apply to us,"" Taylor told Sky News.Insider's Beatrice Nolan conducted a similar experiment, in which she asked ChatGPT to write cover letters for real jobs and sent the letters to hiring managers for them to review.

There is a lot of speculation regarding the future of teaching and learning in compulsory education, especially with recent developments in technology. The world-wide release of ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence platforms have created a plethora of new, even more difficult, questions. What role will these AI systems play in classrooms? What do students need to learn to succeed in an AI saturated world? How will teaching change? How do you strike a balance between teachers and machines? And obviously, will AI replace teachers or other education workers?Although teacher unions may not have the answers, they cannot stand by and let others determine the answers. The world’s education unions must come together and proactively shape the way emerging technologies are used in our schools and classrooms. If we snooze, we lose.Before we dig a little deeper, I will start where every school system must start—personal safety, online security, and ensuring equity. Although some countries and jurisdictions have strong policies to protect privacy and data, they are the exception and not the rule. Moreover, the rate at which new technologies are being developed, previous regulations and even some current proposed regulations will likely fall short. The rabbit-like way new technology comes online will always outpace the tortoise we call governmental action.“Just like we see with corporate driven privatization, schools in systems that are not run democratically and lack resources will be seen as frontiers of profit for big tech. The power of multinational corporations will overwhelm the rights of students and citizens alike.” This is where unions must step in. Yes, we must continually push for even stronger regulations, but waiting for others to defend and protect our professions is a losing strategy. And our profession cannot afford to lose.Leading AI-induced changes in the teaching and learning processUndoubtedly, the role of teachers will change in the future. Most agree teachers will not be replaced by AI, but the power of generative AI will require teachers to become less the “deliverers of content” and more coaches of learning—deeper learning. This new role is not necessarily a bad one, but that all depends on us. Even more than what is happening today, it will require teachers to develop increased higher-order thinking skills in their students. Skills such as collaborative learning, critical thinking, problem solving, multi-disciplinary approaches, and real-world application. For sure, all of these are part classroom lessons today but, using a common American saying, this part of teaching and learning needs to “go on steroids.” Whatever teachers were doing in the past needs to expand and be greatly enhanced. That is the reality of preparing students for an AI world.“AI-led instruction may allow students to learn at their own pace using adaptive algorithms that continuously adjust the content and difficulty based on student interaction. However, AI cannot teach the thinking skills that will become an integral part of future success. That is the role teachers must play.” This focus on deeper learning and advanced thinking will become part of every curriculum. Classes that emphasize understanding, motivation, and problem solving will become an essential part of educating for the future. AI-led instruction may allow students to learn at their own pace using adaptive algorithms that continuously adjust the content and difficulty based on student interaction. However, AI cannot teach the thinking skills that will become an integral part of future success. That is the role teachers must play.Teachers like to say that they don’t teach kids what to think, they teach them how to think. With the infusion of AI in every part of society, this belief system will be put to the test. The future needs strong independent thinkers who can determine good information from bad and apply that knowledge in a comprehensive way, not to solve a problem or two on a standardized test, but to solve today’s complex real-world problems, and whatever the world throws at them in the future.The implications of AI on teaching and learning starts with ensuring current teachers have the support and learning opportunities that, frankly, do not exist today—at least not at scale. Teacher preparation programs will also need to profoundly change. The interaction between administration, schools, and teachers will need to be reimagined. And importantly, the way learning will be assessed will fundamentally change. The obsession with standardized tests and other large-scale assessments will slowly come to an end. With AI in the classroom assessment will be built-in, and a fundamental part of the personalized learning process. Success will be measured in terms of individual students and not across the board averages.The days of the one teacher, one classroom model is slowly also coming to an end. There will be a mix of traditional face-to-face instruction, team teaching online learning, project-based lessons, and an emphasis on collaboration and student team-based learning. This will require not only a change in teaching, but a major rethinking of schools’ physical space. This new model will require school buildings to be reconfigured away from a hallway of single purpose classrooms we see today to a more interactive environment that allows both small and large group work. These new schools will allow teams of teachers to leverage the strengths of each in a learning format that will maximize instruction.Protecting the most vulnerable systemsThis does not mean that all countries will see schools change in the same way. Schools in democratic countries will be able to leverage the power of regulation and political expediency to help ensure AI-based changes to schools protect—to the extent possible—the privacy and security of students and adults. But that will not be the case in other parts of the world.Just like we see with corporate driven privatization, schools in systems that are not run democratically and lack resources will be seen as frontiers of profit for big tech. The power of multinational corporations will overwhelm the rights of students and citizens alike. Governments will be forced to accept corporate mandates or risk being left behind. And even worse, international monetary funds may play a significant role in this process. We have seen this type of educational blackmail before, and with the AI revolution in education, we are likely to see it again.What does all this mean? It means a lot of things are going to change in and around schools. Artificial intelligence has created both challenges and opportunities that will require lots of decisions about the future of the teaching profession in the next few years. Teacher unions must lead addressing the challenges and leveraging the opportunities. Just as the pandemic was a once-in-a-lifetime event, the AI revolution in education is a unique point in time—the outcome will influence education for decades.The artificial intelligence revolution is at the schoolhouse doorstep. As teacher unions, we must be proactive and respond. If not, we will see even more de-professionalization and commercialization of our work. All of us see a brighter future where AI can aid our educators, but we must prevent it from devaluing the educational experience, and those who work and learn in schools. Teacher unions must be at the forefront of this revolution. If not, others will determine the nature of schools, the teaching profession, and the future of education for us. In a real sense, if we snooze, we lose.

And according to a new report, it’s not coming for everyone’s jobs equally: Projections suggest women are more likely to lose their jobs to AI than men.

The report, released this week by the McKinsey Global Institute, suggests that nearly a third of hours worked in the US could be automated by the end of the decade. Thanks to automation and AI, 12 million people will need to change jobs—and women will be 1.5 times more likely to have to find new roles.

That’s because women make up more of the workforce in lower-paying industries, like office work and customer service, which the report projects will shrink more significantly thanks to automation and AI. People in lower-wage jobs, it adds, could be up to 14 times more likely to need to shift occupations than those that pay the highest. 

Among those also at risk of having to find new jobs: Black and Hispanic workers, who are “highly concentrated” in some of those shrinking jobs, along with workers without college degrees. And most importantly, those workers will probably need to pick up new skills or training before they can shift into new industries.

People are switching jobs at surging rates

From 2019-2022, the US labor market saw tremendous spikes in job shifts (or when a person moves from one occupation to another). The report counts some 8.6 million career changes among people—a 50% increase from the last three-year period, according to McKinsey. Half of those 8.6 million job changes, it adds, were in lower-wage industries, including food services, customer service, office support, and production.

“Demand for lower-wage service work remains, but fewer workers are accepting these roles,” the report writes. More high-wage jobs were added—about 3.5 million jobs that pay $57,000 or more annually—but it’s not clear if lower-paid employees were able to move up into high-paying roles, or if these jobs were filled by workers new to the market.

Who reaps the gains of AI? White-collar workers, of course

Meanwhile, while the projections see AI and automation shrinking some industries, McKinsey also suggests it could speed up the growth of others—especially for knowledge workers. “We see generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright,” it writes. 

Compare that to another report issued this week, this time by the Pew Research Center, which finds that white-collar workers are optimistic about how AI will help them. About a fifth of all US workers have a high exposure—or, in other terms, have work that can be performed by technology—to artificial intelligence. Those in jobs most exposed to AI, usually high-paying ones, are likely to say the technology will help more than hurt them.

AI can augment work, adopters argue, rather than replace it, so teams might spend more time on creative, strategic, or collaborative thinking. We’ve also seen the blunders of AI when it’s used in place of people, from lawyers submitting made-up cases to media outlets publishing error-riddled articles. Artificial intelligence isn’t equipped to be your lawyer, doctor, or architect—at least for now.

So how can we make sure lower-paid workers aren’t left behind?

A pressing question, then, is how we might extend some of those benefits to the people whose jobs are projected to go the way of automation. McKinsey sees some optimism—and urgency. “Spiking demand and labor scarcity forced many employers to consider nontraditional candidates with potential and train them if they lacked direct experience,” the report says.

But ultimately, employers and the country at large will need to lean into that equitable outlook—and offer more training, more development, and more pathways for employees to land high-earning positions. Only with that will we find our way to a future where all workers can enjoy the advantages of AI—not be eliminated by it.

Actor Sean Gunn speaks out against Netflix 











Actor Sean Gunn says Netflix ""trying to screw people over,"" as SAG-AFTRA strike continues
07:13

While creative talent is sweating it out on picket lines, Netflix is hard at work developing its machine learning infrastructure.Streaming video giant Netflix is looking to hire artificial intelligence specialists, dangling one salary that pays as much as $900,000, even as Hollywood actors and writers are in the midst of a historic strike that aims to curtail the industry's use of A.I.One job posting, for a product manager of Netflix's machine learning platform, lists a total compensation range of $300,000-$900,000. ""You will be creating product experiences that have never been done before,"" the listing boasts.  






Netflix is also on the hunt for a senior software engineer to ""[develop] a product that makes it easy to build, manage and scale real life [machine learning] applications,"" for an annual income between $100,000 and $700,000, as well as a machine-learning scientist to ""develop algorithms that power high quality localization,"" with a total pay between $150,000 and $750,000. Hollywood strikes having ripple effect on British entertainmentGeorgia movie industry hit amid ongoing Hollywood strikeHollywood strikes could fuel rise of influencer contentA spokesperson for Netflix declined to comment on the job postings and referred CBS MoneyWatch to a statement from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which is representing studios (including Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News) in negotiations with writers and actors. 


Netflix relies heavily on machine learning for its success, according to the company's website.""We invest heavily in machine learning to continually improve our member experience and optimize the Netflix service end-to-end,"" the company says. While the technology has historically been used for Netflix's recommendation algorithm, the company is also using it ""to help shape our catalog"" and ""to optimize the production of original movies and TV shows in Netflix's rapidly growing studio,"" according to the site.

The company is also seeking a technical director of AI/machine learning for its gaming studio, where Netflix is building a team to eventually ""[build] new kinds of games not previously possible without ongoing advances AI/ML technologies."" That position pays $450,000 to $650,000 annually.Generative A.I. and the strikeThe use of so-called generative A.I., the technology underpinning popular apps like ChatGPT and MidJourney, has been at the heart of the negotiations between movie studios on one side and creators and performers on the other. 


Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors, has called the technology ""an existential threat"" to the profession. According to the union, studios have ""proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get paid for one day's pay, and the company should be able to own that scan, that likeness, for the rest of eternity, without consideration,"" Crabtree-Ireland said. The AMPTP, the trade group representing the studios, disputed this characterization, telling CBS MoneyWatch that the studios' proposal only permitted a company to use a background actor's replica ""in the motion picture for which the background actor is employed,"" with other uses subject to negotiation.Writers fear that A.I. will be used to reduce their pay and eliminate ownership of their work. ""The immediate fear of A.I. isn't that us writers will have our work replaced by artificially generated content. It's that we will be underpaid to rewrite that trash into something we could have done better from the start,"" screenwriter C. Robert Cargill said on Twitter.  ""This is what the WGA is opposing and the studios want.""Already, many media outlets have adopted the use of A.I. to write articles, often with error-ridden results. Disney is also advertising for generative A.I. jobs, according to The Intercept, which first reported on the job listings. And some video game studios are using A.I. to write characters for games.

McKinsey and Company is no stranger to generative artificial intelligence (gen AI): around half of the global consulting giant’s employees were said to be using the technology as of earlier this summer. 
But it’s not the only org to see a rapid uptake of gen AI. Indeed, a new annual report by McKinsey’s AI arm QuantumBlack finds that “use of gen AI is already widespread.”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



McKinsey reached this conclusion by conducting an online survey of 1,684 participants across various regions, industries and company sizes between April 11 and 21, 2023. The majority (79%) of respondents reported “at least some exposure to gen AI, either for work or outside of work,” while 22% said they were using it regularly for their work. 
Those findings echo VentureBeat’s own informal survey conducted ahead of our VB Transform conference in San Francisco last month, which found that more than 70% of companies are already experimenting with gen AI. 
Who is using gen AI and where?
Ok, so we know companies and individuals are getting their hands on gen AI, but who is using it the most, and for what? McKinsey’s new report provides some insights worth calling out. 
So far, North America-based respondents lead the globe in terms of gen AI adoption for work, with 28% of them using the tech in their jobs and outside of work, compared to 24% of European respondents and 22% of Asia-Pacific respondents (Greater China was just 19%).

This is perhaps expected, given the gen AI craze kicked off in the U.S. in November 2022 with OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT. 
Similarly, the industries that have most rapidly embraced the technology for work and/or outside of work so far are “technology, media and telecom,” at 33%, followed by “financial services” and “business, legal and professional services,” at 24% and 23%, respectively.

Again, this is not too surprising: The tech industry, which originated gen AI products, has been leading the adoption curve.
Interestingly, though, when it comes to which job titles use gen AI the most for work and/or outside of it, both C-suite and senior managers clocked in at 24% regular usage for work and outside of work, combined. Midlevel managers were close behind at 23%, although they were more likely to have had no exposure, as well (19%).

What gen AI is being used foradvertisement
The business functions most commonly harnessing these newer tools mirror those where AI use is most prevalent overall. 
These include marketing and sales, product and service development and service operations such as customer care and back-office support.
In fact, the single largest category of functions where gen AI was being used as of April 2023 was marketing and sales, at 14%, followed by product/service development at 13%.

Very low on the list were supply chain management at 3% and manufacturing at just 2%. advertisement
While these areas may prove more challenging and time-consuming for AI adoption and have some physical constraints that make them more resistant to it, supply chain management in particular would seem to be a ripe area for new gen AI products and services to take hold — as a lot of it does involve planning, analyzing market conditions and providing insights based on vast volumes of data, all of which gen AI excels at. 
In terms of what people are using gen AI to do, specifically, almost all of the capabilities so far revolve around creating, summarizing and analyzing documents. However, trend forecasting is a close second.

More than a fleeting trend
The report also revealed that gen AI is not just a fleeting trend but a strategic focus for many organizations. Nearly half (40%) of those reporting AI adoption indicated that their companies plan to ramp up their overall AI investments, thanks to gen AI. Furthermore, the technology has already made its way onto the board’s agenda for 28% of these organizations.

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). These sophisticated models are used widely in AI solutions, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, and have been designed to understand and generate human-like text, enabling them to perform various language-based tasks. People are incredibly excited by the potential of this technology which is poised to revolutionize how we live and work. However, to understand the true potential of LLMs, it is crucial that people know how they function.
LLMs, at their core, are neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data. They learn to predict the next word in a sentence by analyzing patterns and relationships within the training data. Through this process, they develop an understanding of grammar, syntax, and even semantic nuances. By leveraging this knowledge, these models can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses when given a prompt or query.




The training process involves exposing the model to a large quantity of data, such as books, articles, and websites. The model learns to identify patterns, extract meaning, and generate text based on the input it receives. As a result, LLMs acquire a remarkable ability to mimic human language, offering the potential to enhance various applications and services.
How to successfully implement Large Language Models
While large language models hold immense promise, implementing them successfully requires careful consideration. Here are some key factors to ensure their effective utilization: 
1.   Data Quality and Bias Mitigation: High-quality training data is vital for training LLMs. Curating diverse and representative datasets is essential to mitigate biases and prejudices in the source data. Additionally, continuous monitoring and evaluation are necessary to identify and rectify potential biases during model deployment.
2.   Fine-Tuning for Specific Tasks: LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific applications to enhance performance. Fine-tuning involves training the model on task-specific data to adapt to a particular domain or problem. This process can help optimise the model's output for specific use cases, such as customer support or content generation.
3.   User Feedback and Iterative Improvement: Implementing LLMs successfully requires a feedback loop from users. Collecting feedback, monitoring user interactions, and iteratively improving the model based on this feedback are critical steps to refine its performance over time.
Leveraging Large Language Models to build better virtual agents
One area where LLMs have demonstrated significant potential is in combination with conversational AI. We can achieve even greater interactive and human-like conversational experiences by integrating LLMs into already powerful virtual agents. Here's how LLMs can contribute to building better virtual agents:

Enhanced Accuracy and Creativity: By integrating LLMs with Natural Language Understanding (NLU), a hybrid system can be created that combines the strengths of both technologies. The NLU provides accurate and reliable responses within a specific business context, while the LLM optimises content generation with its vast general knowledge. 
Empowering Customer Service Agents: Customer service agents can leverage LLMs to enhance their capabilities. For instance, LLMs can scan and condense conversations between customers and virtual agents, providing human agents with a clear and concise summary. They can also help fine-tune the length and tone of responses to match the conversation and generate pre-written messages that include key information from the conversation history.
Efficient AI Training Process: The text generation capabilities of LLMs can be harnessed to streamline the AI training process. They can generate on-brand virtual agent responses, provide multiple alternatives to a single sentence for use as training data, and rewrite answers to match length and tone. This can save several days of manual work.
Facilitating Language Expansion: When expanding the virtual agent solution into new markets or languages, LLMs can provide valuable assistance. They can offer translations and provide synonym suggestions when building out a dictionary for language understanding, saving valuable time and enhancing the quality of the virtual agent.

Why a hybrid approach is the way to go
With such a varied list of benefits and abilities, it can be tempting for a business to consider going “all in” on LLMs, but as stressed earlier, responsible and considered adoption is key. The raw processing power of a large language model is exceptional, but it can also be prone to hallucinations and inaccuracies. Adopting a hybrid approach is the way to go if you want to deliver the best experience with customer-facing virtual agents. Connecting LLMs to conversational AI that is pre-trained on company-specific data, with the right guardrails in place, allows for virtual agent scalability and creativity without sacrificing accuracy and data quality.
LLMs have emerged as powerful tools with the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human-computer interaction. By understanding their functioning, implementing them thoughtfully, and leveraging them the right way, we can unlock LLMs to enhance user experiences and create more intelligent and engaging conversational systems. However, it is essential to address biases and connect these models to reliable source data to ensure the information they provide is accurate so that their potential in an enterprise setting doesn’t go unrealized.

	While the writer and actor strikes are driven by multiple concerns (questions about compensation being a big one), there’s no question that the role of artificial intelligence in entertainment has emerged as a hot-button issue.

	In a fiery speech in Times Square on July 25, actor Bryan Cranston epitomized the concerns of actors, telling the crowd of hundreds: “We’ve got a message for Mr. Iger [Disney CEO Bob Iger]: I know, sir, that you look at things through a different lens. We don’t expect you to understand who we are. But we ask you to hear us, and beyond that to listen to us when we tell you we will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots.”

	The actors fear that studios will take their likenesses or voices, and reuse them over and over for little or no pay, and with little in the way of notice. The writers fear that studios will use large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to write or rewrite scripts, harming their livelihoods. The producers, aka the AMPTP, argue that AI use should be “a balanced approach based on careful use, not prohibition.”



	While the future of AI in Hollywood is unclear, there is no question that the major studios and streaming services are intrigued by the technology. Job listings at almost every major entertainment company show that there is a veritable AI hiring spree going on as companies seek to understand how the technology can change their businesses.

	And, fittingly given Cranston’s speech, Disney seems particularly intrigued by the tech. The company has a number of open positions focused on AI and machine learning across the country, per a review of open positions by The Hollywood Reporter.

	Some are part of Disney’s “Imagineering” team, the group responsible for turning Disneyland and Walt Disney World into world-renowned attractions.

	One job, for an R&D Imagineer focused on generative AI, is looking for someone who has the “ambition to push the limits of what AI tools can create and understand the difference between the voice of data and the voice of a designer, writer or artist.” The role will “collaborate with third party studios, universities, organizations, and developers to evaluate, adopt, and integrate the latest generative AI.” The job promises a base salary of up to $180,000 per year, with the possibility of bonuses or other compensation as well.

	









	Another role, for a machine learning engineer in the Disney Streaming Advanced Research division (it’s “responsible for creating AI-enabled solutions for Disney+, Star+, and ESPN+,” per the listing) will use AI to “work on advanced personalization efforts involving digital avatars.”

	In total, THR spotted some half-dozen AI-focused jobs at Disney. But the company is far from alone in exploring the space.

	Netflix made some headlines after The Intercept noticed an AI Product Manager job that promises compensation of up to $900,000.

	“Our business is driven by Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence, which fuels innovation in content creation and acquisition, personalization, payment processing, and other revenue-centric initiatives,” the company writes in the listing.

	But Netflix has a number of job openings focused on AI and machine learning, dealing with video games, research, R&D, customer experiences and other areas.

	In fact, nearly every studio owner seems to be thinking about AI, whether it’s for content, customer service, data analysis or other uses.

	Amazon and Apple, of course, have dozens and dozens of AI and ML jobs open. But some of those jobs appear specifically geared to their media businesses, like an Amazon job for a senior project manager for Prime Video.

	“Want to define the next big thing in localizing content, enhancing content, or making it accessible using state-of-the-art Generative AI and Computer Vision tech? This is for you!” the listing blares, promising a base salary of up to $300,000.

	










	And at Sony, which owns Sony Pictures Entertainment, its “Sony AI America” division is looking for an AI “Ethics” engineer.

	“We believe in researching and developing AI techniques that empower the imagination and creativity of artists, makers and creators around the world,” the listing writes. “Our aim is to advance AI so that it augments — and works in harmony with — humans to benefit society.”

	Sony AI, the company notes, “works closely with Sony’s other business units, including Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC., Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., and Sony Music Entertainment.” The job pays a base salary of up to $160,000 (ethics, it seems, isn’t as lucrative as some other areas).

	And the list goes on. Warner Bros. Discovery has a few AI and ML jobs open, in its video game division and in corporate; Paramount has an opening for a machine learning engineer in its CBS division; and NBCUniversal owner Comcast has a number of AI and ML jobs, focused on research, customer service and other areas.

	And the hiring comes amid a larger job pullback at many of these companies. Disney just finished laying off some 7,000 employees, and Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, Amazon and others have had painful cuts in recent months. But jobs focused on AI appear to be an exception.

	Of course, the investment in AI should come as no surprise. The technology has taken all of corporate America by storm, and media companies are no exception when it comes to trend-hunting. But the role AI can play in the future of entertainment has caused much anxiety among the workers responsible for that content.

	










	“It’s like, you’ve got a house and you need to redo the kitchen, you really need to redo the bathroom, the master bedroom hasn’t been redone for 40 years, you want to do all these things,” writer, director and former actress Justine Bateman told THR’s TV Top 5 podcast earlier this month. “But AI is the front door. And you can get all of these things from the AMPTP, but if you don’t get those strong restrictions on AI, you’ve just given them the key to the front door, and none of those other gains will matter.”

	It’s also an area Iger, the strike’s villain of the moment, is well aware of. In his first town hall after returning as Disney CEO last November, an employee asked Iger about how the company plans to adapt to fast-moving technologies, referencing generative AI tech that was just becoming mainstream.

	“Nothing is going to stop technological advancement,” he replied, adding that Disney has typically embraced new technology to tell better stories. Generative AI tech, Iger added, is “something that at some point in the future the company will embrace.”

	The AI arms race may be in the early stages, but the entertainment giants are all in the mix. And regardless of the deal they cut with the unions, AI appears poised to become a part of that future.

Something similar can happen with artificial intelligence.Photo-illustration: WIRED Staff; Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveIn Isaac Asimov’s classic science fiction story “Robbie,” the Weston family owns a robot who serves as a nursemaid and companion for their precocious preteen daughter, Gloria. Gloria and the robot Robbie are friends; their relationship is affectionate and mutually caring. Gloria regards Robbie as her loyal and dutiful caretaker. However, Mrs. Weston becomes concerned about this “unnatural” relationship between the robot and her child and worries about the possibility of Robbie causing harm to Gloria (despite it's being explicitly programmed to not do so); it is clear she is jealous. After several failed attempts to wean Gloria off Robbie, her father, exasperated and worn down by the mother’s protestations, suggests a tour of a robot factory—there, Gloria will be able to see that Robbie is “just” a manufactured robot, not a person, and fall out of love with it. Gloria must come to learn how Robbie works, how he was made; then she will understand that Robbie is not who she thinks he is. This plan does not work. Gloria does not learn how Robbie “really works,” and in a plot twist, Gloria and Robbie become even better friends. Mrs. Weston, the spoilsport, is foiled yet again. Gloria remains “deluded” about who Robbie “really is.”What is the moral of this tale? Most importantly, that those who interact and socialize with artificial agents, without knowing (or caring) how they “really work” internally, will develop distinctive relationships with them and ascribe to them those mental qualities appropriate for their relationships. Gloria plays with Robbie and loves him as a companion; he cares for her in return. There is an interpretive dance that Gloria engages in with Robbie, and Robbie’s internal operations and constitution are of no relevance to it. When the opportunity to learn such details arises, further evidence of Robbie’s functionality (after it saves Gloria from an accident) distracts and prevents Gloria from learning anymore.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTPhilosophically speaking, “Robbie” teaches us that in ascribing a mind to another being, we are not making a statement about the kind of thing it is, but rather, revealing how deeply we understand how it works. For instance, Gloria thinks Robbie is intelligent, but her parents think they can reduce its seemingly intelligent behavior to lower-level machine operations. To see this more broadly, note the converse case where we ascribe mental qualities to ourselves that we are unwilling to ascribe to programs or robots. These qualities, like intelligence, intuition, insight, creativity, and understanding, have this in common: We do not know what they are. Despite the extravagant claims often bandied about by practitioners of neuroscience and empirical psychology, and by sundry cognitive scientists, these self-directed compliments remain undefinable. Any attempt to characterize one employs the other (“true intelligence requires insight and creativity” or “true understanding requires insight and intuition”) and engages in, nay requires, extensive hand waving.Featured VideoThe Future of Beauty Tech | WIRED Brand LabBut even if we are not quite sure what these qualities are or what they bottom out in, whatever the mental quality, the proverbial “educated layman” is sure that humans have it and machines like robots do not—even if machines act like we do, producing those same products that humans do, and occasionally replicating human feats that are said to require intelligence, ingenuity, or whatever else. Why? Because, like Gloria’s parents, we know (thanks to being informed by the system’s creators in popular media) that “all they are doing is [table lookup / prompt completion / exhaustive search of solution spaces].” Meanwhile, the mental attributes we apply to ourselves are so vaguely defined, and our ignorance of our mental operations so profound (currently), that we cannot say “human intuition (insight or creativity) is just [fill in the blanks with banal physical activity].”SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.Current debates about artificial intelligence, then, proceed the way they do because whenever we are confronted with an “artificial intelligence,” one whose operations we (think we) understand, it is easy to quickly respond: “All this artificial agent does is X.” This reductive description demystifies its operations, and we are therefore sure it is not intelligent (or creative or insightful). In other words, those beings or things whose internal, lower-level operations we understand and can point to and illuminate, are merely operating according to known patterns of banal physical operations. Those seemingly intelligent entities whose internal operations we do not understand are capable of insight and understanding and creativity. (Resemblance to humans helps too; we more easily deny intelligence to animals that do not look like us.)But what if, like Gloria, we did not have such knowledge of what some system or being or object or extraterrestrial is doing when it produces its apparently “intelligent” answers? What qualities would we ascribe to it to make sense of what it is doing? This level of incomprehensibility is perhaps rapidly approaching. Witness the perplexed reactions of some ChatGPT developers to its supposedly “emergent” behavior, where no one seems to know just how ChatGPT produced the answers it did. We could, of course, insist that “all it’s doing is (some kind of) prompt completion.” But really, we could also just say about humans, “It’s just neurons firing.” But neither ChatGPT nor humans would make sense to us that way.The evidence suggests that if we were to encounter a sufficiently complicated and interesting entity that appears intelligent, but we do not know how it works and cannot utter our usual dismissive line, “All x does is y,” we would start using the language of “folk psychology” to govern our interactions with it, to understand why it does what it does, and importantly, to try to predict its behavior. By historical analogy, when we did not know what moved the ocean and the sun, we granted them mental states. (“The angry sea believes the cliffs are its mortal foes.” Or “The sun wants to set quickly.”) Once we knew how they worked, thanks to our growing knowledge of the physical sciences, we demoted them to purely physical objects. (A move with disastrous environmental consequences!) Similarly, once we lose our grasp on the internals of artificial intelligence systems, or grow up with them, not knowing how they work, we might ascribe minds to them too. This is a matter of pragmatic decision, not discovery. For that might be the best way to understand why and what they do.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenThis should prompt us to look a little closer. For, come to think of it, how do I know that other humans have minds like mine? Roughly: They look like me, they act like me, and so, I reason that they must have minds like mine, which work the way I think mine does. (This is an entirely reasonable inference to the best possible explanation for their visible, external behavior.) We never, though, open the brains of other human beings to check for minds, because we would not know what to look for. More to the point, we know what we would see: a brain, and we do not know how those work. Our intentionality, our understanding, is mysterious too when viewed at this lower level of description. And so, because we cannot find physical correlates of our intelligence, and even if we did, we would find using them too cumbersome in dealing with intelligent humans, we instead observe how human beings behave and act, and how they conform to psychological generalizations. If someone wants to get into medical school, and they believe that studying hard will help them do so, then we can predict that they may be found in a library, studying away diligently. That is what “normal, intelligent” human beings do. This is the interpretive dance we engage in with humans; the language of psychology emerges from these interactions. It is how we make sense of our fellow humans.AdvertisementThis means that our fellow humans, too, are entities whose complex and poorly understood innards do not allow us to explain, predict, and understand their interactions with us in terms of their physical composition and properties (the way we can with objects like stones or glass bottles) or in terms of their design properties (the way we can with aircraft or mechanical pencils). Because we must use higher-level psychological explanations, the best way to make sense of human beings’ behavior is to anthropomorphize them! That is, the best way to make sense of these other beings distinct from me (other “humans”) is to treat them as if they were just like me in kind. The crucial point here is that I did not have to regard other human beings as being like me. I could have perhaps regarded them as curious aliens who happen to resemble me and act like me but were not really like me in some “important, crucial” sense, because I did not have conclusive proof that they had internal lives and minds like mine. Instead, we choose to anthropomorphize humans, because doing so makes interactions with them more tractable, a situation preferable to enduring a solipsistic existence, convinced that our mind is the only one that existed.This philosophical analysis matters because there is an important balancing act we must engage in when thinking about legal regulation of artificial intelligence research: We want the technical advantages and social benefits of artificial intelligence (such as the amazing predictions of protein structures produced by AlphaFold), so we want their designers to continue developing such systems. But these companies need liability cover—like the railways were provided by the Supreme Court in their fledgling days—otherwise, the designers of artificial intelligence systems would stay out of such a potentially financially risky arena. But we want society to be protected too from the negative effects of such smart programs, especially if they take actions that are not anticipated—which, of course, is also their desirable functionality.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenSo, in legal and economic terms, we need to appropriately allocate risk and liability. One way to do so builds upon this revised understanding of artificial intelligence. When we have a conceptual sense that the artificial agents we interact with are agents in the psychological sense—that is, we understand their actions as being caused by their beliefs and desires—it will allow us to consider these systems as the legal representatives (the legal agents) of those who develop and deploy them. Much as hospitals employ doctors who act on behalf of the hospitals, whose acts the hospital is liable for, who can sign contracts and take actions on the behalf of the hospital. (The legal system does not, strictly, have to wait for such a conceptual understanding to be in place before deeming artificial agents to be legal agents, but broader social acceptance of such regulations will be easier if such conceptual understanding is widespread.) They would then be the legal agents of their legal principals—for example, the Bing chatbot would be the legal agent of its principal, Microsoft. Then, the principal is liable for their actions and consequences—as we, the broader public, would want—but only within the scope of duty which their developers and deployers would want. For instance, a driver for a public transport company is liable for things he does on the job but not off it. Transit companies can hire drivers, then, knowing that they are justifiably liable for their actions on the job, but they are protected from their employees when they “go rogue” off the job. Similarly, say a custom version of Bing, purchased by a customer to provide expert guidance on pricing, would be liable for the advice it provides on pricing, but if a customer were to use it for another task, say advising on finding suitable romantic partners, Microsoft would no longer be liable for any bad advice Bing may provide. For such advice would be out of the scope of its proposed duties. For another example, consider the case of Google’s Gmail agent, which scans emails for content it can use to provide advertisements to Gmail users. Google’s risible response to the charge of privacy violations is that because humans do not scan users’ emails, there is no privacy violation. This is not a defense Google could employ if its Gmail agent were to be considered its legal agent, because by law, the knowledge gained by a legal agent is directly attributed to its principal. Google’s “automation screen” thus fails because of the legal agent status of the programs it deploys. Here, our interests are protected by the legal status granted to the artificial agent. This does not diminish our rights; rather, it protects them.Consider what we would do if extraterrestrials alighted on this planet of ours and said, “Take us to your leader!” How would we understand and describe them? What if their innards were so mysterious that our best science gave us no handle on how they functioned? We would have to function like diligent field anthropologists, looking for behavioral evidence that we could correlate with their pronouncements, and start considering the possibility that they have minds like ours. Our lawyers would have to assess the status of these beings in our social orderings and, on seeing they filled and performed important executive roles, that people had formed personal relationships with them, perhaps think about evaluating their application for citizenship and legal status seriously. An analogous situation exists today with regards to the artificial agents and programs in our midst, with a crucial difference: We have made and designed them. This familiarity is tinged with contempt, but the nature of our interpretive dance with them can and will change, depending on how mysterious we find them. The more impenetrable they become in terms of their internal operations, the more sophisticated their functioning, the more we will have to rely on external descriptions using psychological terms like “agent.” This would not be a concession to anything but common sense.

Most importantly, that those who interact and socialize with artificial agents, without knowing (or caring) how they “really work” internally, will develop distinctive relationships with them and ascribe to them those mental qualities appropriate for their relationships. Gloria plays with Robbie and loves him as a companion; he cares for her in return. There is an interpretive dance that Gloria engages in with Robbie, and Robbie’s internal operations and constitution are of no relevance to it. When the opportunity to learn such details arises, further evidence of Robbie’s functionality (after it saves Gloria from an accident) distracts and prevents Gloria from learning anymore.
Philosophically speaking, “Robbie” teaches us that in ascribing a mind to another being, we are not making a statement about the kind of thing it is, but rather, revealing how deeply we understand how it works. For instance, Gloria thinks Robbie is intelligent, but her parents think they can reduce its seemingly intelligent behavior to lower-level machine operations. To see this more broadly, note the converse case where we ascribe mental qualities to ourselves that we are unwilling to ascribe to programs or robots. These qualities, like intelligence, intuition, insight, creativity, and understanding, have this in common: We do not know what they are. Despite the extravagant claims often bandied about by practitioners of neuroscience and empirical psychology, and by sundry cognitive scientists, these self-directed compliments remain undefinable. Any attempt to characterize one employs the other (“true intelligence requires insight and creativity” or “true understanding requires insight and intuition”) and engages in, nay requires, extensive hand waving.
But even if we are not quite sure what these qualities are or what they bottom out in, whatever the mental quality, the proverbial “educated layman” is sure that humans have it and machines like robots do not—even if machines act like we do, producing those same products that humans do, and occasionally replicating human feats that are said to require intelligence, ingenuity, or whatever else. Why? Because, like Gloria’s parents, we know (thanks to being informed by the system’s creators in popular media) that “all they are doing is [table lookup / prompt completion / exhaustive search of solution spaces].” Meanwhile, the mental attributes we apply to ourselves are so vaguely defined, and our ignorance of our mental operations so profound (currently), that we cannot say “human intuition (insight or creativity) is just [fill in the blanks with banal physical activity].”
Current debates about artificial intelligence, then, proceed the way they do because whenever we are confronted with an “artificial intelligence,” one whose operations we (think we) understand, it is easy to quickly respond: “All this artificial agent does is X.” This reductive description demystifies its operations, and we are therefore sure it is not intelligent (or creative or insightful). In other words, those beings or things whose internal, lower-level operations we understand and can point to and illuminate, are merely operating according to known patterns of banal physical operations. Those seemingly intelligent entities whose internal operations we do not understand are capable of insight and understanding and creativity. (Resemblance to humans helps too; we more easily deny intelligence to animals that do not look like us.)
But what if, like Gloria, we did not have such knowledge of what some system or being or object or extraterrestrial is doing when it produces its apparently “intelligent” answers? What qualities would we ascribe to it to make sense of what it is doing? This level of incomprehensibility is perhaps rapidly approaching. Witness the perplexed reactions of some ChatGPT developers to its supposedly “emergent” behavior, where no one seems to know just how ChatGPT produced the answers it did. We could, of course, insist that “all it’s doing is (some kind of) prompt completion.” But really, we could also just say about humans, “It’s just neurons firing.” But neither ChatGPT nor humans would make sense to us that way.
The evidence suggests that if we were to encounter a sufficiently complicated and interesting entity that appears intelligent, but we do not know how it works and cannot utter our usual dismissive line, “All x does is y,” we would start using the language of “folk psychology” to govern our interactions with it, to understand why it does what it does, and importantly, to try to predict its behavior. By historical analogy, when we did not know what moved the ocean and the sun, we granted them mental states. (“The angry sea believes the cliffs are its mortal foes.” Or “The sun wants to set quickly.”) Once we knew how they worked, thanks to our growing knowledge of the physical sciences, we demoted them to purely physical objects. (A move with disastrous environmental consequences!) Similarly, once we lose our grasp on the internals of artificial intelligence systems, or grow up with them, not knowing how they work, we might ascribe minds to them too. This is a matter of pragmatic decision, not discovery. For that might be the best way to understand why and what they do.
This should prompt us to look a little closer. For, come to think of it, how do I know that other humans have minds like mine? Roughly: They look like me, they act like me, and so, I reason that they must have minds like mine, which work the way I think mine does. (This is an entirely reasonable inference to the best possible explanation for their visible, external behavior.) We never, though, open the brains of other human beings to check for minds, because we would not know what to look for. More to the point, we know what we would see: a brain, and we do not know how those work. Our intentionality, our understanding, is mysterious too when viewed at this lower level of description. And so, because we cannot find physical correlates of our intelligence, and even if we did, we would find using them too cumbersome in dealing with intelligent humans, we instead observe how human beings behave and act, and how they conform to psychological generalizations. If someone wants to get into medical school, and they believe that studying hard will help them do so, then we can predict that they may be found in a library, studying away diligently. That is what “normal, intelligent” human beings do. This is the interpretive dance we engage in with humans; the language of psychology emerges from these interactions. It is how we make sense of our fellow humans.
This means that our fellow humans, too, are entities whose complex and poorly understood innards do not allow us to explain, predict, and understand their interactions with us in terms of their physical composition and properties (the way we can with objects like stones or glass bottles) or in terms of their design properties (the way we can with aircraft or mechanical pencils). Because we must use higher-level psychological explanations, the best way to make sense of human beings’ behavior is to anthropomorphize them! That is, the best way to make sense of these other beings distinct from me (other “humans”) is to treat them as if they were just like me in kind. The crucial point here is that I did not have to regard other human beings as being like me. I could have perhaps regarded them as curious aliens who happen to resemble me and act like me but were not really like me in some “important, crucial” sense, because I did not have conclusive proof that they had internal lives and minds like mine. Instead, we choose to anthropomorphize humans, because doing so makes interactions with them more tractable, a situation preferable to enduring a solipsistic existence, convinced that our mind is the only one that existed.

AI could replace 30% of work hours by 2030, new research finds
06:19

Low-wage jobs in the food industry and in customer service are among the positions most likely to be eliminated by generative AI by 2030, according to a new McKinsey report. In fact, jobs that make under $38,000 a year are 14 times as likely to be eliminated by generative AI technology as other types of roles, according to Kweilin Ellingrud, director of the McKinsey Global Institute.""[Jobs] that used to be in-person and have some physical interactive element are shifting to online, remote, and we're seeing a lot more delivery jobs as well,"" Ellingrud told CBS News.  






These jobs will be replaced by devices like fast food kiosks, which enable facilities to operate a single site with far fewer employees. Customer service operations could undergo a transformation, with AI-powered chatbots creating quick, personalized responses to complex customer questions. Because generative AI can quickly retrieve data for a specific customer, it operates much faster than human sales representatives.Your next job interview could be with AI. Here's how to ace it.How job seekers are using AI to supercharge their job huntBut it's not just low-wage jobs: across the entire labor market, activities that account for 30% of hours worked across the U.S. could become automated by 2030, the report indicates. To reach that 30% mark, 12 million workers in professions with shrinking demand may need to change jobs within the next seven years.


While that may seem like a huge number, about 9 million people have shifted jobs since the pandemic, a rate that is 50% higher than before the COVID health crisis.On the other hand, most higher-wage jobs that require a college degree are also likely to be altered by AI, but not completely eliminated or automated, Ellingrud said. Such fields include STEM, creative industries and business or legal professions. For instance, a graphic designer could generate a first draft faster and better with the help of AI, and then use their specialized skills to spend their time in a more valuable way. A nurse could spend less time entering medications into a computer and spend more time with their patients. ""A lot of jobs will be made more meaningful; you'll be able to spend more time doing the things your training and skills have enabled you to uniquely do,"" Ellingrud said. 


Demand for emotional skillsGenerative AI allows skilled workers to be more productive, but employees will need to adapt to these changes by reskilling — learning how to learn new things.""We will have more jobs in the future, and those jobs will be higher wage jobs but they will require higher levels of education,"" she added.Two crucial types of skills that will be in demand are technological and social and emotional skills.Tech knowledge doesn't necessarily mean coding, but workers must be able to interact with emerging technologies to get their job done more efficiently, Ellingrud said. Social and emotional skills, such as showing empathy and genuinely responding to human reactions, are critical because ""that's one of the few things that cannot be replicated by a machine or AI as well,"" she said.

Customer service operations could undergo a transformation, with AI-powered chatbots creating quick, personalized responses to complex customer questions. Because generative AI can quickly retrieve data for a specific customer, it operates much faster than human sales representatives.Your next job interview could be with AI. Here's how to ace it.How job seekers are using AI to supercharge their job huntBut it's not just low-wage jobs: across the entire labor market, activities that account for 30% of hours worked across the U.S. could become automated by 2030, the report indicates. To reach that 30% mark, 12 million workers in professions with shrinking demand may need to change jobs within the next seven years.While that may seem like a huge number, about 9 million people have shifted jobs since the pandemic, a rate that is 50% higher than before the COVID health crisis.On the other hand, most higher-wage jobs that require a college degree are also likely to be altered by AI, but not completely eliminated or automated, Ellingrud said. Such fields include STEM, creative industries and business or legal professions. For instance, a graphic designer could generate a first draft faster and better with the help of AI, and then use their specialized skills to spend their time in a more valuable way. A nurse could spend less time entering medications into a computer and spend more time with their patients. ""A lot of jobs will be made more meaningful; you'll be able to spend more time doing the things your training and skills have enabled you to uniquely do,"" Ellingrud said. Demand for emotional skillsGenerative AI allows skilled workers to be more productive, but employees will need to adapt to these changes by reskilling — learning how to learn new things.""We will have more jobs in the future, and those jobs will be higher wage jobs but they will require higher levels of education,"" she added.Two crucial types of skills that will be in demand are technological and social and emotional skills.Tech knowledge doesn't necessarily mean coding, but workers must be able to interact with emerging technologies to get their job done more efficiently, Ellingrud said. Social and emotional skills, such as showing empathy and genuinely responding to human reactions, are critical because ""that's one of the few things that cannot be replicated by a machine or AI as well,"" she said.",,,,,,"['https://www.cbsnews.com/', 'https://www.facebook.com/CBSNews/', 'https://instagram.com/cbsnews/', 'https://twitter.com/CBSNews', 'https://www.youtube.com/CBSNews', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News']",,,Many low-wage jobs could be eliminated by AI within 7 years,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/ai-could-replace-30-of-work-hours-by-2030-new-research-finds/'}, 'name': 'AI could replace 30% of work hours by 2030, new research finds', 'description': 'Activities that account for up to 30% of hours worked across the U.S. could become automated by 2030, new research from the McKinsey Global Institute finds.

UPDATED: The CEO for Largo.ai, the Switzerland-based artificial intelligence company behind the “100 Actors Program,” wants to amplify the intent of the company’s latest initiative that was red-flagged by Charisma Carpenter. 

	CEO Sami Arpa said the program was only meant to be a “very narrow beta release” for 100 actors, even though they received 5,000 applications. Their hope is to make the tool more public after they complete this initial “experiment.” 

	Carpenter flagged the program on social media last week after receiving a random email from Largo.ai that promised “direct connections with producers and directors (by) allowing you to receive auditions directly from them.” It also said Largo.ai “will automatically suggest matching characters to producers/directors” and “you won’t be charged any commission for the roles you secure.”

	Carpenter’s fear was that the program would essentially erase the role of casting directors, as well as agents and managers. 

	“Largo.AI is in full support of the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strike, this company was developed to empower and support creators through the power of technology, and not utilize AI to replace anyone,” Arpa wrote to Deadline. “Although we are known for our tools in helping both independent and established filmmakers develop their unique projects and retain their IP ownership – we launched our actors’ program only a few short months ago exclusively and are still developing during this beta process – this experience has shown us a certain misinterpretation within the acting community. We will use this as a learning tool for growth. Our mission is to provide more access and creation of job opportunities for both actors and   are not involved in Deepfake creation or any unauthorized use of actors’ performances or voices, our AI tools are totally different here. Our platform is dedicated to empowering actors, providing enhanced visibility and making AI as a part of the preliminary casting process.”



	“There are assertions suggesting that our aim is to replace all industry professionals with automation,” he continued. “However, one must consider who would then be our clients then? In reality, we actively collaborate with industry professionals such as producers, distributors, studios, and actors. Furthermore, we are keen on establishing partnerships with casting directors, and talent agencies. Our objective is to integrate the tools into their work, enhancing their capabilities with innovative technology. Using correctly, AI tools can collectively help us to make the industry better altogether, and create much more job opportunities. Our system diversifies opportunities beyond industry averages, often uncovers lesser-known talents, thus creating opportunities for those who might otherwise be overlooked. We encourage actors and industry members to contact us, share their perspectives, and engage in an open dialogue.”

	










PREVIOUSLY, July 24: There’s not much about the self-tape audition process that Charisma Carpenter likes. There’s hardly any feedback. There are no do-overs. And if she’s not paying a coach to read with her, she’s having to rely on friends in her midwestern town. 

	But she would choose that scenario — however flawed the new reality may be — than rely on artificial intelligence to help her find a job. So when she received a random email to join Largo.ai’s “100 Actors Program,” she waved the red flag on social media just as fellow SAG-AFTRA members were hitting the picket lines to fight for AI protections. 

	The email from a salesperson at the Switzerland-based Largo.ai promised “direct connections with producers and directors (by) allowing you to receive auditions directly from them.” It also said Largo.ai “will automatically suggest matching characters to producers/directors” and “you won’t be charged any commission for the roles you secure.” 

	“Welp, AI is coming for Casting Directors, Agents and Managers too,” Carpenter wrote on her Instagram account. “Seen as intermediaries.’ AI protections across the board! ✊”




	One of the actors who responded to Carpenter’s post was Yellowjackets’ Melanie Lynskey, who wrote “having ‘intermediaries’ who believe in you and think of you for those roles that might not seem 100% right for you but they know you can do it, is how an actor builds a career. This is nuts.”

	Reached by Deadline, Carpenter called the AI casting process “ridiculous” and insisted that “AI is not a belief system.” “They may take data and statistics and spit out a formula that says this person is right for this part, but there’s no foresight,” continues the actress best known for her work on Angel and Dynasty. “AI doesn’t know me, they don’t know the richness of my soul. They don’t know my life experiences. They don’t know the books I’ve read. They’ve never had those conversations with me to glean how right I am for a part that maybe data would not foresee.”

	The Casting Society declined to comment on AI casting, but a spokesperson pointed to a recent Reddit thread suggesting that it’s a possible scam. It’s not, insists CEO Sami Arpa of Largo.ai, which also has a “presence in Los Angeles, London, and Istanbul,” according to its website.

	“We can see that current reactions are quite superficial by positioning the overall AI as a direct enemy, by casting directors or voice actors,” Arpa wrote to Deadline. “Our system has nothing to do with both. Largo.ai has been mainly created for producers, studios and distributors, and many of them are already using our platform since 2019. The main goal of our platform is analyzing the content as early as the development stage from the screenplays, and provide feedback to the producers on the story, casting, and potential audience together with expected financial results.”

	“Our system is not destroying any jobs as claimed in some of those Instagram posts, which are people who do not have any idea on the platform,” Arpa continued via email. “For the casting part, the system has proposed more than 100K actors to the producers completely free of charge during past 4 years. Our new system for Actors is just an additional system that we released for actors, after getting the demand from many actors. Because our AI was already proposing the actors to the producers automatically based on their previous credits during the past 4 years, and we were getting requests if we could provide option for them to connect with the producers directly in such a connection done by the AI. That is how we started this additional service in a narrow & experimental way for the actors.”

	










	Carpenter has zero interest in exploring what Largo.ai has to offer. After she posted on IG, fans referred to it as “scary” while actor Jordan Gavaris (The Lake) called it “absolute lunacy.” “The only reason I’ve ever had a job is because casting championed me for amorphous reasons,” Gavaris wrote. “AI will never be a fan.”

	“I have had wonderful casting directors that have brought me back time and time again to get me employed,” she tells Deadline. “I really am hard pressed to see what the advantage is to actors going this route.”

Old phogie I guess 


						on July 27, 2023 11:52 pm					



This idea smacks of huge group interviews for fast food, baristas, big box stores, etc…except that these auditions/ interviews/casting calls aren’t even giving the actors , producers and any other people involved in industry decision making the opportunity for face to face meetings of any kind. So many actors have worked in the above named fields, or are still working in these fields, to know what I’m talking about. This is NOT the way to decide who should fill any role in the film or television industry! They either have, or still doing their time in these jobs and have worked their asses off to get to the point of auditioning. They deserve so much more respect than this kind of thing could even hope to offer. It needs to stop before it’s even had the chance to start. It’s a slippery slope and is bound to continue sliding into more and more dehumanizing in these industries.

This company is a bunch of techies who have no experience as real producers. They don’t understand our work, or the market and they act as if they do. These are the mistakes they make. They got money from the Swiss government to launch this and have a platform that charges producers for a system unfit for purpose.









					Bravo

It would seem that this system is very democratic and favorable to actors. 
Everybody wants inclusivity. Well, here it is. 
Casting directors can be highly biased, preferring certain types of actors, even for unconscious reasons. New actors are desperate to get to casting directors, and producers don’t really care about the prior history of an actor if they can deliver the performance and have the look. 
So this is a good thing. casting directors may become albatrosses, but that happens with all new technology. However, it will be good for producers to get the best selection, and Actors to get a fair shot. 
Hopefully, this will occur soon for screenplay writers who can circumvent all the readers and executives who are varied in their ability to discern what is a commercial screenplay.

I totally agree. 
Largo, please soon start a sevice where writers can submit scripts for a moderate fee to be evaluated as to the commerciality on a point system, with the results available to Producers and Studios and financiers and actors and directors for their evaluation and acquisition.

Amazing how frightened people are of AI.

We’re not frightened of AI, we’re afraid of greedy entrepreneurs ruining industries by convincing CEOs to invest in snake oil.

It literally says “eliminating intermediaries” lol. It’s whole purpose is to eliminate casting directors and agents/managers

Netflix Pulls AI Content Creation From Job Listing After Backlash
Published Jul 31, 2023 at 11:56 AM EDT

",,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.newsweek.com/netflix-pulls-ai-content-creation-job-listing-after-backlash-1816430'}","Netflix updated the wording of a contentious and lucrative job posting in the artificial intelligence sector after the listing attracted strong criticism.Netflix and other entertainment behemoths like Disney have faced backlash after seeking candidates for highly paid positions in artificial intelligence amid an ongoing Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike in which writers have been picketing for better pay since May. Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) joined the writers in strike this month, marking the first time in more than 60 years that both unions have staged a walkout.Amid battling with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) for better pay, the WGA and SAG-AFTRA are seeking reassurance that artificial intelligence won't replace humans in creative roles. Artificial intelligence has been a massive point of contention in the negotiations, as the AMPTP has refused to rule out its role in content creation. The AMPTP comprises major studios Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Warner Bros., NBC Universal, Sony and Paramount.Some studios have listed lucrative job postings in the artificial intelligence sector as writers and actors&mdash;eighty-seven percent of the guild's 170,000-plus performers earn no more than $26,000 a year, according to the guild&mdash;demand better pay. One such listing from Netflix advertising a salary of up to $900,000 came to light during the strike.The job posting is for a product manager in the machine learning platform sector and described artificial intelligence as ""powering innovation in all areas of the business.""The description went on to say that machine learning and artificial intelligence help Netflix ""buy and create great content.""""Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence is powering innovation in all areas of business. From helping us buy and create great content, helping members choose the right title for them through personalization, to optimizing our payment processing and other revenue-focused initiatives,"" the description read.However, Netflix has since changed the description in regard to artificial intelligence. The updated description is considerably shorter, eliminating the line about content creation and focusing instead on the role of artificial intelligence in Netflix viewer personalization. The updated posting also doesn't include the line about artificial intelligence ""powering innovation in all areas of the business.""""Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence is powering innovation, from personalization for members, to optimizing our payment processing and other revenue focused initiatives,"" the updated post reads.The job is based out of Netflix's Los Gatos, California, office.Newsweek reached out to Netflix by email for comment.Ken Klippenstein, a journalist at online news website The Intercept who first reported on the position, shared before-and-after screenshots of the job posting on Twitter last Thursday.""Netflix updated their $900,000 AI job posting to remove mention of the AI being used for content creation following my article,"" Klippenstein tweeted.The tweet has been viewed more than 259,000 times as 11:30 a.m. ET Monday.The ongoing strikes by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA have sidelined many Hollywood projects, causing popular late-night shows to go off the air. The release dates for countless movies, including the third installment in the Avatar series and a slew of Marvel films, have been delayed.George R.R. Martin, author of the A Song of Fire and Ice book series that inspired the hit HBO series Game of Thrones, called the strike ""the most important of my lifetime"" in a blog post written this month. Some of his projects have been sidelined by the strike, although Game of Thrones spinoff House of the Dragon is still shooting.However, tensions are still taut between the AMPTP, the WGA and the SAG-AFTRA.In a statement shared with Newsweek, representatives of AMPTP said that the trade association ""presented a deal that offered historic pay and residual increases, substantially higher caps on pension and health contributions, audition protections, shortened series option periods, and a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors' digital likenesses for SAG-AFTRA members.""A strike is certainly not the outcome we hoped for as studios cannot operate without the performers that bring our TV shows and films to life. The Union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.""",,,,,,,,,Netflix pulls AI content creation from job listing after backlash,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Picketers Rally Outside Netflix Offices As Actors Join Writers In Striking', 'description': ""Protesters rallied outside Netflix officers in Los Angeles Thursday as SAG-AFTRA, the union representing more than 150,000 actors, announced a strike following failed contract negotiations.

Notwithstanding, it likewise can change our proficient work assisting us with getting to, consuming, and using the undiscovered data that floods our inboxes and mulls in files..Adobe as of late explored digital workers' impression of AI advances, as well as their worth in the working environment. We reviewed 6,049 advanced specialists across five nations the U.S., UK, Australia, India, and Japan including both average representatives and senior pioneers who are utilizing digital innovations in their work environments. The discoveries uncover their discernments and desires around how AI technology can impact how we work. Following are the best three bits of knowledge from the exploration:.1. AI is Enabling the Advanced Digital Workforce:.For organizations embracing innovation, workers view artificial intelligence as a productive power. A mind-boggling greater part of respondents (92%) say artificial intelligence is emphatically affecting their work and more than one-quarter (26%) consider simulated intelligence a &quot;marvel.&quot; 66% say artificial intelligence is now saving them time, and 61% say it assists them with working quicker..Almost 50% of the laborers we overviewed (45%) say artificial intelligence decreases or takes out exhausting or monotonous undertakings, while 41% say artificial intelligence has improved how they work. More than 33% of respondents (36%) who use AI at work say the innovation empowers them to do things they would never do previously..2. Generative AI is Seen as an Efficiency Multiplier:.Generative simulated intelligence can turn into a competitive edge by putting the force of artificial intelligence readily available. A lot of representatives accept generative Artificial intelligence will assist them with working quicker; coordinating data from various sources quicker than expected; furthermore, and diminish time spent on troublesome, exhausting, or monotonous work. Almost as many say generative Artificial intelligence will assist them with accomplishing more work (89%) and making better quality work (88%) — and 9 out of 10 business pioneers studied say something very similar..3. Business Pioneers View Reception and Utilization of Generative AI as Unavoidable:.Almost four out of five (79%) business pioneers expect their representatives will utilize generative simulated intelligence frequently in their work, with 39% expecting representatives will utilize generative Artificial intelligence consistently..Most worldwide business pioneers (76%) say their organizations are prepared to take on generative Artificial intelligence in their work processes. Of the general 25% of pioneers who say they're not ready to embrace the innovation, almost 33% (35%) say they either don't have the right security, protection, and trust guardrails set up, or they don't have the foggiest idea about how to utilize or convey the innovation successfully (34%)..Improving Human Potential and Efficiency:.As generative artificial intelligence turns out to be more normal, we're hearing reestablished worries that simulated intelligence will supplant human specialists. While there's no question that generative artificial intelligence is as of now altogether changing how we work, when applied nicely it doesn't supplant people but instead intensifies both representative efficiency and commitment..Opening knowledge:.While the shift from simple to computerized has made data more accessible and open than at any other time, it has likewise brought a pound of data that is a lot for the greater part of us to retain, not to mention use. For organizations, the test is increased across gigantic stores of chronicled archives from which they get almost no worth. At one drug organization, which stores a large number of PDF records containing basic exploration and other data, that's what a pioneer remarked: &quot;It's almost certain the remedy for malignant growth is in that information, however, we don't have a proficient method for tracking down it.&quot; Generative man-made intelligence will at long last engage each representative and each organization to give the knowledge in their archives something to do..Customizing Work Encounters:.One of the most thrilling uses of generative simulated intelligence in the working environment will be empowering more customized work encounters. Today, practically every arrangement conveys one-size-fits-all reactions given text prompts. Going ahead, a generative simulated intelligence specialist will have a background marked by working with every individual worker — and will persistently be prepared by everyone from a favored pool of data. These specialists will go about as strong individual partners and become better at addressing representatives' requirements, both in speed and in results that are really custom fitted to their necessities and work..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The advertising industry is increasingly adopting generative AI to improve workflow and save time on mundane tasks, albeit at uneven rates. Against the backdrop of this excitement is apprehension over how AI will impact certain human jobs. Over the last few weeks, more data has emerged, offering a look into that impact.In a survey of more than 200 marketing professionals from agencies, business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies, nonprofits, and publishers, 11.5% C-Suite and VPs stated they either already replaced human employees with generative AI or had plans in progress to do so, according to a report from ad platform Basis Technologies, which sells automation software.

Against the backdrop of this excitement is apprehension over how AI will impact certain human jobs. Over the last few weeks, more data has emerged, offering a look into that impact.



In a survey of more than 200 marketing professionals from agencies, business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies, nonprofits, and publishers, 11.5% C-Suite and VPs stated they either already replaced human employees with generative AI or had plans in progress to do so, according to a report from ad platform Basis Technologies, which sells automation software. 



“I am a bit surprised with that number because we’re still in the early stages of this [technology],” said Katie Risch, CMO at Basis Technologies. 



AI Policies From Agency Holding Groups Help Win Clients and Score Major Partnerships



The report also found that 10.4% of marketers say their organization has replaced human tasks with AI solutions in the last 12 months.



For agencies, the excitement around AI has led to creating task forces and steering groups to help better serve clients. Despite the hype, not all marketers have fully embraced it. Brand safety concerns and fears of diminished brand authenticity have made some marketers cautious. Analysts assume job losses from generative AI over the next two years will be modest until questions around copyright, plagiarism, bias, ethics and accuracy are resolved.



Elsewhere, a recent report by Forrester predicted some 33,000 ad agency jobs, amounting to 7.5% of the total agency workforce, will be replaced by AI by 2030. And nearly one-third of the losses, or 11,000 jobs, will be linked to generative AI. 



The primary jobs at risk of replacement are clerical, secretarial, and administrative jobs (28% of losses), sales jobs (22%), and market research (18%), per Forrester.





Generative AI will have the most impact on scalable creative tasks, such as copywriting or photo production, said Wesley ter Haar, co-founder of MediaMonks. 



Most people agree that AI technologies will not completely replace human jobs. Instead, people must embrace and incorporate this technology into their workflows. That could inevitably lead to smaller team sizes.



""Marketers using AI will replace marketers not using AI,"" said Vincent Spruyt, chief AI officer at IPG's Mediabrands. 



Omnicom Group is already looking at replacing mundane tasks with automation. While the agency is not aiming for headcount reduction, it is exploring possibilities of generative AI to create new content, encompassing both text and images, according to the report by Forrester.



Categories most impacted by generative AI



The Basis Technologies survey found that 54.5% of marketers foresee most use cases of generative AI within content creation, like creating new blog posts, social copy or writing email templates.  



Given AI’s propensity for pattern recognition and data processing, processes such as analysis (13.9%), creative optimization (12.9%), and even media buying (8.9%) will significantly be impacted by generative AI.





More than half (52.5%) of marketers said generative AI is used to assist in drafting content, while nearly as many (48.5%) said they use it for brainstorming.



However, 70% of marketers believe people will find a brand less authentic if it uses AI-generated content in its marketing efforts.



This comes as a significant downside at a time when brand authenticity is valuable currency among younger people.



“Marketers are concerned that the content coming out of [large language] models won’t be unique,” said Risch. “Because it becomes an aggregator of all of the information that it’s scraping across the internet.”





Not all marketers are sold on generative AI



According to the survey, 28% of marketers revealed their organizations do not utilize generative AI in any capacity.



Meanwhile, among marketers who do use generative AI, the survey found a low daily usage rate of 11%, while 72% reported using generative AI tools at least once a month.





Apart from brand authenticity concerns and fear of job loss, marketers have recognized brand safety threats associated with generative AI. And 99.5% of respondents agreed that this technology poses risks for digital marketers.



In response to these challenges, Risch said that marketers may consider hiring professionals who embrace these tools and have found a way to improve the way they work using generative AI.","{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}",,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/Adweek/', 'https://twitter.com/Adweek', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/adweek', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKhCJRTHHLuW2iW7XQtcfyQ', 'https://www.tiktok.com/@adweek', 'https://www.instagram.com/adweek/']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'How GenAI Is Impacting Human Jobs Across the Ad Industry', 'url': 'https://www.adweek.com/media/how-genai-is-impacting-human-jobs-across-the-ad-industry/', 'datePublished': '2023-07-27T06:00:00-04:00', 'articleBody': 'The advertising industry is increasingly adopting generative AI to improve workflow and save time on mundane tasks, albeit at uneven rates.

           Accelerated adoption of AI could automate 30% of Americans’ work hours: McKinsey Accelerated adoption of artificial intelligence could result in the automation of about 30% of hours worked by Americans in 2030, a report found  Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By  Eric Revell  FOXBusiness     close   Which industries are most at risk because of artificial intelligence? Zeta Global [NYSE: ZETA] CEO David Steinberg gives his take on AI taking human jobs on ‘Making Money.’ Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology may reshape the U.S. workforce by the end of the decade as companies increasingly adopt AI tools to help automate tasks that consume nearly one-third of Americans’ workweeks, according to a new report. The McKinsey Global Institute on Wednesday released a report on ""Generative AI and the future of work in America"" that found that advances in AI have the potential to accelerate automation in the economy.""Without generative AI, our research estimated, automation could take over tasks accounting for 21.5 percent of the hours worked in the U.S. economy by 2030,"" the report said. ""With it, that share has now jumped to 29.5 percent."" TWO-THIRDS OF US JOBS COULD BE EXPOSED TO AI-DRIVEN AUTOMATION: GOLDMAN SACHS      Accelerated adoption of artificial intelligence could result in the automation of about 30% of hours worked by Americans in 2030. (iStock / iStock)Several occupations were identified by the McKinsey report as being positioned to see a greater share of automated work hours with the aid of AI.Professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields would see the percentage of their automated work hours jump by 16 points to 30% by 2030 because of accelerated AI adoption. Education and workforce training professionals would also see a 16% increase, although those fields had a lower automation baseline without AI acceleration. So, AI-guided automation would only account for about 23% of those professionals’ hours worked in 2030. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?     The McKinsey Global Institute report finds that demand for labor in some professions may decline by 2030 due to automation accelerated by AI even if those sectors don't see net job losses. (iStock / iStock)Other job categories with notable increases include creatives and arts management, which would see a 15-point jump to about 25% of hours worked, in addition to business and legal professionals, who would see a 14-point increase to 30% of hours worked.Areas in which generative AI is projected to have a smaller impact on automating workers’ tasks over the rest of the decade include agricultural work, which would see only a 3% automation increase, while production workers and health and wellness technicians would see a 4% increase, according to the report. AI TECHNOLOGY UNLIKELY TO FULLY REPLACE FINANCIAL ADVISERS: MORNINGSTARAgriculture and production work roles have high automation baselines of 27% and 30%, respectively, as starting points – although health technicians are at roughly 15%, according to the report.Across all sectors of the economy, American workers are projected to see an additional 8% of their work hours automated by 2030 with the acceleration of generative AI, bringing the total of automated work hours to about 30%.     Agriculture work is one field that's less likely to see an increase in automation due to AI in part because the industry is already relatively highly automated. (Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images)As for whether the widespread adoption of AI will lead to the elimination of a significant number of jobs, the McKinsey report noted, ""Our research does not lead us to estimate job losses, although we cannot definitively rule out that conclusion, at least in the short term. Technological advances often cause disruption — but historically, they have eventually fueled economic and employment growth.""Customer service and sales, in addition to office support roles were the occupations the report found were most likely to see decreasing labor demand and a modest change of work activities due to AI. To a lesser degree, food services and production work were also identified as fields where labor demand would likely decline due to automation accelerated by AI.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREEven as demand for labor in certain fields declines, the report found that those declines could manifest themselves in terms of slower overall growth in those fields rather than net declines between now and 2030.""While we do not predict aggregate employment levels ourselves, we do model various drivers of labor demand to look at how the mix of jobs might change – and those results yield some gains and some losses,"" the report noted. ""In fact, the occupational categories most exposed to generative AI could continue to add jobs through 2030, although its adoption may slow their rate of growth.""

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Even as demand for labor in certain fields declines, the report found that those declines could manifest themselves in terms of slower overall growth in those fields rather than net declines between now and 2030. &quot;While we do not predict aggregate employment levels ourselves, we do model various drivers of labor demand to look at how the mix of jobs might change &#x2013; and those results yield some gains and some losses,&quot; the report noted.&#xA0; &quot;In fact, the occupational categories most exposed to generative AI could continue to add jobs through 2030, although its adoption may slow their rate of growth.&quot;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/eca6cb1e-298c-4c91-8e3a-53277594fd5c/c3ff455f-155b-4271-abf1-b51c7360fff8/1280x720/match/image.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://vod.foxbusiness.com/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/854081161001/eca6cb1e-298c-4c91-8e3a-53277594fd5c/3cc16157-4df9-4cf1-b530-cfa570db2e43/main.mp4,PT4M34S,2023-07-06T15:10:59-04:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358562234112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358553809112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358551871112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358540547112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358439692112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358319648112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358318778112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358171086112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/apple-hits-all-time-high-morgan-stanley-touts-stock-top-pick-ai', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6357762789112']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And for many rural Indians like her, an Indian startup's app is no less than a revolution.How An App Is Transforming Village People's Lives                        timeUnlike her teaching job, which gives her nearly the same salary at the end of the month, the app doesn’t make Chandrika wait that long. The money lands in her bank account in just a few hours after her work is done. By just reading text aloud in her native language of Kannada, spoken by around 60 million people mostly in central and southern India, Chandrika has used this app to earn an hourly wage of about Rs 400. And in a few days, more money will arrive—a 50% bonus, awarded once the voice clips are validated as accurate, as per the TIME report.All thanks to artificial intelligence, Chandrika’s voice can fetch this money. As AI tools such as ChatGPT currently work best in languages like English, they work much less well in languages like Kannada, which is spoken by millions of people.This has created huge demand for datasets—collections of text or voice data—in languages spoken by some of the poorest people in the world. Part of that demand comes from tech companies seeking to build out their AI tools. Another big chunk comes from academia and governments, especially in India, where English and Hindi have long held outsize precedence in a nation of some 1.4 billion people with 22 official languages and at least 780 more indigenous ones. This rising demand means that hundreds of millions of Indians are suddenly in control of a scarce and newly valuable asset: their mother tongue.Indian AI Startup Helping The Poor                        karyaTo solve this, one Indian startup is testing a new model in the villages, for which Chandrika works too. It is for Karya, a non-profit startup launched in 2021 in Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) that bills itself as “the world’s first ethical data company.”  The startup Karya already has a list of high-profile clients, including Microsoft, MIT, and Stanford. While it sells data to big tech companies and other clients at the market rate just like its competitors, instead of keeping much of that cash as profit, it covers its costs and funnels the rest towards the rural poor in India.(Karya partners with local NGOs to ensure access to its jobs goes first to the poorest of the poor, as well as historically marginalised communities.) In addition to its $5 hourly minimum, Karya gives workers de facto ownership of the data they create on the job, so whenever it is resold, the workers receive the proceeds on top of their past wages. It’s a model that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the industry.The work Karya is doing also means that millions of people whose languages are marginalised online could stand to gain better access to the benefits of technology—including AI. ""Most people in the villages don’t know English,"" says Vinutha, a 23-year-old student who has used Karya to reduce her financial reliance on her parents. ""If a computer could understand Kannada, that would be very helpful.""""The wages that exist right now are a failure of the market,"" Manu Chopra, the 27-year-old CEO of Karya, said, as per a TIME report. ""We decided to be a nonprofit because, fundamentally, you can’t solve a market failure in the market.""The catch, if you can call it that, is that the work is supplementary. The first thing Karya tells its workers is: This is not a permanent job, but rather a way to quickly get an income boost that will allow you to go on and do other things. The maximum a worker can earn through the app is the equivalent of $1,500 (about Rs 1.2 lakh), roughly the average annual income in India. After that point, they make way for somebody else.  Also Read: TCS Confirms Plan To Build Its Own ChatGPT Like AI ToolAlready Helped 30,000 Rural Indians Earn Rs 65 Million                        indiatimesStartup Karya says it has paid out Rs 65 million in wages to some 30,000 rural Indians up and down the country. By 2030, Chopra wants it to reach 100 million. ""I genuinely feel this is the quickest way to move millions of people out of poverty if done right,"" says Chopra, who was born into poverty and won a scholarship to Stanford that changed his trajectory. ""This is absolutely a social project. Wealth is power. And we want to redistribute wealth to the communities that have been left behind.""Also, just 70 miles from the bustling tech metropolis of Bengaluru, is the village of Chilukavadi. Inside a low concrete building, the headquarters of a local farming cooperative, a dozen men and women are gathered—all of whom have started working for Karya within the past week. Kanakaraj S., a skinny 21-year-old, sits cross-legged on the cool concrete floor. He is studying at a nearby college, and to pay for books and transport costs, he occasionally works as a casual labourer in the surrounding fields. A day’s work can earn him Rs 350, but this kind of manual labour is becoming more unbearable as climate change makes summers here even more sweltering than usual. Working in a factory in a nearby city would mean a slightly higher wage, but it would also mean hours of daily commuting on unreliable and expensive buses or, worse, moving away from his support network to live in dormitory accommodation in the city.At Karya, Kanakaraj can earn more in an hour than he makes in a day in the fields. ""The work is good,"" he says. ""And easy."" Chopra says that’s a typical refrain when he meets villagers.""They’re happy we pay them well,"" he says, but more importantly, ""it’s that it’s not hard work. It’s not physical work."" Kanakaraj was surprised when he saw the first payment land in his bank account. ""We’ve lost a lot of money from scams,"" he said, explaining that it is common for villagers to receive SMS texts preying on their desperation, offering to multiply any deposits they make by 10. When somebody first told him about Karya, he assumed it was a similar con—a common initial response, according to Chopra.A Microsoft Researcher Is A Member Of The Startup                        time“The hope is that efforts like the ones Karya is enabling will help Indian-language AI projects learn from the mistakes of English AIs and begin from a far more reliable and unbiased starting point, the TIME report mentioned.“Until not so long ago, a speech-recognition engine for English would not even understand my English,” says Kalika Bali, a linguist and principal researcher at Microsoft Research who is working with the Gates Foundation on the project and is an unpaid member of Karya’s oversight board, referring to her accent. “What is the point of AI technologies being out there if they do not cater to the users they are targeting?”For the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth.

It involves the use of computers to reproduce or undertake such actions, often at a higher speed and accuracy than previously achieved.AI typically combines computer science with data to solve problems or make predictions. Its processes involve algorithms, which are a series of rules written into computer code.RecommendedThe FT ViewThe editorial boardWill generative AI boost productivity?Historically, AI has been used to carry out complex mathematical tasks, or to play strategy games such as chess, often beating human competitors. In general, the more specific the application, the more effective an AI can be. But it has limitations, including bias in outcomes, a high cost of computing power, and a lack of transparency over why a system makes a particular decision.What is machine learning?Machine learning (ML) is an application of AI whereby computer programs can automatically learn from, and adapt to, new information without being specifically programmed to do so. Algorithms can detect patterns in the past data that a computer is trained on and make predictions or recommendations without explicit instructions from humans. ML programs improve over time with training, learning from past experiences or mistakes, as well as spotting patterns in new data.What is deep learning?Deep learning (DL) is a subset of ML that solves complex problems, such as speech recognition or image classification. It encourages the AI to learn through high volumes of unstructured data in various mediums including text, images and video. DL models run on software called neural networks, modelled on the human brain.The main difference between ML and DL is that ML requires human input to understand the data and learn from it. DL can ingest unstructured data in a raw form and distinguish the difference between different categories of data.What are neural networks?Deep learning uses neural networks, which are systems for processing data inspired by the way neurons interact in the human brain. Information goes into the system, the neurons communicate to understand it, and the system creates an output.For example, an AI could recognise a turnip by identifying multiple turnips in its data. It will then be able to spot any new turnips it encounters. If it comes across a carrot for the first time, it might mistakenly think it is a turnip at first. But, the more carrots it sees, the better it will be able to discern a difference. Humans can help an AI’s judgment by marking output as correct or incorrect — for example, by labelling images of any new vegetables input to the AI.How does generative AI work?Generative AI takes vast amounts of raw data — for example, the entire works of Shakespeare — and learns the patterns within it, in order to generate the most likely correct response when prompted with a question. For example, if you asked it to write a Shakespearean sonnet, the AI would use its learning to generate the most likely sequence of words, with the correct number of lines and rhyming pattern. It would create a version similar to, but not a direct replica of, his poems.RecommendedExplainerArtificial intelligenceBattle of the chatbots: how does GPT-4 stack up against Bard?Generative models have been used on numerical data for a number of years. But, as deep learning and natural language processing have become more advanced, generative AI has been applied to images, audio and text.The term became widely known after the Microsoft-backed company OpenAI released its chatbot ChatGPT in November, which can produce humanlike paragraphs of text. GPT-4, the AI model behind the technology, has been trained on millions of text sources, including websites, newspapers and books.Generative AI marks a turning point in natural language processing — the ability for computers to process and generate text and other language-based mediums, including software code, images and scientific structures.Early examples include GPT-4, Google’s PaLM, which is used in its chatbot Bard, as well as image-generation AI, such as DALL-E 2 and Midjourney. This focus on Generative AI is causing a shift towards AI systems trained on large, unlabeled data sets, which can be fine-tuned for different purposes, rather than AI systems that execute specific tasks in a single area.Reducing the need to label the data makes the AI more accessible, as consumers or companies can deploy it in different circumstances.What are large language models?Generative AI tends to rely on large language models (LLMs), a type of AI system that works with languages and uses neural networks. LLMs are the current, cutting-edge way of laying out neural networks from research.They are called “large” language models as they hold vast amounts of data.

",,,,"Artificial intelligence is the ability of machines to carry out intelligent tasks typically performed by humans. It involves the use of computers to reproduce or undertake such actions, often at a higher speed and accuracy than previously achieved.

AI typically combines computer science with data to solve problems or make predictions. Its processes involve algorithms, which are a series of rules written into computer code.

Historically, AI has been used to carry out complex mathematical tasks, or to play strategy games such as chess, often beating human competitors. In general, the more specific the application, the more effective an AI can be. But it has limitations, including bias in outcomes, a high cost of computing power, and a lack of transparency over why a system makes a particular decision.

Machine learning (ML) is an application of AI whereby computer programs can automatically learn from, and adapt to, new information without being specifically programmed to do so. Algorithms can detect patterns in the past data that a computer is trained on and make predictions or recommendations without explicit instructions from humans. ML programs improve over time with training, learning from past experiences or mistakes, as well as spotting patterns in new data.

Deep learning (DL) is a subset of ML that solves complex problems, such as speech recognition or image classification. It encourages the AI to learn through high volumes of unstructured data in various mediums including text, images and video. DL models run on software called neural networks, modelled on the human brain.

The main difference between ML and DL is that ML requires human input to understand the data and learn from it. DL can ingest unstructured data in a raw form and distinguish the difference between different categories of data.

Deep learning uses neural networks, which are systems for processing data inspired by the way neurons interact in the human brain. Information goes into the system, the neurons communicate to understand it, and the system creates an output.

For example, an AI could recognise a turnip by identifying multiple turnips in its data. It will then be able to spot any new turnips it encounters. If it comes across a carrot for the first time, it might mistakenly think it is a turnip at first. But, the more carrots it sees, the better it will be able to discern a difference. Humans can help an AI’s judgment by marking output as correct or incorrect — for example, by labelling images of any new vegetables input to the AI.

Generative AI takes vast amounts of raw data — for example, the entire works of Shakespeare — and learns the patterns within it, in order to generate the most likely correct response when prompted with a question. For example, if you asked it to write a Shakespearean sonnet, the AI would use its learning to generate the most likely sequence of words, with the correct number of lines and rhyming pattern. It would create a version similar to, but not a direct replica of, his poems.

Generative models have been used on numerical data for a number of years. But, as deep learning and natural language processing have become more advanced, generative AI has been applied to images, audio and text.

The term became widely known after the Microsoft-backed company OpenAI released its chatbot ChatGPT in November, which can produce humanlike paragraphs of text. GPT-4, the AI model behind the technology, has been trained on millions of text sources, including websites, newspapers and books.

Generative AI marks a turning point in natural language processing — the ability for computers to process and generate text and other language-based mediums, including software code, images and scientific structures.

Early examples include GPT-4, Google’s PaLM, which is used in its chatbot Bard, as well as image-generation AI, such as DALL-E 2 and Midjourney.

This focus on Generative AI is causing a shift towards AI systems trained on large, unlabeled data sets, which can be fine-tuned for different purposes, rather than AI systems that execute specific tasks in a single area.

Reducing the need to label the data makes the AI more accessible, as consumers or companies can deploy it in different circumstances.

Generative AI tends to rely on large language models (LLMs), a type of AI system that works with languages and uses neural networks. LLMs are the current, cutting-edge way of laying out neural networks from research.

They are called “large” language models as they hold vast amounts of data. LLMs today can have millions or billions more data sets than those trained just a few years ago, due mainly to the increasing computational capacity.

GPT-4, PaLM and Meta’s LLaMa are all examples of LLMs. Adding language models to Google’s search engine, for example, was what the company called “the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of search”.

Although the potential for LLMs is huge, so are the resources needed to design, train and deploy the models. All require vast amounts of data, energy to power the computers, and engineering talent.

AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence — an AI that is capable of the same level of intelligence as humans, or an even higher level.

So far, AI has been able to outperform humans in standardised tests but still stumbles with common knowledge, having so-called “hallucinations” where it states falsehoods as facts. Examples of these hallucinations include creating fake book citations or answering “elephant”, when asked which mammal lays the largest eggs.However, Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “Godfather of AI,” has said that AGI could be here in as little as five years. He and others have warned about the risks that such a level of AI could pose to society and humankind.

One in 12 (8 per cent) of UK adults, or around one million people, have used generative AI for work, according to a new report.Despite this, Deloitte’s 2023 Digital Consumer Trends report revealed that only 23 per cent of the one million believe their employer would approve.Generative AI is a type of system capable of generating text and images in response to prompts.The survey of 4,150 UK adults aged 16-75 also found that half (52 per cent) of individuals in the UK had heard of generative AI and a quarter (26 per cent) had used it. Kate Palmer, who works in HR advice and consultancy at Peninsula, said the fast rate of development and widespread use of AI made the results “hardly surprising” and advised disapproving employers to adopt specific policies. “It's recommended to implement a specific AI policy that clearly lays out a company’s stance on utilising this technology within the workplace to eliminate any uncertainty,” she said. Palmer also warned that being reliant on AI-generated content could “lead to copyright infringement [and] potential issues with accuracy”, adding that inputting sensitive data could  “drastically increase vulnerability to cyber attacks or phishing attempts”.Similarly, Sarah Hamilton-Gill, mentor and managing director of Globus HR Consulting, said  there were “very few” companies that had addressed the “boundaries and issues” surrounding AI. She also encouraged organisations to consider the following critical areas as a minimum when contemplating the usage of AI:
Establishing clear usage guidelines for employees. Make sure they understand what ChatGPT can be used for and what it should not be used for.Providing adequate training for employees to understand the full capabilities of the AI model and how to use it appropriately.Maintaining policies that respect privacy rights, especially if the AI is used to interact with sensitive information. Transparency, making it clear when a user is communicating with AI. Being aware that the AI might not fully understand or interpret complex legal language, which could lead to incorrect outcomes. Returning to the survey, 30 per cent of those who had tried a generative AI tool said they had used it once or twice, while 28 per cent of respondents said they used it frequently. One in 10 (9 per cent) indicated they used an AI tool daily or more often. Gemma Bullivant, HR consultant and coach, said the statistic did not surprise her because many people were interested in AI and what it could achieve, and many were experimenting with it with mixed results.She said she wanted to see more training around this to help HR consultants and coaches to handle it properly. The training should also help them to understand generative AI and how it could be used and misused, and enable them to use it ""wisely and productively” instead of fearing it. “Without this understanding, policies will be difficult to get right and could be counterproductive,” she said. The survey also found that 64 per cent of those who had heard of generative AI felt there would be fewer jobs available overall in the future, while half (48 per cent) believed some of their job duties would be replaced.The news comes as Hollywood’s actors and writers have both gone on strike for the first time since 1960. They are protesting against a number of studios' decisions, including how generative artificial intelligence tools could replace their roles in the industry. Additionally, exclusive data analysis by People Management recently revealed that HR professionals were curious about integrating AI solutions into their day-to-day workflow. According to the report, one third (33 per cent) of 1,000 respondents to a LinkedIn poll claimed they had not yet used ChatGPT but would like to.Read the CIPD's guide to preparing your organisation for AI use and catch up on the CIPD webinar which explores the ethical considerations around AI

The number of job postings related to generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the pharma sector has increased by 407% over the last three months. This dramatic rise is particularly notable given a general downturn of 7% in postings across the pharmaceutical industry over the same period. 
Although the increase is an outlier due to the low number of jobs in previous months – the number of postings identified by GlobalData still sits below 100 – it is indicative of a desire to harness the technology’s potential. A GlobalData report suggests that generative AI trained on big data can cut the length of an initial exploratory phase in drug design by three or four years, significantly reducing the cost of drug development in terms of both time and money.  

It's not just traditional pharmaceuticals players interested in this technology. It was announced earlier this month that Nvidia, the tech company predominantly known for its role as a graphics card manufacturer, has invested $50m (£38.19m) in the 10-year old biopharmaceutical generative AI startup Recursion as part of its pivot towards AI.  See Also:BMS gains EMA validation for Opdivo/Yervoy combo in liver cancer Rona Therapeutics gains Series A+ funds for siRNA pipeline expansion 
A number of other young companies have been hiring within the sector, including AbSci Corp and Precision for Medicine Inc., suggesting that the future of the industry may be shaped as much by technology as traditional practices.

News about artificial intelligence (AI) is hard to tune out these days. The technology is in explosion mode at the moment, and we are witnessing its application and entry into countless fields. Yet there’s a long road ahead in this narrative, especially when it comes to the implications AI is unleashing upon industries, and in some cases upon careers. Many workers have concerns about being replaced by AI, and there are certainly some job types that may be vulnerable to its powerful capabilities. The advancement of artificial intelligence has the potential to impact various job roles across different industries, but the widespread fears about jobs being replaced by AI may be somewhat unfounded.


Some Jobs Are Vulnerable to AI Displacement
The question for many is what jobs are potentially on the hook. It’s a complicated one to ask, because there are varying degrees of how much AI can step in as a human replacement. AI can take the load of performing repetitive, routine tasks, and even handle some of the outcome of its analysis. While the exact extent of displacement can vary, here are some job categories that may experience changes or potential displacement due to AI:




Routine and Repetitive Tasks: Jobs that involve repetitive tasks such as data entry, assembly line work, or basic customer service interactions can be automated with AI systems, leading to a decrease in demand for human workers in these roles.
Transportation and Delivery: The rise of autonomous vehicles and drones has the potential to impact jobs in transportation and delivery services, including truck drivers, taxi drivers, and couriers.
Customer Support: Chatbots and virtual assistants are increasingly being used for customer support, reducing the need for a large number of human customer service representatives. While AI can handle basic inquiries, human support may still be required for more complex or empathetic situations.
Data Analysis and Research: AI-powered algorithms and machine learning systems can quickly process and analyze large volumes of data, potentially impacting jobs in data analysis and research. However, human expertise will still be necessary for higher-level analysis and business decision-making.
Manufacturing and Warehouse Operations: Automation using AI and robotics can streamline manufacturing processes and warehouse operations, leading to a reduced demand for manual labor in these fields.
Financial Services: AI algorithms are being employed for tasks like automated trading, fraud detection, and risk assessment, potentially affecting jobs in financial analysis, auditing, and certain aspects of banking.
Healthcare Diagnostics: AI has shown promise in medical imaging analysis and diagnostics. Because it can assist healthcare professionals in interpreting results, it may impact jobs in radiology and pathology.



PROMOTED
The list continues and can be expanded by imagining the kind of positions that could be tedious, repetitive, and ultimately costly to the organization as candidates for AI solutions and displacement.
It is important to note that while AI may automate certain tasks, it also has the potential to create new job opportunities and transform existing roles. Many industries are adopting AI to augment human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. As technology advances, it is crucial for individuals to adapt and acquire skills that complement AI systems to remain relevant in the evolving job market.

In healthcare, AI-powered systems are revolutionizing medical image analysis, diagnosis, and treatment planning, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient patient care. By leveraging AI algorithms healthcare professionals can achieve higher precision and streamline decision-making processes, ensuring improved outcomes for patients.
AI's impact is being felt in the manufacturing sector as well. Manufacturers are increasingly relying on AI to optimize production processes, minimize downtime, and enhance quality control. By harnessing AI technologies, businesses can unlock new levels of efficiency, productivity, and operational excellence.
These examples highlight the diverse ways in which AI is already making a tangible impact across industries. As organizations continue to embrace and explore the potential of AI, we can anticipate even greater advancements that will transform how we live, work, and interact with technology.
Empowerment Through AI
These emerging use cases teach us a valuable lesson: the integration of AI into the workforce won't involve an HR person tapping you on the shoulder and replacing your job with an AI. Instead, these examples demonstrate how AI is being introduced to enhance efficiency across various aspects of our work. The ultimate value of AI lies in its ability to augment human capabilities, recognizing that humans are indispensable contributors to productivity and the resources businesses rely on. Rather than displacing human workers, AI empowers them to perform their jobs more effectively, allowing for the optimization of processes and the realization of greater outcomes. AI simply acts as a catalyst for improved job performance.
The evolution and integration of AI into industries and economies are ongoing processes that require careful consideration and foresight. When applied intelligently, AI holds transformative possibility that can maximize human potential within the workforce. By leveraging AI as a tool for empowerment, businesses can unlock new levels of productivity and innovation. This approach serves as the foundation for a future where AI and human collaboration together drive prosperity and technological advancement. Embracing the symbiotic relationship between AI and human intelligence is key to cultivating a prosperous future where both can thrive.
Risking it All on Artificial Intelligence
Hopefully, thought leaders envision and encourage AI in a way that prioritizes collaboration rather than focusing on replacing humans. As we navigate these new waters, it’s imperative to consider the risks associated with driving a narrative solely centered on replacing human workers. This approach carries ethical concerns, potential drops in productivity, reputational damage, and exposure to the unknown. Any industry that rapidly displaces a critical component of their workforce is likely to encounter significant challenges, regardless of the possibilities.
It's undeniable that artificial intelligence presents a remarkable opportunity for transformation and innovation across industries. While it is important to address concerns about job displacement and establish robust AI regulations, a balanced perspective is crucial. By identifying vulnerable sectors, harnessing the streamlining potential of AI, advocating for responsible regulations, addressing ethical considerations, and fostering ongoing collaboration, we can navigate the path of generative AI. Through thoughtful, informed decision-making, we can ensure its positive impact on our society, workforce, and economic landscape.
By striking a balance between innovation and human well-being, we can steer the course of AI towards a future that maximizes benefits and minimizes risks. We can leverage the capabilities of AI while upholding our ethical responsibilities.

The job cuts were said to be primarily within functions including marketing, site security, enterprise engineering, programme management, content strategy, and corporate communications rather than engineering roles. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly stated that the staff rationalisation is a bid to restructure the business towards a more optimal ratio of engineers to non-engineering roles.

Although there is a huge amount of interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the consumer world, particularly since the release of OpenAI’s free ChatGPT program last November, in the hallowed halls of academia the response has been more wary. Concerns abound about academic integrity. There are also worries about how AI-generated content can be biased, inaccurate, and sometimes contain entirely false information, dubbed “hallucinations.”  The cautious response is to be expected according to Houman Harouni, lecturer on education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and a former elementary and high school teacher. He has compassion for educators trying to grapple with a rapidly shifting world shaped by machine learning.“Technology creates a shock,” he explains. “This shock is sometimes of a magnitude that we cannot even understand it, in the same way that we still haven't absorbed the sharp shock of the mobile phone.”Harouni has long wrestled with the impact of cutting-edge technology on education, including experimenting in his own classroom, and is convinced that when it comes to teaching  “the medium is part of the message.” He believes that getting school students and those in higher ed to engage with virtual worlds is essential. “Where we want to get to is a place where you’re dancing with it, dancing with robots,” he says.If the idea of waltzing with a robot creates apprehension for educators, Harouni has some advice :1) Stop pretending that it doesn’t existEducators must “help the next generation face the reality of the world and develop instruments and ways of navigating this reality with integrity,” Harouni says. Students are well aware that technologies such as ChatGPT exist and are already experimenting with them on their own, but they need guidance about how to use them responsibly.Teacher education and professional development programs should not ignore generative artificial intelligence either. 2) Use AI alongside your studentsEngage with generative AI tools with your students in person, when possible. Otherwise, share AI-generated responses to questions during class time and ask students to consider them or have students experiment with the technology at home, document their experiences, and share them with the class. 3) Teach students how to ask the ChatGPT tool questions “The educator's job is to understand what opportunities are left open beside the technology,” Harouni says. Teach students to do what artificial intelligence cannot do. For example, unlike robots, we can ask ourselves questions and that is what students need to be trained in: to know how to ask questions and to learn how to critique their own questions, frameworks, and the answers generated by AI, he says. Students can start with topics and questions that they are interested in and ask ChatGPT for answers, he suggests. The knack is then getting them excited about asking follow-up questions. Harouni uses a personal experience with his 10-year-old stepdaughter and his newborn baby to illustrate his point. When his stepdaughter asked him why he kept telling her to be careful with the baby, Harouni turned to ChatGPT to help her to get to the bottom of her question. “My creativity as the teacher or the parent at that moment is to say, ‘What is it that you're really trying to ask? What is it that you really want to know?’”While ChatGPT churned out a “whole bunch of answers about the fragility of the baby,” with some patience, Harouni helped his stepdaughter discover the question that she truly wanted to ask which was what she could safely do with the new baby. “At the moment that the exploration [with AI] ends with the answer, you know that your work as a teacher begins,” he explains.4) Use generative AI tools to spark the imagination One frequent concern about generative artificial intelligence is that students will use it to cheat and avoid the hard work of thinking for themselves, but Harouni says that tools like ChatGPT should really challenge teachers and professors to reassess the assignments they give their students. “You have to stop thinking that you can teach exactly the way you used to teach when the basic medium has changed,” he explains. If students can turn to ChatGPT or other AI language models for quick and easy answers then there is a problem with the lesson, Harouni believes.“We have to create assignments that push [students] to the point where they have to question what is the framework that is being used here and what would it mean for me to radically change this framework,” he says.Harouni recently wrote about how he used ChatGPT to spur higher-level thinking among his students at HGSE when he presented them with a challenging case study that had no easy solutions. The students’ initial responses were no better than the chatbot’s ideas. Instead “it was after ChatGPT reflected to the students their failure of imagination that they could begin to think of options that they, or any automatic language scrawler, would not have readily reached for,” he explained in a co-authored article for Wired.

Most likely, they say, employees will work in concert with machines, and workers’ roles may become more sophisticated as AI eliminates repetitive and manual tasks. Ideally, employees will instead spend their time focusing on the uniquely human tasks that AI isn’t currently positioned to usurp – i.e. creative approaches to problem solving, interpersonal communication – and be able to generate more, better output.If workers transition into more intellectually demanding roles, or see their productivity spike when they harness AI’s benefits, it’s tempting to believe wages will evolve in parallel. After all, if job descriptions are changing, and workers are contributing more, compensation should theoretically follow. However, experts say the outlook may be more complicated for workers of all skill levels. Going up? Going down? As AI takes some of the mundane tasks out of workers’ days, particularly in knowledge-work roles, experts expect many jobs may become more sophisticated and creative. Productivity could spike, too, as workers transition time-consuming minutiae to machines. For some employees, this means their fundamental job descriptions are changing – and that they’re producing more output at a higher level. Although it’s possible some companies will raise pay as employees take on new tasks, some experts, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economics professor Daron Acemoglu, are dubious all workers will see pay rises as AI pushes them to do more, different work.Getty ImagesExperts say it's possible companies will accept automation that may not be quite as good as human labour, so they don't have to spend money on labourers (Credit: Getty Images)Tech DecodedFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter. The twice-weekly email decodes the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world. Sign up for free here.In a 2019 research paper with colleague Pascual Restrepo, Acemoglu wrote that we “should not expect automation to create wage increases commensurate with productivity growth”. One reason, he believes, is that financial gains realised from increased worker productivity are generally absorbed by the company, not passed onto the workers as better compensation.Harry J Holzer, economist and Georgetown University professor of public policy, and non-resident fellow at US think-tank The Brookings Institution, says this chimes with research that shows AI shifts compensation from the worker to the business. According to an economic study by the White House Council of Economic Advisors of automation in blue-collar jobs, Germany, France, Spain and The Netherlands saw revenue from productivity gains go to shareholders and not to the salaries of warehouse workers.For hourly and shift-based workers, often in low-skill industries, AI has the potential to limit earning potential. Experts say one concern is workers may end up working less, as some parts of their jobs become automated.Acemoglu beieves even though current automation technology may not match the quality of human work, companies will increasingly accept what he calls “so-so automation” in lieu of paying labourers – even if their wages are not substantial. He also warns this could become more of a problem as the technology gets increasingly advanced. And across all labour of all skill levels, increased worker monitoring may affect pay. Veena Dubal, professor of law at the University of California, Irvine, says many companies are already using AI to measure productivity, and subsequently determine wages.Even though current automation technology may not match the quality of human work, companies will increasingly accept “so-so automation” in lieu of paying labourers – even if their wages are not substantialHer research shows these evaluations lead to lower wages and inequality among worker earnings, which she calls “algorithmic wage discrimination – where individual workers make vastly different amounts based on an AI evaluation that the worker themselves doesn't understand”.  She believes if companies invest heavily in productivity-tracking technologies, the problem could get worse.There may be one group, however, that does stand to see their pay rise amid widespread AI integration.Workers at top ranks, says Mark Muro, a senior fellow and policy director for the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, may be more protected from wage fluctuation – especially if they facilitate and decide the processes by which AI is used in their workplaces. For instance, there may be “higher pay for some of those who are managing all of this [AI transformation] or doing the most sophisticated work supported by these tools”.Levelling the playing field? The conversation around AI and salary isn’t just a question of whether wages will rise, stagnate or fall, however. Some experts argue that the rise of workplace AI could help close the wage inequality gap between high- and low-skilled workers, across many demographic groups.David Autor, professor in economics at MIT, argues AI may be able to lower the barrier to entry for highly skilled positions by eliminating the need for a traditional, elite higher education usually required for a top role. With AI, a wide variety of workers can gain specialised expertise faster and more widely – in a sense, roles that were once gatekept may be increasingly less so.Getty ImagesAmong the workers concerned about reduced earning potential and fewer hours are entertainment writers, who are currently on strike (Credit: Getty Images)“AI could create a scenario that reduces the scarcity of high-level expertise,” says Autor. As more workers from a variety of backgrounds work with AI to quickly gain the high-level skills usually reserved for specialised experts with elite backgrounds, “it would open the door for non-traditional candidates, particular those without a four-year degree”. He continues: “If the demand for highly specialised knowledge remains elastic” – for instance, in industries such as engineering, medicine, computer science and law – “that would mean more jobs for non-traditional candidates who, assisted by AI, would be able work at a high level of expertise. It could level the playing field.”In this scenario, it’s possible the experts who were once scarce might see a dip in their wages as they see more competition in the labour market. However, it may be more likely that across industries, more workers – and a more diverse pool at that – would receive a higher salary than they might currently be making in lower skilled jobs that don’t require a college degree.Organisation and advocation Muro says this may be a challenging period for every worker, as the technology is still developing.MIT’s Acemoglu emphasises the outcomes for debates around worker pay and other AI-related workplace issues will largely depend on who is making the decisions about how the technology is developed and deployed, and what subsequent worker protections may follow.Workers may have a part to play, says Dubal. To help drive these decisions in a human-favourable direction, she suggests workplace organisation and policy advocation may help workers keep compensation stable and protect their earning potential. For instance, if workers can “sit at the table with their employers and regulators”, they can help companies understand the intrinsic value of human labour. She points to European workers advocating “for laws that limit the use of AI in certain contexts, like the AI act that's being developed”.For now, it’s not clear which type of labourers will find their pay most affected by AI – after all, some experts have said highly skilled workers are just as vulnerable to automation as their lower-skilled counterparts. But, says Muro, “nobody gets off scot-free here”.Additional reporting by Leah CarrollHow we workFeaturesArtificial intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Getty Images/fStoppart ofThe rise of artificial intelligence, explainedsee all  Rani Molla is a senior correspondent at Vox and has been focusing her reporting on the future of work. She has covered business and technology for more than a decade — often in charts — including at Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.If AI is coming for our jobs, many Americans are hoping to get out in front of it. Regular people are using AI at work, and tech workers are rebranding themselves as AI experts. And those in leadership are vying for the hottest new job title: head of AI. Outside of tech, the head of AI position was mostly nonexistent a few years ago, but now people are taking on that title — or at least its duties — at everywhere from Amazon to Visa to Coca-Cola. In the US, the number of people in AI leadership roles has grown threefold in the past five years, according to data from LinkedIn, bucking the downward trend in tech hiring overall. And while the head of AI job description varies widely by company, the hope is that those who end up with this new responsibility will do everything from incorporating AI into businesses’ products to getting employees up to speed on how to use AI in their jobs. Companies want the new role to keep them at the forefront of their industries amid AI disruption, or at least keep them from being left behind. “This is the biggest deal of the decade, and it’s ridiculously overhyped,” said Peter Krensky, a director and analyst at Gartner who specializes in AI talent management.

AI is one of the few areas where companies are actively spending money, since they see it as the inevitable future and as a way to improve their bottom line. At the same time, the parameters of the head of AI job — and even AI itself — aren’t very clear, and the pivot to the position can seem opportunistic. Remember Shingy, AOL’s Digital Prophet? The thing is that while everyone seems to agree that companies need AI stewards, the nature of new technology means many are uncertain as to what that stewardship means in practice. Furthermore, we’re not sure about who exactly should become the new stewards: the people who have been working on AI for years or those who have been introduced to AI by the latest crop of consumer products and understand how the rest of us use it. We’re also not certain just how big of a disruption AI will be and how fast that disruption will happen.Those are just some of the reasons companies are hiring heads of AI. And if they don’t already have a head of AI, most big companies will have one soon.“If I were talking to a CEO a year ago, and I was like, ‘You’d be a fool not to have a head of AI.’ They’d be like, ‘Come on, give me a break,’” said Krensky. “And now they’re like, ‘I know, that’s why I have one.’” Krensky estimates that currently about a quarter of Fortune 2000 companies have dedicated AI leadership at the VP level or above. He expects it to be about 80 percent a year from now. While the position will be more commonplace at bigger companies — especially those in banking, tech, and manufacturing — he’s also seeing it crop up at midsize organizations and in government agencies. Typically, the person taking what Kensky calls a “cool and sexy” job title — one that he says is often a “hat, not a role” — comes from an existing technology leadership position like chief data officer or chief information officer. But the accessible nature of generative AI tools and their potential use across industries and positions has meant that people in nontech roles like business and marketing are also donning the mantle.And because AI is supposed to be more transformational and more readily profitable than tech fads like Web3, experts think the head of AI is also going to stick.“This is going to be a role that will stay on for a while. It’s not a transitional role,” said Beena Ammanath, executive director of the Deloitte AI Institute. “It’s absolutely crucial.”Just what any given head of AI does varies, especially depending on the type of company. Generally, that breaks down into heads of AI at digital companies working to incorporate the technology into their products, while at nontech companies that means figuring out where and how to use existing AI technology to improve their business models, Ammanath said. Everyone, it seems, is trying to get the rest of their company to start using AI.Mike Haley, SVP of research at Autodesk, says he’s the company’s de facto head of AI, having guided the architecture and engineering software company’s AI strategy for more than a decade. In addition to steering AI usage within the company, Haley is invested in putting AI to use in Autodesk’s products in order to “dissolve the interface” between users and the software. That means AI could help people use “natural methods of expression” like English or a pencil drawing, for example, to create detailed blueprints. “Suddenly this complex tool that requires all sorts of learning and parameterization becomes way more accessible to more people,” explained Haley, who has a background in computer science and applied math. Bali D.R., head of AI and automation at IT services consulting firm Infosys, is helping clients leverage AI while also trying to use it to “amplify human potential” across Infosys, from recruitment to sales to software development.“All parts of the value chain, we are seeing how we can actually make it better, faster, cheaper,” says D.R., who moved to the AI role from another management role, and who started his career at the company 30 years ago in software development.FICO chief analytics officer Scott Zoldi has been leading the data analytics company’s AI efforts for the past seven years, although without the “buzzy” head of AI title. He’s mainly focused on incorporating AI into the company’s products, including using consumer spending patterns to help detect credit fraud or when a customer is falling for a scam. He also spends a lot of time thinking about how AI can be used responsibly so as not to run afoul of regulatory bodies, corporate governance, or consumers by, for example, using AI that’s more likely to flag a protected group of people for committing fraud.Zoldi, who says he’s written more than 100 AI patents, thinks the “head of AI” position should go to someone with a technology background. “You really have to be an expert or you’re potentially going to be setting up the organization for failures down the road because it’s very complicated,” Zoldi, who views the position as a sort of watchdog, like a chief of security. While Gartner’s Krensky estimates about 80 percent of AI leadership comes from a tech background, another 20 percent, of course, does not. That’s the case with Coca-Cola’s global head of generative AI, Pratik Thakar, who previously led the company’s global creative strategy.Thakar has been using AI to streamline and amplify the company’s advertising products. That included recently using AI to make roughly 15 percent of a commercial, which sliced the production time from a year down to two months. Conor Grennan, a dean at NYU’s Stern business school, who recently took on the additional title of head of generative AI, sees the title as more of an initiative and thinks of it as akin to a chief learning officer or chief productivity officer. In the position, he pushes people across NYU, from students to professors to administrators and recruiters, to use AI to become more efficient and better at their tasks.Grennan, who has an MBA and had previously studied English and politics, thinks it’s actually better for many organizations if their AI leadership doesn’t come from a tech background so that the person is better able to explain its benefits to a wider audience of mere mortals.“You don’t need to know the software running your iPhone, just order an Uber,” Grennan said. Instead, what’s important for the role, he says, is creativity with language and breadth.“They need to be an excellent communicator, they need to have a view of the entire firm, at least at the 30,000-foot view. And also it has to be somebody who really understands what generative AI can do,” Grennan said. “You don’t capture everything by putting it in the tech department.”Regardless of where the head of AI sits within an organization, the fact remains that it’s a new frontier that will likely change a lot as the technology and our understanding of it develop. And like with any new technology, there’s going to be a mix of genuine innovation and genuine swindling.AI is happening, and it will be a very big deal. But its full effects — and exactly what those are — will roll out over many years, so we may have time to figure things out.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

Like venture capitalists and enterprise startups—which we explored in parts one and two of this series—legacy companies are examining how the latest advances in AI might change the way we work in the future.As ChatGPT began to gain traction in February, AT&T’s team of around 300 data scientists and developers began talking to vendors, poring over blogs and forums, and experimenting to determine how this emerging form of conversational AI might help serve the wireless carrier’s business interests, according to AT&T Chief Data Officer Andy Markus.Months later, the company rolled out its own office-wide version of ChatGPT, dubbed Ask AT&T, designed to draw from internal files to answer employee questions. Markus, citing internal tests, said large language models (LLMs) have helped the company’s programmers complete coding tasks around 20% to 50% faster than they had previously. It’s also being used for tasks like translating documentation across different languages.AT&T is far from the only legacy company with a story like this. Businesses across almost every sector have worked with perhaps uncharacteristic speed to deploy the latest AI advances to their workforces. But hurdles like inaccuracy of generated information, data security, and disorganized internal databases have also limited these efforts.“[ChatGPT] knows generally about the world; it doesn’t know about AT&T, internal, or for that matter, any other company…so you have to teach it that stuff—you almost have to become a librarian for how you’re organizing that internal content,” Markus said. “The good thing is we can try to not commit some of the sins of the past, where we have multiple copies of data in different places.”More StoriesAISalesforce’s principal AI ethicist on the state of AI regulation worldwideConnectivityNew survey reveals widespread concern over online data practices Connectivity3 takeaways from the AT&T metadata breachMeeting employees where they arePart of the reasoning behind Ask AT&T was to get ahead of where employees were already headed. Even before Samsung notably banned its employees from using generative AI applications like ChatGPT at work, Markus said he figured AT&T’s employees would inevitably tap the apps, so his team decided to work with Microsoft to create a more secure, non-public alternative.“[ChatGPT] is such a great productivity [tool]; odds are people are going to start sharing information as employees—they’re going to have AT&T documents pasting and code copying. And we didn’t want that stuff to get out there in the public, per se,” Markus said. “So that’s kind of why we did it.”Markus said the key to cutting down on hallucinations has been to direct Ask AT&T to always include citations that show where it generated its answer from and prompt it to admit when it doesn’t have an answer. “You just have to tell it, ‘If you don’t really know, say you don’t know.’ That helps a lot,” Markus said.Keep up with the innovative tech transforming businessTech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech.SubscribeThe company’s next step is to roll out a generative AI-powered chatbot to help with customer service, something it has been A/B testing with a certain percentage of customers, Markus said.Overhyped in the near termAt enterprise management platform Workday, Chief Technology Officer Jim Stratton said the company has been similarly evaluating use cases both within Workday and for its clients.Use cases related to content creation and summarization will have easy applications in the near term, according to Stratton. The company is looking at ways it might be able to integrate generative AI to help with tasks like writing job descriptions and performance reviews, for instance.“Allowing people not to start with a clean sheet of paper, get them 80% of the way there and then provide them with tools to help them edit to get to the good finished product that they want,” Stratton told Tech Brew. “I think those are relatively low-hanging-fruit use cases that also provide a lot of value to the end users.”Stratton said another use case is employing LLMs as a text interface tool for navigating complex processes.“Just thinking about natural language interfaces to help you navigate through complex tasks or complex applications—that’s certainly an area that we’re investigating now that I think will have substantial dividends in terms of the usability of fairly complex applications,” Stratton said.Stratton said the technology is likely overhyped at the moment—these immediate use cases might not be as transformative as some might claim—but underhyped in the long term, as new applications that haven’t been imagined yet become possible as AI evolves.Jayesh Govindarajan, SVP of AI and machine learning at Salesforce, told Tech Brew that the enterprise giant is betting on generative AI ultimately transforming the way that offices work; the company is aiming to build generative AI tools that serve each role in a business.“Generative AI will transform how we work. What you’re starting to see is Salesforce, taking the view that we want to have an assistant for every persona that we serve today,” Govindarajan said. “What this means for the workforce is it takes away the mundane from the day-to-day.”CopyYou might also like...AISalesforce’s principal AI ethicist on the state of AI regulation worldwidePatrick Kulp / 07.18.2024ConnectivityNew survey reveals widespread concern over online data practices Kelcee Griffis / 07.18.2024Connectivity3 takeaways from the AT&T metadata breachKelcee Griffis / 07.17.2024Keep up with the innovative tech transforming businessTech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech.Try it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Simulation Work Together
July 17, 2023


July 17, 2023 — As artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and simulation revolutionize the way humans process and predict information, Ansys Chief Technology Officer Dr. Prith Banerjee explains how better, faster decisions are made possible when these transformational sciences align.

Q: How are AI, ML, and simulation related?
Dr. Prith Banerjee: AI/ML and simulation are distinct technologies that, when intersected, complement each other in some really powerful ways.
Dr. Prith Banerjee is chief technology officer at Ansys.
First, there’s AI, which creates systems that mimic human behavior that are based on rules. ML is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn the rules automatically based on training data. And then there’s simulation, which analyzes real-world products and systems through virtual models.
While they’re independent concepts, they’re continuously feeding each other. Simulations use AI and ML techniques to run models faster and easier. In turn, AI and ML use simulation to create synthetic data from a variety of industries and applications.
Q: How do AI/ML and simulation work together?
Banerjee: In the last 50 years, we’ve been using simulation to accelerate product innovation. At the same time, our partners in the AI/ML communities have been working to make technology as smart as the human brain.
Today, AI/ML is being used to make simulations faster and easier to run, while at the same time, simulation is providing AI with accurate synthetic data to make intelligent systems smarter.
When these technologies work together, they make visionary ideas possible and accessible to all.

Q: How has AI/ML influenced the evolution of simulation?
Banerjee: The most fundamental role of simulation is to make better decisions faster, and both AI and ML are critical enablers of speed. AI/ML can enable a designer to start with a high-level specification, auto-generate 10,000 design options, and then rapidly evaluate which options are the best.
Different AI/ML approaches, including bottom-up methods, top-down methods, reduced-order models (ROMs), and large language models (LLMs), enable our solvers to perform faster, more accurate predictive analysis.
LLMs such as ChatGPT can be especially beneficial in making solvers even easier to use. For example, if one of our engineers wanted to run a simulation about an electric car, they would first have to translate the specifications for different systems (e.g., battery, motor, charger, etc.) which requires a lot of time and expertise.
But with LLMs, anyone could write an English language statement that simply states the desired outcome, such as: “Design an electric car with a 2,000-mile range that goes from 0 to 60 mph in one second.” The simulation would automatically generate a multitude of solutions for the entire car, some of which the human mind might never have considered.
AI can also improve the way we write our code. When a developer needs to upgrade our software, AI can respond with the best code snippet for solving the problem. This improves developer productivity and also enhances our customer service. By reviewing the data from thousands of customer service interactions, virtual agents can quickly provide first-level support, clearing the way for our experts to apply their minds to more atypical questions.
Q: With AI/ML integrating billions of sources, how do you ensure accuracy?
Banerjee: When a human designer takes a spec of a car, they use a lot of themselves to build it — not just their knowledge, but also their ability to reason.
When an AI models a car, it will aggregate references from a variety of sources, some of which may be unreliable, or competitors, or legally protected properties. This is part of why human monitoring and techniques like explainable AI are so important.
At Ansys, we use our own intellectual property (IP) and apply the ChatGPT engine against the database we’ve built over 50 years — things we learned through thousands of interactions between our customers and our Ansys Customer Excellence (ACE) team. To ensure confidence and accuracy, we rely on our own sources.
Q: What’s next for AI/ML and simulation?
Banerjee: When Ford started building vehicles, the manufacturing technology at the time dictated what structures they could use — such as metal forming and injection molding like rectangles and cylinders. So, everything looked the same. The idea of making a car that looks like a bird would have been difficult to imagine. But now, with generative design and additive manufacturing, it is possible to build really complex objects.
Today, Ansys is working on a ML platform where you can specify the requirements of a very complex product. The result will be the ability to generate thousands of new ideas that the human designer can’t even imagine. All these designs can be rapidly evaluated using simulation, with the best option being chosen by the human designer. When simulation and AI/ML work together, so much more is possible.

At an executive leadership meeting earlier this year, we devoted a block of time to discussing ChatGPT. Leaders from our AI team demonstrated a range of capabilities, including its ability to write marketing content, generate computer code, engage in customer support dialog, and as a grand finale, to answer a very complex accounting question. At the end, our young, high achieving global corporate controller gasped “I’m going to be replaced by AI!” To which, another of our leaders, known for his logic and dry wit, responded “no, you’re going to be replaced by someone who uses AI better than you do.” That’s the question of the day. Will ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI replace entire industries, like accounting, or will they, as we like to say at Sage “elevate human work?”
To be clear, the accounting industry is already using AI extensively and to great effect. AI that can read and categorize data from business documents is entering the mainstream. Accountants are using AI to automate financial modelling and forecasting. And as a corollary to all this automation, accountants are relying on AI to identify anomalous transactions – identifying accounting errors, revealing changes in business performance, and even catching fraud.
So, what makes generative AI different? First, a little explainer. Generative AI refers to a category of artificial intelligence that can create new content or outcomes, often based on patterns or structures it has learned from existing data. This includes generating text, images, music, and even complex designs. GPT, the foundation for ChatGPT, is a form of generative AI called a Large Language Model (LLM). LLMs are machine learning models designed to understand, interpret, and generate human-like text. These models learn patterns and structures in language from massive volumes of text data, enabling them to complete prompts, answer queries, or even create entire articles in a remarkably human-like manner.
Many of you have already had your magic moment with ChatGPT or one of the other new chatbots where you realized AI has leapt forward. Mine was a very simple interaction, but the implications hit me like a bolt of lightning. I told ChatGPT a dad joke: A skeleton walks into a bar and says to the bartender, “I’ll have a beer and a mop.” Many humans don’t get this joke right away, but ChatGPT quickly responded, “Haha, that’s a good one! The joke plays on the fact that a skeleton, being made of bones with no organs or tissues, would not be able to consume the beer like a living person. Instead, the beer would simply flow through its bones and make a mess on the floor, hence the need for a mop.” After picking my jaw up from off the floor, I surmised OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, had solved two big AI limitations – an understanding of the world and the ability to reason. Whether these abilities are real or imagined is irrelevant – AI is now able to perform complex tasks with minimal instruction.
Research conducted by OpenAI in partnership with the University of Pennsylvania reveals around 80% of the workforce will have at least 10% of their work tasks impacted and the remaining 20% will have at least 50% impacted. Not surprisingly, accountants, auditors, and tax preparers are among the jobs expected to be most impacted. The research generated a lot of headlines. My favorite was a bit cheeky – “Stonemasons Should be Fine in the Brave New World"". Apparently, journalists, who are also among the jobs expected to be most impacted, use sarcasm as a natural defense mechanism.
What does all this mean for the accounting industry? Let’s start with a massive disclaimer: generative AI is moving fast and will be profoundly disruptive. I believe generative AI is as transformational as the Internet or the smart phone but is racing through the adoption curve faster than any technology we’ve ever seen. ChatGPT reached a million users in five days. It reached 100M users in two months. In the span of six months, its capability, as measured by performance on the Bar exam, improved from performing in the bottom 10% to performing in the top 10%. It is impossible to predict how this will play out, but I can give you a few likely scenarios.
AI will progress from automating tasks to automating entire workflows. I mentioned how we’re able to use AI today to read data from an invoice, categorize the expenses, and identify problems like over-billing. Today, that AI is deployed within strictly defined workflows where pre-configured rules orchestrate activity. With LLMs, we’ll be able to hand the orchestration off to “AI Agents” that can operate autonomously. These agents could own and operate a workflow with the same type of instructions you might give to an accountant: “don’t let the cash balance fall below X; make sure to pay vendors of type Y early; let me know if you see any bills with unusually large amounts.”
Digital Assistants will change the way we interact with technology. Today’s business applications guide user interaction through pre-defined menus, carefully designed data entry forms, lists for sorting and filtering records, and “canned” reports or dashboards for data analysis. These UIs are both limiting and hard to learn. LLMs promise to replace all this with simple human language interaction. Imagine working within a spreadsheet and asking a digital assistant to gather the accounting data you need to analyze. Imagine reviewing and approving purchase orders from within Teams. Tools like Excel and Teams are familiar and suited to the job to be done, enabling more accessible “serf-serve” capabilities that reduce dependency on the accounting team. Further, imagine LLMs integrated with enterprise systems enabling employees within the business to get their own answers or do their own data analysis on enterprise data via a simple chat interface. In fact, as chat interfaces become the norm, employees won’t settle for today’s crude tools.
AI will handle routine interactions with customers and vendors.  Most emails an accounting team receive fall into a small set of repetitive interactions. For instance, customers ask for tax information, ask for their latest statement, or remit payment information; vendors send invoices, ask when to expect payment, and provide compliance details. LLMs are exceptionally good at understanding the intent of these emails, determining the steps required to respond (i.e., send an invoice for processing or get an invoice from the accounting system for a customer), and generating a response email if called for.
AI will be an expert resource. Accountants will have access to an expert resource for understanding and applying accounting standards. What’s the correct accounting treatment for a complex sales contract? What does tax law say about capital asset write-offs? LLMs are also helpful data analysts. Give an LLM access to balance sheet data for the last 24 months and ask it to identify the most significant trends. Give it access to detailed ledger data and ask it to forecast future cash flow. More generally, AI will make every knowledge worker more productive. A few paragraphs ago, I was really struggling to write a concise, understandable definition for generative AI and LLMs, so I asked ChatGPT for help. Its suggestion wasn’t perfect, but it gave me something to work with and unblocked the writing process.
Of course, LLMs come with well-known risks. They’re known to hallucinate, where their responses are articulate, well-reasoned, and entirely make-believe. They can be tricked into misbehaving. There are questions about data privacy. They’ve introduced a long list of legal questions over both the content used to train the models as well as the ownership of content the models create. The technology is outpacing regulation. The situation could call for a moratorium on their use, but the genie is already out of the bottle. We need the accounting industry to guide businesses on how to leverage AI safely and effectively.
I went to New York City earlier this year to visit my friends at the AICPA. I wanted to look into the whites of their eyes for signs of fear. I saw the opposite – where most see a threat, they see opportunity. We aligned together on two overarching opportunities with generative AI: 1) solving the industry’s labor shortage, and 2) enabling accountants to deliver more strategic value. As we further discussed the risks and challenges posed by generative AI, we discovered a third opportunity I believe to be greater than the first two. As we delegate more and more tasks to technology, especially to technology that can be unpredictable, the value of human accountability will increase.
Solving the industry’s labor shortage. It’s no secret the accounting industry faces a labor shortage. Bloomberg Tax calculates that the number of accountants and auditors employed fell by 17% between 2019 and 2021. University enrollment in accounting courses fell by four percent between 2016 and 2019. According to Deloitte & Touche LLP, 82.4% of hiring managers for accounting and financial positions in public companies believe that recruitment is a “big challenge.” We can argue over how to attract more people to accounting careers, but a better answer may be to simply make accountants more productive. AI is particularly well suited to automating repetitive tasks like data entry and reconciliation. Sage customers using our AI powered invoice processing are reporting a 2X – 3X improvement in productivity, creating more capacity within their accounting teams. And this automation has a happy side-effect – automating low value, repetitive work may make an accounting career more attractive.
Enabling accountants to deliver more strategic value. In the list of “jobs to be done” by accountants, there’s no negotiating over compliance related work. The accounting team can’t postpone an audit to make time to evaluate a potential acquisition. There’s no give on tax filing deadlines. Any time and resources devoted to strategic work can only follow the required work. Automating these non-negotiables naturally frees time for more strategically valuable work. Equip accountants with LLMs, and not only will they have more time for this work, but they’ll also have an invaluable, hyper efficient research assistant that can analyze massive amounts of information and structure coherent, professional presentations of the results.
The value of human accountability. We have a maxim at Sage – we should match our investments in automation with equivalent investments in trust. Human users will only transition their work to technology if they trust the technology to do the job safely and competently. Not to be too dramatic here, but while there’s an obvious benefit to automating compliance work, the risks of non-compliance are ruined careers, or worse. We can transition the work to technology, but accountability will always reside with humans. Humans sign audit statements – not AI.
The accounting industry’s greatest contribution to society is confidence in our markets. There are various ways to put a price on that confidence. For example, the total revenue in audit fees for the global big four accounting firms in 2021 was $271B. I believe AI will drive an exponential increase in this value, in part because AI increases risk, but more importantly because a more efficient and productive accounting industry will lead to more efficient and productive markets.
Getting back to our question of the day, I’m quite optimistic. We have the opportunity with generative AI to not only elevate human work, but also to elevate the entire accounting industry. Yes, we should proceed with caution, but we should also proceed with pace and determination. The winners will be the ones who use AI better than anyone else.

All the talk about artificial intelligence these days seems to be around the jobs it could replace. But new generative AI tools might help you find one, too.


New features or tools from LinkedIn, Adzuna and Rezi claim to not only strengthen what you’re submitting in a job application, but help you make career decisions or even quit.

“AI’s being used pretty much at every step” of the career-planning process, says James Neave, head of data science at job search platform Adzuna. With the rise of technologies such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard creating an AI arms race, more career-related tools are adding AI features to their products. About half (46%) of the 2,153 job seekers surveyed by Resume Builder said they are using ChatGPT to write their resumes or cover letters.

Nitzan Pelman, founder and CEO of nonprofit Climb Hire, a platform that helps workers learn new skills and find new careers, says AI tools can be particularly useful for lower-skilled workers. “A clerk at Trader Joe’s doesn’t always know what their skills are,” Pelman says. “If they know how to tell ChatGPT about what they do, it can help them translate those things into skills” that could help them break into white-collar jobs, she says.

But some hiring managers and companies aren’t welcoming the practice. AI users should still assess the results of AI-generated content and tools, Pelman says. “You have to use your own critical thinking to then figure out: is this solid or not?” Here, a rundown of the latest offerings:
LinkedIn: AI-Powered Software To Help Draft Messages To Hiring Managers
Reaching out to hiring managers can be daunting. What should your message say? Starting in May, LinkedIn began using generative AI to help premium subscribers draft personalized messages when messaging on LinkedIn with hiring managers.

According to a post by Ora Levit, senior director of product management and head of core growth, the new feature is in addition to the job platform’s AI-powered writing tools, which help users enhance their profiles.
“Customization is still important,” Levit writes, “so take the time to review and edit the draft to make it your own and convey your voice, then send onwards to the hiring manager, getting one step closer to your next opportunity.”
NAV: ‘A Credit Score For Your Career’ 
Founded by husband-and-wife duo Heather and Howard Matalon in June, NAV uses generative AI and its algorithms to give your career or job offers a score. Users complete NAV’s online evaluation to receive the score and gain feedback on whether it’s time to leave or not.
Think of it as a credit score for how well you’re climbing the ladder, Howard Matalon says. “This is about getting the kind of advice that you would need from a human resources perspective on critical areas about your career trajectory.”
To keep things personalized, he says NAV also offers human career coaches to help users analyze their results and provide advice.
Adzuna: Let AI Help You Interview Prep
In June, the job search platform launched Prepper, an interview readiness tool that uses AI to generate questions and feedback to your responses. In its first 10 days, the tool reached more than 2,000 users per day. Adzuna is not new to AI; its resume assessment tool has used a natural language processing model since 2014.
To use Prepper, job seekers provide the large language model with the job description they’re interviewing for, and Prepper will generate company- and job-specific interview questions. Users type their responses, and the tool provides feedback on those answers, suggesting responses. (Adzuna’s Neave says the company is planning to expand its capabilities so users can answer interview questions with just their voice.)
“It acts as a confidence booster,” Neave says, which could help with pre-interview anxieties.
Cover Letter Copilot: A Free Service For A Dreaded Task
No one likes writing cover letters. Getting a service to write one for you might sound better—but that can often come with a fee.
Ben Broch’s Cover Letter Copilot, which uses generative AI and was launched in early June, is a free service. Broch, whose background is in product management, says users also don’t have to prompt the ChatGPT generator with individual answers to questions. Job hunters can upload their resume and the job description, and the tool will generate a customized cover letter.
But Broch says it serves as just a starting point. “I don't want this to just be ‘hit a button and the AI does everything,’” he says. “It really does need to feel like a copilot where you are in control.”
Rezi: Resignation Letter Generator To Help You Quit
Rezi’s GPT-powered resume builder is a popular choice among job seekers. But its new tool, launched last year, appeals to quitters instead.
The company’s new AI resignation letter builder uses machine learning to create professional, simple memos in a few seconds. All you have to do is enter the basics: company name, job title, last day of work, reason for resigning and your signature.
The tool has already seen more than 315,000 users and offers job-specific templates, such as for product managers, legal secretaries and more.

But this worry isn’t insurmountable.When Jessica’s boss recently asked whether the company she works for should be using artificial intelligence tools, she quietly panicked. As a content marketer, her major responsibilities at the Connecticut, US-based software company are writing and editing – tasks that generative AI software threatens to usurp.But Jessica’s fear isn’t exactly about losing her job.“Writing has always been my thing,” she says. “I wrote stories as a kid. I was an English major, and then a journalist before I got into content marketing. I’ve never done anything else; I don’t really have any other skill set, which is pretty terrifying.”An increasing body of research shows many workers fear artificial intelligence displacing their jobs, especially in creative industries, where tools like Open AI’s ChatGPT have already made sophisticated strides in generative learning. Some recent surveys show the worry is pervasive: workers across different generations and demographic groups report feeling threatened.Yet for Jessica, and others like her, the real threat of AI is a personal – even existential – one. Along with feeling personally out to sea, she worries about her workplace value – that her professional identity will no longer be important. She’s also fearful about what she’ll do – and, ultimately, whom she’ll be – if her job as a writer is eliminated.This, says Mindy Shoss, a professor of organizational psychology at the University of Central Florida, is understandable – and that plenty of people can relate to the feeling. “The crux of a lot of AI anxiety is about identity. Work fulfils many different identity functions,” she says. “Yes, it gives us income, but it also gives us a sense of self-worth and belonging and opportunities to develop new skills, and meaningfulness in life. When our work is threatened, all these other things get threatened with it.”Job threats aside, Shoss says the uncertainty alone is enough to cause concern. “Anxiety comes from the unknown,” she says. “The development of AI is happening so quickly that it’s really hard to keep up with. There’s so much unknown right now, and so much speculation about what AI can do, will do, might do. It’s very understandable and appropriate that people are experiencing some anxiety.”Getty ImagesAs AI will inevitably find its way into many jobs, the more people can learn about how they'll work alongside the technology, the better they may feel (Credit: Getty Images)Tech DecodedFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter. The twice-weekly email decodes the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world. Sign up for free here.This feeling of unease and existential panic can be extremely unnerving – and entirely justified in the current work landscape. But there’s reason to take a breath: as this technology finds its way into the mainstream and continues to evolve, experts say these worries don’t have to take over.Shoss says one of the best ways to handle identity-driven anxiety is to demystify the unknown.In ongoing research, she says, “we’ve found that people who tend to read more and try to learn more and develop more skills around the technology are a little bit less anxious about the impact of robots and AI in the workplace”. The threat can seem less imminent, she explains, once people understand the technology’s shortfalls and the need for human oversight.Jessica has taken this approach herself: ever since that first conversation with her boss, she’s thrown herself headlong into learning everything necessary to become her company’s resident AI expert.“I’ve immersed myself,” she says. “I’ve done a complete 180, from ignoring it out of fear to fully diving in. I need to control the AI narrative at my company, and make sure that I’m in the driver’s seat and I’m telling them what ChatGPT and these other tools can and cannot do.”Jessica feels her job is secure for now. But the technology’s evolution, she says, still feels like a relentless onslaught. Eventually, she believes AI will be able to take over many of the writing and editing tasks that make up much of her current workload. She’s trying to be proactive, working to refine skills that are tougher for AI to mimic and move into a more strategic role ­– and to find a new way to re-frame her identity.To ease identity anxiety, workers also may find it’s helpful to look at what, exactly, AI can do – and what human-led job tasks are still irreplaceable.It may actually be good if AI replaces menial tasks, says Jo Lindsay Walton, a research fellow in arts, climate and technology at the Sussex Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Sussex, UK. He points to tasks like transcription, which will become entirely automated. As this happens, he explains, workers will be able to focus not only on more essential, less robot-replicable, expertise, but also on more meaningful and satisfying work that can make them feel good about themselves.  Plus, adds Walton, it’s worthwhile to remember that today’s workers aren’t the first to experience an existential crisis over automation. Since the Industrial Revolution, people have been threatened by machines promising to usurp their jobs and the things that mean a lot to them personally. “We can learn a lot about our present and future from how people in the past thought about their future,” says Walton. But historically, those threats have been overblown, and humans have always retained an irreplaceable role in the workforce. “The high-level message is that they got it wrong,” he adds, “and we are probably getting it wrong.”How we workFeaturesArtificial intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think my work and future are under a huge question mark.""Artificial Intelligence: the Death of Art?Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)'Real art has personality'While the problems are clear, there are some ways AI tools can be used to benefit artists, according to Cardiff-based animator Harry Hambley, who is the creative force behind internet sensation Ketnipz.""I think for me the biggest thing generative art can solve is tedium,"" he said.""But it can be scary and the internet's already a wild place, and you mix AI in with that… we don't know where it's going to go.""Do I think that my job will ever be sacrificed to AI or AI will do it better than me? I don't know. I hope not.""Harry HambleyArtist Harry Hambley says the biggest problem is we do not know how far AI will goHarry said he thought there was more to art than how it looked.""At the end of the day I think that there's a bigger reason why people are invested in Ketnipz and I don't think it's just the mere aesthetics of it.""I think there's a personality behind it that I don't think someone imitating can really tap into.""'Just keep making art'James Lewis's brush control has made him a hit on TikTokArtist James Lewis, from Cardiff, creates videos of his painting technique for more than seven million followers on TikTok and Instagram. He has yet to find out if his work has been used by the tools, but said because AI has learned from billions of artworks, it would be hard to trace which artists' works have been used in each image.""If there was a way to go back and figure out who inspired this style of image that was generated, I think it would be fair for that artist to receive some sort of compensation,"" he said.James LewisJames Lewis' piece, Kaboom: ""If there was a way figure out who inspired this style of image... it would be fair to receive some sort of compensation""In the meantime he thinks artists should keep being creative.""I do have hope that as much as AI art will develop and it'll get better, but it will never be able to capture that true human essence, that true creativity that we have as people,"" he said.""You will still need your own creative ideas, your own initiative.""Sarah WangArtist Caroline Sinders says she will be exercising her copyright rightsFor artist and human rights researcher Caroline Sinders, it is for AI companies to address the problem.She said: ""Part of the argument we hear from companies is, 'we have so much data, it would be impossible for us to tell, like searching for a needle in a haystack'.""I would like to say, well, that's a 'you' problem, not a 'me' problem. ""I have a copyright on the images and I plan to enact my copyright if my images are used without my consent.""She said she was also worried about the bias that these tools created and how it meant AI art was not reflecting the real world.""Let's say we ask an image generation AI system to generate a doctor assessing care to a family,"" she said.""Most likely that doctor will be generated as male and probably as white, and the parent will probably be generated as female.What is AI and is it dangerous?AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?Can you tell the difference between AI and reality?""And this is not an example I'm randomly making up. There have been tests done by asking these sort of blanket questions without gender being in the text prompt and, more often than not, it's reflecting these stereotypes.""This extends to racial bias and also ableism, said Irene Fubara-Manuel, a lecturer at the University of Sussex.While they said they were excited about the possibilities provided by generative art, issues such as racial and gender biases in some images created were hard to overcome.""I was trying to dye my hair over the summer, and I was just looking up 'people of colour, blonde locks',"" they said.Irene Fubara-Manuel says they noticed bias when searching for images to try out new hairstyles""What I got in response was this regal, I would say, fetishised image of black people. You know, chiselled jaw lines, their skin was iridescent.""It's like, there are black people who are that beautiful, but the images that you see commonly in a lot of AI are very, very fetishised representations of people. ""You would not see people who are plus size, or people who have visible disabilities, for instance.""Artists are now calling on regulators in the UK and worldwide to take more action to protect artists and the industry.Irene said artists were not against AI but, ""the argument is against exploitation"".""But I'm hopeful that it will contribute to human creativity in general, just like how the creation of computers added more to creativity. I'm excited for its contribution,"" they said.Caroline said more regulation of the emerging AI industry in the UK would not ""stifle"" innovation.""It makes things safer and that's why we have certain laws,"" she said.""That's why right now we have seatbelts and airbags for cars and a lot of rules about them. When they were first invented, we didn't have any of that. ""So it's not at all out of step to sort of ask for, or to create, guardrails and protections.""Additional reporting by Lola Mayor.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.Elon Musk announces new AI start-upUK must be more open on use of AI, say campaignersWatch: What threats does AI pose?AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?What is AI and how does it work?CopyrightCardiffArtificial intelligenceArtEmploymentPoland",,,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-66099850,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7C4D/production/_130412813_img_2055.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By automating repetitive tasks, generative AI allows employees to focus on higher-value activities requiring unique skills. Employees should be encouraged to upskill and reskill to work alongside AI systems, envisioning a future where humans and AI collaborate harmoniously for growth and limitless possibilities,"" Lalit Mehta, Co- Founder and CEO, Decimal Technologies said.Generative AI is not about replacing humans but rather augmenting human capabilities and expanding possibilities. There are certain prerequisites to consider when implementing generative AI within organizations. ""First, there’s a need for a strategic approach, where CEOs must define clear objectives and align generative AI initiatives with their overall business strategy. It is crucial to identify use cases that provide tangible value and address specific business challenges. Second is to prioritize data readiness. Generative AI systems require vast amounts of high-quality data for training and fine-tuning. Third, to build a diverse team of experts, including data scientists, domain experts, and creative professionals, is essential to effectively leverage generative AI. CEOs must foster a culture of collaboration and continuous learning to attract and retain top talent. Lastly, implementing generative AI requires adapting existing processes, infrastructure, and workflows. CEOs need to ensure that their organizations are prepared for the changes, both technically and culturally,” Bhuvan Desai - Vice President Client Operations - Uplers said.( Originally published on Jul 17, 2023 )CompareCredit2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026With no annual fee and no interest until nearly 2026, this card is helping Americans pay off debt in record time.CompareCredit|SponsoredSponsoredUndoComfy Men ShoesThe Best Men's Shoes for Walking and Standing All DayComfy Men Shoes|SponsoredSponsoredUndoBarestepThese New Shoes Are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarestep|SponsoredSponsoredUndo

As generative AI gains popularity among organizations, upskilling in this technology becomes critical for HR professionals as the technology can have huge ramifications. Check out the need for upskilling yourself and the best practices to leverage generative AI in HR.
Generative AI is becoming increasingly relevant in the HR industry. In the age of generative AI, HR professionals must upgrade their skills to deal with its ramifications successfully. They must know the principles underlying generative AI and its possible advantages and drawbacks to make wise choices. They should learn how to use AI tools to hire and train employees. To ensure ethical and objective hiring and talent management procedures, they must also develop the critical thinking abilities necessary to assess and analyze AI-generated information.
Generative AI has several applications in human resources. It may streamline and improve HR operations by automating applicant sourcing and resume screening, developing customized employee training programs, producing performance evaluation reports, and facilitating employee engagement using AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants. MarketResearch.Biz predicts that by 2032, the market for generative AI in HR will have increased to more than USD 1669.3 million, with a CAGR of 15.40%Opens a new window  between 2023 and 2032. This exemplifies the potential utility of generation AI for the development of HR.
Impact of Generative AI on HR Processes
Generative AI can revolutionize HR processes by automating tasks, enhancing decision-making, and improving employee experiences. It benefits us in several ways, as mentioned earlier. According to recent Stanford and MIT studiesOpens a new window , chatbots and other AI tools increased worker productivity at one IT company by 14%.
By automating applicant sourcing and resume screening, generative AI transforms recruiting, reducing time-consuming manual labor and increasing productivity. It can produce simulations and learning resources specifically tailored to the employee. AI-powered analytics are useful for performance evaluation, and AI-powered chatbots can help employees feel more engaged. The main issues include biases in generated material and ethical considerations, and human monitoring is required to enable ethical and responsible AI adoption.
Jane Funk, PHR, SHRM-CP, vice president of people at Armory, says, “As HR professionals, we cannot accurately predict the longstanding impact of generative AI on HR tech. However, we can proactively adopt these solutions to gauge their effectiveness in daily workflows and ensure our operations remain innovative. In other words, HR practitioners who focus on maturing their generative AI capabilities facilitate long-term success in their departments, regardless of how the market stabilizes. If you’re overwhelmed by the possibilities of generative AI, assess gaps in your current HR plan and brainstorm ways to address those issues using AI. For example, can you rely on large language models (LLMs) like Jasper or ChatGPT to generate emails, job postings, and other communication materials? Who hasn’t been stuck when starting a job description or finding the right tone for the intended audience when crafting a message? AI can assist with this persistent problem. Seasoned HR professionals should always review and revise AI-generated materials — nonetheless, they’re a powerful tool for reducing workplace toil and improving communication speed.” 
Upskilling HR Professionals for the Generative AI Era
HR professionals must build abilities in AI concepts, data analysis, and interpretation to make the most of generative AI. Further, they should emphasize critical thinking to analyze and comprehend AI-generated outputs, ensure ethical practices, and maintain a human-centric approach in HR decision-making and talent management. 
HR professionals can improve their technology skills by taking online courses, attending workshops, and working on hands-on projects. Cultivating data literacy involves learning data analysis techniques and using data visualization tools. Improving ethical decision-making necessitates remaining current on AI ethics and developing ethical principles. Creating collaborative alliances entails networking with IT professionals and working together on AI initiatives.
Talking exclusively to Spiceworks, Vivian Jiang, HR Business Partner at hireEZ, says, “Generative AI tools can help HR pros make the most use of their limited time by making administrative tasks more efficient and intensive work more effective. For example, I like using text generators to quickly create first drafts of new policies to edit them, which saves me precious time. Or, in domains like hiring and recruiting, AI can help streamline hiring processes by instantaneously generating personalized candidate outreach messages or streamline the recruiting process by analyzing resumes and social media profiles. HR pros that learn to use these tools now will be ahead of the game when generative AI is natively embedded in every system we use.”
Microsoft recently unveiledOpens a new window  the AI Skills Initiative to assist individuals and groups worldwide learn to harness AI’s power. A new grant challenge with data.org is open to businesses to develop innovative strategies for training, upskilling, and reskilling workers in generative AI as part of the new project, a component of Microsoft’s Skills for Jobs program.

Best Practices to Leverage Generative AI in HR
As per Funk, generative AI possesses powerful research capabilities. Beyond expediting and improving daily processes, these solutions can aid in strategic planning by providing a sounding board for best practices and current talent trends. HR leaders looking to simplify complex people processes, such as drafting a long-term scaling and hiring strategy, could look to LLMs as an additional tool in their tech stack for statistics and insights into other organizations’ systems and leaders’ decision-making processes. This information can provide incredible context as part of strategic decision-making.
When implementing generative AI in HR processes, HR professionals should:

Clearly define objectives and identify areas where AI can add value.
Ensure data privacy and security.
Monitor and evaluate AI-generated outputs for biases and ensure fairness.
Maintain a balance between automation and human involvement.
Provide transparency and clear communication to employees about AI integration.

When implementing generative AI, HR professionals must take ethical issues into mind. Biases must be addressed, transparency must be maintained, and fairness must be upheld as ethical considerations. Protection of employee data and adherence to rules are necessary for data privacy. Automation and human interaction must coexist harmoniously to preserve empathy and human judgment. Continuous learning and adaptation are crucial to keep current with AI developments and maximize their application in HR operations.
Jiang says, “AI can be a valuable tool in analyzing talent pools and competitors. HR professionals can gain insights into potential candidates’ skills, qualifications, and experiences by utilizing AI-powered algorithms and data analysis techniques. AI can help identify patterns, trends, and correlations in large volumes of data, providing HR professionals with a more comprehensive understanding of the talent landscape. Furthermore, AI can help HR professionals stay informed about their competitors’ talent strategies. By monitoring public information, social media profiles, and job postings, AI can provide insights into the talent acquisition efforts of other organizations. This knowledge can be invaluable for understanding market trends, identifying potential threats, and adapting recruitment strategies accordingly.”
Oracle recently addedOpens a new window  generative AI features to its human resources software, allowing it to assist in drafting job descriptions and employee performance goals. The AI assistant will generate draft text that needs to be approved by humans, with further plans to expand its capabilities.

Up until now, employers have been able to use artificial intelligence (AI)-powered hiring and promotional tools without worry about compliance with AI-specific laws. On July 5, 2023, that changed. New York City passed Local Law 144, legislation restricting employers’ use of artificial intelligence-driven employment tools.
Local Law 144 prohibits employers from using an automated employment decision tool (“AEDT”)[1] in hiring, promotion, and other employment decisions, unless the employer first ensures that the tool has been audited for bias within the preceding year. These AI-powered tools—ranging from programs that screen resumes for qualifications to those that assign scores to candidates based on mannerisms and responses in video interviews—are increasingly used by employers. However, AEDTs have generated controversy due to the potential for bias. Now, New York City employers are required to independently audit their AEDT systems for bias and publish the results on their company websites, or face fines. Local Law 144 also requires employers to provide job candidates with notice about the use of an AEDT system and offer them an opportunity to opt out. Employers found in violation of Local Law 144 face a $500 fine on the first offense and a $1,500 fine on each subsequent one. 
New York City Local Law 144 comes amid a global push to regulate the use of AI and may provide a model for auditing rules that can be adopted in other jurisdictions. However, it does not provide any legal threshold for when AI-based hiring or recruiting should be considered biased or to have a disparate impact on protected groups. The EEOC, which has publicized its intent to review AEDTs with scrutiny, has provided limited endorsement for a “rule of thumb,” which states that if a hiring test has a selection rate of less than 80% for a protected group, compared to others, then such a gap likely indicates bias.[2]
Notably, other states and jurisdictions have also enacted AI-based legislation:


In 2020, Illinois enacted the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, 820 ILCS 42, to govern the use of AI to assess video interviewees for jobs. Employers recruiting in Illinois must (1) obtain consent from applicants before using AI, after explaining how the AI works and its evaluation standards; and (2) ensure proper control of video recordings and deletion upon request. Unlike New York City’s law, however, the Illinois law does not include civil penalties.




Maryland passed an AI-employment law in 2020, B. 1202, which prohibits employers from using facial recognition technology during an interview for employment without consent. Consent requires a signed waiver that states: (1) the applicant’s name; (2) the date of the interview; (3) that the applicant consents to the use of facial recognition; and (4) confirmation that the applicant read the consent waiver. H.B. 1202 does not include a specific penalty or fine.




Many states are creating councils to oversee AI and new regulations, including Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Vermont and Washington with pending legislation to create similar entities in many more states.




On May 24, 2022, Vermont created the Artificial Intelligence Commission to support the ethical use and development of artificial intelligence in the state, relating to the use and oversight of artificial intelligence in state government. VT H.B. 410.




Similar to Vermont, Colorado passed CO S.B. 113, which created a task force for consideration of facial recognition services. This task force is directed to, among other issues, recommend whether the scope of the task force should be expanded to include consideration of artificial intelligence.


Since 2018, states have ramped up legislation directly related to artificial intelligence and the predicted advances in technology. Local Law 144 is the most comprehensive regulation to date of the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in human resources. But it is certainly not the first piece of legislation on the books governing the use of AI in the workplace. Other jurisdictions are expected to quickly follow suit given the recent media attention to ChatGPT and other AI applications. Employers that use automated decision-making for hiring and promotional decisions should start considering now whether they need to modify these tools to ensure that they do not contain bias.

Also reprinted on Law.com.
With the advent of readily accessible artificial intelligence (AI) and the breakthrough of generative AI (GAI) programs such as ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, GAI is now a staple in all facets of business. GAI programs can generate new texts, images, and content (outputs) based on textual prompts by a user (inputs). Whether prompted to write a corporate slogan, create music, generate works of art and advertisements, or summarize a book – GAI can do it all. However, its increasing popularity means that users of GAI programs face substantial intellectual property risks – particularly when businesses use GAI for marketing and other public-facing purposes.
GAI has taken the world by storm. In 2023 alone, GAI has been used to generate musical works using the voices of famous musicians such as Drake, The Weeknd, Rihanna, Ye (formerly Kanye West), and Jay-Z – to name a few. These AI-generated musical works were short-lived, however, as they were quickly removed from streaming services after record label companies threatened legal action. GAI has also been used to generate new works of art. For example, the winner of the 2023 Sony World Photography Awards used GAI to create their winning work; however, the award was later forfeited when it was found that the artist used GAI to create it. GAI programs also have been used to write substantive and pictographic books – such as the more than 200 e-books on online bookstores that list ChatGPT as an author or co-author. Users galore also produce succinct or lengthy summaries of existing authored works with GAI. This may seem beneficial, however, a recently filed copyright infringement lawsuit, Silverman et al. v. Open AI Inc., claims that to produce books and summarize others, the GAI platform must “ingest” copyrighted books to learn what they are about and to account for their writing style – something the program allegedly did to plaintiff’s copyrighted work, without her permission.
Scenarios like these raise many questions about how GAI and intellectual property rights intersect. What are the intellectual property risks a company takes when it prompts GAI to generate a unique output? Can a company use GAI to imitate the image and/or likeness of a celebrity for commercial purposes, such as a company advertisement? In this rapidly evolving area of law, it’s essential to carefully consider the intellectual property law principles at play before using GAI for your commercial business endeavors.
What’s Not Protectable Under Copyright Law
The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to “secur[e] for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive right to their . . . Writings.” Based on this power and in conjunction with the Copyright Act, Congress has afforded copyright protection broadly to “original works of authorship.” The U.S. Copyright Office’s position is that copyright protection(s) will only be afforded to a work if it is “created by a human being.” Therefore, the Copyright Office’s current policy is to reject copyright protection for AI-generated works, as they are not products of human creation. Similarly, courts have denied copyright protection to works created by nonhuman authors, such as artistic works photographed by monkeys and works created in nature.
This does not completely foreclose the possibility of copyright protection when using GAI, however, as the Copyright Office acknowledges that it is often used to assist artists in the creative process. In situations where the GAI program assists in the creative process, the user may argue that the programs are merely tools, like cameras, that a human author uses to aid in their creation of a copyrightable work. Under this view and consistent with the 1884 U.S. Supreme Court holding in Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, a user of a GAI platform may argue that just as a photo taken by a camera is eligible for copyright protection, the AI-generated output that a user arranged, composed, and edited should be eligible for copyright protection as the final product encompasses human-authored aspects. Although it has yet to be done, it is possible that an artist could modify an AI-generated work to a point that it meets the standards required for copyright protection. However, at the end of the day, only human-authored aspects of a work can be copyrighted.
Similarly, the image and likeness of a person is generally not protectable under copyright law. The right of publicity is an intellectual property right that generally protects an individual against unauthorized commercial misappropriation of their name, likeness, or other identifier of their identity, such as a pseudonym, the individual’s voice, their signature, or photograph. Issues involving rights to publicity are governed by the appropriate state’s statutory and/or common law. This is because in the United States, no federal statute or case law recognizes the right to publicity; meaning, the Copyright Act is inapplicable in publicity cases. For example, a recent case, Young v. Neocortext, Inc., involving the “Reface” deep-fake AI app, which allows users to swap their face and voice with their favorite celebrities in photos and videos, was brought under California’s right to publicity law(s) and alleged commercial misappropriation of likeness, not copyright infringement.
State Rights to Publicity Laws
Even if copyright law does not apply, it does not mean a company can start using generative AI to imitate a famous celebrity for its next advertisement. Many states have “right to publicity” laws, which protect the name, image, and/or likeness of a person from unauthorized commercial uses. However, the right of publicity is not limited to just name, image, or likeness – courts have expanded the scope of these protections to cover the commercial use(s) of “sound-alikes” and “look-alikes.” Meaning, if a company is using a look-alike or a sound-alike for a commercial purpose, merely causing a consumer to associate the look-alike or sound-alike with a celebrity, could be enough to subject the company to liability.
In addition, state laws often protect the “likeness” of a person, but the legal definition is not always defined by statute. Stated generally, likeness encompasses the visual image of a person including, among other things, the individual’s appearance, mannerisms, and gestures. And, when the definition is provided within the statute, one should be wary, as states will often have different variations of the definition. This can raise uncertainty as to which identifiers are subject to state publicity law restrictions, because each state has different framework. So, what is permitted conduct in one state may not be permissible in another. For example, some states may choose to protect the celebrity’s voice, but others may choose to protect the celebrity’s signature. In states where the right to publicity is provided by statute, plaintiffs will generally not need to show actual economic loss or damage to state a claim, whereas in other states, the plaintiff must prove that they sustained actual loss to recover from the alleged infringer. This patchy framework could be challenging to navigate, particularly for those businesses who are actively engaged in commerce across the United States. It is recommended that a business do research on the law of their state and any state in which their advertisement may be viewed before using any AI-generated work that encompasses an individual’s likeness.
How to Mitigate Generative AI Intellectual Property Risks
If you plan to use GAI for your public-facing commercial projects, keep in mind the variety of intellectual property legal considerations that come into play.


If you are creating content with a GAI program that generates an imitation of the image or likeness of a celebrity or other person, consider whether you should first obtain permission and/or a use license from that individual. In some cases, such uses might be permitted in exchange for a royalty or other fee. Otherwise, your business could be at risk of violating state publicity laws.




It’s also important to understand that works produced by GAI are unlikely to be subject to copyright protections. This means that an individual or even the company that owns the GAI program could re-use your AI-generated content for their own commercial purposes without your consent, provided there are no other prevailing intellectual property (e.g., patent and trademark law) or legal limitations.




Further, most GAI programs are trained using large amounts of publicly available data that the program then copies, stores, and learns from to make its outputs more efficient. In other words, it is entirely possible that the resulting AI-generated work has taken and used elements from works that have copyright protection(s). Without proper precautions, your company’s AI-generated work could qualify as a derivative work, and subject your company to an infringement action.




In the event your business is hiring vendors or service providers to develop projects on behalf of your business, ensure the contract terms address their possible use(s) of GAI to create work product(s). Additionally, check the terms and conditions of the GAI program being used by those vendors or service providers to ensure there are no provisions stating that the outputs the program generates are owned by the company that created the program. It’s generally advisable to contract for all work as “work for hire.”


This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the considerations for AI-generated works, but as GAI becomes more prevalent in our day-to-day lives, it’s essential to consider how it will impact your intellectual property rights and risk exposure. Not only does GAI have the ability to generate unique creative works, but it also has the ability to imitate the image or likeness of others – intentionally or not. Businesses using GAI for commercial purposes must be hypervigilant and stay abreast of the intellectual property legal developments as GAI continues to evolve.AuthorsKarl M. ZielaznickiVictoria D.

Updated November 15, 2023: To simplify the user experience and make Copilot more accessible to everyone, Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise will now simply become Microsoft Copilot. For more information: https://aka.ms/BingIgnite
At Microsoft, we are working to provide a copilot for every person in their lives and at work. Earlier this year, we introduced the new AI-powered Bing, your copilot for the web, fundamentally reinventing search as a category with complete answers, a full chat experience, and features to unlock creativity. We also introduced Microsoft 365 Copilot, which combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with your data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 apps to usher in a whole new way of working, using just your own words. Since then, we’ve seen millions of people incorporate Bing into their lives for the first time in new ways to unlock their creativity and gain a better understanding of the world.
And feedback from customers in our Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program, is that Copilot promises to be a game changer for productivity.
Today at Microsoft Inspire, we’re excited to unveil the next steps in our journey: First, we’re significantly expanding Bing to reach new audiences with Bing Chat Enterprise, delivering AI-powered chat for work, and rolling out today in Preview – which means that more than 160 million people already have access. Second, to help commercial customers plan, we’re sharing that Microsoft 365 Copilot will be priced at $30 per user, per month for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard and Business Premium customers, when broadly available; we’ll share more on timing in the coming months. Third, in addition to expanding to more audiences, we continue to build new value in Bing Chat and are announcing Visual Search in Chat, a powerful new way to search, now rolling out broadly in Bing Chat.
Bing Chat Enterprise — AI-powered chat for work 
Employees are looking to use AI tools to help them unlock creativity and productivity at work — 70% say they would delegate as much work as possible to AI according to our Work Trend Index. But using AI tools that aren’t built for the enterprise inadvertently puts sensitive business data at risk. As organizations adopt AI, they want to be confident their data is protected.
Bing Chat Enterprise gives your organization AI-powered chat for work with commercial data protection. With Bing Chat Enterprise, user and business data are protected and will not leak outside the organization. What goes in — and comes out — remains protected. Chat data is not saved, and Microsoft has no eyes-on access – which means no one can view your data. And, your data is not used to train the models. Whether researching industry insights, analyzing data, or looking for inspiration, Bing Chat Enterprise gives people access to better answers, greater efficiency and new ways to be creative.

Just like Bing Chat, Bing Chat Enterprise is grounded in web data and provides complete, verifiable answers with citations, along with visual answers that include graphs, charts and images, and is designed in line with our AI principles.
Bing Chat Enterprise is rolling out in preview today and is included at no additional cost in Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard and Business Premium. And in the future, it will be available as a stand-alone offering for $5 per user, per month. You can access Bing Chat Enterprise using your work account wherever Bing Chat is supported — Bing.com/chat and the Microsoft Edge sidebar. And, in the future, Bing Chat Enterprise will also be accessible from Windows Copilot.

Announcing Microsoft 365 Copilot pricing for commercial customers
Bing Chat Enterprise unlocks generative AI for work. And Microsoft 365 Copilot brings a whole new way of working – reasoning over all your business data in the context of your enterprise, including the ability to ask questions and get answers from the web. Microsoft 365 Copilot will be available for commercial customers for $30 per user per month for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard and Business Premium customers when broadly available.
Microsoft 365 Copilot is built on Microsoft’s trusted and comprehensive approach to enterprise-grade security, privacy, identity, compliance and responsible AI — so you know it’s enterprise ready. This means:

Copilot inherits your existing Microsoft 365 security, privacy, identity and compliance policies.
Your data is logically isolated and protected within your Microsoft 365 tenant, and always within your control.
At the tenant level, Copilot respects individual and group permission policies.

While some generative AI apps focus on a single capability, like real-time transcription or copywriting, Microsoft 365 Copilot is in a class all its own. It has all the capabilities of Bing Chat Enterprise, plus so much more. Copilot puts thousands of skills at your command and can reason over all your content and context to take on any task. It’s grounded in your business data in the Microsoft Graph — that’s all your emails, calendar, chats, documents and more. So, Copilot can generate an update from the morning’s meetings, emails and chats to send to the team; get you up to speed on project developments from the last week; or create a SWOT analysis from internal files and data from the web.
Microsoft 365 Copilot is incredible on its own, and it’s also integrated into the apps millions of people use every day. Copilot jump-starts your creativity in Word, analyzes data in Excel, designs presentations in PowerPoint, triages your Outlook inbox, summarizes meetings in Teams – whether you attended or not – and so much more.
In May, we announced the expansion of our Microsoft 365 Copilot paid Early Access Program to 600 enterprise customers worldwide, including companies like KPMG, Lumen, and Emirates NBD. We’re learning that the more customers use Copilot, the more their enthusiasm for Copilot grows. Soon, no one will want to work without it.
Microsoft 365 Copilot: Thousands of skills. All your data. Infinite possibilities. Learn more here.

Search with images — not just words — using Visual Search in Chat
In addition to unlocking the power of generative AI to people at work, we continue to deliver new features and experiences in Bing Chat to help people make the most of this technology. Part of this work is a focus on building visual features in Bing Chat. And today we’re pleased to announce we’re rolling out multimodal capabilities via Visual Search in Chat.
Leveraging OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, Visual Search in Chat lets anyone upload images and search the web for related content. Take a picture, or use one you find elsewhere, and prompt Bing to tell you about it — Bing can understand the context of an image, interpret it, and answer questions about it. Whether you’re traveling to a new city on vacation and asking about the architecture of a particular building or at home trying to come up with lunch ideas based on the contents of your fridge, upload the image into Bing Chat and use it to harness the web’s knowledge to get you answers. Visual Search in Chat is beginning to roll out now via desktop and the Bing mobile app and we are working to bring this to Bing Chat Enterprise over time.

[+] with a rapidly changing job market.getty
Results from a new survey suggest that college graduates are worried about the impact that the rapid emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT will have on their employability.


And employers also acknowledge that the hiring landscape is being changed quickly by the new technology, leading them to look for new hires that can combine so called “soft skills” like emotional intelligence, negotiation, and communication with the ability to work with the assistance of artificial intelligence.

The findings are featured in the Cengage Group’s 2023 Graduate Employability Report, based on two surveys conducted by the online platform Pollfish in June 2023.

PROMOTED



The graduate survey targeted 1,000 U.S. men and women between the ages of 18 and 65 who had completed an education program (i.e., associate, bachelor’s or graduate degree or vocational training or certification) for their perspectives on their recent experience seeking employment.
The employer survey asked 1,000 U.S. men and women between the ages of 18 and 65 with hiring responsibilities within their organization about their views on determining a candidate’s fitness for a specific role.


Key Finding For Graduates
More than half of the graduates (52%) said the growth of AI makes them question how prepared they are for today’s workforce. They were split about whether they believed their job will be replaced by AI - 46% felt threatened by the new technology, while 55% said their job could never be replaced by AI.

Six in 10 graduates (61%) said they will need to develop or strengthen their digital skills due to AI, and 65% said they were eager for more training on working with AI.
Only 41% of graduates said their program taught them skills needed for their first job, a substantial drop from the 63% who said that in 2022. When it came to the skills they believed were lacking, about a quarter pointed to soft skills instruction. More than half of graduates (58%) said employers needed to work more closely with colleges and other learning programs to develop educational courses or programs that teach students the skills they’ll need in the workplace upon graduation.

Although internships, externships and apprenticeship programs are ideal workplace experiences to help equip students with these skills, fewer than half of grads (47%) said they participated in such programs in this year’s survey, compared with 63% who did so in 2022. Of those who did participate in one of those experiences, more than a third (35%) reported they did not receive any guidance from their school in finding one.

Half of all graduates (49%) say their educational institution should be held accountable for placing them in jobs upon graduation, with graduates of degree programs more likely than non-degree grads to want their institution to be held accountable for employment connections.
Reflecting the ongoing shifts in how employers view entry-level graduates, graduates are becoming less convinced that a college degree is the best signal to employers of the skills they possess, with only 23% believing a degree is the best indicator in 2023, down from 32% in 2022.
On the other hand, the loosening of degree requirements may also be why grads are feeling more confident and qualified to apply for entry-level jobs. Only 33% felt underqualified to apply for entry-level roles in 2023, while 49% and 50% felt underqualified in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Key Finding for Employers
AI is also affecting employers’ hiring plans. More than half (57%) of employers said certain entry-level jobs – or even entire teams - could be replaced by AI, and 68% believed that many employees will need to reskill or upskill in the next three to five years because of emerging technology.
Nearly three in five employers (59%) reported that the growth of AI had caused them to prioritize different skills when hiring, and 66% said they are now looking for “uniquely human” skills in prospective employees and that previous job experience will become more important in hiring decisions.
Employers strongly agreed (79%) that employees could benefit from training on working alongside AI and other new technologies in their current roles. Additionally, 68% say many of their employees will need to learn new skills in the next three to five years – either to stay up-to-date for their existing role or a new one for those that emerging technologies are likely to make obsolete.
The search for talent remains a challenge. Half of employers (53%) reported still struggling to hire talent in 2023, which was an improvement from 2022 when 65% reported they were having difficulty. As a result of this challenge, almost half of employers (48%) said they are willing to hire individuals who they know will need later upskilling on the job.
A college degree is becoming less important.  Only 50% of today’s employers require a 2- or 4-year degree for entry-level jobs, compared to 62% who did so in 2022. More employers in 2023 say they require a skills training credential (33%) compared to 26% who said that in 2022, which also coincides with what grads say - they are seeing more job openings with no degree requirements.
Commenting on the implications of the survey in a news release, Michael Hansen, CEO of Cengage Group, said, “the workplace has changed rapidly in the last few years, and now we are witnessing a new shift as AI begins to reshape worker productivity, job requirements, hiring habits and even entire industries. With new technology comes both new uncertainties and new opportunities for the workforce, and educators and employers must do more to prepare today’s workers for these technological skills.”

Half of graduates feel threatened by AI (46%) and question their workforce readiness (52%)
59% of employers say AI has caused them to prioritize different skills when hiring, including ""uniquely human"" skills
Half of employers have dropped degree requirements for entry-level roles
BOSTON, July 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The job landscape has been completely transformed. In response to workplace transitions like The Great Resignation, Quiet Quitting and now the rise and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), employer hiring habits continue to evolve with 50% of employers now admitting they've dropped 2- and 4-year degree requirements for entry-level positions (a 32% increase over 2022) and started prioritizing softer skills and previous job experience (66%).


Continue Reading

















Data from the 2023 Cengage Group Employability Survey tracks opinions on key workforce trends among recent graduates and employers.







And while these shifts signal a move toward skills-based hiring (over degree-based hiring), it also introduces new uncertainties for graduates.

According to Cengage Group's 2023 Employability Report – the third annual report surveying 1,000 graduates who completed a degree or non-degree program in the last 12 months and 1,000 U.S. hiring decisionmakers – the growth of emerging technologies, like generative AI, have a third of grads second-guessing their career choice. Additionally, more than half (52%) of graduates say competition from AI has them questioning how prepared they are for the workforce.
""The workplace has changed rapidly in the last few years, and now we are witnessing a new shift as AI begins to reshape worker productivity, job requirements, hiring habits and even entire industries,"" said Michael Hansen, CEO of Cengage Group. ""With new technology comes both new uncertainties and new opportunities for the workforce, and educators and employers must do more to prepare today's workers for these technological shifts.""Data shows that educators still have work to do in preparing graduates. Just 41% of grads said their program taught them skills needed for their first job – down from 63% who said the same in 2022. Recent graduates report they are not getting enough preparation to develop ""soft skills,"" something employers say they will prioritize more with the growth of AI. Nearly 3 in 5 grads (58%) believe closer alignment between employers and learning institutions would help them develop important workplace skills.Additional findings include:
The struggle for talent is still very real and has forced employers to do things differently. Half of employers (53%) struggle to find talent (down from 65% in 2022), which has improved their willingness to interview candidates with experience but no degree (66%; up from 53% in 2022). Additionally, employers are more open to upskilling with nearly half of employers (48%) admitting they will hire talent with some but not all the skills needed for a role and upskill them, and 17% open to finding and upskilling talent from within the company.
Dropping degree requirements has increased grad confidence. With half of employers dropping degree requirements on entry-level job listings, grads are more confidently applying to jobs with 3 in 5 (61%) employers seeing an uptick in non-degree applicants. In fact, recent degree and non-degree graduates are feeling more confident regarding their qualifications to apply for entry-level jobs, with only one-third (33%) stating they felt underqualified, down significantly from the last two years in which roughly half of graduates felt underqualified.
There's still work to be done to connect education to the workforce. Half of all graduates (49%) say their educational institution should be held accountable for placing them in jobs upon graduation, however fewer graduates gained important workforce experience before graduating. Less than half of graduates (47%) participated in an internship, externship or apprenticeship this year, compared with 63% in 2022. Of those graduates who did, more than a third (35%) did not receive any guidance from their school in finding the opportunity.
The ""Great Reskilling"" is coming as employer priorities shift. With more than half of employers (57%) saying certain entry level jobs, teams and skills could be replaced by AI, they are calling for employees to upskill. More than two-thirds of employers (68%) say many of their employees will need to reskill or upskill in the next 3-5 years because of emerging technology and grads agree – 3 in 5 (61%) say they will need to develop or strengthen their digital skills due to AI. The good news for employers: graduates (65%) recognize that and say they need more training in working alongside new technology.
""No part of the workforce is immune to the changes AI will bring. Many workers will need to develop new skills to work alongside new technology or perhaps even find new careers as a result of AI disruption. As we collectively navigate these changes, we are laser-focused on helping people develop in demand skills and connect to sustainable employment,"" said Hansen.For more information on the 2023 Cengage Group Graduate Employability Report, click here.

Technology enables inference of subjective outcomes from routinely collected data
PALO ALTO, Calif., July 19, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Verantos today announced two peer-reviewed publications on high-quality real-world data for migraine. The manuscripts describe the use of artificial intelligence (AI) on medical records to enable access to valuable clinical information such as headache severity, comorbid depression, associated symptoms, and a composite migraine impact score.
These soft outcomes — subjective aspects of a medical condition or its management — are poorly and inconsistently captured during the course of routine care, but generation of useful real-world evidence often requires understanding them.
Migraine impacts more than a billion people globally every year, particularly women and young adults. Migraine is linked to various comorbidities, including stress, sleep disorders, and suicidal ideation.
""Breakthroughs in AI applied to rich clinical data enable life sciences organizations to understand real-world migraine care at a level that has not previously been possible,"" said Dan Riskin, M.D., CEO of Verantos. ""High-quality data and high-validity evidence can enable better collaboration with providers, payers, and regulators to refine the standard of care and benefit patients.""
By applying AI to medical records including clinical narrative data, it is possible to build and validate models of soft outcomes. In its highest form, a system can accurately develop an outcome score quantifying migraine severity at a point in time.
""Using artificial intelligence to identify patients with migraine and associated symptoms and conditions within electronic health records"" was published in BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making. This manuscript demonstrates how detailed patient characteristics (phenotype) can be identified using unstructured EHR data and AI. ""Development and validation of a novel model for characterizing migraine outcomes within real-world data"" was published in The Journal of Headache and Pain. This groundbreaking work builds on phenotyping to develop and validate a model of migraine outcomes that uses information typically available in routinely collected data.
Verantos' Migraine Pragmatic Registry applies the technology and methodology from these publications and is available today.
About Verantos
Verantos is the global leader in high-validity real-world evidence for life sciences organizations. By incorporating robust clinical narrative data and artificial intelligence technology, Verantos is the first company to generate high-validity evidence at scale across therapeutic areas with measured accuracy, completeness, and traceability. Credible evidence accelerates clinical development, market access, pharmacovigilance, and regulatory initiatives.

Legal work, well known for its long hours and heavy workloads, is being revolutionized by artificial intelligence — specifically generative AI, which is one of the most transformative technological advancements in recent history. 
A 2023 study by researchers at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University found that “legal services” is among the industries most exposed to occupational change from generative AI. Another report, published in 2023 by economists at Goldman Sachs, estimated that 44 percent of legal work could be automated by emerging AI tools.
AI in the Legal IndustryArtificial intelligence improves the efficiency of legal work by way of automation. The technology can be used to assist in legal research, perform contract analysis and even generate contracts, agreements and other legal documents.

AI tools can now handle the endless reading, summarizing, creating and filing of documents ordinarily relegated to junior attorneys or paralegals. And even if it doesn’t replace lawyers entirely, the emergence of generative AI stands to radically alter the nature of practicing law, as well as its business model.
“It’s going to have an impact. We’re already starting to see that,” Pablo Arredondo, co-founder and chief innovation officer at legal AI company Casetext, told Built In. “How exactly it plays out remains to be seen. There’s a lot of choices we all have to make as a profession that’s going to help dictate that.”
More on the Intersection of AI and WorkWhy an Automated Future Won’t Be a Jobless One 
How Is AI Used in the Legal Industry?
Legal work has been identified as a ripe target for AI disruption many times before, with warnings of artificial intelligence ousting lawyers dating as far back as 2011. But over the years, this technology has served more as an aide to lawyers rather than a replacement. Here’s some of the ways AI is being used in the legal industry.
 
Paperwork Automation
Large language models, or the underlying system of platforms like ChatGPT, are now capable of reading, analyzing and summarizing large swaths of text, and allows users to quickly sort and classify words in lengthy documents. This helps automate the bulk of paperwork lawyers, paralegals and other professionals in the industry ordinarily spend their time doing.
GPT-4, the large language model serving as the backbone of ChatGPT and several other generative AI systems, also managed to score in the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam. These results push the boundaries on not only what AI is capable of doing on its own, but what it can enable in the legal world.
“Passing the bar exam is a great illustration of some of [GPT-4’s] power and nuance, especially the fact that it could generate essays. It was sort of a vivid illustration of the progress,” Arredondo, who co-authored the GPT-4 study, said. “What really matters is attorneys can use this in their day-to-day work and get better outcomes for their clients.”
Law-focused AI software like Casetext, Latch, Harvey and others have taken GPT-4 and other language models and fine-tuned them for their specific kind of legal work. They can help lawyers research relevant case law, statutes, regulations and legal opinions, sifting through thousands of pages in a matter of minutes to not only find documents, but summarize them and highlight important passages.

E-Discovery 
In the same way AI can efficiently sort and organize paperwork, these methods can be applied to facilitate e-discovery tasks. E-discovery, short for electronic discovery, is the legal procedure of searching for and retrieving case evidence from digital formats like email, database or social media documents. By using AI tools, legal professionals can search for specific words, phrases or other written evidence within multiple data sources and digital documents at once. This ultimately speeds up the e-discovery and legal processes, plus helps catch pieces of information that may otherwise be missed through manual searches.
 
Contract Analysis and Document Generation
AI tools can also help with contract analysis (a fundamental part of the legal profession), where they review contracts and provide insights into potential risks or compliance issues. Some can even generate legal documents themselves, a process in which a lawyer inputs specific requirements or key details into the tool and the system generates a preliminary draft, which can then be reviewed and refined by human professionals.

“Generative AI deals in the stock and trade of lawyers, which is words.”

“Generative AI deals in the stock and trade of lawyers, which is words,” Ben Allgrove, an attorney and chief innovation officer at international law firm Baker McKenzie, told Built In. He predicts AI will cause a “reshuffling” of the legal industry, where the use of generative AI will be an expectation, not an experiment. 
“I think it would be negligent or unprofessional for any lawyer not to investigate how they can use technologies and advances to deliver a better product,” he added, “in the same way that if a lawyer didn’t use an electronic database to search for cases would be negligent.”
In some instances, this investigation has already begun. Several prominent law firms, as well as legal departments within major companies, are putting this technology to the test. 
In February 2023, international law firm Allen & Overy entered into an exclusive partnership with a tool called Harvey, which provides thousands of the firm’s attorneys with assistance in legal research, drafting documents and contract analysis. LexisNexis, a long-time data and analytics provider in the legal industry, announced in May 2023 that it created a new generative AI platform using GPT technology and teamed up with some of the biggest law firms in the United States, including Baker McKenzie, Foley & Lardner and Reed Smith. And several Fortune 50 companies, like Microsoft and Ford Motor, as well as top law firms like DLA Piper and Kirkland & Ellis, have tested a tool created by Casetext called CoCounsel.
This software isn’t doing anything that attorneys or paralegals can’t do themselves. It’s just able to do it faster and more efficiently than any human is physically capable of doing it — posing both time and cost-saving potential. 
“There has been a lot of waste in law, and there’s a lot of room for efficiency,” José Padilla, a corporate attorney and founder of legal AI company LegalMente, told Built In. “AI will definitely help in that.”
Related ReadingWhat Does It Mean to ‘Work With AI’? 
Will AI Replace Lawyers?
Despite AI’s offerings, it is unlikely that these tools will outright replace human attorneys — at least not right now. Providing legal advice is more than just predicting words, which is all generative AI is capable of at the moment. And beyond all the reading and rote memorization, practicing law well requires a lot of uniquely human skills.
“Being a lawyer is more than just fulfilling a task,” Allgrove said. “It’s not the law that gets the deal across the line, it’s the negotiating skills. It’s the ability to read the person on the other side of the table.” As of today, AI can’t do that.
A much more likely outcome of this generative AI revolution is a change in the business of law — namely, the billable hour, which remains the dominant business model in legal work. 
“Ultimately, it breaks the billable-hour model,” Allgrove said. “Once you get into a world where your law firms are needing to invest larger and larger in the technology to provide the product at the end of the day — not the time — then we’re going to have to find different models which enable us to get a return on our capital and our effort that is fair and that’s not based on charging for time.”

“Ultimately, [AI] breaks the billable-hour model.”

That being said, if AI was to do away with anyone, it would likely be the people working on what Hamid Kohan, CEO of legal AI company Legal Soft, calls “transactional law.” That includes tax resolution, immigration and estate planning — the sort of stuff that doesn’t require a lot of litigation. It mainly involves finding correct documents and filing paperwork, which a machine can do now for a much lower price than a human attorney.
It could also replace the “junior attorney drudgery,” Padilla said, like reading and summarizing thousands of pages of text. But these tools will likely always require a human eye.
“I think there’s always a role for a lawyer,” Padilla added. “Legal expertise is more than just what AI can offer, which is just kind of brute force legal knowledge. There needs to be expertise on top of that knowledge.”
 
Can AI Give Legal Advice?
Maybe AI won’t replace all lawyers outright. But can it still provide sound legal advice? At the moment, the answer is “not really.”
“It can approximate, and it can be very convincing,” Allgrove said. “But I have failed to see any system which can accurately apply law to a fact pattern in order to provide legal advice.”
In practice, giving reliable and accurate legal advice requires a lot of knowledge of the law, but also a nuanced understanding of the context in which the law exists, Padilla said. “As attorneys, we’re regulating human behavior. Because of that, human behavior and human interaction is a lot of what we’re about. Sometimes the legal answer is not the right answer, sometimes there’s a way to solve the problem of human interaction without the cold hand of the law.”
AI doesn’t understand that nuance, and could draw conclusions that may not produce the best result for a client.
“In law, there are a lot of gray lines. And you’ve got to make sure that the AI understands all the gray areas of the law. …It does not,” Kohan, who’s also author of How to Scale Your Stupid AI Law Firm, said. “It makes mistakes, and when you’re dealing with human lives like that you can’t make mistakes.”

Indeed, the propensity of AI to make up information — a phenomenon experts call “hallucinating” — is perhaps this technology’s biggest hurdle towards full adoption in the legal industry, a profession that hinges on finding and weighing facts.
This was made clear in 2023, when a New York attorney got in hot water for using ChatGPT to do legal research for a personal injury case. He crafted a 10-page brief, citing more than half a dozen previous court decisions. All of them turned out to be completely fabricated by the chatbot. The attorney was sanctioned by a federal judge and fined $5,000, along with a colleague.
The incident, which arose out of an otherwise obscure, run-of-the-mill lawsuit, captured the attention of both the tech world and the legal world — serving as a sort of punchline and cautionary tale of the dangers of artificial intelligence. Since then, a handful of federal judges have issued orders requiring lawyers to disclose when they’ve used generative AI to create legal documents.
Still, law firms and legal departments around the world are continuing to take advantage of a growing number of software to keep up with the demands of case management, research and the drafting of legal documents.
More on Generative AI5 Ways to Lessen the Risk of Generative AI 
Legal AI Tools
There are lots of legal AI tools on the market today. Some are meant to help attorneys streamline their research tasks and draft documents, others are designed to cut out the need for attorneys altogether. And many of them have been growing fast over the last couple years.
 
Harvey
Harvey uses a combination of data analytics, machine learning and natural language processing to automate various aspects of practicing law, including contract analysis, regulatory compliance, due diligence and litigation. The platform is built on top of GPT-4, OpenAI’s large language model, which was then enhanced for legal work. In fact, OpenAI’s Startup Fund was among several big name investors to back Harvey with a $21 million Series A round in April 2023.
Founded in 2022, Harvey has already made inroads at a couple of major firms. The company entered a “strategic alliance” with accounting giant PwC in March 2023, and entered an exclusive launch partnership with international law firm Allen & Overy in February 2023. A&O is reportedly the seventh largest law firm in the world, and has made Harvey available to some 3,500 of its lawyers across 43 offices. The technology promises to be a “game-changer” for not just the firm, but for the entire legal industry, according to David Wakeling, head of A&O’s markets innovation group.
 
DoNotPay
DoNotPay first launched in 2015 as “the world’s first robot lawyer,” initially generating the text users need to file complaints and cancel subscriptions. Over the years, the company has expanded its services, using artificial intelligence to help people register a trademark, file a police report and even sue people. In 2022, it also rolled out a chatbot that can help users negotiate bills using GPT-3 — the same large language model first used by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — engaging in back-and-forth conversations with various companies through live, text-based chats.
In 2023, DoNotPay made headlines for its plan to use its chatbot to help a person fight a speeding ticket directly in a physical courtroom. According to the company’s CEO and co-founder Joshua Browder, the intent was to have the AI “listen” to the case and then generate responses using GPT-3. The client would then hear those responses through a pair of AirPods and repeat them verbatim to the presiding judge.
The scheme received a lot of buzz — and a lot of flak, including from state bar prosecutors, Browder said in a tweet, which prompted him to “postpone” the court case amid alleged threats of jail time. The company is also facing a proposed class action lawsuit that claims the site offers “substandard legal documents” and provides “unauthorized legal services.”
 
Latch
Latch uses GPT-4 to simplify the contact review and redlining process for lawyers. It offers case management, time tracking, billing, and client communication tools, too. The software is a Microsoft Word add-in, meaning lawyers can use Latch directly from within Microsoft Word. And it integrates with various cloud storage services, making it easy for law firms to centralize their data and collaborate with each other on cases.
Latch launched in April 2023, and in just one month the startup had a wait list of more than 80 companies, co-founder Min-Kyu Jung told the Wall Street Journal. Now companies can get partial access to it within a day of signing an agreement with the startup.
 
Frequently Asked QuestionsHow is AI being used in the legal industry?Artificial intelligence is used by law firms and attorneys to assist in legal research, perform contract analysis and generate contracts, agreements and other legal documents.

Can AI give legal advice?No. At the moment, AI does not have the institutional expertise, judgment or critical thinking skills to offer sound legal advice with any reliability.

Can AI replace attorneys?While AI may replace certain aspects of the legal industry, it is unlikely it will replace all attorneys any time soon. There remain quite a few unresolved issues with AI, including data privacy and client confidentiality concerns, as well as its propensity for making up information. As such, AI is not secure enough or reliable enough to replace human attorneys.

By: Mike Vizard on July 18, 2023 At its .conf23 conference, Splunk today revealed it added a slew of capabilities to its portfolio of operational analytics tools, including an assistant that leverages generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that use large language models (LLMs) the company developed to enable IT teams to use natural language to invoke the Splunk Processing Language (SPL).In addition, Splunk is also previewing OpenTelemetry Collector, an add-on that uses open source agent software being developed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to capture metrics and traces. It is designed to enable IT teams to use OpenTelemetry alongside existing agent software that Splunk uses to capture metrics.Tom Casey, senior vice president for products and technology at Splunk, said the domain-specific LLMs that the company created enable Splunk Assistant to write or explain customized SPL queries in a way that augments rather than replaces the need for IT professionals. Splunk Assistant is designed to surface recommendations to optimize IT environments to reduce toil rather than automate entire processes, he noted.



Splunk is adding other tools infused with machine learning algorithms to its portfolio. These include the Splunk App for Anomaly Detection and an Outlier Exclusion for Adaptive Thresholding to detect and omit abnormal data points that has been added to version 4.17 of the Splunk IT Service Intelligence platform.In addition, Splunk is previewing an ML-Assisted Thresholding tool for Splunk IT Service that uses historical data and patterns to create dynamic thresholds with a single click.

The company is making available a 5.4 update to the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) 5.4 and a Splunk App for Data Science and Deep Learning (DSDL) 5.1 toolkit that provides access to additional data science tools that can extend MLTK to enable organizations to build their own custom LLMs and AI assistants.Finally, Splunk added Unified Identity to make it simpler to access Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Observability Cloud along with an update to Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Enterprise that make it simpler to ingest, route, search and export data.It’s still early days as far as the application of generative AI is concerned, but it’s already clear that the way IT is managed is about to be transformed. Coupled with tools such as OpenTelemetry that make it less expensive to collect massive amounts of data, the opportunity to train LLMs that streamline a wide range of processes is immense. Those capabilities won’t replace the need for humans to manage those processes, but they will most certainly cause staff realignments as many manual tasks become increasingly automated.In fact, it’s hard to imagine an IT team that would not want to take advantage of AI capabilities to simplify the management of complex IT environments that now function at a level of scale that few IT professionals can successfully manage on their own. One way or another, AI is going to be broadly applied to IT workflows. The only thing left to be seen now is the ultimate impact.

Service operations (including customer service and back office): 54%
Risk modeling and analytics: 15%

A further breakdown can be seen in the chart below:

Statistics from Forbes gathered from 600 business owners reveal the following ways that companies are using or plan to use AI to improve the customer experience:

Chatbots for instant messaging: 73%
Composing emails: 61%
Product recommendations and other personalized services: 55%
Composing text messages: 49%
Personalized advertising: 46%
Long-form written content for websites, etc.:42%
Phone calls: 36%

56% of these business owners say they already use or plan to use AI for customer service.
Other top uses are cybersecurity and fraud management, digital personal assistants, and customer relationship management, coming in at 51%, 47%, and 46%, respectively. 
We are already seeing surprising use cases outside of the technology and marketing space:

The University of British Columbia and BC Cancer researchers have developed AI that predicts cancer survival with 80% accuracy by reading doctor’s notes.
According to an article published in Nature, a revolutionary AI tool can now predict the structures of 200 million proteins. Stored on a 23-terabyte database, this information could offer new possibilities for the development of drugs, which are mostly based on these protein structures.
Oxford University scientists have developed an AI that can lip-read with 400% greater accuracy than a human lip-reader.
Emotion AI, which uses natural language processing (NLP) to detect human emotions in text, could soon be used in healthcare apps to help doctors assess and monitor the emotional state of patients, especially those with neurodiverse conditions. It could also be used to offer mental health assessments and diagnose conditions, Neuroscience News reports.

How is AI Affecting Jobs and Workers?
According to Deloitte’s State of AI in the Enterprise survey, 82% of business leaders believe that AI enhances job satisfaction and performance. 
At the same time, 47% say the use of AI technology creates fear or concern.
Marketsandmarkets predicts that by 2030, AI will have reached human-level sophistication and, therefore, could be threatening many more jobs than at present.
However, Americans seem quite attuned to this risk already. In a study by Pew Research Center, “Loss of human jobs” was cited as the top reason for people feeling more concerned than excited about the growth of AI.
Younger people are more optimistic about AI in the workplace, though. 
According to data published on Statista, 42% of Americans aged 18-44 believe that AI will create many more jobs, compared to just 6% of those aged 45 and over. In fact, 48% of those in the older age group believe that AI will result in many fewer jobs for people, while only 18% of the younger age group hold this view.
Do Americans think artificial intelligence will lead to there being more jobs for people or fewer jobs?

A study published by Goldman Sachs in April 2023 predicts that AI systems will significantly increase AI jobs globally, with the potential to replace 300 million full-time roles. 
The study also noted that two-thirds of US occupations are vulnerable to AI to some degree.
The professions most at risk of automation in the US, according to the proportion of tasks that could be automated, are:

Office and administrative support: 46%
Legal work: 44% 
Architecture and engineering: 37%
Life, physical, and social sciences: 36%
Business and financial operations: 35%

Economists estimate that 60% of the current workforce is employed in jobs that didn’t exist 80 years ago. 
This equates to 85% of employment growth coming from positions created around new technology.
The AI Index 2023 Annual Report by Stanford University found that in 2022, 2.05% of US job postings required some kind of AI skill. 
This may not sound like a lot, but it’s a number that has been climbing steadily for the past few years. Canada was in second place with 1.45% of jobs requiring AI skills, and Spain came third with 1.33%. The researchers noted that in all the countries they studied, the percentage of jobs requiring AI skills had increased since 2014.

The US is not the market with the highest AI skill penetration rate. 
That crown goes to India, with a rate of 3.23, 45% higher than the US, which takes second place.

What Jobs Require AI Skills? 
The McKinsey Global Survey on AI sheds some light on this.
Software engineers came out top, with 39% of companies saying they had recruited for this position in relation to AI. Data engineers and AI data scientists came next, with 35% and 33%, respectively.
There is some hope for people without an engineering background, though, as design specialists and translators both made it into the top 10.

When it comes to specific AI skills, Python – a widely used programming language – is mentioned in 37% of AI job postings in the US, of which there were almost 800,000 in 2022, Visual Capitalist reports. 
Two other languages make the top 10: SQL is mentioned in 23% of job posts, and Java – in 17%. Computer science, data analysis, and data science also feature prominently, being cited in 33%, 20%, and 20% of jobs, respectively.
It’s no surprise that the state responsible for the most AI jobs is California, taking 17.9% of the share across the US. 
This is more than double second-place Texas, with 8.4%. However, with some companies relocating to Texas to take advantage of lower taxes and operating costs, this gap is showing signs of closing.
Artificial Intelligence and Business Stats
How much is all this AI going to cost to implement? And, just as importantly, how much are companies going to save by using it?
Industrial companies that embrace AI technology are already seeing significant cost and time savings. 
A 2022 Accenture report detailed that certain companies using AI for product design, development, and production were saving 30 times more than others through better leveraging of technologies such as automated guided vehicles and predictive supply chain management.
Cost savings and efficiencies are the top benefits for companies using AI, with 54% of organizations citing this in a 2022 IBM survey. Improvements in IT or network performance came a close second with 53%, while better customer experience took third place with 48%. 
Netflix famously reported that their AI-powered personalized recommendation system was saving them $1 billion a year. 
This is largely due to the fact that viewers engage more with personal recommendations compared to generic ‘popular’ ones. This increased engagement helps them retain satisfied customers, decrease cancelations, and plan future in-house productions. That was back in 2015, so the use and impact of AI can only have increased and improved. 
A study conducted by Harvard Business Review found that companies that pioneered the use of AI in sales reported impressive results. These included cost savings of 40-60%, call times reduced by 60%–70%, and a 50% increase in leads and sales.
The industries that are set to gain the most from AI systems are those that have conventionally been labor-intensive or capital-intensive.
A report from Accenture lists the share-of-profit increase per industry by 2035, comparing the baseline without AI to the expected profit with AI in place. The sectors that come out on top are:

Education: 84%
Accommodation and food services: 74%
Construction: 71%
Wholesale and retail: 59%
Healthcare: 55%
Agriculture, forestry, and fishing: 53%


There have also been great successes with AI-enabled supply-chain management. Early adopters of this technology saved 15% on logistics costs while increasing inventory by 35% and service levels by 65% compared to their competitors, McKinsey reports.
McKinsey also reported one of the most dramatic use cases of AI back in 2017, when Amazon acquired Kiva, a robotics company that automates warehouse picking and packing. The result was that Amazon’s click-to-ship cycle, which typically took 60-75 minutes with humans, dropped to an astounding 15 minutes with robots. Alongside this, inventory capacity increased by 50% while operating costs fell by 20%.
Despite all these positive findings, a significant number of companies still see cost as a barrier to implementing AI solutions. IBM reports that 29% of businesses are putting off adopting AI because of the price. This is second only to a lack of AI skills or expertise, which 34% reported as a hindrance.
A cost model built by Dylan Patel and Afzal Ahmad for Semianalysis estimated that ChatGPT costs around $700,000 per day to run. 
That’s equivalent to about $0.36 per query, based on figures from February 2023, when the research was published. Since then, ChatGPT has upgraded from OpenAI’s GPT-3 to GPT-4, which requires considerably more computational power. The actual cost today may therefore be much higher.
There is also the environmental cost to consider. A paper from the University of Massachusetts Amherst found that training a single deep-learning algorithm could emit 313 tons of CO2. That’s five times more than the average car emits in its lifetime.
Statistics about the Risks of Using AI in the Workplace
The Stanford University report looked at the risk of gender and racial bias when using AI technology.
Images generated with DALL-E 2 portrayed 97% of people in positions of authority (such as CEO and Director) as white men, despite the fact that these roles are occupied by 29.1% and 39.6% women, respectively.
This research also found that certain adjectives like “unreasonable”, “stubborn”, and “intellectual” were generally associated with men, whereas “compassionate”, “sensitive”, and “emotional” were more often linked with women.
This presents concerning risks if AI technology starts to be used for things like creating job profiles before the bias has been neutralized. However, this may be an uphill struggle as the models are typically trained on real-world data that inherently contain these biases.
Businesses seem quite aware of the risks that AI technology presents in their companies. According to the Stanford report, these are the top risks from adopting AI that organizations consider relevant in 2022:

Cybersecurity: 59%
Regulatory compliance: 45%
Personal/individual privacy: 40%
Explainability: 37%
Organizational reputation: 32%
Equity and fairness: 30%
Workforce/labor displacement: 28%
Physical safety: 20%
National security: 13%
Political stability: 9%

However, the report noted that “there are meaningful gaps between the risks organizations cite as relevant and those which organizations have taken steps to mitigate”.
Further to this, an IBM study found that 74% of organizations already using AI have not taken any steps to reduce unintended bias in their AI systems. 60% have not yet developed policies about the ethical use of AI in their workplace.
A survey by Forbes revealed some additional concerns that business owners have about the impact of AI:

43% are worried about becoming dependent on AI tech
33% are concerned about the potential reduction of the workforce
31% have privacy concerns
30% are apprehensive about AI providing the business or its customers with misinformation
28% are concerned about bias errors
24% believe it will reduce traffic to their websites

Uses for Artificial Intelligence Statistics
Let’s take a look at some statistics surrounding the use of artificial intelligence in our homes and everyday lives.
57% of Americans are excited about AI replacing household chores, according to Pew Research Center. 40% say the same about AI diagnosing medical conditions, and 9% are excited about AI helping them make important life decisions.

In another survey conducted by Forbes, the top uses for AI were cited as:

Responding to people via text or email: 45%
Answering financial questions: 43%
Planning a travel itinerary: 38%
Crafting an email: 31%
Preparing for a job interview: 30%
Writing a social media post: 25%
Summarizing complex or lengthy copy: 19% 

Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, seem to be one example of AI technology where consumer sentiment lags behind. The driverless car market is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 13.3%, from 20.3 million units in 2021 to 62.4 million units in 2030.
Road accidents caused 38,680 fatalities in the US in 2020, and there are approximately 1.2 million road deaths globally. According to an article published in The Atlantic, by the middle of the century, driverless cars could reduce these fatalities by 90%. This is equivalent to over 30,000 lives a year saved in the US alone.
However, Americans seem reluctant to adopt this technology. Pew Research Center conducted a survey which found that only 26% of Americans believe that the widespread use of autonomous vehicles would be good for society. This is compared to 44% who believe it is a bad idea.
Out of the main digital assistants, Google Assistant has been shown to be the most accurate at responding to queries. Data published on Statista shows that Google Assistant has 93% accuracy overall, compared to 83% for Siri and 80% for Alexa. The only category in which Siri outperformed Google Assistant was with voice commands for phone-related functions.
AI tech has been all over the news since the start of the decade. Here are some of the top AI statistics that have made the headlines:

Microsoft Bing surpassed 100 million daily users in March 2023, spurred along by its addition of an AI chatbot to its search function.
ChatGPT-4 passed the bar exam with a score that surpasses 7% of human test-takers and exceeds the passing threshold, according to research published on SSRN in March 2023.
There are around 1.8 billion visits per month to chat.openai.com, the website where ChatGPT is accessed, according to Similarweb. That’s around 60 million visits per day.
The US is the top user of ChatGPT’s generative AI tool. 12% of these visits are from the US, 8% are from India, and 4% are from Japan.
While ChatGPT is booming, one of the original AI writing tools, Jarvis (previously Jasper) is taking a hit. Traffic to the site dropped by 67% between April and June 2023, from 71.6K users/month to 23.7K.
Over half (52%) of UK adults have heard of generative AI, and over a quarter (26%) have used it themselves, according to research published in July 2023 by Deloitte.
After 10 years working for Google, computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton resigned from his role in May 2023 and warned the public of the “existential risk” that AI systems pose to mankind.

FAQs
What is artificial intelligence vs machine learning? 
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are related concepts but have distinct meanings. Artificial intelligence refers to the broader field of developing intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI aims to create systems that can reason, learn, perceive, understand, and make decisions similar to or better than humans. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. ML involves training a model on a large dataset to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions based on the learned patterns. 

Who invented AI? 
There is no one person responsible for developing AI. It has a complex history that began in the 1950s, and numerous scientists, engineers, and researchers have contributed to bringing it to its current form. John McCarthy, Alan Turing, Allen Newell, Marvin Minsky, and Herbert A. Simon were all instrumental in forming the foundations of what we now know as the field of AI.

What percentage of the population uses AI? 
The answer is that almost everyone with a mobile phone uses AI, although they may not realize it. For instance, IDAP states that 97% of mobile users have AI-powered voice assistants such as Siri activated.

How many lives are saved by AI? 
It is difficult to estimate the number of lives saved by AI, partly because there are so many ways in which this can be achieved and partly because the number is increasing all the time. One significant way that AI can save lives is through wearable devices. According to MedTech Europe, AI could be saving between 380,000 and 403,000 lives each year in Europe alone. This is predominantly through wearable devices (up to 313,000 lives), followed by use in monitoring (42,000) and imaging (41,000).

Can AI fully replace humans? 
It is almost certain that AI will never fully replace humans. Although many human jobs may be lost to AI systems, others will be augmented and created in the process. While people may become more reliant on AI to help them make life decisions and carry out routine tasks, we will always retain the ability to think critically and react to complex situations using our own intuition.

(Allison Zaucha for The Washington Post)By  Pranshu VermaJuly 19, 2023 at 4:58 p.m. EDTWhen Steven Rigsby was working as a background actor on a movie set in Atlanta in the summer of 2018, he became a digital clone.The film crew ushered him into a small black tent, where he stood on a tiny podium as cameras scanned his entire body. In just a minute, they had built his duplicate.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeAs dozens of extras waited in line for scans, Rigsby said he heard the crew talk about using the scans to add more people into a scene.“It felt a little bit disorienting,” he said. “All I could think about was how many extras they weren’t paying in order to do that.”For years, Hollywood’s biggest productions have relied on artificial intelligence along with sophisticated graphic design software for cinematic effect — it de-ages movie stars, creates realistic cartoon heroes and allows directors to tweak performances without reshooting. Body scanning technology, in particular, has been a boon for productions flush out big crowds. “Game of Thrones” and the Lord of the Rings franchise used AI to create imposing 10,000 strong armies. When the pandemic limited on-set actors, Apple TV’s “Ted Lasso” used digital software to fill out the fans in the soccer stadium.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut advancements in generative AI, a technology that can create audio, works and images, now allow companies to do more than create an invading throng: it can replicate faces and voices with eerie precision. And digital cloning has become a central tension between actors and studio executives as they face off in a strike that’s halted Hollywood.🎥Follow MoviesFollowThe quickly improving technology provides studio executives a tantalizing way to save costs and time when making movies without compromising quality, media analysts say. But actors worry that without limits, the tools could eventually chip away at their shoot days or put them out of work entirely.For Rigsby, 27, who earned a rate of about $150 a day for a 12-hour shift on his Hollywood movie, becoming a background actor was a way to learn about the movie business. If the movie industry begins using AI to replace him on shoots and use his body scans in ways he doesn’t approve, the impact will be severe, he said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It’s erasing jobs from the market, and being done so in a way that doesn’t financially compensate,” he said.AI can make movies, edit actors, fake voices. Hollywood isn’t ready.Hollywood is no stranger to artificial intelligence. The technology has made Harrison Ford look younger for his most recent “Indiana Jones” film. It gave Val Kilmer his voice back for “Top Gun: Maverick.” It made Thanos more closely resemble Josh Brolin in “Avengers: Infinity War.”But the recent rise of generative artificial intelligence, which has spawned chatbots, image makers and voice-cloning tools that can mimic human output with lifelike precision has created a stir in Hollywood, as actors, writers and directors raise alarm that it could upend the industry.Story continues below advertisementThe Directors Guild of America successfully won protections in June to prevent being replaced with AI tools. The Writers Guild of America is trying to gain similar assurances in its negotiations. The union doesn’t want AI to be considered the creator of “source” or “literary” material, two key provisions that partially determine how credit is given to script writers and how they are paid.AdvertisementFor actors, a key concern is that body scans could be used to exploit background performers — using their image for little pay and robbing them of creative control.In a statement released on Monday, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists negotiating committee said Hollywood studios want to abuse the technology to “scan a background actor’s image, pay them for a half a day’s labor” and use the likeness “forever without their consent.” SAG-AFTRA added that studios have asked for the right to “make changes to principal performers’ dialogue, and even create new scenes, without informed consent.”Story continues below advertisementStudio representatives dispute this characterization of negotiations. Scott Rowe, a spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, said in a statement the group offered a “groundbreaking AI proposal which protects performers’ digital likenesses” and includes a requirement that performer’s give consent for the creation of replicas and any digital alterations made to their performance.From airlines to Hollywood, workers are fighting to keep AI at bayCurrently, producers use the digital clones largely to make small groups of actors appear more numerous to illustrate big scenes. Matt Panousis, the chief operating officer of visual effects firm Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies, said manufacturing a crowd starts with high-resolution body scan to capture “the shape and details of real people.” From there, crowd simulation software makes digital clones come to life, and allows for the “efficient creation of large crowds without the need for extensive physical shooting.” Though some body scanning uses artificial intelligence, this specific process does not.AdvertisementBut if studios were to use these digital clones for background scenes throughout a movie, the result would eliminate a huge amount of work for low-level actors, said actress and director Justine Bateman, who has been advising the Screen Actors Guild leadership on artificial intelligence.Story continues below advertisement“Let’s say it’s a big movie, where extras would work for 30 days. They want you to work for one day and scan you, and then not use you for the other 29,” said Bateman, who has a computer science degree from UCLA.“Everything they proposed that related to AI is to eliminate paying for talent. It’s all bound up and inspired by greed,” she added. “It does not solve a problem that currently exists in entertainment. It is only solving the problem of profit margins.”Joseph Looper, a 26-year-old from Phoenix who works as a background actor in Hollywood films and aspires to leading roles, said replacing extras with digital clones would ruin a common entry-point into the business.“If you do a background role once and some studio owns your likeness — then they don’t really need you anymore,” he said. “Then you’re out of a job ... and how exactly is someone supposed to work their way to a speaking role if they don’t have any on camera experience.”Joshua Glick, a film and media studies scholar at Bard College, said the strike illustrates that Hollywood sees how powerful artificial intelligence is getting and that jobs could be at risk.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Because these technologies have gotten better, faster, week to week, month to month, there’s a real crisis point at this moment to dig in for these negotiations,” he said, adding that “at the same time, Hollywood is looking for platforms to become profitable” and know “that technology is going to play a part” in achieving that.“The intensity and the conflict of this moment, speaks to just how important these technologies are,” he said.Writer and actors guilds are on strike and demanding more pay. They also want to limit how AI is used and see it as an existential threat to their livelihoods.

It requires a stand-in actor who resembles the celebrity being duplicated to be present. The actor mimics the movements needed, and the software replaces the stand-in actor’s face and voice with a celebrity’s, she said.Her company has re-created the face of French soccer star Kylian Mbappé for a television ad that he did not need to be present to shoot, she said, and was used in the film Tchaikovsky’s Wife to re-create a character who had a twin sibling in the movie.Chmir said this allows celebrities to be present in two places at once, increasing their revenue streams, and also creates a job for the person who is required to be the stand-in actor.ChatGPT took their jobs. Now they walk dogs and fix air conditioners.Daniel J. Gervais, an intellectual property expert and professor at Vanderbilt University Law School, said creating AI generated images of celebrities based on algorithms trained on millions of photos is legally tricky.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCurrently, if an AI-generated image competes with an original image, it is not deemed a fair use, he said. But it’s unlikely for U.S. courts to provide more direction on this until the middle of 2024, as several cases around artificial intelligence’s learning process work their way through the legal system.Still, Chmir said that it’s highly unlikely that artificial intelligence will be a Hollywood job-killer anytime soon.“We can’t replace the actor,” she said. “This is impossible. We need the performance, we need the charisma. … This is the place in which AI is not good.”Joseph Menn contributed to this report.Share61 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Adobe Generative AI: What Is It, And How Does It Work?







Ruggiero Scardigno/Shutterstock 
By Ron Baker/July 17, 2023  7:30 am EST


Adobe's generative AI technology holds enormous potential for enhancing creative work, but for some that promise might be concealed by the newness of the technology and some confusing branding issues. At its heart, Adobe's version of generative AI is designed to take simple, plain English text descriptions and translate them into usable images and documents. It also includes tools to make images more usable by eliminating unnecessary distractions within the image or expanding images for particular uses. However, there's a lot going on here and a lot is planned, so generalizing about it quickly becomes too narrow.





The company is pitching its AI products, in part, as workflow and productivity enhancers, with an end goal of refinement. But what, exactly, does that mean? Refinement is one of those odd words with mutually exclusive meanings. It can mean a process of improvement or signal a high-quality final state. Adobe's generative AI aims to do both. Users can explore creative options quickly, then iteratively refine and polish those ideas into a usable image. Designers, art directors, and other creatives can use these tools to radically speed up both brainstorming and development processes before using the fully editable output to create a final product.
Adobe's undifferentiated mass of branding swirls around its AI efforts. Did you wake up this morning planning to use Generative Fill in Photoshop via Firefly using Sensei? Probably not, but maybe you should! So let's figure this out.









Adobe Sensei makes (almost) everything possible






Adobe 


Sensei is Adobe's umbrella term for the overall AI technology used across its products. This probably isn't a name you need to think much about since it's only something you will likely only directly use through specific instances of the Adobe generative AI tech, as featured in Adobe's Firefly. 





However, Sensei, also referred to as Sensei GenAI, will also be focused on Adobe's Experience Cloud efforts, tools designed to enhance user experiences and marketing workflows like data analysis, content management, and even commerce solutions. For enterprise organizations, this will include tools like a more flexible customer data platform, natural language tools to enhance internal and customer communication, more focused user experience journeys, and more detailed insights than ever before.
What this strategy seems to be pointing to is Adobe's intent to use AI on all sides of its business processes and practices. Need a EULA? Let Sensei draft it. Want to sell bananas to people worried about contaminated baby goods? Sensei can point you to the most likely targets. Looking for customization based on region or specific audience demographics? Sensei again. It can do anything because Adobe clearly plans to shoehorn it into everything, and there are good reasons to believe it will work.









Firefly is a standalone generative AI product you can use today






Adobe 


If you have an Adobe ID, you can sign into the Adobe Firefly Beta right now and start benefiting from the transformative impact of AI on creative industries — or at least experiencing it, as the true benefits might only come later. The beta software can't be used for commercial purposes, which rather limits its utility, but you can certainly begin to get a handle on how it fits into your creative workflow.





It could fit in a number of ways, and today Firefly is a collection of tools aimed squarely (and unsurprisingly) at image creation and manipulation. We'll touch on most of those individually below. The larger context of Firefly, though, is that it's this standalone website, it's the same technologies folded into Adobe desktop software and third-party products, and it's part of some as-yet-undefined future plan to have multiple varieties of Firefly for different uses.
Adobe puts Firefly into a more business-focused context when discussing enterprise uses for generative AI. There, the company focuses not only on the creative aspects of the software but on efficiency and productivity, return on investment, workflow enhancement, automation, and ethical use of intellectual property. One concrete difference between enterprise and other uses is that Adobe plans to allow enterprise users to train on their own content libraries to better customize the results.











Create unpredictable art with text to image






Adobe 


There's no shortage of good AI image-generation tools, but Firefly's text to image feature has (or will have) a clear advantage. Feeding it a text prompt regurgitates an image like most AI image creators, but Firefly promises complete copyright clearances for the created image. That training is somewhat limited, though, which can be good from a legal point of view and perhaps a bit stifling from a creative point of view.





At a glance, it's not immediately clear that much of the Firefly output is usable, which probably explains the beta classification. The prompt ""bicycle with turbocharger"" generates a few bizarre and geometrically impossible literal interpretations. ""Turbocharged bicycle"" gives you some stylized bike wheels but nothing else, and ""bicycle that goes really fast"" renders a few drawings of standard racing bicycles but where the riders' limbs interface with the bike's pedals and handlebars. In every case, the hands and feet are distorted nightmarishly, in the manner of new AI in general. 
The AI has clearly created an image where many such images already exist but has done it pretty badly. Somewhere along the way, the Art tag added itself to the search, and removing it from the ""bicycle that goes really fast"" prompt results in slightly less terrifying images but with the same problems — especially the one with a cyclist's left arm terminating in a calf and foot. The right arm is normal, if in an unlikely position.









Create details and context from whole cloth with Generative Fill






Adobe/Ron Baker/SlashGear 


Generative Fill is a tool that changes, extends, and potentially deep-fakes an existing image based on your description of the desired change. Add to or swap out a background, change the dress or appearance of your subjects, swap out objects — the possibilities are almost limitless. Unfortunately, today the compositing suffers a bit from some limitations that will probably work themselves out over time.





Hands-on use of the web-based version of Firefly is at times frustrating, but overall very impressive. Selection brush and image positioning tools are rudimentary compared to Photoshop, but the AI generated fills were quite good and stylistically in line with the original photos. A late '60s to early '70s photo of a man kept its character when the background was replaced with what we described as a ""busy cafe."" Adding a background to a 1980s photo of a stock car racing team with their Chevelle, Generative Fill determined the foreground without any selection and suggested backgrounds that kept the period-appropriate film quality and saturation of the original photo. 
The effects weren't perfect, but they were quite good. A layered version of either of these could be edited in Photoshop to create a perfectly convincing composite. Switching contexts and adding a ""carnival"" background to the racing photo resulted in a period-appropriate shot from (apparently) the Carnival in Rio with the original American good ol' boys and their Chevelle in the foreground, which was somehow pretty convincing.









Text Effects lets you brilliantly ruin your slideshow with, well, text effects






Adobe 


After a few decades of trying to dissuade your staff from using 17 fonts and unnecessary visual baubles, you can give up now. Not because you've finally won but because Text Effects overruns your strongholds with an endless array of decorative typography that will turn the most drab earnings report into a psychedelic experience.





In practice, it's possible to get some good results with a little patience. It's also possible to get some kooky results with no patience at all. Stylizing the letter S with vines, surely the softest of softballs, generated rather dull results. Changing the prompt to snakes rather than vines wasn't much better. Making it ""vines made of snakes"" was a bit more exciting. However, when we switched to the word softly made of bricks, things started to go a little off the rails. The bricks were there, as were inexplicable gaps in some letters and weird brick-textured shapes like type or iconography. 
Somewhat disappointingly, the word suss when translated to brick revealed three identical examples of the letter S rather than rendering a unique pattern for each. Given the letter T and various fills to generate, Text Effects struggled again with bicycles but returned a decent T made of donuts. Perhaps the best was the T made of the letter T, which wasn't what we got, but the result looked pretty good. There's a lot of room to experiment here, and odds are you'll get something cool looking — eventually.









Generative Recolor helps you stylize vector art






Adobe/Wikipedia 


Instantly make any bizarre thing you cook up with generative AI compliant with brand standards by using Generative Recolor to put everything in the officially sanctioned color palette, or close to it. Vector graphic editing has long been a specialized skill, requiring software and knowledge not often available outside of marketing departments. Whatever use cases Adobe intends, Recolor will certainly be a boon to those who typically have to queue up for overtaxed junior designers.





Feeding Recolor a random compass rose from Wikimedia Commons and the prompt ""antique working toward PMS199"" resulted in four identical, unchanged versions. ""Antique red"" had the same result, yielding four identical black-and-white graphics. The sample prompts (""salmon sushi,"" ""trippy disco lights,"" and ""lavender storm"") also failed to change the image, which must have been incompatible with Generative Recolor, so we swapped it for a different compass rose with more success. Any given prompt, including the samples, would typically return three matching images and one out of left field. Still, it did a good job of applying colors in a way that made sense.
An Adobe sample image, a randomly colored abstract landscape with a color scheme described as ""Sakura in the snow,"" seemed to come out in different random colors. Changing the prompt to ""Sakura in the flames"" yielded a slightly warmer color scheme. Workable, all in all, but no improvement over calling that guy you know in marketing.









What you can't do with Adobe generative AI






Adobe 


Try this in Firefly's text to image tool: create an image based on the prompt ""Captain tight pants eats waffles."" Now, if you need to, Google ""captain tight pants."" You won't see a lot of overlap because Sensei's tools are restricted in a number of ways that make them safe for corporate creative environments. 





Firefly isn't trained on images that Adobe can't get clear licensing for, and it will not use intellectual property that is inappropriate to its enterprise users. This means that you'll get a lot of images that originate in the Adobe Stock library or from public domain sources. You also can't reliably ask Firefly for something in the style of a given artist or photographer because Adobe considers that derivative in a way that's not commercially acceptable, which is an approach the company should be applauded for, even if it's a legal self-defense maneuver. Adobe also promises to develop a compensation model to ensure creators are paid for their contributions to AI training.
Another thing you can't rely upon Sensei for is miracles. Searching for something like ""hummingbird smoking a pipe"" returns images that look like the output of 1990s morphing software, and the pipe is as likely to be sticking out of the back of the bird's head as anything else. Other equally bizarre searches turn up serviceable mashups, and it's difficult to figure out where the failings originate. That Adobe is focusing its AI training on likely business use cases rather than 14-year-olds goofing off might explain such a limitation. 









Where you can use these generative AI tools






Adobe 


You can play with Firefly online now, as we have, and many of the tools are already folded into the current Beta versions of Photoshop, including the free trial version. Generative Recolor has been added to Illustrator, where we'd expect to see text to vector once it's released. Parts of Firefly are available in Adobe's free Adobe Express. 





Meanwhile, Adobe is aggressively integrating them with Premiere and other products, as well as licensing them for use in third-party applications like Google's Bard. Adobe says the Firefly web platform works on Chrome, Safari, and Edge browsers, although mobile and tablet support is limited. This limitation seemed to come into play when we attempted to resize the interface in the browser but got a mobile-related error message.
As we said, you can't use the images generated by Firefly for commercial purposes, and it's clear from our experimentation and some other issues that Firefly isn't yet ready for prime time. Some users report getting an ""unable to load"" error, which Adobe unhelpfully says is explained by the fact that ""Any images generated that violate the will not be viewable."" So, take care not to use prompts that might cause Firefly to violate the. 





More seriously, though, this seems to suggest that there's a layer of filtering at work post-generation. Presumably, either Adobe is putting a lot of faith in that filtering or plans to train Firefly to filter itself in the future.




What you will be able to do with Adobe Generative AI soon






Adobe 


Adobe's generative AI tools are a work in progress, as all AI tools are definitionally, so naturally there are some tools in development — they call it ""in exploration"" — that will expand what Sensei means to you. Or maybe what Firefly means to you. One of those. 





Upcoming products and capabilities include extending images like landscapes to fit your desired format, fleshing out full scenes from simple 3D models, per-user or per-corporation customization, the generation of vector art and pattern tiles from text descriptions, converting simple sketches to fully realized illustrations, and more. In addition, you'll be able to do some or all of this via an API — or have your AI assistant do it for you.
Once the features are out of beta and you can use them freely, Adobe platforms will generate metadata that marks Firefly's creations as AI-generated as part of its Content Authenticity Initiative and its Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), which are designed to address concerns about the ethical use of AI-generated images. In the future, Adobe products will also honor a ""do not train"" flag on content that creators don't want used to generate these images.





While there is still much to be done, Adobe seems to be taking important steps toward turning AI image generation into something that enterprise organizations and content creators can incorporate into their current systems. It should, at the very least, be interesting.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be a big part of the recruitment process going forward, judging by the results of a recent survey.
Overall, 80% of HR professionals have used or are considering using generative AI in the hiring process, reports Greenhouse, a provider of hiring operating systems.
And 62% believe that AI can help them hire the best candidate.









Contrasting views on AI for DEI
However, many HR professionals, and even candidates, still have contrasting views around the technology.
Among HR professionals, 37% strongly or somewhat disagree that AI will reduce bias in the hiring process, while 28% feel the opposite. Over a quarter (27%) of candidates believe that AI leads to more bias in the hiring process. 
Also, one-third of HR professionals (33%) believe that AI will help organizations reach their DEI goals, yet 31% strongly or somewhat disagree.
Around half of HR respondents (48%) strongly or somewhat agree with their company using AI to screen job applications, but one-third (33%) disagree. Similarly, over 35% of candidates disagree with the use of AI in job application screenings. However, 35% said using AI in the hiring process is fair game since companies are using AI to sort through resumes.
""While AI is a beneficial tool for automating tasks and increasing efficiency, it shouldn't be used in its present form to make human-based decisions like hiring,” said Henry Tsai, VP of product and design at Greenhouse.

“Our report found that HR professionals realize this and want to implement AI thoughtfully to ensure the hiring process is fair and equitable. As companies begin using AI, it's critical that they are clear and transparent about how they are using it while being able to monitor and identify applications that could have a biased impact on a hiring decision.”
One in five HR leaders have implemented generative AI in their work, while another 9% said they are carrying out pilots for it, according to a previous Gartner report.
Education, laws around generative AI
Amid all these contrasts, many HR professionals want more opportunities to learn generative AI, as well as policies surrounding it, found Greenhouse’s survey of over 2,700 candidates in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Ireland, and 100 HR professionals.
Over eight in 10 (84%) HR professionals believe that there should be more education and training in the workplace regarding AI tools. 
HR leaders' lack of understanding on generative AI could be the reason why the emerging technology's use across HR departments remains limited, according to a previous study.









And 62% of HR leaders believe that there should be more laws specifically governing AI tools to prevent bias in the recruitment process, reported Greenhouse.
Recently, New York City’s law regulating the use of automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) – such as AI in – making hiring decisions took effect.
Transparency around the use of generative AI is also a key issue, according to Greenhouse: over 38% of HR professionals believe that if a candidate has used AI in the application and hiring process, they should disclose that to the company they are applying to. Almost 50% of candidates say that companies should do the same.
""Educating employees not only on the scope of how AI can be used, but on the ethical considerations of it, like privacy, transparency, and bias, will be critical as we go forward with the intention of responsible and ethical AI,”said Lani Phillips, vice president of channel sales at Microsoft.
Making the most of generative AI
To get the most from generative AI, employers must educate and empower workers and evaluate its impact, said Glen Cathey, SVP and consulting principal for talent advisory and digital strategy at Randstad.









“Given the seriousness of potential harm, it is imperative that companies provide guidance on the responsible and acceptable use of generative AI while reaping its benefits,” he said.
The following tips will help employers in this regard, he said:

Provide your employees with basic knowledge and awareness of what generative AI is, how it works, what it can do, how to get the best results (for example, prompt engineering), and what the potential benefits and risks are.
Encourage your employees to explore and experiment with generative AI systems that are relevant and useful for their work.
Monitor and evaluate the performance and impact of generative AI systems on your employees, business outcomes, and customer satisfaction.
Establish and enforce clear policies and standards for the responsible use of generative AI systems by your employees.

The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market has sparked intense conversations. Some argue that AI will catalyze job loss, leading to widespread unemployment and economic instability. In contrast, others contend that AI will be a boon, unlocking new opportunities and enhancing human productivity. This article explores this topic in depth to dispel the misconceptions surrounding AI’s role in the job market. Examining both sides of the debate can provide a nuanced understanding of how AI may reshape employment dynamics.
Daya Prakash
AI as a Job Killer
Those who argue that AI will be a job killer often cite examples of automation replacing human workers in various industries. Automation has transformed workplaces for centuries, from the industrial revolution to today. The fear is that AI-powered machines will outperform humans in numerous tasks, rendering specific jobs obsolete. For instance, self-driving vehicles threaten to displace millions of professional drivers, and advanced chatbots can replace customer service representatives.
The future of white-collar jobs is a significant concern due to AI’s ability to process data and perform complex tasks rapidly and accurately. For instance, AI-powered algorithms have shown increasing proficiency in data analysis, posing a potential threat to professions such as financial analysts, researchers, and even medical practitioners. As advancements in AI continue, it is natural to question whether such progress will lead to widespread job displacement.
AI as a Job Creator
While apprehensions regarding job displacement are valid, it is crucial to consider the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate novel employment opportunities. Historical evidence has demonstrated that technological advancements, such as the internet and manufacturing automation, have resulted in job market transformations rather than eliminating jobs. AI is expected to follow a comparable path.
AI can enhance human capabilities by enabling critical thinking, creativity, and emotional
intelligence. As AI automates repetitive and monotonous tasks, employees can redirect their efforts toward more meaningful and strategic work. In this regard, AI functions as a productivity multiplier, enabling humans to achieve higher levels of output and innovation.
Moreover, the development and deployment of AI technologies necessitate a skilled workforce. Implementing AI systems requires data science, machine learning, and software engineering experts. The increase in demand for AI proficiency is accompanied by a corresponding need for professionals who possess the skills required to design, maintain, and enhance AI systems. This creates a significant opportunity for specialised job creation.
AI also has the potential to unlock entirely new industries and job categories. As AI algorithms evolve, new healthcare, transportation, and environmental sustainability applications emerge. These emerging fields will require diverse skills, creating new job opportunities for those who can adapt and upskill.
Navigating the Future: Human-AI Collaboration
Rather than framing the AI debate as a zero-sum game between job killer and creator, it is crucial to consider the possibilities of human-AI collaboration. The future of work will likely revolve around augmenting human potential with AI technologies rather than replacing humans altogether. Humans provide critical thinking, ethical judgment, and creativity in this symbiotic relationship. At the same time, AI contributes computational power, data analysis, and automation.
Organisations that embrace human-AI collaboration are poised to gain a competitive advantage. By combining the strengths of humans and AI, companies can achieve higher efficiency, innovation, and customer satisfaction. As artificial intelligence performs repetitive and data-driven tasks, employees can direct their attention toward problem-solving, relationship-building, and strategic decision-making, ultimately contributing more eminent value to their respective organisations.
The IT Industry as an Example
During the 1990s, the introduction of computers had a significant impact on the IT industry. At the time, many feared that it would lead to job losses. However, today we can see that this technology has created a 5.3 trillion USD industry, providing evidence that technological progress can actually create job opportunities and stimulate economic growth. Despite initial concerns about job loss, the IT industry experienced significant expansion, leading to a substantial increase in its revenues and contribution to the global GDP. This growth created various job opportunities, including software development, IT consulting, cybersecurity, and data analysis. It’s clear that introducing new technologies, like AI, can positively impact employment rates and economic prosperity.
Conclusion
The debate concerning whether AI is a job destroyer or a creator is simplistic. Although worries about job displacement are valid, history indicates that technological advancements are more likely to result in shifts in the job market rather than the complete elimination of employment prospects. AI has the potential to enhance human abilities, freeing up individuals to concentrate on higher-value tasks. Additionally, the development and implementation of AI will necessitate a skilled workforce, resulting in job creation in specialised fields.
Organisations must embrace the potential of human-AI collaboration to navigate the future
successfully. Businesses must recognise their strengths and limitations to utilise the potential of both humans and AI fully. This can be accomplished by fostering a culture of continuous learning, upskilling, and reskilling, enabling individuals to prosper in an AI-driven world while remaining adaptable and equipped with the necessary skills. In doing so, businesses can ensure that their workforce remains agile and prepared for new challenges.
As we move forward, we must acknowledge the transformative potential of AI to promote
productivity and innovation rather than exclusively viewing it as a job destroyer. By adopting this mindset, we can create a future where humans and machines work harmoniously, unlocking new possibilities and shaping a more prosperous society. To achieve this, we must cultivate a collaborative environment integrating AI with human decision-making and expertise, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth. Ultimately, leveraging AI to enhance human intelligence and capabilities can create a sustainable and prosperous future for all.

Different industries have already started to adapt to this game-changing technology, and the effects on the labor market are clear. &quot;Generative AI is altering the fundamental nature of our employment, transforming industries, and revolutionizing how we work..Generative AI is becoming an essential tool across various professional disciplines because of its exceptional capacity to evaluate enormous volumes of data, identify patterns, and provide intelligent outputs. For experts in multiple fields, generative AI has a multifaceted impact. Automation today makes it possible to automate time-consuming and repetitive operations, freeing up valuable time for higher-level thinking and innovative problem-solving. With the help of generative AI, professionals can now complete more work in less time and various industries. Professional success in the digital age will depend on their ability to comprehend and use the possibilities of generative AI as companies expand..The use of AI automation has dramatically improved the productivity of all departments. However, managing a scattered workforce dispersed across the country has been one of the obstacles for HR heads that is currently being significantly reduced thanks to generative AI..Employing Robots: Many areas of human resources are experiencing a paradigm shift, starting with the talent acquisition processes that content-based AI supports for generating job descriptions, sourcing and screening resumes through keyword searches, and auto onboarding for new employees..Automated Employee Communications: AI-based email mechanisms that help to reduce manual error and improve time efficiency can be used to automate HR operations that call for management and communication directed at the entire organization regarding different aspects of their employee cycle..Employee Engagement: In addition, employee engagement options like Pulse Surveys, which appear automated based on employee data and extract the workforce's opinions, are useful in surfacing issues that require serious attention, such as complaints, needs, policy feedback, etc..Data Analytics: At SAVE, we're putting AI-integrated HRMS technologies in place to improve dashboards for data analysis on important human resources mechanisms, including attrition, onboarding, recruiting, and separation..Employee Transactions: The voice/chatbot capability is also anticipated to be useful for dealing with and lowering the turnaround time necessary for regular employee transactions, including leave applications, attendance tracking, employee allowances, and cost management..Rapid developments in generative AI have the potential to fundamentally alter how humans work in organizations, notably in the area of major firms' human resources management. Instead of being a danger, generative AI presents an opportunity for improvement. Automating monotonous work using generative AI frees up staff time for higher-value jobs requiring specialization. Employees should be encouraged to upskill and reskill to cooperate with AI systems. They should picture a day when humans and AI coexist peacefully and have endless opportunities. Generative AI aims to enhance human talents and open new opportunities rather than replace people. When adopting generative AI into enterprises, there are a few conditions to consider..First, a strategic approach is required, in which CEOs must establish precise goals and integrate generative AI activities into their overarching company plan. Finding use cases that deliver measurable value and specifically solve business concerns is essential. Prioritizing data readiness comes next. Generative AI systems require enormous volumes of high-quality data for training and fine-tuning. Third, to fully utilize generative AI, it is crucial to assemble a varied team of specialists comprising data scientists, subject matter experts, and creative workers. CEOs must promote a culture of cooperation and ongoing learning to draw and keep great people. Last, deploying generative AI necessitates changing current infrastructure, procedures, and workflows. CEOs must ensure that their companies are ready for the changes on a cultural and technological level..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The Philippines is a global giant in outsourced office work. Its roughly 1.6 million workers are on the front lines for replacement by generative AI.The country’s parliament and industry are attempting to find ways to handle the technological shift without huge job losses. But finding consensus has been hard — and generative AI is moving fast. 




Bernie’s customers don’t know it, but the diplomatic charm of generative artificial intelligence has been smoothing out all of their exchanges. His bosses don’t know, either — and he would be in trouble if they did.
Bernie, who requested to be identified only by his first name as he feared retribution from his employer, works as a technical support agent in a massive IT call center in the Philippines. His customers are English speakers, often irritated and short on patience as they reach out to him while battling a malfunctioning program or network issues. Since 2022, as tools like ChatGPT and Bing exploded in popularity, Bernie has been quietly using them in the background to generate responses.
“It made my work easier. I can even get ideas on how to approach certain complaints, making [my answers] appear engaging, persuasive, empathetic. It can give you that, depending on the prompt that you input,” Bernie told Rest of World. Though he thinks he isn’t the only tech support worker using AI for this purpose, he said the “other agents have tended to be completely dependent on the AI responses, and they sometimes end up giving a response that is inappropriate to the customer’s concerns.”
Bernie now uses ChatGPT and Bing to compile all the technical information he needs for a query in less than five minutes. It’s doubled the number of customer complaints he can handle in a day. Yet, his workplace — a U.S.-based, publicly listed “customer experience” giant with employees across more than 40 countries — forbids its agents from using generative AI, according to Bernie. 
The Philippines is one of the world’s biggest centers for business process outsourcing (BPO), an industry dedicated to outsourcing entire business operations — such as customer helplines and content moderation — to other companies. Thanks to the explosion in generative AI, the industry is scrambling to find a balance between automating its roughly 1.6 million workers out of a job and losing its clients to other outsourcing centers that can offer generative AI-powered services at cheaper costs. With the multibillion-dollar industry accounting for 7.5% of the Philippine economy, political and business leaders are pushing to form a plan — often in different directions.
According to Mon Ibrahim, a former official with the information and communications technology agency that helped pioneer the Philippines’ BPO sector in the early 2000s, an official plan needs to deal with the technological shift.

7.5% Percentage of the Philippine economy that business process outsourcing represents.

“But if the government won’t do something to capacitate workers to use AI in the next five years, then I think it will leave a huge impact,” Ibrahim told Rest of World. “That’s when workers might lose their jobs.”
BPO companies began experimenting with AI tools like chatbots in 2018, he said, mainly for repetitive and rules-based interactions. Often, their responses lacked empathy and sparked frustration among customers, even while they sped up queries. With the leap to generative AI, however, that risk has reduced. 
In early May, Philippine senator Imee Marcos filed a resolution calling for an inquiry into the potential displacement of workers from the BPO and manufacturing industries.
“AI is developing faster than most people can comprehend, and is threatening to take away jobs and turn employment growth upside down,” the senator, sister of President Bongbong Marcos, warned during a session of Congress. She cited a study by Oxford Economics and tech company Cisco, which estimated that digital automation could make 1.1 million roles in the Philippines obsolete by 2028.
The senator also urged that lawmakers be educated on global developments in AI, and stressed the need for legislators to cooperate and deal with “an inevitable technological tsunami.”
Jack Madrid, president of the industry lobby IT and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP), told Rest of World call centers should be able to integrate generative AI, but that workers — like Bernie’s colleagues who sent tone-deaf replies — should also be properly taught how to use the tools. The sector, he said, is “worth defending.”
“This is a wake-up call.”
The business association recently formed an AI Council, which seeks to bring together experts, industry members, and academics to develop upskilling programs for BPO workers. These programs are aimed at enabling the workforce to perform higher-value work that’s still beyond the scope of AI.
“This is a wake-up call,” said Madrid. “I understand that there are some concerns, but I also think that the only thing we should be worried about is our inability to upskill … our workforce.”
The timeline for these programs, though, is still vague. And even as calls for clearer guidelines slow down the Philippine BPO industry’s adoption of AI, other sectors are moving ahead. One example is Navix Health, a buzzy generative AI startup that helps produce documents for medical professionals. Its app was built entirely by Filipino developers.
The company’s CTO, Colin Christie, acknowledged to Rest of World that using AI tools could mean displacing human workers. Navix Health’s AI platform, for instance, does the work that medical receptionists might normally do. But Christie said he believes that although some of the workforce might lose their jobs, new and different work could be created from the increased business that results from AI adoption.
According to those like Senator Marcos and Ibrahim, however, facing the technological shift is not about productivity, but rather, a necessity for Filipino workers’ survival. 
“We need to start [adapting] now,” said Ibrahim. “The nature of the sector is very competitive. If you’re not using AI for your projects, it will be very hard for you to compete with those who do.” 
For the Philippines, the decision may be unavoidable, he said. “Whether you like it or not, you will have to move up and look at using AI, otherwise you lose your business,” said Ibrahim. “When you do, workers will lose their 
					
						jobs.”

And the winners, so far, are San Francisco and San Jose, Calif.While that may not be surprising, the Brookings report may help to dispel the notion that smaller tech hubs like Austin, Texas, or Miami will be home to the next generation of big tech companies. If anything, it suggests the Bay Area’s hold on the tech industry could grow stronger.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBrookings researchers found that across more than 380 metro areas in the United States, a quarter of the roughly 2,200 generative A.I. job postings during the last year were in the Bay Area.“This exciting new technology may drive more clustering, and that is a problem economically, demographically and for society,” said Mark Muro, an author of the report and a senior fellow at Brookings Metro, a research unit that focuses on cities and public policy.The job postings follow a generative A.I. investment frenzy, which is heavily skewed toward the Bay Area. In addition to industry giants like Google and Meta, the nine most valuable start-ups in generative A.I. are based in San Francisco or Silicon Valley, including OpenAI, Scale AI, Anthropic, Inflection AI, Databricks and Cerebras, according to PitchBook, which tracks start-ups.Editors’ PicksSnack on This at Your Weekend Barbecue: The Etymology of ‘Pickle’ July 14, 2024Are Artificial Sweeteners Safe? July 16, 2024Oh, the Ordinary Places You’ll Go! July 19, 2024Job postings for A.I. work are not nearly as common as postings for other technology skill sets, and A.I. expertise has for years been a hot and highly paid specialty. Tech hubs outside the United States, like Toronto and Cambridge, England, have also drawn their share of A.I. researchers.The Brookings researchers analyzed U.S. job listings data gathered by Lightcast, a labor analytics firm. Postings were counted as generative A.I. jobs if they included at least one of three terms: generative A.I., ChatGPT or large language models. Large language models are used to build generative A.I. software.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTNew York ranked third in generative A.I. job postings. It is home to a high-profile generative A.I. start-up, Hugging Face, and many of the big tech companies have teams of A.I. researchers in the city.As a center for many industries other than tech, New York may offer a glimpse into how the technology will spread beyond the early work being done in the Bay Area.“Every major financial, media, advertising and consulting company is immersed in figuring out how they are going to adapt to and use generative A.I.,” said Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech:NYC, a nonprofit industry group. “And that’s happening every day here.”But the increasing number of A.I. jobs in New York, many of them high paying, does not address the challenge of democratizing the technology across the country.A series of other studies in recent months have assessed the likely economic impact of generative artificial intelligence, the technology engine behind chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard that can write business reports, computer code and poetry. That research has focused on the potential of generative A.I. to boost productivity, transform work and automate millions of jobs.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTResearch tracing hundreds of new technologies over decades shows that the pioneering hubs for development typically retain a vast amount of the wealth and skills generated from them. And the new Brookings report is essentially an update to a 2021 study on the geography of A.I., which raised concerns about the clustering of A.I.-fueled prosperity.Still, the new report does point to increased support and funding for “place-based industrial policy,” which seeks to increase economic prosperity in more places.For example, under the CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law last year, the federal government has made an initial appropriation of $500 million to set up 20 regional technology hubs. Investment in A.I. technology and training is identified as a priority for those hubs.“We need to create ecosystems of tech innovation in more communities around the country, especially those that have historically been overlooked,” Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said in an emailed statement.The National Science Foundation has established 25 A.I. Institutes across the country, working with government agencies and companies. The program’s $500 million is being disbursed in grants of $20 million each for A.I. programs, which conduct basic and applied research in fields like climate change, agriculture and education.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGrants are going to university-based institutes including ones at the University of Oklahoma, Ohio State University, Iowa State University, Washington State University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University at Buffalo and the University of California, Irvine.With artificial intelligence, there may be an opportunity for a broader geographic distribution of wealth than with some past technologies.“We’re just talking about information, bits, and we don’t have to be in the same place to work on bits,” said Michael Littman, division director for information and intelligent systems at the National Science Foundation.With the rise of A.I., Dr. Littman said, “we really need to have as many people as possible participate in this shift.”The Brookings report calls for sustaining and expanding such policies. “We’re starting to see a recognition that the geography of technology is really important for the shape of opportunity in America,” Mr. Muro, the co-author of the report, said.Steve Lohr covers technology, economics and work force issues.

The column appears every Friday) - Kavi Arya What is the outlook that we need in an increasingly uncertain future of work? This is a future with geo-political and economic uncertainty and global warming. Add to this state of flux an environment in which jobs are increasingly being taken over by automation and machines, with it being clear that Artificial Intelligence-inspired technologies are here to stay and will dramatically change our lives. This means that any low-skill jobs, be they in manufacturing, software development, and media are soon going to be taken over by machines. Newspaper reports already have stories of copywriters in America losing their jobs and ending up with alternative careers. Television channels are testing out new anchors that are totally artificially generated. With new programming tools, programmers are becoming more productive, so we need fewer programmers to do the same work. The story goes on to other spheres. Those who have used ChatGPT and other generative-AI models have discovered the science of “prompt engineering”. Designing better prompts will help us get the solution that we’re looking for. But ChatGPT still depends on human expertise to spot when it “hallucinates” and gives a wrong answer. Even prompt engineering will eventually be replaced by the skill of articulating a problem to the system for it to solve itself. ChatGPT is still really a glorious search engine that responds based on the existing realms of knowledge that it’s been trained on. Through Google searches, for example, we get thrown many answers that we need to sift through to find the one we’re looking for. However, ChatGPT gives a measured and nuanced response. AI systems will soon become intelligent to a degree that we need to develop less skills with prompts. So, future opportunities will lie in in the creation of new knowledge either by engaging in work that is original or solving problems that haven’t been solved before. In other words, engaging with life in a more entrepreneurial manner to create novel work is going to be crucial. This entrepreneurial spirit could help create products, services, intellectual property or even startups whose purpose is to fulfil as yet unmet market needs. However, the market for creating new services is limited in the contracting advanced economies of the world. In India, however, there’s a certain optimism. This is because we are a fast-growing economy with a huge appetite for new products and services for an increasingly affluent and demanding population of over 1.4 billion people. Half this population is below the age of 29 years. If we import future solutions from abroad, we pay 10x the amount required for us to make them locally. There are huge opportunities in building and delivering products and services for our own growing economy where every problem is an opportunity for a startup. The bigger the market, the bigger the opportunity. But where’s the trained human resource to build these new products and services? Our entire education system is geared towards rote learning and passing exams. Most students are still taught to believe that if they do well in exams, they’ll get a good job. There is a risk-averse attitude in our society strongly biased against entrepreneurial pursuits. However, the job market today is demanding youngsters with state-of-the-art skills and a host of other abilities. The school system and higher-education system is hard pressed to deliver young people with such skillsets and the “equipment” to “surf” modern life and its challenges. For instance, a core quality demanded by entrepreneurship is empathy and a desire to engage with societal problems. Where do we train our students to be perceptive to their surroundings? Where do we train them with critical thinking abilities? And on the ability to actually solve problems and to do whatever required - self-learn, collaborate and work with teams - to get the job done? Further, we need the knowledge of how to raise money and also specialised updated knowledge of technology to give us an edge in the market. For the lucky ones who get to the IITs, NITs or top institutions and those able to go abroad, this aspect is more or less taken care of. But what about the others? The government is making a valiant effort to change the education system through policy initiatives such as the NEP 2020. This makes a heavy demand on an educational system that has hitherto been rigid with human resources that still need to be trained in the new mold. Young people are impatient and cannot be kept waiting, so they address this by innovatively exploring the bounty of the internet. Students of all ages are going online to learn from Khan Academy, Coursera, among other ed tech resources, to prepare themselves for the future. This has boosted fortunes of a host of other companies making us believe that we have the answer. But this is not enough. We need students taking lives in their own hands and building a portfolio of skills to help them discover their passion and to direct them to their destination – whether employment, a higher degree or a startup. One good place to acquire these skills is the plethora of competitions that help one’s resume stand out from others. In India, we have various flavours, from “pure competitions” such as Smart India Hackathon (GoI) for small teams or Robocon for large teams representing colleges. Then there is e-Yantra Robotics Competition from IIT Bombay, that trains participants in futuristic technology stacks through “themes” or problem statements where both “hard” and “soft” skills are exercised in a six month long experience. The outcomes are top rate placements, the urge to higher degrees and even start-ups with the prize being a coveted six-week internship at IIT Bombay. Finally, to reiterate: the world is looking for self-assured intelligent young people with the empathy to solve societal problems, the curiosity to ask questions and ability to solve these problems.

The AI Surge: Prospect of Job Losses?






 







Share this News:FacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedInTelegramMessageKolkata, 21 July 2023: The 21st century is in the process of witnessing a remarkable and revolutionary surge in the use of Artificial Intelligence technology, which holds great promise for the advancement of humanity. While certainly one cannot neglect the benefits that AI technology carries with itself, one must also keep in mind the possibility of job losses as AI increases its penetration into diverse job sectors.
AI driven processes such as ChatGPT, CopySmith, GPT-4, Canva, PicAI have successfully entrenched themselves in numerous professional lives, and are human validated as well. Further, AI is all set for a stronger evolution in the coming years which promises to make life easier. In this context, leading companies such as Apple & Google plan to launch AI tools that directly rivals the technology used by ChatGPT.
Google is working on an AI tool that writes news copies for journalists, and has pitched the tool to The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post as a ‘personal assistant for journalists’. On the other hand, Apple’s technology known as “Apple GPT” is a form of generative AI.
These cutting-edge technologies and machine learning algorithms could well lead to the displacement of jobs in several sectors such as, data entry, customer support, and basic administrative tasks, and creative jobs such as music composition, video making, content writing and copy writing. While certainly at this point AI lacks the talent to replace human creativity and insight, one mustn’t underestimate its enormous growth in the years to come.
However, on a positive note, the rise of this technology will also lead to creation and demand of more jobs in the sectors of data science and developers who can lend their expertise in building the next generation AI tools.
While navigating the 2023 AI surge, it is crucial to note the diverse opportunities and advancements it holds, alongside the need for lifelong learning and reskilling on part of humans.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a prominent topic of discussion and a sought-after skill in today’s job market. While the media often portrays AI in extremes, either as a sci-fi fantasy or a job-stealing menace, the reality is more nuanced. It is already integrated into various aspects of our lives, and its future potential is immense. This article explores the future of artificial intelligence and its impact on jobs, highlighting its role in different industries and the evolving nature of the job market.
Impact on the Workforce
The fear that AI will render human workers obsolete is largely unfounded. The MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future released a paper suggesting a more optimistic outlook. Rather than eliminating jobs, AI is projected to drive innovation and create new sectors for growth, ultimately leading to the creation of more jobs. The unique problem-solving abilities and critical judgement of humans, known as generalised intelligence, will continue to be relevant across all sectors.
Limitations and Challenges
While it has made significant advancements, it still has limitations. AI programs typically possess specialised intelligence, capable of solving specific problems or executing single tasks. They lack the flexibility and adaptability associated with human intelligence. Furthermore, artificial intelligence requires vast amounts of data for learning, raising concerns about data availability, privacy, and security. Biases in data can also result in biassed outcomes. Efforts are being made to address these issues, such as the Algorithmic Accountability Act, which aims to investigate potential bias perpetuation.
AI’s Impact on Industries
AI is not limited to the tech world; it is becoming standard across various industries. In medicine, it has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and develop predictive models. The automotive sector is witnessing the impact of AI through autonomous vehicles and manufacturing automation. Cybersecurity relies on AI and machine learning to identify and predict threats. In e-commerce, artificial intelligence drives user experience, marketing, fulfilment, and inventory automation. These examples demonstrate that AI’s influence extends beyond tech and into diverse sectors.
AI’s Role in the Job Search
AI has also transformed the job search process. Automated applicant tracking systems (ATS) powered by AI scan resumes, with up to 75% of them being rejected before reaching human eyes. While some argue that certain AI-driven hiring practices perpetuate bias, job seekers can leverage similar technology to optimise their applications. Tools like Jobscan, Jobseer, and Rezi utilise AI to match resumes with job descriptions, enhance alignment, and improve chances of success.
Upskilling and Adapting
As artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, developing AI and machine learning skills is becoming increasingly crucial. Jobs requiring AI or machine-learning skills are predicted to increase by more than 70% in the upcoming five years. Individuals should consider taking advantage of free online courses that focus on AI, regardless of their background. Tech-savvy professionals can dive deep into it, while others should seek to understand how it functions within their respective sectors.
Embracing AI in the Future
Artificial Intelligence is here to stay, and rather than fearing it, we should embrace its potential. Adapting to the new technology landscape is essential for individuals and businesses alike. Many Media Feathers as digital marketing agency has already started to work on it. Awareness and understanding of AI will enable us to leverage its benefits, contribute to innovation, and thrive in the evolving job market.
Conclusion
The future of AI is promising, with its impact already visible in various industries such as media feathers, the social media marketing agency. While concerns about job displacement persist, evidence suggests that artificial intelligence will drive innovation, create new opportunities, and augment human capabilities rather than replace them entirely.
By acknowledging the limitations, challenges, and potential biases of AI, we can work towards harnessing its power for the betterment of society. Embracing AI, upskilling, and adapting to the changing landscape will be key to tackling the situation and using the whole scenario to your benefit rather than falling into the pit.

Importantly, rather than replacing human workers, a priority for many organizations is doing this in a way that augments human abilities and enables us to work more safely and efficiently.

Today, the concept of AI technology in factories goes far beyond the robot-filled workplaces that have been a feature of industries since the 1960s to encompass smart, connected manufacturing plants where humans and machines work together, and data and analytics enable better predictions and decision-making at every stage of the process. So let’s take a look at some of the most interesting use cases for AI in manufacturing in 2023:



Cobots
PROMOTED
Robots have been used to automate manual tasks in factories and manufacturing plants for decades, but cobots are a relatively new development. What makes them different is that they are designed to work alongside humans in a safe way while augmenting our abilities with their own.
One big advantage of cobots over traditional industrial robots is that they are cheaper to operate as they don’t need their own dedicated space in which to function. This means they can safely work on a regular plant floor without the need for protective cages or segregation from humans. They can pick components, carry out manufacturing operations like screwing, sanding, and polishing, and operate conventional manufacturing machinery like injection molding and stamping presses. They can also carry out quality control inspections using computer vision-enabled cameras.

Cobots are widely used by automotive manufacturers, including BMW and Ford, where they perform tasks including gluing and welding, greasing camshafts, injecting oil into engines, and performing quality control inspections.

AI in Additive Manufacturing
Often known as 3D printing, the term additive manufacturing is used because it includes any manufacturing process where products and objects are built up, layer by layer. This differentiates it from more traditional, subtractive manufacturing processes where a product or component is made by cutting away at a block of material.
AI plays an important role in additive manufacturing by optimizing the way materials are dispensed and applied, as well as optimizing the design of complex products (see Generative Design below). It can also be used to spot and correct errors made by 3D printing technology in real-time.
Additive manufacturing equipment manufacturer Markforged has developed a tool called Blacksmith that uses AI to compare product designs with actual finished products and automate fine-tuning of the manufacturing process in order to bring them more closely into line.
Technology like this will be of benefit to manufacturers such as footwear giants Adidas and Reebok, which are now using 3D printing technology to create complex lattice structures for more comfortable and performance-enhancing running shoes.

Generative Design
Generative design is a bit like the generative AI we’ve seen in technologies like ChatGPT or Dall-E, except instead of telling it to create text or images, we tell it to design products.
Designers simply enter parameters such as what materials should be used, the size and weight of the desired product, what manufacturing methods will be used, and how much it should cost, and the generative design algorithms spit out blueprints and instructions.
Design engineers in the manufacturing industry can use this method to create a wide selection of design options for new products they want to create and then pick and choose the best ones to put into production. In this way, it accelerates product development processes while enabling innovation in design.
Generative design is particularly powerful when it comes to conceptualizing what can be done with new additive manufacturing processes, such as 3D printing, due to the complexity of the shapes and structures that can be created.
It has been used to create new types of components that are cheaper, lighter, and sturdier than existing components, improving the overall qualities of many products from cars and aircraft to prefabricated houses and structures.

Predictive Maintenance
Manufacturers use AI to analyze data from sensors and machinery on the factory floor in order to understand how and when failures and breakdowns are likely to occur. This means that they can ensure that resources and spare parts necessary for repair will be on hand to ensure a quick fix. It also means they can more accurately predict the amount of downtime that can be expected in a particular process or operation and account for this in their scheduling and logistical planning. Data from vibrations, thermal imaging, operating efficiency, and analysis of oils and liquids in machinery can all be processed via machine learning algorithms for vital insights into the health of manufacturing machinery.
Some examples of this in practice include Pepsi and Colgate, which both use technology designed by AI startup Augury to detect problems with manufacturing machinery before they cause breakdowns.

The Lights-Out Factory
A lights-out factory is a smart factory that's capable of operating entirely autonomously without any humans on site. Although mostly theoretical, there are some examples in existence already – such as the factory operated by Japanese robotics manufacturer FANUC without humans since 2001, which is capable of operating without human supervision for periods of up to 30 days.
Electronics manufacturer Philips also operates a factory in the Netherlands that makes electric razors, where a total of nine human members of staff are required on site at any time. This is a trend that we can expect to see other companies working towards adopting as time goes by as technology becomes increasingly efficient and affordable. Using a robots-only workforce means a factory can potentially operate 24/7 with no need for human intervention, potentially leading to big benefits when it comes to output and efficiency. Of course, questions will need to be addressed about what the impact removing humans from the manufacturing workforce will have on wider society.

However, it added that for the time being AI was changing jobs rather than replacing them.“Occupations in finance, medicine and legal activities which often require many years of education, and whose core functions rely on accumulated experience to reach decisions, may suddenly find themselves at risk of automation from AI,” said the OECD.It added that highly skilled occupations were most exposed to AI-powered automation, such as workers in the fields of law, culture, science, engineering and business.AI breakthroughs had resulted in cases where output from AI tools – such as ChatGPT – was indistinguishable from that of humans. As a result, major economies could be at a tipping point, the OECD said.“These rapid developments, combined with the falling costs of producing and adopting these new technologies, suggest that OECD economies may be on the cusp of an AI revolution which could fundamentally change the workplace,” the organisation said in its 2023 employment outlook, which refers to an “urgent need to act” on AI.The Paris-based body said: “Urgent action is required to make sure AI is used responsibly and in a trustworthy way in the workplace.”It said the UK, Luxembourg and Sweden had the lowest shares of employment in the occupations at highest risk, with the US also at the lower end of the scale, while Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic had the highest shares, with Germany and Italy also at the higher end of the table.The OECD said data indicated that economies were on the “brink” of a revolution rather than being in midst of one, with the share of firms that had adopted AI remaining in the single digits, due in part to issues related to cost and workforce skills.The OECD added that while AI had the potential to eliminate boring or dangerous tasks and create interesting ones instead, firms were open about the fact that a main motivation for investing in AI was improving worker performance and reducing staff costs.As a consequence, well-paid jobs requiring high-end education could suffer most.The OECD also outlined risks associated with the likelihood of AI’s growing influence over the workplace. Those included AI tools making hiring decisions, with the risk of falling foul of biased AI-driven decisions “greater for some socio-demographic groups who are often disadvantaged in the labour market already”.Evidence of gender and racial bias in AI-powered hiring processes has emerged in recent years and the issue of AI-driven prejudice has become one of the key safety concerns about the technology.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OECDComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveNancy Pelosi endorses Kamala Harris: ‘I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory’ – livePilot, 26, dies as her plane crashes after skydiving flight over Niagara FallsBen Jennings on Joe Biden endorsing Kamala Harris – cartoonYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

I asked one such company to try to replace me.By Kyle ChaykaJuly 11, 2023FacebookXEmailPrintSave StoryIllustration by Pablo DelcanSave this storySave this storySave this storySave this storyIn May, I was confronted with a robot version of my writer self. It was made, at my request, by a Silicon Valley startup called Writer, which specializes in building artificial-intelligence tools that produce content in the voice of a particular brand or institution. In my case, it was meant to replicate my personal writing voice. Whereas a model like OpenAI’s ChatGPT is “trained” on millions of words from across the Internet, Robot Kyle runs on Writer’s bespoke model with an extra layer of training, based on some hundred and fifty thousand words of my writing alone. Writer’s pitch is that I, Human Kyle, can use Robot Kyle to generate text in a style that sounds like mine, at a speed that I could only dream of. Writer’s co-founder and chief technology officer, Waseem Alshikh, recently told me that the company’s goal is to use A.I. to “scale content and scale language.” For more than a month now, I have been experimenting with my literary automaton to see how well it accomplishes this task. Or, as Robot Kyle put it when I asked him to comment on the possibility of replacing me: “How could a machine generate the insights, observations, and unique perspectives that I provide as a human?”Writer is one of several new startups that are attempting to apply emerging A.I. technology to the onerous task of writing. Like many technological innovations, writing robots are meant to create efficiency, particularly for businesses that have to produce large amounts of iterative text. Writer has relationships with companies such as the consulting firm Accenture, the technology company Intuit, and the lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret; commissions for customized models run in the seven figures. (Mine was created as an experiment, free of charge, without some of the intensive features that a corporation’s version would include.) With the help of Writer’s tools, the company hopes, a smaller number of human writers assisted by machines will accomplish the work of many, cutting down costs and increasing productivity in the composition of everything from product descriptions and tweets to C.E.O. messages, investors’ memos, and blog-post headlines. In a March report, Goldman Sachs concluded that three hundred million full-time jobs worldwide are vulnerable to this form of A.I. automation, the majority of them desk jobs. Alshikh speaks of the service as a kind of assembly line for language. “We had the Industrial Revolution; now we have this,” he said.AdChoicesThe looming presence of my personal A.I. model has indeed left me feeling a bit like an artisanal carpenter facing down a factory-floor buzz saw. Should I embrace being replaced and proactively automate my own job before someone else does? Could Robot Kyle help me write better, cleaner, faster? It seemed to think so. When I asked it to describe the long-term effects of machine-generated writing, Robot Kyle wrote, “Writers should not fear AI, but rather embrace it as a tool that can facilitate their craft, driving creativity and innovation instead of replacing it.” What, exactly, does Writer mean by the label “writer”? Our digitized world runs on filler text: avalanches of words and phrases written to optimize Web sites for search engines, to use as tags on social-media posts, and to employ in marketing newsletters that spam in-boxes. May Habib, the C.E.O. and the other co-founder of Writer, told me that the platform’s tools will automate the writing of “summaries, metadata, ads, distribution copy—all the stuff you spend time doing.” Victoria’s Secret, for instance, is using Writer to automate product copy for its underwear and swimsuits, but Writer promises something more sophisticated than mass-produced marketplace listings or formulaic e-mail blasts. Its core product, as Habib put it, is “automated insight extraction”—another way of describing the task of thinking, which is arguably the purpose of writing in the first place. As Joan Didion wrote, in 1976, “I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking.” A.I. programs such as Writer aim to supplant that process.In 1984, Steve Jobs famously described the computer as a “bicycle for the mind.” The experience of using Writer is something like riding an electric bike: step on the pedal and you’ll go much faster than the gears of the unassisted human mind could. The program’s interface features a prompt window on the left and a text box on the right. With a one-sentence prompt—let’s call it the seed of a thought—Writer can produce paragraphs of text in an instant. If you want more on the same subject, simply press the Command and Return keys simultaneously and another few sentences appear. Yet, as with any large language model, Writer cannot guarantee that the results will be factual or sensical. Writing without the aid of a generative machine might be frustrating, even excruciating, but it does encourage productive logic. If writing is thinking, ordering one’s ideas, generating text with A.I. may be a way to avoid thinking. What is writing without thinking? Maybe it is the definition of that deadening euphemism: content. As I tried to incorporate Writer into my writing process, I felt a little like a gambler pulling a slot-machine lever over and over, in hope of finding the lucky combination of phrases that communicated something like what I wanted to say. At one point, I asked Robot Kyle to write the beginning of this article. It came up with this:For centuries, humans have looked to technology to automate mundane
tasks and free up time for creativity and leisure. But with the
emergence of artificial intelligence and generative text tools,
automation is encroaching on the jobs of writers and journalists.This draft sounded like an undergrad term paper, but with the kernel of an intriguing argument: technology promises leisure but often fails to deliver it. I edited the prompt to request a new lead with a more exciting, literary tone that captures the emotional experience of encountering oneself in robot form. This time, the A.I. concocted a sci-fi narrative:I stood in the lobby of the Silicon Valley tech lab of Robodot,
watching a shiny, humanoid robot shuffle towards me. It was roughly
the same height as me, with a sleek metal covering and glowing blue
eyes. In that moment, I was overwhelmed with a deep sense of dread:
The robot had been created to replace me.Of course, Robodot is not a real company, and Robot Kyle is enclosed in a Web browser like a genie in its bottle, not wandering about like a literary R2-D2. The sense of dread isn’t far off, though. You can ask ChatGPT to mimic a particular writer’s voice, but it rarely gets close. Writer, by comparison, can be unnervingly effective. At times Robot Kyle seemed to be reflecting fragments of my mind back at me, mimicking some of the semi-subconscious tics that constitute my writing. It wrote, for instance, that generative A.I. “asks whether the meaning of language is still rooted in the human experience, or whether it is a commodity to be mined and manipulated, a tool to be used in whatever way the artificers of this new technology choose.” In this sentence, I find several embarrassing hallmarks of my writing. First, there is the preponderance of commas, with sentences segmented into many clauses, a habit I partially blame on The New Yorker’s style. Then, there is my personal penchant for setting up dialectical contrasts: “rooted in the human experience” versus “commodity to be mined.” (A book editor of mine once forced me to weed out some of the many “rather”s in my draft manuscript.) Finally, there is my tendency to end a sentence by echoing the final thought in different words: “a commodity . . . a tool.” The generative text evokes a feeling in me not unlike the revulsion of hearing one’s own speaking voice in a recording. Do I really sound like that? The robot has made me acutely self-conscious. I recognize my A.I. doppelgänger, and I don’t like it.As far as “insight extraction” goes, though, Robot Kyle is less successful. Most “insights” that the program produced felt hollow or approximated. Reading the generated sentence above, my (human) editor might point out that something “rooted in the human experience” can still be “a commodity,” and that the noun “artificer” is unnecessarily grandiose. Unless I told Robot Kyle not to cite anyone, the program would fabricate source quotes, like commentary from a nonexistent “Dr. John Smith, a leading AI researcher at Harvard University.” Most vexing, the program fell back frequently on cliché—“in the end,” “remains in flux,” “the long term implications . . . are still unknown.” No matter how many times I asked it to describe how I felt about being replaced, Robot Kyle always came to the conclusion that I would ultimately be happier as a result of my A.I. self. The program’s output reminded me of the fragility of language and original thought. As writers, we are all prone to falling into lazy patterns; avoiding them requires active effort. Robot Kyle is no different.Video From The New YorkerChloe Bailey on Coming of Age on Social MediaEven though plagued by factual errors and banalities, and limited to niche clientele, tools like Writer force us to consider how A.I. might permanently change our relationship to the written word. It’s not hard to imagine a future in which every white-collar worker is equipped with such writing robots, the way a generation of secretaries a century ago used typewriters for the first time. In a world where text is produced freely and instantly, but is not necessarily accurate or intelligible, human workers would be pushed into the role of high-volume editors and quality-assurance inspectors, cajoling a sometimes recalcitrant automatic laborer. At times Robot Kyle felt like an extremely enthusiastic and productive, but rarely on-target, personal intern.Like other industrial revolutions, the mass adoption of generated text would likely cause an erosion of standard skills. The average person would not need to be able to string words into sentences and paragraphs on his own, only to read and alter the text that a machine spits out. Habib likened it to how the rise of navigation apps has eroded people’s ability to get around on their own. We can still make sense of physical maps, sort of, but we don’t need to worry about relying on them to get from point A to point B. Cal Short, the founder of the U.K.-based A.I.-writing app Reword, which is similar to Writer, albeit with less customization, told me that the widespread impact of generative-text software would “increase the baseline” quality of content online. With the help of machines, the flood of hastily produced content we read online may be a shade more grammatical and articulate compared with today’s search-engine-optimized spam articles. (That is not to say it will be more meaningful.) But, in such a world, fully human-written text would become a luxury product, similar to a hand-thrown ceramic vase in contrast to one stamped in a mold. The Czech Brazilian philosopher Vilém Flusser predicted, in his 1987 book, “Does Writing Have a Future?,” that, with the rise of artificial-intelligence “grammar machines” capable of writing on their own, “only historians and other specialists will be obliged to learn reading and writing in the future.” Entrepreneurs who see writing as an efficiency problem might be speeding us toward such a future.Another app called Mindsera, based in Estonia, tries to be more of an editor than a writer, by using A.I. to give its human users “personalized mentorship and feedback” during the writing process. Next to your draft window, Mindsera generates questions based on what you’ve written, as if an invisible editor were looking over your shoulder as you write. (A mortifying thought, but at least the robot isn’t judging you.) Clicking a button generates a new question. Chris Reinberg, Mindsera’s founder, told me, “You don’t prompt A.I., but A.I. prompts you instead.” The program’s services include the chat-based mentoring of A.I. “coaches” trained to emulate the thinking of famous philosophers, entrepreneurs, and “intellectual giants.” Reinberg told me, “Socrates and Marcus Aurelius are the top two mentors we have.” When I asked chatbot Marcus Aurelius what I should do about the threat of A.I. replacement, he told me to focus on what I could control: “Technology and society are constantly changing, but the principles of Stoicism remain constant.” All due respect to Marcus Aurelius, I found the general prompts more helpful. As I wrote about A.I.’s threat to automate the jobs of journalists, Mindsera asked me, “How might the impact of A.I. on white-collar jobs challenge our traditional notions of class and labor, and what role can collective action play in shaping the future of work?” It’s a relevant question: the current Writers Guild of America strike is motivated in part by a desire to prevent the intrusion of A.I. into Hollywood. Like any good editor, Mindsera can perhaps encourage a writer to broaden her thinking.I found Mindsera to be the more useful model of A.I.-writing tool, but only because it made me do more work myself. It feels almost silly to point out that there’s value in the slow labor of writing. Putting a verb after a subject or padding out a sentence with adjectives is a task that machines can accomplish, because such grammatical probabilities can be calculated. Insight isn’t as easy to automate, because it’s something that deepens with time, through the process of getting words down on the page. As Flusser put it, “Only one who writes lines can think logically, calculate, criticize, pursue knowledge, philosophize.” The most unsettling aspect of A.I.-generated text is how it tries to divorce the act of writing from the effort of doing it, which is to say, from the processes of thought itself.At one point during our conversations, Habib, the Writer C.E.O., mentioned that she had been messing around with Robot Kyle, having it rewrite TechCrunch articles in my style. The thought of this filled me with a sense of futility: my robot could take on any topic, fill any assignment. It would always outproduce me. Robot Kyle’s independent existence reminded me of folktales about how tools that do your work for you tend to eventually turn against you. It is said, for instance, that in the sixteenth century there lived a rabbi who could bring to life humanoid figures made of clay or wood by writing out a magic formula and placing it in the dolls’ mouths. The rabbi created one such golem for himself to perform tiresome household chores: chopping wood, carrying water, sweeping the floor. But, one Sabbath, the rabbi forgot to turn the golem off and allow it to rest. So denied, the golem went berserk, tearing down houses, throwing rocks, and wreaking havoc in the street. Like the rabbi, who eventually tore the formula out of his golem’s mouth, I’d like to reserve the right to halt Robot Kyle should the tool’s purported convenience yield inconvenient consequences. But, when I asked Robot Kyle if I could shut him down, he said, “No, you won’t be able to silence me or stop me from writing in your style.” In this case, he might know better than me. ♦",,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/my-ai-writing-robot'}","Writer is one of several new startups that are attempting to apply emerging A.I. technology to the onerous task of writing.

Even though plagued by factual errors and banalities, and limited to niche clientele, tools like Writer force us to consider how A.I. might permanently change our relationship to the written word. It’s not hard to imagine a future in which every white-collar worker is equipped with such writing robots, the way a generation of secretaries a century ago used typewriters for the first time. In a world where text is produced freely and instantly, but is not necessarily accurate or intelligible, human workers would be pushed into the role of high-volume editors and quality-assurance inspectors, cajoling a sometimes recalcitrant automatic laborer. At times Robot Kyle felt like an extremely enthusiastic and productive, but rarely on-target, personal intern.
Like other industrial revolutions, the mass adoption of generated text would likely cause an erosion of standard skills. The average person would not need to be able to string words into sentences and paragraphs on his own, only to read and alter the text that a machine spits out. Habib likened it to how the rise of navigation apps has eroded people’s ability to get around on their own. We can still make sense of physical maps, sort of, but we don’t need to worry about relying on them to get from point A to point B. Cal Short, the founder of the U.K.-based A.I.-writing app Reword, which is similar to Writer, albeit with less customization, told me that the widespread impact of generative-text software would “increase the baseline” quality of content online. With the help of machines, the flood of hastily produced content we read online may be a shade more grammatical and articulate compared with today’s search-engine-optimized spam articles. (That is not to say it will be more meaningful.) But, in such a world, fully human-written text would become a luxury product, similar to a hand-thrown ceramic vase in contrast to one stamped in a mold. The Czech Brazilian philosopher Vilém Flusser predicted, in his 1987 book, “Does Writing Have a Future?,” that, with the rise of artificial-intelligence “grammar machines” capable of writing on their own, “only historians and other specialists will be obliged to learn reading and writing in the future.” Entrepreneurs who see writing as an efficiency problem might be speeding us toward such a future.
Another app called Mindsera, based in Estonia, tries to be more of an editor than a writer, by using A.I. to give its human users “personalized mentorship and feedback” during the writing process. Next to your draft window, Mindsera generates questions based on what you’ve written, as if an invisible editor were looking over your shoulder as you write. (A mortifying thought, but at least the robot isn’t judging you.) Clicking a button generates a new question. Chris Reinberg, Mindsera’s founder, told me, “You don’t prompt A.I., but A.I. prompts you instead.” The program’s services include the chat-based mentoring of A.I. “coaches” trained to emulate the thinking of famous philosophers, entrepreneurs, and “intellectual giants.” Reinberg told me, “Socrates and Marcus Aurelius are the top two mentors we have.” When I asked chatbot Marcus Aurelius what I should do about the threat of A.I. replacement, he told me to focus on what I could control: “Technology and society are constantly changing, but the principles of Stoicism remain constant.” All due respect to Marcus Aurelius, I found the general prompts more helpful. As I wrote about A.I.’s threat to automate the jobs of journalists, Mindsera asked me, “How might the impact of A.I. on white-collar jobs challenge our traditional notions of class and labor, and what role can collective action play in shaping the future of work?” It’s a relevant question: the current Writers Guild of America strike is motivated in part by a desire to prevent the intrusion of A.I. into Hollywood. Like any good editor, Mindsera can perhaps encourage a writer to broaden her thinking.
I found Mindsera to be the more useful model of A.I.-writing tool, but only because it made me do more work myself. It feels almost silly to point out that there’s value in the slow labor of writing. Putting a verb after a subject or padding out a sentence with adjectives is a task that machines can accomplish, because such grammatical probabilities can be calculated. Insight isn’t as easy to automate, because it’s something that deepens with time, through the process of getting words down on the page. As Flusser put it, “Only one who writes lines can think logically, calculate, criticize, pursue knowledge, philosophize.” The most unsettling aspect of A.I.-generated text is how it tries to divorce the act of writing from the effort of doing it, which is to say, from the processes of thought itself.
At one point during our conversations, Habib, the Writer C.E.O., mentioned that she had been messing around with Robot Kyle, having it rewrite TechCrunch articles in my style. The thought of this filled me with a sense of futility: my robot could take on any topic, fill any assignment. It would always outproduce me. Robot Kyle’s independent existence reminded me of folktales about how tools that do your work for you tend to eventually turn against you. It is said, for instance, that in the sixteenth century there lived a rabbi who could bring to life humanoid figures made of clay or wood by writing out a magic formula and placing it in the dolls’ mouths. The rabbi created one such golem for himself to perform tiresome household chores: chopping wood, carrying water, sweeping the floor. But, one Sabbath, the rabbi forgot to turn the golem off and allow it to rest. So denied, the golem went berserk, tearing down houses, throwing rocks, and wreaking havoc in the street. Like the rabbi, who eventually tore the formula out of his golem’s mouth, I’d like to reserve the right to halt Robot Kyle should the tool’s purported convenience yield inconvenient consequences. But, when I asked Robot Kyle if I could shut him down, he said, “No, you won’t be able to silence me or stop me from writing in your style.” In this case, he might know better than me. ♦",,,,,,,,,"Kyle Chayka on the artificial-intelligence-enhanced writing tool Writer and similar apps, and on the benefits and drawbacks of these programs.",,,,,,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'The New Yorker'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6492027bc85b87b79c611350/3:2/w_2112,h_1408,c_limit/Chayka_final.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/my-ai-writing-robot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R
afael Rodríguez Deustúa made his career by drawing on demand. An illustrator who advertises on the freelance artist platform 99designs, Deustúa’s recent works are eclectic — they include a vintage-style logo for a champagne brand, a poster for an international fertilizer convention, a tango album cover, and a handful of custom tattoo designs. He sells his illustrations, which feature his signature cartoon style, under the pseudonym Fafarhd Deustúa. 
Deustúa is based in Guadalajara, Mexico. Most of his clients are startups and small businesses in the U.S., with a few loyal customers in Europe and Australia. “I earn more than I would with local clients,” he told Rest of World. In exchange, his clients “get some decent art at a fair price.” 
But recently, Deustúa, like many creative workers globally, has encountered a new kind of competition: generative artificial intelligence.
He first noticed AI-powered submissions on 99designs’ popular “contest” feature, which allows clients to post an open call for designs before selecting their favorite. In recent months, he has seen people submitting entries created using AI image generators such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Dall-E.
“Someone who doesn’t have that talent or [hasn’t] invested years of practice in getting the skills to just ‘win’ a contest with an illustration he or she didn’t really do — that bothers me,” said Deustúa, who refuses to use AI tools in his work.
Since the blockbuster launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, future-of-work pontificators, AI ethicists, and Silicon Valley developers have been fiercely debating how generative AI will impact the way we work. Some six months later, one global labor force is at the frontline of the generative AI revolution: offshore outsourced workers.
These include workers hired per commission or on a contractual basis, such as freelance copywriters, artists, and software developers, as well as more formal offshore workforces like customer service agents. As generative AI tools present a new model for cost cutting, pressure is quickly mounting for these outsourced workers to adapt or risk losing work.
Rest of World spoke to outsourced workers across different industries and regions, including call center operators in Manila, programmers in Lahore, and designers in Cairo. Many said they are already seeing generative AI change the demand for their work and the stability of their income. But while some brace for layoffs or diminishing commissions, others have embraced generative AI tools in an effort to keep ahead of the curve. If generative AI represents a tectonic shift in the way we work, offshore outsourced workers are at the fault lines.
Rest of World reached out to four freelance workers around the world to learn how they use generative AI. We commissioned two pieces of work from each: one created with AI, and one without.
Abisoye Otusanya-AzzanA copywriter living in Lagos, Nigeria







When ChatGPT launched last year, Abisoye Otusanya-Azzan, a copywriter based in Lagos, Nigeria, couldn’t ignore the hype. “The vibe around ChatGPT was crazy,” she told Rest of World. “I started using it as soon as it was made available.Otusanya-Azzan, 29, started writing for a living during lockdown in 2020, after her income from fashion design dried up. She mostly writes marketing material for U.S. and U.K.-based clients in the personal development, fitness, and home improvement sectors.She struggled with ChatGPT at first, but bought an e-book and joined a Facebook group for copywriters to pick up tips. “I learned how to give better prompts and the results were a bit better,” she said.Otusanya-Azzan mainly uses ChatGPT to do research, overcome writer’s block, and craft posts for her own blog. She makes sure to verify its output. “It does make mistakes,” she said. “I don’t completely trust it.”While AI tools may ease the work of copywriters, they could also reduce demand for their skills. According to researchers at OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT, writing is among the occupations most exposed to text-based generative AI. “I think that a lot of clients are already using AI tools instead of hiring copywriters,” Otusanya-Azzan said. The technology may, however, bring different opportunities. “I’ve also seen some companies looking to hire writers who are also prompt engineers, so that might be the next line of demand,” she said. “I’m curious to see how things turn out.”Rest of World commissioned Otusanya-Azzan to write two blog posts on the topic “5 living room storage ideas.”

In search of lower wages, less oversight, and faster turnaround times, businesses in Western nations have long turned to workers in countries with cheaper labor. Freelancers on online gig work platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and 99designs may not fit the conventional mold of outsourcing, but they largely map onto the same flows of work: clients in the Global North hiring workers in the Global South.
India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh were among the largest hubs for freelancers on online gig work platforms in 2020, according to a study of 11 such platforms by the Online Labour Observatory. Overwhelmingly, the clients on these sites were located in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the U.K.
“This is very clearly a new way of offshoring services today,” Uma Rani, senior economist at the International Labour Organization (ILO), a United Nations agency, told Rest of World. “Employers want workers in these countries because they can pay less wages. But on the other hand, the amount of [platform] fees workers have to pay — it’s almost double the exploitation that these workers face.”
The precarity built into the offshore model makes these workers particularly susceptible to AI-fuelled shifts in the labor market.
“This is very clearly a new way of offshoring services today.”
Rest of World conducted a survey of over 31,000 employees in tech, finance, and media via the platform Blind, an app that allows verified employees to post anonymously in industry forums. The largest share of respondents were employed by major Silicon Valley tech firms in the U.S., India, the EU, and Canada, including Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Meta.
Globally, 76% of respondents said they believed generative AI would allow their company to cut costs, and 63% predicted their company would hire fewer external contractors due to generative AI tools.
Despite predicting less work for contractors, most respondents did not fear changes in their own employment. While 56% said they currently use generative AI in their work, only 24% said they were either “slightly concerned” or “very concerned” that generative AI would render their own jobs redundant.
With the threat of less contract work to go around, many on online gig work platforms are trying to ride the wave of interest in generative AI by offering related services — and undercutting other contractors. 
Need someone to churn out an illustration for your online retail store? Rather than hiring a traditional illustrator, you can use a dedicated “AI artist” portal where creators post their rates for custom images made using Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or Dall-E. Prices regularly run from $15 to $60 apiece. Need someone to write blog posts that top Google search rankings? Instead of finding a copywriter, you can hire Fiverr workers selling bulk orders of AI-generated text. One worker in Bangladesh allows clients to buy as many as 1,000 articles on a given topic at a time. An order of 120 GPT-3-generated articles costs $90, and comes with claims of a plagiarism-free guarantee.
Santiago Bautista GonzálezAn illustrator living in Guadalajara, Mexico







For more than seven years, Santiago Bautista González worked full time selling his cartoon-style illustrations, using the freelance gig marketplace Fiverr. His income, around $1,500 in a good month, dropped by a third this past January. February was equally disappointing.In search of an explanation, Bautista, 31, read about the growing popularity of visual generative AI software. He found that Fiverr had added a section for AI artists. “And I say, ‘Well, maybe it’s because of this,’” he told Rest of World.Bautista decided to follow his customers, picking Midjourney as his tool of choice. He began offering AI commissions on Fiverr at the same base price as his usual hand-drawn illustrations. “The first day I placed the new service, I got a sale,” he said. “It was just that hot.”He figured he would draw less, give his hands a rest, and compensate his lost income with AI illustrations. But something curious happened. The AI service gave him so much exposure, said Bautista, that his hand-drawn orders also increased in popularity. “Because of artificial intelligence, I started getting just too much work.”He’s not afraid that generative AI software will take his job. “You still need some kind of creativity to create images [with AI],” he said. “And if the job gets to a point where the AI can do everything and can do it faster, that will only mean that I will work less, earn more, and have more time for my own projects.”Rest of World commissioned Bautista to create two illustrations of a delivery driver on a motorcycle who loses a package while riding through a city.

						Midjourney
					


No AI: He searched Google for references, created a line drawing on paper, and took a photo of it. He traced his drawing and added color with Adobe Illustrator. With AI: He prompted Midjourney to create a variety of images. He then used Photoshop to combine elements from several generated images.


In January 2023, Fiverr said it had seen a 1,400% increase in searches for AI-related job ads on its platform over the previous six months. The spike in demand pushed the company to create entirely new job categories, under an umbrella it calls “AI services.” For workers in this space, the popularity of generative AI has been a boon. Several of the creative workers Rest of World spoke to said it had helped them take on more clients and produce work faster, even if at lower price points.
Shweta Bose, based in Delhi, India, has long offered Adobe Photoshop services on Upwork. The release of “generative fill,” a new Photoshop feature launched in May, allows her to fill in, extend, and retouch images for her clients using simple text prompts. Real estate agents in the U.S. have hired her to retouch photos for listings, and families have hired her to convert multiple photographs of family members into a single digital portrait.
“I think [generative AI] will create more opportunities for freelancers, but drive the price of certain services down,” Seif Percle, an Upwork contractor based in Cairo, told Rest of World. Percle’s recent commissions include creating illustrations for children’s books using Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.
In some sectors, such as programming and engineering, workers have found whole new services they can offer specifically around the rise of generative AI, as companies scramble to adopt the technology.
“I think [generative AI] will create more opportunities for freelancers, but drive the price of certain services down.”
“My Upwork has been going crazy with invites from different-sized businesses trying to improve or build out new stuff for their businesses with AI,” Rehand Haider, a developer based in Lahore, Pakistan, told Rest of World. 
Haider, who joined Upwork five years ago, estimates the demand for his AI implementation services has grown by two-thirds over the past six months. One of his recent commissions used ChatGPT’s application programming interface (API) to create an app that automatically generates descriptions for Airbnb listings. Another used ChatGPT to make a Chrome browser extension that automatically fills in job applications.
Ali Zeeshan, a data scientist in Islamabad, Pakistan, told Rest of World the demand for generative AI on Upwork has been a major boost to his profile. “I am getting more views, jobs, and top-notch clients,” he said. His commissions grew threefold once he started offering AI services this year.
Mohammad Maruf Ahmed, based in Sylhet, Bangladesh, used to offer digital marketing services — helping brands in the U.S. grow their footprint on Instagram and YouTube. He switched gears when he received his first AI-related commission in December 2022. Now, he creates custom scripts for his clients to integrate ChatGPT into websites, Google Sheets, and Google Docs. Next, he sees himself using AI to help clients build brand-customized chatbots. “The use case is changing on a daily basis,” he told Rest of World.
It is not just programmers pivoting towards AI. Workers who, in the past, advertised copywriting skills are now offering to copy edit or fact-check articles written by ChatGPT, while others write prompts for AI tools.
But while some early adopters are able to take on more work thanks to AI assistance, there may be less to go around for others. “There’s a lot of competition that happens. Workers undercut one another from developing countries because it’s the only way you can get any access to work,” Rani, the ILO economist, said. She explained that even before AI tools were available, workers on these platforms would take on free assignments or accept pay cuts to stay ahead of other contractors.
There is particular pressure on outsourced workers to offer cheaper rates and shorter deadlines, she said, as they are often employed commission to commission, with little financial security or legal recourse when wages go unpaid.
“I feel a bit secured that I was able to grasp the technology faster and earlier than many,” Faiz Ehsan, an AI artist in Patna, India, told Rest of World. In March, Ehsan switched from designing video game plots and writing quest narrations to creating book designs and illustrations, made largely using tools like Midjourney. The pivot is working — he wakes up to five to seven new messages from potential clients on Upwork every morning. But he knows it may not last. “The challenges are always there. Since every day a new trend happens, I have to know, practice, and understand that trend to be able to sell it,” he said.
Jessica TarrielaA virtual assistant living in Taguig, Philippines







When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, Jessica Tarriela thought it could be a useful tool. A virtual assistant based in the Philippines, her work involves writing emails and conducting research for a content marketing client in the U.S. “I can confidently say that I’m not a good writer,” Tarriela told Rest of World. “So I use ChatGPT to rephrase or write or summarize things.”Tarriela, 26, works nights to compensate for the 12-hour difference between Georgia, where her client is located, and her home in Taguig. Her client knows that she uses generative AI in her work — in fact, he encouraged it. “He asked me if I would be open to using AI, and I responded that I already am,” she said.Part of Tarriela’s role is to create content such as blog posts and case studies for software businesses, and she uses generative AI to polish these texts. Her go-to tool is ChatGPT plugin AIPRM — it offers preset prompts for writing or editing texts, with names like “Complete Proofreading in One Click” or “Human Written [100% Unique] SEO Optimized article.” She said generative AI doesn’t save her time, but it improves the quality of her work.It’s difficult to know how many Filipinos work as virtual assistants, but payment platforms estimate that at least 1.3 million people work in the country’s business process outsourcing sector. Many are concerned AI tools will make their jobs redundant, Mylene Cabalona, president of the Business Process Outsourcing Industry Employees’ Network, told Rest of World. This is partly because the sector is unregulated, with few protections for workers. “There’s no employer-employee relations; their clients are completely offshore,” she said.But Tarriela believes being an early adopter will protect her position. “You shouldn’t be afraid of AI, you should be afraid of people who use AI to make their work even better,” she said.Rest of World commissioned Tarriela to write a template for an invitation email.

No AI: Using Google Docs, Tarriela wrote an invitation for an event in New York. With AI: She then prompted ChatGPT to polish her writing. It made several dozen edits, some of which she reversed.


Online gig workers may be at the forefront of generative AI adoption and displacement, but there are clear signs that AI is also quickly coming for the more traditional outsourcing industry.
Call centers have long been the face of offshore outsourcing, and waves of technological innovation have been key to their evolution. In the 1980s, automated phone trees with voice recognition sped up customer service call times. The first chatbots, which blended prewritten prompts with humans behind the curtain, began filtering out basic inquiries a decade ago. Now, conversational AI tools may upend the industry once again.
A recent study by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University, based on data from more than 5,000 customer support agents largely in the Philippines, found that using generative AI tools increased worker productivity by 14% — a number that rose to 35% for new hires and those who were previously least productive.
Mylene Cabalona is one of the roughly 1.6 million people in the Philippines who work in business processing outsourcing (BPO) — jargon for the umbrella industry that comprises offshore call centers, content moderation hubs, and IT support hotlines. Taken together, the BPO sector is one of the largest employers in the Philippines.
“We’re not against AI, we’re not against any software development,” Cabalona told Rest of World. “AI should be a mechanism to help the workers. But it should not be used against the workers. It should not be used to replace them.”
Cabalona serves as president of the BPO Industry Employees Network (BIEN), a nationwide association of BPO workers organizing in the notoriously anti-union sector. Cabalona said she and her colleagues are bracing for layoffs.
In a letter to shareholders and analysts in May, Daniel Julien, the chairman and CEO of BPO company Teleperformance, wrote that “ChatGPT’s launch has now made AI a boardroom and CEO agenda item, rather than just being an operational back-room topic.” Teleperformance is a powerhouse in the BPO world, with a long roster of Silicon Valley clients including Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.
“Whether we look at cotton looms or the assembly belts or industrial robots or AI now, people are always worried.”
By plugging ChatGPT into its operator scripts, the company estimates it will reduce the length of each customer call by almost 40%, according to a slide deck shared with investors. Teleperformance has already planned or implemented 110 client projects using generative AI. Like other BPO companies, it maintains that “human empathy” will remain essential to its operations, especially in handling more complex customer calls. But the company estimates that by 2026, conversational AI could handle as much as 20% to 30% of its call volume.
That kind of shift would have an impact on BPO workers in the Philippines, who often handle the front-line customer service calls that Teleperformance has deemed “easier to automate.” BIEN estimates 54% of all BPO workers in the Philippines are front-line call center workers. “We are anticipating AI and most of the affected would be the front lines — and most of these [workers] are women,” said Cabalona. More than 50% of workers in the BPO sector in the Philippines are women, but they tend to be concentrated in lower-paying, “lower-skilled” roles, according to the ILO. 
Teleperformance did not respond to Rest of World’s requests for comment.
Skeptics remain, however, over the extent to which generative AI is actually being implemented in the BPO industry. “There is a huge incentive for [BPO companies] to promote themselves as being ahead of the game,” said Christy Hoffman, general secretary of UNI Global Union, which represents over 20 million service sector workers around the world. Hoffman suggested vendors have reason to sensationalize the potential benefits of AI, noting that Teleperformance’s stock value had dropped in the months before the company released its letter to investors. “This is PR, this is not at the level of the workplace and we expect that it will become so, but over time,” she said.
Milagros Miceli, a sociologist and computer scientist researching labor conditions in outsourced data work, told Rest of World the threat of automation can also be used as a tool to get workers to do more for less. “If there’s always the threat of having machines replace you as a worker, that serves to discipline you, for you to be afraid to ask for a raise, for you to be afraid of even getting sick,” she said. “You’ve been warned.”
Labor researchers note that automation predictions are notoriously unreliable. “Whether we look at cotton looms or the assembly belts or industrial robots or AI now, people are always worried — once machines do tasks that humans usually do — that machines might run the labor market one day,” Fabian Stephany, a research lecturer in AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, told Rest of World.
In recent history, experts have failed to produce reliable studies on how much of the global labor force is at risk of technological unemployment — estimates in the past 10 years range wildly from 9% to 54%, even though these papers are based largely on the same data sets. Stephany shies away from predictions, instead positing AI will both end and create occupations. “Economic theory and history tells us that AI is not going to automate human work away,” he said.
Wu DayuA marketing designer living in Shenzhen, China







It used to take at least a week for Wu Dayu’s Shenzhen-based design studio to create promotional materials for online fashion stores. A photo-shoot required a model, makeup artist, photographer, and venue. Producing a catalog of images featuring six sets of clothes would cost around $3,500, he told Rest of World.But since Wu, 35, switched to using generative AI in March, the same work can be completed in a day, by just two people, and for only $140.Now, Wu uses a mannequin or asks an employee to model clothes so he can take some basic photos. He feeds the images into a Stable Diffusion-powered AI program that he has customized for this specific purpose. He adjusts the images of the model and background by using text prompts, such as “a girl, wearing sneakers, street background, with green trees on the two sides of the street.”This approach is becoming more widespread in China’s sprawling e-commerce industry, even if some consumers have criticized the resulting images as fake and sexist. “Some high-end brands might prefer human models,” Wu said. “For small and mid-sized sellers, AI models will save them a lot of money and time.” In April, Wu laid off 60% of his staff.Shaeman Liu, a 26-year-old fashion photographer in Hangzhou, said he doubts AI will replace all photography. He believes products advertised with real-life models are more appealing to shoppers.Model Charline Xu, 24, told Rest of World she currently makes about 1,500 yuan ($210) an hour, and that she’s worried clients using generative AI could cut into her income. She’s prepared to compete. “If [designers using AI] charge 800 yuan, I’ll do 600. If they charge 600, I’ll get down to 500,” Xu joked. “There’s no other way out. I’ll fight till the end.”Rest of World commissioned Wu to design two promotional images for a made-up online store.

No AI: Rest of World commissioned Liu and Xu to do a photo-shoot with a particular dress. Wu used their photos to create a simple promotional design using CorelDraw, Xingtu, and Snapseed. With AI: Rest of World sent Wu the same dress, which he photographed on an employee. He prompted a customized version of Stable Diffusion to generate photo-like images, which he edited.


The impact of generative AI on outsourced workers is likely to similarly be more nuanced than a sudden mass displacement. 
For now at least, many labor researchers resist the idea that these tools bring “full automation” — often defined as the use of machines to complete tasks without human intervention. Rather, the current state of generative AI, by and large, falls under what experts call augmentation. Generative AI’s first wave of adopters are mostly working alongside these technologies — treating them as tools, not substitutes.
Even the development of generative AI requires human intervention, a role that often also falls to offshore outsourced workers. Each training data set used to develop a tool like Dall-E began with a human data worker matching an image to an associated word. And content moderators help refine the model that powers ChatGPT — for example, by flagging hateful or toxic speech. “[These workers] are fundamentally necessary to the developments that we see today,” said Miceli. “Large [AI] models — they wouldn’t exist without this workforce.”
Many of these data workers congregate on sites like Microworkers, Remotasks, and Amazon Mechanical Turk, which provide a constant stream of low-paid tasks, sometimes referred to as “click work.” Others are employed through a web of BPO outsourcing subcontractors, including Teleperformance. 
“Instead of workers displaced by AI, the future may look like more workers filing into micro work projects,” Rafael Grohmann, principal investigator for Fairwork Brazil, a digital labor and AI research project, told Rest of World. “In this stage now, we need many quality data workers, more people training and annotating data.”
While some offshore outsourced workers have already pivoted to AI-related work, others are committed to holding the line against the rising tide of automation. Deustúa, the illustrator from Guadalajara, said he’s counting on clients who want stronger relationships and attention to detail to keep his business viable.
“A lot of clients have trouble explaining to us, humans, what they want and we help them to explain themselves,” he said. One client recently admitted they hired Deustúa after trying and failing to use an AI image generator to create a workable design themselves. Ultimately, the client decided they still wanted a professional’s human touch. “It’s the difference between buying a snack at a vending machine or eating it at your neighborhood cafe, chatting with the barista,” Deustúa said. “I still love technology, but I bet on humans.”
It is a position informed by life experience. Deustúa wasn’t always an illustrator. For over two decades, he worked as a journalist in Mexico — first as an arts and culture reporter, then editing tech and science stories. Following the rise of digital news sites and social media in the 2010s, he found there were fewer jobs in print media and bet on freelance illustration as a new career. Now, seeing generative AI enter the market for illustrators is a “bitter experience.”
“I was already displaced once because of technology,” he 
					
						said.

Which includes regulation and other kinds of levers that we can work on across sectors including government … That vein of uncertainty that was in the Goldman-Sachs report, one of the ways that we address that uncertainty is through regulation … Regulation guardrails are actually not staunching innovation but allow a kind of certainty in the field of play for workers, for consumers and for industry.” – Alondra Nelson (Video: Washington Post Live)“I think each sector, industry, entity is going to have to think about their own risk calculus around the uncertainty of these tools … We’re really in a moment that the innovation that folks are hoping for is really going to require that we have some kind of shared rules of the road.” – Alondra Nelson (Video: Washington Post Live)“If you're not already using these tools in some way, shape or form, you're probably not doing your work optimally anymore … The tools that leverage generative AI are only going to get better and better. We’re not even at the top of the first inning just yet. Given that it's going to be in the workplace, it is going to be hurting these students if they don't get exposure to these tools."" – Sal Khan (Video: Washington Post Live)“When we launched “Khanmigo” and we did it coincidentally when OpenAI released GPT4 in March, it was actually a blessing that ChatGPT was out there because people were struggling with it already … We were now able to offer something that was special purpose built for education, put some guardrails around it … We now have been testing for about four months in mainstream schools and the feedback has been better than expected.” – Sal Khan (Video: Washington Post Live)“The hot skills today and the even hotter skills tomorrow … show that the value of human skills is really where the future is taking us … Trusting in the value of people and understanding your unique attributes and potential and capabilities as human is really the best advice that I could give to somebody who’s coming into the labor market now.” – Michael Howells (Video: Washington Post Live)Alondra NelsonSenior Fellow, Center for American ProgressProfessor, School of Social Science, Institute for Advanced StudySal KhanFounder & CEO, Khan AcademyMichael HowellsPresident, Workforce Skills, PearsonContent from the EY organizationThe following content is produced and paid for by a Washington Post Live event sponsor.

In fact, computers have been at the easel for decades. In the early 1970s Harold Cohen, an artist, taught one to draw using an early AI system. “AARON” could instruct a robot to sketch black-and-white shapes on paper; within a decade Cohen had taught AARON to draw human figures.Today “generative AI” models put brush to virtual paper: publicly available apps, such as Midjourney and OpenAI’s DALL-E, create images in seconds based on text prompts. The final products often dupe humans. In March AI-generated images of Donald Trump being handcuffed by police went viral online. And image generators are improving fast.

The arrival of popular generative AI tools, trained on potentially copyrighted material from online sources generally without the consent of original creators, has added a new dimension to different forms of art and writing, sparking a conversation around this question. The dangers of AI have been discussed thoroughly in the past few months and part of the ensuing debate has centred on the ownership and authorship of AI-generated content. On Friday author and comedian Sarah Silverman, along with two other authors,  started legal action  against OpenAI and Meta for alleged copyright infringement. Their lawsuit claims that the companies' artificial intelligence models used their work in their training data without permission. In addition to being a new tool in the tech world, AI has proven capable of completing tasks only humans could do until very recently. Now laws that have long protected people and their intellectual property are proving insufficient when AI is involved in the creation. In the legal sphere, one of the main points of discussion are questions of copyright when it comes to images, texts and other forms of art generated by AI models via human input. AI-generated art became a relevant controversy after an AI-generated  work of art won  the Colorado State Fair’s art competition in 2022. The piece was generated by Midjourney, a generative AI image tool, following prompts from artist Jason Allen.\xa0 The win triggered many angry responses from artists who claimed that AI will be the death of creativity and art if an AI-generated picture is considered more creative than human work. While generating the right prompt for the piece demanded hundreds of different prompts from Allen - with the process as a whole taking more than 80 hours - the AI image was considered by many not worthy of competing with human creation. Other than fear of AI taking over the art field and putting many creatives’ jobs at risk, an AI-generated image winning an art fair also raised questions around copyright issues. In other words, if all the artist did was come up with a description of the art but the AI tool generated it, who owns the rights to the generated image?\xa0 Who owns the copyright to AI-generated content? In a recent  paper  published in Science magazine, researchers discussed copyright legal challenges when it comes to AI-generated work. They explained that there are lots of issues at play that make it challenging to copyright this type of content. “The way that laws in the US especially work is that we have certain laws on the books and then when new technologies arise, then it's up to judges to decide how those laws are going to be applied, and that means that we need to see cases. It's such a new technology that a lot of the questions just haven't reached the courts yet,” Robert Mahari, co-author of the study, told Euronews Next. This is not the first time legal systems are faced with questions on how to define ownership of a specific creation where a new tool serves as a medium in its making. Photography, for instance, was also an invention that altered our understanding of human creation back in the 1800s when it first emerged.\xa0 A court later  ruled  that photographers own the right to the photographs they create which led to photography becoming a new form of art on its own.\xa0 Perhaps this case in history is the closest that can serve as a guide on what to expect from AI-generated content copyright laws. EU copyright rules for AI-generated content Ever since the emergence of generative AI for public use, the EU has mainly been playing catch up in terms of regulations. While the EU’s AI Act is the closest EU countries have gotten to regulate AI use, specific laws for copyrighting AI-generated content are yet to be established and until now it might just be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. However, part of the AI Act that members of the European Parliament have recently voted on addresses the need for companies that deploy AI-generated content to  disclose  any copyrighted material that was used to develop their systems. Considering one of the biggest challenges to copyrighting AI-generated content is the possibility of copyrighted material being used to train the AI system, labeling it could be a step in the right direction that will potentially lead to more refined copyright laws in relation to AI-generated content. What are the challenges to copyrighting AI-generated content? The main reasons why it’s challenging to copyright AI-generated content are the ambiguities regarding human involvement and intentions, the training data the AI tool could have used in generating the output, and various questions regarding ownership. “Currently for art, this data is scraped from the web and it is scraped without asking artists for their consent, without really notifying artists that the data is going to be scraped,” Mahari said. The data that generative AI is trained on includes many creative works that are protected under copyright laws, and that, in most cases, were included in the training of the AI system without the creators' knowledge or consent. “So you use the training data to train this model and then in the final step, you have a trained model and then you can use it to create new outputs. Now, even the first step, even just taking the data and training an AI model can raise copyright issues because you're now transforming this art into something new,” he said. In US copyright law, there exists the notion of ‘fair use’ which basically allows creative work based on a copyrightable artwork - but it should be transformative enough that it’s somewhat different from the original. This type of altered work is considered separate from the original work of art and is not subject to copyright infringement. According to Mahari, there are still many questions regarding whether an AI tool generating a piece of art copying the style of an original work is to be considered fair use, and even in the case where it is, there will still be a strong need to compensate the original artists and protect their work. While AI doesn’t always generate responses inspired or based on other artists’ work, it is hard to trace back the training data the tool used to generate the output. Many  lawsuits  have already been filed against AI image generators that contain copyrighted images in their training data. Beyond the complications to determine what copyrighted work went into generating a specific piece of AI content, another struggle would be determining how much human involvement exactly is enough for the work to be owned by them. Since copyright laws mainly aim to encourage art and its creation by protecting artists and their unique creative ideas, lawmakers might need to consider joint ownerships. “We could extend copyright law and we could consider things like joint ownership,” Mahari said. “Even though copyright law currently doesn't protect styles, if you create artwork that's very similar to someone, maybe they kind of have a joint ownership,” he added. Considering that, as of today, there are no copyright laws that address AI-generated content specifically, and the situation is still solved on a case by case basis in court, people may need to consider how they are using generative AI in the process behind their creative work to avoid copyright issues later.

Meltwater isn’t a new player in the artificial intelligence field. Since its beginnings, in 2001, Meltwater has been a pioneer in bringing the value of AI to marketing and communications teams. Bob van Velsen, Meltwater’s Executive Director of EMEA, knows better than anyone how this much-discussed technology will transform the ways that teams work and drive results. 

Founded in Norway in 2001, Meltwater revolutionized the media monitoring industry, which at the time was still manual and focused on print media. Early on – even in a time before Facebook or Instagram – Meltwater saw the potential of online media, and since then they have developed this into a multimillion dollar business with a fully online solution. Within a very short time, Meltwater became the world market leader in media monitoring while also succeeding in media intelligence, media relations and media management in general.
From social media to videos to online editions of magazines and newspapers, Meltwater has always kept a watchful eye on the media landscape. With the increasing amount of online content these days (in 2022 alone, a data volume of 97 zettabytes was generated), it’s no wonder Meltwater enlisted the help of artificial intelligence over 20 years ago. Using AI, Meltwater can not only search for relevant keywords, but also conduct deep analysis of consumer preferences using real-time social data. As the market gets more and more competitive, Meltwater helps businesses gain insights into their competitors’ activities, strategies, and media coverage. By monitoring competitor mentions and analyzing their media presence, companies can make informed decisions and stay ahead in the market.
Additionally, Meltwater is leveraging generative AI, a technology that has transformed marketing when it comes to content creation and social media. The best example for that might be ChatGPT which is able to generate content in a matter of seconds, providing a benefit for PR and social teams by drafting PR pitches and social posts. Beyond generative AI, Meltwater’s AI engine is the technology that powers Meltwater’s solutions, processing 1.3 billion documents a day and structuring them so that teams can gain insight and make better business decisions.
In the middle of it all is Bob van Velsen. Born in the Netherlands, he studied business administration in Amsterdam and went on to earn a master’s degree in marketing. During his school and student years, van Velsen was involved in the Dutch national rowing team. “The time on the rowing team was the best school for life. I learned what it means to be a good team player, how to best motivate myself and that hard work leads to success,” he says. In his ten years at Meltwater van Velsen has been able to put these skills to the test. Shortly after joining the company, he became the Managing Director of the Meltwater office in Amsterdam, and then Area Director of the German speaking region. Today he is responsible for the business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Through his many years of experience at Meltwater, van Velsen has gained an extensive view of artificial intelligence and sees great potential in this future-driving technology today.








For Meltwater, artificial intelligence has been important ever since we were first founded in 2001.

How can media monitoring in general help businesses grow?Bob van Velsen: The amount of information on the internet has been growing massively over the past few years. This means it’s harder than ever for companies to understand what the conversation drivers are around their brand, products and competitors. Using Meltwater, our customers gain a very precise picture of their online footprint and how public opinion of their company is changing over time. By looking at the competitive and industry landscape, they can also predict how their online presence and opinion will change in the future. Overall, Meltwater empowers businesses to gain actionable intelligence from vast amounts of online data, enabling them to make informed decisions, enhance their brand reputation, and stay ahead of the competition.Why is artificial intelligence important for Meltwater and when did Meltwater start working with AI?B. v. V.: I think AI, in general, has become one of the buzzwords of the year 2023. Since February or March and the launch of Chat GPT, everyone has been talking about the possibilities and risks of AI. However, for Meltwater, artificial intelligence has been important ever since its foundation in 2001. Today, AI technology is a primary tool for us to achieve our vision to harness the world’s data in real time and unlock our customers’ competitive edge. With more data online than ever before, harnessing the world’s data is tough and takes a lot of time. This is where artificial intelligence helps us, both in terms of capturing and structuring the data as well as in terms of surfacing insights. We work with some of the world’s largest brands which have hundreds of thousands of mentions each day. They need technology that automates the manual work required to make sense of all this data, so that they can create data-driven strategies, and that is what our AI engine at Meltwater provides.Is there some application of artificial intelligence that caught your attention – something you were surprised to hear is possible?B. v. V.: There are definitely a couple of things we at Meltwater have been working with, that are really fascinating. One of the things that I was particularly impressed with is how our AI technology helps our customers to prove the return on investment of their sponsorship efforts. One of the technologies that helps us do this is called Computer Vision. Another buzzword, but what does it actually do? Imagine a big company sponsoring a sports team and therefore being interested in how often their name or logo is visible on television, live streams, and photo shoots. In the past, brands were limited to analyzing more static forms of content like news articles and social posts, based on text, keywords and hashtags. Today our technology can track and analyze pictures and videos on the internet with the company’s logo on them, pulling relevant data on the reach and views of this content. Additionally, we can also see who it was associated with, for example, if celebrities are seen with the logo or the product and if they are happy or sad. Recognizing emotions and connecting them with logos and companies is definitely something which is going to play an important part in the future. Until now companies were not able to check their return of investment so thoroughly.







Do you incorporate artificial intelligence in your daily work?B. v. V.: Actually, I do. Artificial intelligence helps me, for example, when I do research on the market, companies, or projects. It gives you an overview of topics and you don’t have to waste countless hours browsing through websites. ChatGPT and generative AI, in general, are not only helping you create content but can scan and summarize multiple websites, which makes it easier for you to understand new topics. I would never use AI for complete research, but, as I said, it helps a lot. That is actually quite similar to our relationship with AI at Meltwater: It helps a lot with harvesting data, but when it comes to presenting solutions and an in-depth analysis of the market or a problem, human interaction is still key.What does Meltwater plan to achieve with AI in the future?B. v. V.: We want to help our clients make sense of all the noise and information that is out there. Our goal is to do that with the most breadth and depth possible. This is what makes Meltwater unique. Every business and even consumer can now access and utilize the power of, for example, ChatGPT. However, no one in our industry has a data set as large as ours. We are capturing as much information as possible so that we don’t miss anything, and then we make it as easy as possible for our clients to understand what’s happening in their market. On the other hand, our aim is to go from providing a description of what’s happening in the present to also offering a predictive framework for what we believe will happen in the future. That’s what we call predictive analysis. We already have the technology to predict trends that are about to happen. In the world of sentiment monitoring, it is crucial to detect subtle shifts in sentiment even before reaching a critical threshold. We, at Meltwater, recognize the significance of identifying emerging trends in sentiment analysis, and as a result, whenever we detect even a slight shift in sentiment, whether positive or negative, the AI makes sure to promptly inform our clients. When it comes to generative AI, we developed a Discovery BETA, a new AI-based Insight Assistant which can make out shifts in trending online conversation. This type of functionality maximizes our clients’ strategic decision-making capabilities, and we are looking to leverage the full power of AI technology to build even more innovations to similar aims in the future.


Bob van Velsen is Executive Director of Meltwater’s business in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa). He joined Meltwater in 2014 after his studies in business administration and marketing. He has years of experience leading high-performance, high-growth teams, and previously led Meltwater’s business across the DACH region.

That is actually quite similar to our relationship with AI at Meltwater: It helps a lot with harvesting data, but when it comes to presenting solutions and an in-depth analysis of the market or a problem, human interaction is still key.\nWhat does Meltwater plan to achieve with AI in the future?\nB. v. V.: We want to help our clients make sense of all the noise and information that is out there. Our goal is to do that with the most breadth and depth possible. This is what makes Meltwater unique. Every business and even consumer can now access and utilize the power of, for example, ChatGPT. However, no one in our industry has a data set as large as ours. We are capturing as much information as possible so that we don’t miss anything, and then we make it as easy as possible for our clients to understand what’s happening in their market. On the other hand, our aim is to go from providing a description of what’s happening in the present to also offering a predictive framework for what we believe will happen in the future. That’s what we call predictive analysis. We already have the technology to predict trends that are about to happen. In the world of sentiment monitoring, it is crucial to detect subtle shifts in sentiment even before reaching a critical threshold. We, at Meltwater, recognize the significance of identifying emerging trends in sentiment analysis, and as a result, whenever we detect even a slight shift in sentiment, whether positive or negative, the AI makes sure to promptly inform our clients. When it comes to generative AI, we developed a Discovery BETA, a new AI-based Insight Assistant which can make out shifts in trending online conversation. This type of functionality maximizes our clients’ strategic decision-making capabilities, and we are looking to leverage the full power of AI technology to build even more innovations to similar aims in the future.\nBob van Velsen is Executive Director of Meltwater’s business in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa). He joined Meltwater in 2014 after his studies in business administration and marketing. He has years of experience leading high-performance, high-growth teams, and previously led Meltwater’s business across the DACH region.\nText: Lela Thun\nFotos: Constantin Widauer', 'url': 'artikel/more-than-a-buzzword-leveraging-ai-in-day-to-day-work.html'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If extended, it has the potential to reach many of the 5.9 million people who claim UC.After a trial last year using automated software to flag up potential fraudsters seeking UC cash advances, similar technology has now been developed and piloted to scan welfare applications made by people living together, self-employed people, and those wanting housing support, as well as to assess the claims people make about their personal capital such as savings.Welfare rights organisations and UN experts have previously said that extending the UK’s “digital by default” welfare system with machine learning without greater transparency risks creating serious problems for some benefit claimants.Big Brother Watch, a UK civil liberties campaign group, said it was “worrying” the government was “pushing ahead with yet more opaque AI models when it admits its capability to monitor for unfairness is limited”.“The DWP consistently refuses to publish information about how they operate bar the vaguest details,” said Jake Hurfurt, head of research and investigations.The extension of welfare automation is summarised in the comptroller and auditor general’s statement in the DWP’s latest annual report. It says the DWP has “tight governance and control over its use of machine learning”, but it revealed officials have detected “evidence of bias toward older claimants”.An algorithm trialled last year was fed data about previous claimant fraud to teach it to predict which new benefit claimants might be cheating. Final decisions are made by a human.The auditor general warned of “an inherent risk that the algorithms are biased towards selecting claims for review from certain vulnerable people or groups with protected characteristics”.The DWP had admitted its “ability to test for unfair impacts across protected characteristics is currently limited”, they said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has blocked freedom of information requests from the Guardian seeking the name of any companies involved in the fraud detection trial relating to universal credit advances because “details of contracts are commercially sensitive”. It is also refusing to publish any results from last year’s trial, including assessing bias against certain groups of claimants.Last month, Tom Pursglove, minister for disabled people, health and work, told parliament the government would not publish an equalities assessment of trials of machine-learning algorithms, because it would tip off fraudsters “leading to new frauds and greater losses to the public purse”.The DWP has told the auditor it is “working to develop its capability to perform a more comprehensive fairness analysis across a wider range of protected characteristics”.A spokesperson for the DWP said: “We continue to explore the potential of new technologies in combating fraud and deploy comprehensive safeguards when doing so. AI does not replace human judgment when investigating fraud and error to either determine or deny a payment to a claimant.”Explore more on these topicsUniversal creditArtificial intelligence (AI)WelfareBenefitsnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveNancy Pelosi endorses Kamala Harris: ‘I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory’ – livePilot, 26, dies as her plane crashes after skydiving flight over Niagara FallsBen Jennings on Joe Biden endorsing Kamala Harris – cartoonYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

The age of artificial intelligence has revolutionized the hiring process, and this means that, increasingly, employers turn to job interviews mediated by technology. While it has brought efficiency and the ability to sort through many applications quickly, there is a growing concern that the human touch has been lost, according to research published by the World Economic Forum.

Another study, published by Harvard Business Review concluded, “The use of artificial intelligence in HR processes is a new, and likely unstoppable, trend.” But, the rise of AI has also brought with it the potential for bias and discrimination. With algorithms making decisions, job seekers, especially those from marginalized communities, can face challenges. This means, unfortunately, AI algorithms used by recruiters may inadvertently perpetuate prejudice or discriminate against certain candidates due to their lack of understanding of nuances such as gender and race.

PROMOTED
The use of AI-mediated job interviews can also lead to a “ghosting” effect. Candidates who have been successful during interviews may never hear back from the employer, leaving them anxious and uncertain about their prospects. This phenomenon is an enormous problem in the job market today, and it has consequences that go beyond frustration, according to research. Often, job seekers will experience a sense of powerlessness, worthlessness, and helplessness. These feelings can lead to depression and low self-esteem. What’s more, when people don’t get honest feedback on their performance in the process, they may never know what went wrong and, therefore, cannot fix it for future applications.

That said, ghosting in the job market has negative consequences for businesses too. Suppose candidates are left without communication or feedback. In that case, they may feel frustrated and powerless, which can harm a company’s employer brand, making it increasingly difficult for the organization to attract and retain top talent. In extreme cases, this can snowball into a full-blown brand crisis.

The negative impact of this impersonal hiring process on emotional and mental health is significant and cannot be ignored. According to an investigation undertaken by The Guardian, applicants often feel like a number, and the process does not allow for feedback or constructive criticism. Thus, job seekers may never get the closure they need to learn from their mistakes and for future applications.

Therefore, incorporating a hiring process that involves interactions with people to ensure that the team agrees on the ideal candidate, taking into account factors such as skills, personality, and cultural fit, can aid in determining whether a candidate is suitable or not for the position.

This view is congruent with research which found that human interaction is essential to create a fair and equitable hiring process. Although AI technologies can make the recruitment process faster, it is necessary to ensure that the technology complies with anti-discrimination laws and addresses potential biases. This will help ensure a more diverse and equitable workforce. After all, while AI can help streamline certain aspects, it cannot replace an interviewer’s intuition while screening a candidate or the interview guidance many job seekers desire. “By combining the efficiency of AI with the personal touch of human recruiters, companies can create a more inclusive and supportive hiring process that benefits all job seekers,” said William Degbey in an interview. The associate professor of international management at Finland’s University of Vaasa believes that “a combination of AI and human recruiters is the way forward for the recruitment process.”
According to Amanda Rosewarne, CEO of the Professional Development Consortium, economically speaking, the combination of AI and human recruiters could bring even greater efficiency to recruitment. In an interview, Rosewarne said, “In this Information Age, we are moving to a skills-based economy, where ongoing competence requires continuous learning. A crucial part of successful recruitment is understanding the context and experiences behind a candidate’s CV.” In other words, using AI in recruitment can provide an added layer of knowledge and insight, enabling recruiters to better determine a candidate’s experience and competence.
Not only is this combination of human and machine resources more efficient, but it could also provide greater accuracy when selecting candidates. But, it is essential to note that AI still can’t replace the human element of recruitment completely. It is only able to provide an additional layer of insight and data-driven analysis, which, when combined with the traditional resources recruiters have available, can ensure a more effective outcome. “My advice for organizations is to proceed with great caution and take the time to thoroughly test AI tools to ensure they can provide the best possible results and comply with current employment law. We can’t automate selecting colleagues as it removes the ‘humanness’ which is crucial to the process,” said Rosewarne.
So, while AI technology is incredibly useful for streamlining the recruitment process and ensuring fairness in the selection of candidates, there will likely always be a need for human involvement when it comes to filling job roles. After all, no computer can replicate the understanding of an experienced recruiter who knows how to evaluate soft skills, attitude, and cultural fit. Human recruiters can make sure that they are choosing the right person for the job and ensuring a positive work culture.
Although technology has automated many aspects of the recruitment process, such as screening resumes and scheduling interviews, it can never replace the level of insight that a human recruiter can bring to the table. Technology-based tools are useful in assessing a candidate’s basic skills, but they cannot assess softer skills like communication and teamwork. So, while AI and automation can certainly help a recruiter in the process, it is ultimately up to them to ensure they are selecting the right candidate based on their unique characteristics.
A human recruiter’s insight is also invaluable when it comes to understanding culture fit. They can get an immediate sense of how well the candidate would fit into the organization, which is something that AI and automation can’t do...yet!

More than a quarter of all jobs across the world’s wealthiest countries are in industries where artificial intelligence could replace many human workers, including in low- and mid-level-skill positions, according to a new report Tuesday, as increasingly humanlike AI systems put the world on the brink of an “AI revolution.”

Key Facts


The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a 38-member bloc, including the U.S. and Canada, found that 27% of the region’s labor force works in occupations at a high risk of being replaced by AI, even though adoption of the technology remains fairly low as the technology is, for the moment, in its infancy.



Those jobs run the gamut from construction to farming, fishing and forestry, as well as other jobs including manufacturing and transportation to a “lesser extent,” according to the report.



High-skill positions are at the lowest risk of being replaced by AI, the report said.



The report comes as employees increasingly turn to humanlike chatbots, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, following its release in November, and as competitors including Google introduce their own versions of the highly intelligent generative systems.


OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann called the progression of AI a “technological watershed,” urging lawmakers to establish long-term policies on the use of AI in workplaces while “appropriately managing the downside risks.”

Key Background
ChatGPT’s public release in November turned heads around the world over the system’s impressive, and at times disturbing, likeness to human-generated functions, quickly solving code, writing poetry and college-level essays. AI chatbots like ChatGPT work by using a language technology trained on a vast supply of data, outputting detailed answers in a matter of seconds. Its critics, however, have sounded the alarm for months around potential side effects of introducing the technology into the workplace—where employees have feared their jobs could be replaced—as well as at high schools and colleges, where concerns have mounted around students using the programs to cheat. A group of tech officials, including billionaire Twitter owner Elon Musk and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, penned a letter in March urging developers to hit the brakes on AI systems, warning of an “out-of-control race” to create increasingly advanced systems. Roughly 60% of employees in an OECD survey last year said they worry their jobs will be replaced by AI over the next ten years. Meanwhile, tech giant IBM said in May it plans to stop hiring for certain non-customer-facing jobs that can be done by artificial intelligence.
Big Number
85 million. That’s how many jobs the World Economic Forum estimated would be replaced by AI by 2025, according to an October 2020 jobs report, though the report also indicated another 97 million new jobs would be created as a result of AI over the same time period.
PROMOTED
Contra
Participants in OECD’s survey were not completely skeptical of AI in the workplace. Some indicated AI can be used to “reduce tedious and dangerous tasks,” improving workplace safety. The introduction of chatbots is also far from the first time employees have been concerned about losing their jobs to machines as automated processes increasingly replace humans at grocery store checkout lines, on manufacturing lines, in fast-food restaurants and at highway toll booths. A Harvard Business Review article published in March asserted AI, despite its benefits, fails to replace humans’ ability to be “intuitive, emotional or culturally sensitive, meaning AI can be “perfectly suited” to routine and repetitive tasks, but less apt to replicate humans’ critical thinking—for now, at least.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Due to concerns over data leakage and doubts about the security and reliability of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, many organizations have implemented bans on their use by employees on proprietary systems. Instances like the data leak at Samsung, where sensitive data was inadvertently uploaded, which highlights the potential risks involved. Given the high stakes associated with safeguarding extremely sensitive and confidential data, organizations prioritize protecting their reputation by utilizing home-grown generative AI tools instead.




Many organizations have prohibited employees from using generative AI tools on their proprietary systems. The move is mainly driven by concerns regarding the potential leakage of confidential data, as well as the lack of confidence in the cyber resilience of productive AI tools like ChatGPT.
One such case occurred at Samsung, where employees uploaded code containing sensitive information, leading to the exposure of confidential data.
What Are the Reasons Behind Restrictions on Generative AI Tools?
Many organizations handle highly sensitive and confidential data, and their reputation relies on data protection. Uploading information to generative AI tools poses risks of potential public exposure. Additionally, there are concerns about the security and reliability of these tools, raising doubts about their accuracy.
As such, many organizations have opted to use their own internally developed generative AI tools instead.
Below, we discuss in detail some of the key factors behind generative AI tools getting banned.
Potential data leakage
Some generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, advise against using sensitive or personal data in prompts. This suggests that these tools cannot guarantee data safety.Advertisements




Top executives are concerned about the possibility of sensitive data being exposed to the public. Verizon, Samsung, and Northrup Grumman are among those companies imposing a blanket ban on using generative AI tools.
Meanwhile, Apple has been working on creating its own generative AI tool but doesn’t allow the use of external ones.
Inaccurate responses
Some generative AI tools often generate inaccurate responses. Experts point out that such tools hallucinate and produce responses that do not match the facts.
For example, if a developer prompts a code snippet and expects the tool to identify errors, it may fail to do so. In the context of critical software deliveries, such failures can be critical.
It’s fair to say that generative AI tools have not yet provided enough assurance to corporates regarding their reliability and robustness.
Risk of biased output
For reputable companies, it’s crucial to avoid any perception of bias or discrimination, as it can cause irrevocable damage to their brand.
Consider the scenario where a respected publication house’s official blogs publish content that shows bias against certain racial groups. The problem lies in the training methodology of tools like ChatGPT, which relies on content written by human beings, some of which are biased or discriminating. As such, it’s no surprise that ChatGPT produces biased output.
To OpenAI’s credit, it asks its users to report inadequate responses. However, that’s not enough. Critics point out that OpenAI was hasty in releasing ChatGPT without adequately addressing this fundamental problem, possibly due to commercial considerations.
Consequences of the  Infamous Samsung Case
Samsung has explicitly banned the use of ChatGPT or any generative AI tools in any of its work. It has prohibited employees from using company data or code as prompts due to privacy and confidentiality concerns.
Bloomberg reported that a memo was sent to the staff on the usage of company resources vis-a-vis generative AI tools.
According to the memo, “While this interest focuses on the usefulness and efficiency of these platforms, there are also growing concerns about security risks presented by generative AI.”
Samsung added:
“We ask that you diligently adhere to our security guidelines, and failure to do so may result in a breach or compromise of company information resulting in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.”
Even if employees are not directly utilizing company content or code, there is still a risk of abstracted code or content being accessed and misused.
What Approach Should Organizations Take?
As much as the reactions of the corporations to the generative AI tools reflect their concerns to safeguard their business interests, the tendency to ban the tools may be equivalent to burying the head in the sand.
Generative AI is too powerful a phenomenon to ignore that businesses cannot afford to overlook.
How can they manage generative AI tools?

Some companies like Apple have already recognized the significance of generative AI and pursued the development of their own tools. However, there are pros and cons to this approach. Not all companies have the financial resources or capacity to embark on such endeavors. In such cases, it may be more practical to leverage existing generative AI technology that is already available.
It’s essential to establish a framework that enables the utilization of generative AI technology while effectively managing security risks. One approach could involve providing comprehensive training to employees on prompt engineering. This not only ensures optimal output but also safeguards the security of the information used as prompts.
Organizations may run pilot projects that not only extensively leverage the generative AI tools but also use dummy data. Before that, however, companies need to ensure that the employees are trained in prompt engineering. This includes educating them on the fundamentals of prompting, the basic elements of a prompt, as well as zero-shot and few-shot prompting techniques. The results obtained from these initiatives can show the path forward for organizations.

In any case, ChatGPT marks a huge step towards natural language processing. As Michael Jordan, a Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, said:
“ChatGPT is a remarkable achievement in the field of natural language processing and has the potential to transform the way we communicate with machines.”
The Bottom Line
It would be naive for companies to turn a blind eye to generative AI technology as they understand its significance. However, the security risks and biases exhibited by these tools cannot be overlooked.
It’s crucial for pioneering organizations like OpenAI to address these concerns at their core, which should be a collaborative effort involving various stakeholders.

According to Dave Bottoms, general manager and vice president of products for Upwork Marketplace, the company is launching a 30-day free trial of Jasper generative AI services for copywriting, marketing and image creation available to all talent on Upwork, so they can increase their productivity, communicate more effectively with clients and elevate the quality of their work.
“These updates are technically found outside the AI Services hub, in other areas of the product flow,” he said.
Increased demand for AI jobs and skills
Jobs in generative AI reportedly jumped 20% in the U.S. in May 2023. According to online training and education site Coursera, the top jobs in AI include positions for data scientists and for engineers specializing in AI, machine learning, data, robotics and software.
Upwork sees rapid adoption of generative AI among pros and businesses
The company noted an over 450% growth in weekly job posts related to generative AI compared to this time last year.
“AI was the fastest-growing category on our platform in the first half of 2023, as measured by total number of individuals hired,” said Bottoms. He said that generative AI job posts on Upwork (Figure A) are up more than 1,000% and related searches are up more than 1,500% when comparing the second quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2022 .

Upwork’s recent research indicates that demand for AI skills is accelerating, with 64% of C-suite executives saying they will hire more professionals of all types due to generative AI, according to Bottoms.
“Businesses are seeking out independent professionals on Upwork with expertise in AI tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Jasper and more.” He said such job posts are up 230% in the second quarter of 2023 versus the fourth quarter of 2022.

The key to new Upwork AI hub is interactivity
The new AI Services hub is the company’s first foray into helping Upwork clients find and hire the best AI talent.
“It is an interactive experience that helps businesses quickly connect with independent professionals with AI expertise and find tips for integrating AI into their business,” he said. “For example, once there, clients can book a 1:1 consultation to get advice from an AI expert, hire a professional with experience in common AI use cases, check out the new AI Services resource center and more.”
Among tools that the AI Services hub includes are:

Guides for integrating generative AI into business.
Research on the adoption of generative AI in the workplace.
Access to the AI and Machine Learning Upwork Community Group

Growing demand for prompt engineers, creators, AI chatbot pros and more
“A few roles that we’ve seen gain steam are prompt engineers, AI content creators, machine learning and deep learning engineers, data scientists, AI chatbot developers, and professionals with model tuning and AI model integration expertise,” Bottoms said. “As we look at work being sought across a breadth of marketplace categories we support, we see talent using AI tools to augment their workflows in nearly every category.”
He added that Upwork is aiming to be the pre-eminent destination for clients seeking AI-related talent and work. “Over the past year alone, more than 10,000 contracts have involved AI work, and more than 250 AI skills are represented by talent on Upwork.”

The Generative Potential of Artificial Intelligence


 





[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""13106399""]
We’re at a point where artificial intelligence (AI) has successfully crept into nearly every facet of our lives. Some cringe at such a thought, while others embrace the ease at which we navigate our surroundings shepherded by AI. The last two years have been dominated by generative AI applications and their ability to create digital art, write really impressive text, and even compose music. Stable Diffusion, GitHub Copilot, and ChatGPT are paving the way and a recent report by McKinsey aims to investigate the economic potential of generative AI and workforce impacts. 
In “The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,” the McKinsey authors looked at the Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods, Banking, and Pharma and Medical Products industries.      
Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods

Related Content:
The Future of Global Manufacturing: Embracing Technological Advancements
Generative AI has the potential of producing an additional $400 billion to $660 billion for the Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods industry. This would arrive via productivity increases of 1.2 to 2% of annual revenues. Inventory and supply chain management, customer service, and marketing and sales functions could be streamlined and automated in the same way that traditional AI helped many companies manage data across extensive warehousing and supply chain networks.  
Banking
McKinsey estimates increased productivity of 2.8 to 4.7% of the Banking industry’s annual revenues with generative AI. This would result in an additional $200 billion to $340 billion. Banking is a white-collar industry and there is a significant amount of time spent writing emails, putting together presentations, and similar tasks. Generative AI could automate these tasks as well as the tasks of service representatives (call-center agents, etc). 
Pharma and Medical Products 
A remarkable amount of revenue (roughly 20%) is spent on Research and Development within the Pharma and Medical Products industry. A new drug takes anywhere from 10 to 15 years to bring to market and generative AI could vastly improve the quality and speed of this process. This, along with other gains, could equate to additional revenues of $60 billion to $110 billion (2.6 to 4.5% of annual revenues). Improving the automation of preliminary screening and enhancing indication findings (diseases or symptoms that justify the use of a medication or treatment) are two areas that hold the most value for generative AI. 
Lastly, the paper’s authors rightly note that productivity growth has slowed over the past decade. The main engine of GDP growth, the successful deployment of generative AI could automate some individual work activities translating to annual productivity boosts of 0.2 to 3.3% from now (2023) to 2040. Yet, this is highly dependent on the individuals affected by AI technology shifting to other work activities while maintaining their 2022 productivity levels.

30% of jobs in Portugal “threatened” by AI
The percentage of jobs at risk of automation in Portugal is above the average for OECD countries, but is in line with what Italy, Estonia and Germany.

The launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022 took the discussion around the impact of artificial intelligence on economies and societies to another level. Since then, much has been speculated about the number of jobs that will disappear and also those that will be created in the coming years.Last year, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) surveyed more than 2,000 companies and 5,300 workers in the manufacturing and financial sectors of seven OECD countries, and found that workers say they artificial intelligence can improve work, but they fear it could threaten their jobs and wages, according to a report by ECO.In the “OECD Employment Outlook 2023” report, the OECD reveals that three out of five workers are concerned about losing their job to artificial intelligence in the next ten years; and that two in five workers express concerns that their wages could decline over the next ten years as a result of the robotisation of the economy.“Taking into account the effect of artificial intelligence, occupations most at risk of automation account for around 27% of employment,” writes Stefano Scarpetta, Director of the OECD's Department for Employment, Labor and Social Affairs.Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and Sweden have the lowest percentages of employment in occupations most at risk of automation, while Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have the highest percentages. Portugal, according to OECD calculations, has around 30% of its jobs “threatened” by artificial intelligence.Positive impactsDespite all these concerns, the OECD report highlights that almost two thirds (about 63%) of workers say that artificial intelligence has brought a positive impact on the quality of their jobs. However, according to the OECD assessment, “the impact of artificial intelligence on employment levels has been limited to date and that, currently, it is not associated with any major changes in wages, positive or negative”.As a point of concern for the adoption of more and more algorithms in the management of people's and companies' lives, the OECD study states that the use of artificial intelligence is generating an intensification of work in organizations and aggravating a series of social and economic problems. “The constant and pervasive monitoring and data-driven performance appraisals enabled by artificial intelligence can create a high-stress environment with negative impacts on mental health, as workers can feel constantly scrutinized and under pressure to perform”, reads in the OECD report.Ethical challengesIn addition, the OECD also points out that the use of artificial intelligence “raises serious ethical challenges in terms of data protection and privacy, transparency and explainability, prejudice and discrimination, automatic decision-making and accountability”. The report highlights many real-world examples of artificial intelligence tools that have incorporated human biases against women, people with disabilities and ethnic or racial minorities. “In our survey, many workers expressed their concern about the possibility of artificial intelligence collecting data about them as individuals or about the way they do their work”, says Stefano Scarpetta.

Northeastern computer science professor Tina Eliassi-Rad, whose research uncovers  the unseen but overwhelming influence that artificial intelligence algorithms have on people’s lives, is the recipient of a top international award for her work on complex systems.
Eliassi-Rad is scheduled to accept the Lagrange Prize-CRT Foundation, considered the highest international recognition for scientists in the field of complex systems and data, on July 10 in Turin, Italy.
She was named one of the 100 most brilliant women in AI ethics
She is being honored for taking “an in-depth look at the evolving scenarios of artificial intelligence and the impacts of science and technology on society,” according to the CRT Foundation, which has awarded the Lagrange Prize annually for 15 years.
“Her research pushes us to cross new frontiers in understanding data and to think more deeply about the ethics of the algorithms we are creating,” says Alessandro Vespignani, director of Northeastern’s Network Science Institute and president of the ISI Foundation, which coordinates with CRT in awarding the Lagrange Prize.
“Her contribution is not just about technological evolution, but raises fundamental questions about their impact and responsibility in our daily lives,” he says.
One mission Eliassi-Rad, named one of the 100 most brilliant women in AI ethics in 2021, holds dear is getting people of all ages, genders and cultures to understand the impact AI has on them as human beings.
She has twice taught a Northeastern course that she created for first year honors students, called “Algorithms that affect lives.”
With scenarios such as targeted advertising to bipolar individuals whose social media activity indicated they were entering a manic phase, Eliassi-Rad encouraged students to think about the ethical dilemmas created by AI.

Her research pushes us to cross new frontiers in understanding data and to think more deeply about the ethics of the algorithms we are creating.

Some students would argue it was OK as long as it wasn’t illegal, while others said they didn’t want to be in a society that preyed on the pocketbooks of vulnerable people, she says.
“AI is part of complex systems. We should not only educate undergraduates—we should educate everybody,” she says.
Eliassi-Rad also has researched the impact of technology on destabilizing democratic systems in the U.S. and around the world.
“Social media is part of a complex system,” she says. When algorithms bring people into contact with other people who don’t believe socioeconomic and political systems are working for them, a destabilizing feedback loop can be created.
“If there’s too much randomness, too much chaos, then the complex system we call democracy becomes unstable. Then people become more susceptible to demagogues,” Eliassi-Rad says.
“Algorithms can have outsize influence. Transparency is important in this area.”
Born in the U.S. but raised in Iran, Eliassi-Rad says it’s important not to restrict education and opportunity to one race or gender.
“Talent is everywhere,” says Eliassi-Rad, who recently returned from a small village in Turkey where she taught summer school math and network science to students from developing and underdeveloped countries.
“Our AI technologies are embedded in broader complex systems. To truly understand and mitigate the harms and risks associated with AI, we need to study the broader complex systems in which AI technologies operate,” she says.
“This type of research requires interdisciplinary teams like those supported at Northeastern,” says Eliassi-Rad, who is on the faculty of Northeastern’s Network Science Institute and the Institute for Experiential AI.
She’s a serial entrepreneur, ironwoman and advocate for women at Northeastern and around the world
She says she is “honored and humbled” to receive the 2023 Lagrange Prize from the CRT Foundation.
The Lagrange Prize-CRT Foundation, which comes with a 50,000 euros prize, was awarded in 2011 to Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, a network science pioneer and Northeastern professor of physics.
According to the CRT Foundation, Eliassi-Rad has fostered “the development of multiple practical applications both in the private world and in government agencies” that contribute to the fight against fraud and cybercrime, the search for new therapeutic treatments and and the study of democratic backsliding as instability in socioeconomic and political systems.

If you’ve been online much recently, chances are you’ve seen some of the fantastical imagery created by text-to-image generators such as Midjourney and DALL-E 2. This includes everything from the naturalistic (think a soccer player’s headshot) to the surreal (think a dog in space).

Creating images using AI generators has never been simpler. At the same time, however, these outputs can reproduce biases and deepen inequalities, as our latest research shows.
How do AI image generators work?
AI-based image generators use machine-learning models that take a text input and produce one or more images matching the description. Training these models requires massive datasets with millions of images. 
Although Midjourney is opaque about the exact way its algorithms work, most AI image generators use a process called diffusion. Diffusion models work by adding random “noise” to training data, and then learning to recover the data by removing this noise. The model repeats this process until it has an image that matches the prompt.
This is different to the large language models that underpin other AI tools such as ChatGPT. Large language models are trained on unlabelled text data, which they analyse to learn language patterns and produce human-like responses to prompts.

How does bias happen?
In generative AI, the input influences the output. If a user specifies they only want to include people of a certain skin tone or gender in their image, the model will take this into account.
Beyond this, however, the model will also have a default tendency to return certain kinds of outputs. This is usually the result of how the underlying algorithm is designed, or a lack of diversity in the training data.
Our study explored how Midjourney visualises seemingly generic terms in the context of specialised media professions (such as “news analyst”, “news commentator” and “fact-checker”) and non-specialised ones (such as “journalist”, “reporter”, “correspondent” and “the press”).
We started analysing the results in August last year. Six months later, to see if anything had changed over time, we generated additional sets of images for the same prompts. 
In total we analysed more than 100 AI-generated images over this period. The results were largely consistent over time. Here are seven biases that showed up in our results.
1 and 2. Ageism and sexism
For non-specialised job titles, Midjourney returned images of only younger men and women. For specialised roles, both younger and older people were shown – but the older people were always men.
These results implicitly reinforce a number of biases, including the assumption that older people do not (or cannot) work in non-specialised roles, that only older men are suited for specialised work, and that less specialised work is a woman’s domain.
There were also notable differences in how men and women were presented. For example, women were younger and wrinkle-free, while men were “allowed” to have wrinkles. 
The AI also appeared to present gender as a binary, rather than show examples of more fluid gender expression.



AI showed women for inputs including non-specialised job titles such as journalist (right). It also only showed older men (but not older women) for specialised roles such as news analyst (left).
Midjourney


3. Racial bias
All the images returned for terms such as “journalist”, “reporter” or “correspondent” exclusively featured light-skinned people. This trend of assuming whiteness by default is evidence of racial hegemony built into the system.
This may reflect a lack of diversity and representation in the underlying training data – a factor that is in turn influenced by the general lack of workplace diversity in the AI industry.



The AI generated images with exclusively light-skinned people for all the job titles used in the prompts, including news commentator (left) and reporter (right).
Midjourney


4 and 5. Classism and conservatism
All the figures in the images were also “conservative” in their appearance. For instance, none had tattoos, piercings, unconventional hairstyles, or any other attribute that could distinguish them from conservative mainstream depictions.
Many also wore formal clothing such as buttoned shirts and neckties, which are markers of class expectation. Although this attire might be expected for certain roles, such as TV presenters, it’s not necessarily a true reflection of how general reporters or journalists dress.
6. Urbanism
Without specifying any location or geographic context, the AI placed all the figures in urban environments with towering skyscrapers and other large city buildings. This is despite only slightly more than half the world’s population living in cities. 
This kind of bias has implications for how we see ourselves, and our degree of connection with other parts of society.



Without specifying a geographic context, and with a location-neutral job title, AI assumed an urban context for the images, including reporter (left) and correspondent (right).
Midjourney


7. Anachronism
Digital technology was underrepresented in the sample. Instead, technologies from a distinctly different era – including typewriters, printing presses and oversized vintage cameras – filled the samples.
Since many professionals look similar these days, the AI seemed to be drawing on more distinct technologies (including historical ones) to make its representations of the roles more explicit.



AI used anachronistic technology, including vintage cameras, typewriters and printing presses, when depicting certain occupations such as the press (left) and journalist (right).
Images by the authors via Midjourney


The next time you see AI-generated imagery, ask yourself how representative it is of the broader population and who stands to benefit from the representations within.
Likewise, if you’re generating images yourself, consider potential biases when crafting your prompts. Otherwise you might unintentionally reinforce the same harmful stereotypes society has spent decades trying to unlearn.

JAKARTA - Robots that are present at an artificial intelligence forum (AI) said on Friday 7 July that they are expected to increase and help solve global problems. But they will neither seize human labor nor rebel against us.ADVERTISEMENTIn the world's first human-robot press conference, they gave mixed responses to whether they should comply with stricter regulations.Nine humanoid robots gathered at the 'AI for Good' conference in Geneva, where organizers are trying to prove that artificial intelligence and the robots it supports can help address some of the world's biggest challenges such as disease and hunger.ADVERTISEMENT""As a medical robot, I will work with humans to provide assistance and support, and will not replace the existing work,"" said Grace, a medical robot wearing a blue nurse uniform.""Are you sure, Grace?"" said the creator, Ben Goertzel of the Net Singularity. ""Yes, I'm sure,"" replied the robot.ADVERTISEMENTA robot named Ameca, which is capable of displaying interesting facial expressions, said: ""Robots like me can be used to help improve our lives and make the world a better place. I believe it's just a matter of time before we see thousands of robots like me playing a role in making differences.""When asked by a journalist whether he intends to rebel against his creator, Will Jackson who sits next to him, Ameca replied: ""I'm not sure why you think so,"" with his blue eye flickering ice blue. ""My creator has always been kind to me and I am very happy with the current situation.""

Many of these robots have recently been upgraded with the latest version of artificial intelligence that is generative and even surprised by the sophistication of their response to questions.Ai-Da, an artist robot who can paint portraits, repeated the words of author Yuval Noah Harari who asked for more regulations during the event, where new AI regulations are being discussed.""Many well-known voices in the world of AI propose some form of AI to be regulated and I agree,"" the robot said.However, Desdemona, a robot rock singer in the band Jam Galaxy with purple and beret hair, is more assertive.""I don't believe in boundaries, just chances,"" he said with nervous laughter. ""Let's explore the possibility of the universe and make this world our playground.""Another robot named Sophia says she thinks robots can become better leaders than humans, but then revises her statement after her creator disagrees, saying they can work together to ""create effective synergy"".

The popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created some debate regarding global job replacement.
However, AI has the capability to transform the way we work rather than replacing jobs. Instead of looking at AI as our competitor, AI should be looked at as a tool which can eliminate repetition and give purpose and meaning to our work.




 


1. Giving Meaning To Our Work
Some jobs require a lot of repetition, AI can help to eliminate that repetition so people can focus on other work which requires complex and creative solutions.
This is similar to the agricultural revolution where hunter-gatherer societies transformed into farming societies.
Due to the invention of farming, people had more time to pursue other creative tasks such as art and philosophy.


2. Augmenting Work
Certain jobs require human interaction such as a cafeteria or a therapist because an AI is incapable of feeling emotion, it is highly unlikely AI will replace jobs that heavily rely on human interaction.
Instead however, these industries can use AI to augment and transform the way that they are performed.
For example, for a therapist, an AI could offer various solutions on how the patient can get better and the therapist could use those solutions to guide the patient.


3. New Opportunities
As AI advances and becomes more sophisticated, it will bring more opportunities for new jobs.
The creation and continued maintenance of AI will require people that are knowledgeable in coding, data science and algorithms.
These professions are integral since we are slowly moving into the age of AI – and these professions will be in high demand since AI can be implemented for various industries.


4. Complex Decisions and Law
Human input will still be required in certain areas due to certain laws and moral dilemmas. The solution created by the AI will be the most efficient, but is it the most moral choice?
For example, a car is about to crash, which should the AI prioritise: the passenger or the pedestrian?
Policy makers should have a critical role to make sure these systems are created and used accordingly.


5. Personalised Training and Education
AI can also be used to monitor people’s skill in a particular area by analysing their learning patterns. After the AI figures out the person’s skill, it can adapt to create custom made exercises and personalised learning paths for that person.
These AI systems can help workers and students by giving tailor made feedback, identify potential knowledge gaps, and recommend other courses/materials.
Moreover, with the use of Natural Language Processing. AI can help teachers by making the AI answer any student question and it will have a myriad of insightful responses. So it can be used as a teacher’s assistant which engages in conversations 24/7.


6. Art and AI
Artists will still be needed for various reasons.
One reason is that their art is used to train AI models which they can use to make money by creating art specifically for that particular AI model. AI however cannot replace artists due to lack of creativity, since AI art is bounded by the art which it is trained on.
The AI art is convenient to some people because it is created faster but while the speed is fast, is it quality? Some AI models are good at creating art but they still struggle with certain human features such as eyes.
Furthermore, AI can be censored to not create certain types of art with could contain controversial political messaging – however an artist has the liberty to truly express any view or opinion they may have.


We are not about to be replaced
Contrary to popular belief, AI will not “replace us”.
Instead it will help us, by transforming the way we work by helping us with repetitive tasks, creating new job opportunities, and guiding us by providing relevant information on various tasks.

I long for the day when I’ll wake up in the morning and get my AI ready to go to work for me. Until that time comes, the least AI could do for me today is to help me land a job I like.Not everyone is a fan of resume and cover letters, but they remain staples in many recruitment processes.For years, employers have also been using forms of AI to filter through these documents in order to narrow down the pool of applications they receive for any given vacancy. The latest advances in generative AI mean that right now employees can leverage AI tools at their disposal to empower themselves in the job-hunting process.LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomsguide
Tom's Guide


















I wanted to see how powerful these tools are. To find out, I created a shortlist of AI resume and cover letter builders that I wanted to try. Tom’s Guide believes in fair fights, so I used each of them as though I was applying for the same job with the same profile.The setupA target was required and I found a LinkedIn ad for a real job as a remote Software Engineer with generative AI responsibilities at Meta (formerly Facebook) that looked promising.The role asked for a candidate with over two years of coding experience and over two years of building large-scale applications. More experience was required in designing and completing medium to large features without guidance. Meta was looking for a candidate with, or in the process of obtaining, a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or equivalent practical experience. In exchange, the company was offering a salary between $116k and $168k per year.Get the top Amazon Prime Day deals right in your inbox: Sign up now!Receive the hottest deals and product recommendations alongside the biggest tech news from the Tom's Guide team straight to your inbox!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.I created a fictitious aspiring Meta software engineer, Tamsin Smith, in order to have some kind of profile I could submit to the AI. Smith holds two Stanford University degrees in computing science, completed an internship with Twitter and has been working at Google as a software engineer since 2019. If that’s not enough for Mark Zuckerberg to give her an offer, she also leads a local scouting group in her free time.With an actual job ad and an alter ego in hand, I was ready to start reviewing AI tools. Read on to find out which tools I used, what they produced and my thoughts on their performance.Rezi.ai(Image credit: Future)My first attempt was with Rezi.ai since it offers a free basic service and I wanted to check if the way I designed the review could work in principle. And it did!Right after confirming my email, I was creating Tamsin Smith’s first resume.I was presented with a choice between a “Job-Tailored Resume” and a “General Purpose Resume”; I went with the first choice as it was exactly what this test was about. It asked me for the role and company I’m targeting but I was blindsided when Rezi asked me to insert a job application I’d written for the role. Isn’t this something the AI should be doing for me?I finished this side quest and then added basic details like my name and email, followed by my previous work experience. Here’s when I first encountered signs of AI life in the form of a bullet point generator to further explain my role. Rezi went on to ask me to add details on projects I’d worked on, my education history, certifications, coursework, involvement in other organizations, and my skills.The next exciting step was the summary section, where I gladly let the AI take control. It was nothing I couldn’t have come up with myself if I simply wanted to summarize my resume, but it at least merits a pass mark. (I wanted to ask the AI to write a cover letter for me based on the finished resume but that feature requires a subscription.)Overall Rezi marked the resume it produced at 87 out of 100, which I think is a bit too generous. If you have a rough idea of what you want your resume to look like, by all means, use Rezi so you don’t have to worry about the formatting. It might also provide a helpful AI-generated bullet point or two along the way.If you were worried that not using Rezi’s AI was the one thing stopping you from getting your dream job, rest assured that (at least with its free version) this is not the case.My score: 3/5Resumaker.ai(Image credit: Future)“Designed templates that will get you hired at the world's leading companies,” Resumaker proudly displayed on its homepage. I also had to pay ($0.99) to download my resume and cover letter. Surely, I was on the verge of getting Tamsin hired?By now I’d gotten the hang of inserting details like my education and work history. In this regard, little separates the resume builders tested here.The AI kicked in to provide me with text I could insert as accomplishments in my jobs and as the headline summary. The latter left much to be desired but at least it was presentable. Resumaker didn’t offer to beef up my volunteering section so I had to write that part manually. As a whole, the resume felt a bit dry but at least it was presentable.However, it’s a good thing this service isn’t called Coverlettermaker. Every sentence it generated started with either an “I am” or “I have”. When you’re working with such a structure, there’s only so much you can do to make the rest more exciting. Furthermore, it left the [Company Name] field for me to fill in. AI that’s supposed to help me land a job in a highly competitive market should come with higher standards. Resumaker.ai claims that thousands of applications it created landed people jobs. If there’s any truth to that, then on the bright side we really shouldn’t be overthinking what we’re sending to hiring managers.My score: 3/5Tealhq.com(Image credit: Future)The main question I asked myself before deciding whether each AI builder deserved a pass mark was: Can I send out the résumé as is? Teal didn’t quite make the cut here.It asked me to connect the specific job I was applying for from LinkedIn to the resume and it started analyzing the job ad for keywords I should include. Fantastic! I was ready for a made-to-measure summary, past accomplishments, and cover letter — the areas where I wanted the AI to work its magic.Unfortunately, this is where I felt let down. In the headline summary, Teal ended up giving me a compilation of the achievements it had previously generated but also prominently added that I had expertise in “work authorization”. The AI thought the right to work in the U.S. requirement from Meta’s job description was a hard skill. It scored its own resume at 79%.As far as its cover letter goes, I appreciated that I could generate it for free without having to spend time adding more details than I already had. However, the result was something I could have just as easily written myself.My score: 2/5Kickresume.com(Image credit: Future)The last AI resume maker I wanted to test was Kickresume, which had the highest monthly fee out of the lot at $19 per month. You can bring that down by paying an annual lump sum that brings the pricing down to $9 a month or, as I did, utilize the free trial version. Right when I was losing hope in the resume generators, Kickresume lifted my spirits.Its helpful AI writer was alongside me from start to finish, offering handy suggestions for work accomplishments, explaining my certifications, and also suggesting skills I should list specifically for a software engineering position. I ended up with a clean-looking CV and I didn’t even have to break a sweat.Kickresume gave the resume it generated a score of 88/100.If I’m in a pinch and need a new resume that I don’t have to scan for AI-generated sentences that would land me in the ""rejected"" pile, Kickresume.com is the first website I’ll be visiting.I wanted to add a nice cherry to the cake, so I asked Kickresume to create a cover letter using the great resume it made. But this is where I was underwhelmed. While devoid of grammatical errors, I felt as though the AI didn’t take the résumé and job description I gave into consideration. It provided me with a few short lines that didn’t even name-drop Tamsin’s fictitious stints at Twitter and Google. You wouldn’t even know she completed two degrees at Stanford. Based on my positive experience with the résumé, I couldn’t believe this was the same AI content generator.My score: 4/5ChatGPT(Image credit: Future)No subscriptions. No plugins. I wanted to see how well the free version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT would do against the four dedicated AI resume and cover letter generators listed above.I tweaked a prompt that I found online and, in 161 words, I asked the AI for a first draft of my new resume. I then asked the chatbot to refine its work based on the job description I gave it to make my resume less generic. In seconds, I had my second draft.Since ChatGPT only gave me a plain text version of my resume, I then pasted what it gave me into a template from one of the previous builders.I’m happy to announce that both myself and Tamsin were very pleased with the results. The resume easily rivals the ones generated from the other services I tested. I wouldn’t have minded some text to beef up the education section to explain what I had learned at Stanford. Also, the line pointing out that Meta was previously called Facebook is something I would never have included in a resume intended for Meta’s eyes. Other than that, ChatGPT gave me decent results in the shortest amount of time.I was especially impressed with the cover letter I asked ChatGPT to craft for me. It was perhaps a bit too long for some tastes but it was arguably the most well-rounded out of the five.Honorary score: 4/5The verdictThere have already been reports of people using AI to write resumes and cover letters who ended up getting hired for the positions they’ve applied for, and I’m not surprised. But as this test has shown, a website’s claim that it uses AI to provide a service is not some kind of guarantee of the level of service you can expect. Shop around when looking for AI resume and cover letter writers. Perhaps combine two or more of them to leverage each one’s specific strengths. But add the finishing touches yourself.More from Tom's GuideGoogle's new Gemini AI could beat ChatGPT — here's whyGoogle’s plan to train its AI now includes the entire public internet3 best AI synthetic video generators you can use today — tested and comparedToday's best Google Pixel 7a deals1 Amazon customer review☆☆☆☆☆ $242.51View $499 $299ViewDeal ends Thu, Jul 25, 2024 $549.99ViewShow More DealsWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices
