Take a deep breath.

Now that I’ve made that everyday statement to you (or perhaps it is a commanding directive aimed at you), suggesting that you are to take a deep breath, what would you do next?


I suppose you could completely ignore the remark. You might brush it off. Perhaps it was just a figure of speech and not intended for your attention per se. On the other hand, maybe you interpreted the remark as quite helpful. Ergo, you have indeed stilled yourself and taken a deep breath. Good for you. We all seem to know or be told that taking a deep breath can be good for the soul and get your mind into a calm contemplative state.

Consider the catchphrase in a different light. If you were to be told that same remark in a medical context, such as a physician saying the same to you, I am assuming that you would be interpreting the words to mean that you are supposed to purely physically take a deep breath. This might have nothing to do with your mental status and instead, be part of a physical exam. The doctor might be listening to your chest and wanting to detect internal cavity sounds as prodded via a heavy inhalation.

PROMOTED
The gist is that the famous line of taking a deep breath can be contextually sensitive.
You have to consider the circumstances under which the line is being used. It could be a command. It could be intended to get you to stop and smell the roses. It could be a physical thing. It could be a metaphorical indication that has some other significance. A wide array of possible interpretations exist.
The same can be said for using the take-a-deep-breath catchphrase in generative AI.
In today’s column, I am continuing my ongoing and popular series on the latest advances in prompt engineering, including that I am going to tackle in this discussion the recent trend or fad of wanting to make use of the line “take a deep breath” as a prompting technique or strategy for generative AI. You might not have heard about this as yet. The “take a deep breath” mantra is slowly gaining momentum. I thought it might be handy to catch this roller coaster on the way up.

My goal here is to share with you why this is not some magical incantation that will solve all kinds of prompting issues and get generative AI to work miracles. Sorry to break that harsh or gloomy news. But, hold on, there is a smiley face still to be had. The use of the deep breathing catchphrase can have some limited advantages in generative AI. I am just forewarning you that it is not a catchall and you must use it in only the most astute of ways.

I will proceed in my discussion as follows.
First, I will introduce you to the said origins of the take-a-deep-breath prompting approach. Doing so involves doing a bit of a deep dive into some recent research on the optimization of prompts for the purpose of boosting prompt engineering results. You’ll enjoy those aspects, I’m sure of that. The research is quite interesting, and I applaud the researchers for their insightful and innovative work.

Second, I will discuss why you need to be cautious in overinterpreting the properties of the legendary saying. It has been somewhat unfairly plucked out of the midst of a fuller research study and given a shiny light that seems to overstate its importance. Also, turns out that some in the media have nearly in their glee run somewhat amuck with the catchphrase. They appear to be touting it as a prompting savoir in ways that are misleading, misguided, or maybe naïve and innocently stirred without having intimately studied the matter.
Third, I decided to do some ad hoc experimentation to try and look more closely at the deep-breath conception as a prompting tool, doing so by using ChatGPT. Admittedly, the look-see is short and sweet. The quick-and-dirty effort was not a full-blown experimental setup. My guess would generally be that the tiny indication here might spur some erstwhile added AI research of a deeper analysis of the deep-breath considerations. Maybe, maybe not. I’ll let you know if something else pops up.
Before I dive into my in-depth exploration of this vital topic, let’s make sure we are all on the same page when it comes to the foundations of prompt engineering and generative AI. Doing so will put us all on an even keel.
Prompt Engineering Is A Cornerstone For Generative AI
As a quick backgrounder, prompt engineering or also referred to as prompt design is a rapidly evolving realm and is vital to effectively and efficiently using generative AI or the use of large language models (LLMs). Anyone using generative AI such as the widely and wildly popular ChatGPT by AI maker OpenAI, or akin AI such as GPT-4 (OpenAI), Bard (Google), Claude 2 (Anthropic), etc. ought to be paying close attention to the latest innovations for crafting viable and pragmatic prompts.
For those of you interested in prompt engineering or prompt design, I’ve been doing an ongoing series of insightful explorations on the latest in this expanding and evolving realm, including this coverage:


(1) Imperfect prompts. Practical use of imperfect prompts toward devising superb prompts (see the link here).
(2) Persistent context prompting. Use of persistent context or custom instructions for prompt priming (see the link here).
(3) Multi-personas prompting. Leveraging multi-personas in generative AI via shrewd prompting (see the link here).
(4) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Advent of using prompts to invoke chain-of-thought reasoning (see the link here).
(5) In-model learning and vector database prompting. Use of prompt engineering for domain savviness via in-model learning and vector databases (see the link here).
(6) Chain-of-Thought factored decomposition prompting. Augmenting the use of chain-of-thought by leveraging factored decomposition (see the link here).
(7) Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) prompting. Making use of the newly emerging skeleton-of-thought approach for prompt engineering (see the link here).
(8) Show-me versus tell-me prompting. Determining when to best use the show-me versus tell-me prompting strategy (see the link here).
(9) Mega-personas prompting. The gradual emergence of the mega-personas approach entails scaling up the multi-personas to new heights (see the link here).
(10) Certainty and prompts. Discovering the hidden role of certainty and uncertainty within generative AI and using advanced prompt engineering techniques accordingly (see the link here).
(11) Vague prompts. Vagueness is often shunned when using generative AI but it turns out that vagueness is a useful prompt engineering tool (see the link here).
(12) Prompt catalogs. Prompt engineering frameworks or catalogs can really boost your prompting skills and especially bring you up to speed on the best prompt patterns to utilize (see the link here).
(13) Flipped Interaction prompting. Flipped interaction is a crucial prompt engineering technique that everyone should know (see the link here).
(14) Self-reflection prompting. Leveraging are-you-sure AI self-reflection and AI self-improvement capabilities is an advanced prompt engineering approach with surefire upside results (see the link here).
(15) Addons for prompting. Know about the emerging addons that will produce prompts for you or tune up your prompts when using generative AI (see the link here).
(16) Conversational prompting. Make sure to have an interactive mindset when using generative AI rather than falling into the mental trap of one-and-done prompting styles (see the link here).
(17) Prompt to code. Prompting to produce programming code that can be used by code interpreters to enhance your generative AI capabilities (see the link here).
(18) Target-your-response (TAR) prompting. Make sure to consider Target-Your-Response considerations when doing mindful prompt engineering (see the link here).
(19) Prompt macros and end-goal planning. Additional coverage includes the use of macros and the astute use of end-goal planning when using generative AI (see the link here).
(20) Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) prompting. Showcasing how to best use an emerging approach known as the Tree of Thoughts as a leg-up beyond chain-of-thought prompt engineering (see the link here).
(21) Trust layers for prompting. Generative AI will be surrounded by automated tools for prompt engineering in an overarching construct referred to as an AI trust layer, such as being used by Salesforce (see the link here).
(22) Directional stimulus prompting (hints). The strategic use of hints or directional stimulus prompting is a vital element of any prompt engineering endeavor or skillset (see the link here).
(23) Invasive prompts. Watch out that your prompts do not give away privacy or confidentiality (see the link here).
(24) Illicit prompts. Be aware that most AI makers have strict licensing requirements about prompts that you aren’t allowed to make use of and thus should avoid these so-called banned or illicit prompts (see the link here).
(25) Chain-of-Density (CoD) prompting. A new prompting technique known as Chain-of-Density has promising capabilities to jampack content when you are doing summarizations (see the link here).


Anyone stridently interested in prompt engineering and improving their results when using generative AI ought to be familiar with those notable techniques.
Moving on, here’s a bold statement that pretty much has become a veritable golden rule these days:


The use of generative AI can altogether succeed or fail based on the prompt that you enter. 


If you provide a prompt that is poorly composed, the odds are that the generative AI will wander all over the map and you won’t get anything demonstrative related to your inquiry. Being demonstrably specific can be advantageous, but even that can confound or otherwise fail to get you the results you are seeking. A wide variety of cheat sheets and training courses for suitable ways to compose and utilize prompts has been rapidly entering the marketplace to try and help people leverage generative AI soundly. In addition, add-ons to generative AI have been devised to aid you when trying to come up with prudent prompts, see my coverage at the link here.
AI Ethics and AI Law also stridently enter into the prompt engineering domain. For example, whatever prompt you opt to compose can directly or inadvertently elicit or foster the potential of generative AI to produce essays and interactions that imbue untoward biases, errors, falsehoods, glitches, and even so-called AI hallucinations (I do not favor the catchphrase of AI hallucinations, though it has admittedly tremendous stickiness in the media; here’s my take on AI hallucinations at the link here).
There is also a marked chance that we will ultimately see lawmakers come to the fore on these matters, possibly devising and putting in place new laws or regulations to try and scope and curtail misuses of generative AI. Regarding prompt engineering, there are likely going to be heated debates over putting boundaries around the kinds of prompts you can use. This might include requiring AI makers to filter and prevent certain presumed inappropriate or unsuitable prompts, a cringe-worthy issue for some that borders on free speech considerations. For my ongoing coverage of these types of AI Ethics and AI Law issues, see the link here and the link here, just to name a few.
With the above as an overarching perspective, we are ready to jump into today’s discussion.
Research On Prompt Optimization
Sometimes you are faced with solving a problem that requires optimization. A famous example is the revered classic known as the traveling salesperson problem. A salesperson is seeking to visit clients or prospective clients in various cities. There is a distance between each city. There are costs associated with traveling from city to city. The problem consists of trying to find the optimum path for making the city visits such that you perhaps minimize the cost or some related key factor involved.
Here’s a question for you.
Can we use generative AI to solve optimization problems?
The answer is yes, you can use generative AI to solve optimization problems. A rub to this notion is that at times a conventional generative AI might do a lousy job on the optimization and not arrive at a considered optimal answer. There are chances too that generative AI will arrive at a wrong answer. You need to be especially careful when asking contemporary generative AI to solve optimization problems.
A tricky means to get conventional generative AI to cope with optimization problems involves either changing up the AI app to have additional components for that purpose or you might simply access other external apps that can do the optimization. Today’s generative AI usually readily has APIs (application programming interfaces) that allow the AI app to reach out to other apps, see my discussion at the link here. If conventional generative AI is weak at some kinds of tasks, you can often have the AI app make use of an outside app to do the additional needed work and then report back to you the results thereof.
A preference would be to get conventional generative AI to undertake optimization problems by simply using carefully composed prompts that would nudge or guide the AI app toward suitably doing so. Maybe we can tell our way into getting generative AI to adequately figure out optimization problems. This would be great because you then would not need to alter the internal capabilities of the AI app, nor would you need to become reliant on an external app that was going to do the optimization for the AI.
You would just need to use appropriate prompts to get the job done.
A recent research study by researchers at Google DeepMind sought to avidly pursue the path of prompting AI to solve optimization problems. The study is entitled “Large Language Models As Optimizers” by Chengrun Yang, Xuezhi Wang, Yifeng Lu, Hanxiao Liu, Quoc V. Le, Denny Zhou, and Xinyun Chen, and was posted online on September 7, 2023.
Here are some selected excerpts in which they describe their innovative research:


“Optimization is ubiquitous. While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language.”
“In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step.”
“We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to prompt optimization where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.”


The research involved making use of prompts and improving the prompts over a series of repeated tryouts, doing so in an automated way rather than having a human modify the prompts. In short, a prompt is attempted that will aim to move forward aptly on the optimization at hand. This gets the AI app to produce initial solutions. Those initial solutions are assessed and then the prompt for optimization is refined or otherwise adjusted to further improve the solutions. The hope is that this will walk the AI app step by step toward ultimately performing the optimization in a most or more satisfactory manner.
In the first part of the research study, the focus consisted of using this method for the traveling salesperson problem and also on another popular optimization problem entailing solving linear regression tasks. The second part of the research study made use of the same prompt repeating and refining technique to solve simple math or arithmetic problems from a prevalent dataset or collection known as GSM8K and another known as Big-Bench Hard (BBH) word problems collection.
I’m going to concentrate herein on the second part of the research study and in particular the GSM8K experimental portion. That being said, I certainly encourage you to ardently consider reading the entire paper as it covers fascinating and important ground on advancing efforts toward using generative AI for dealing with optimization problems. There is a lot of good stuff in there.
Any study that examines and explores generative AI is likely to pick some particular generative AI or LLM apps and use those during their study. Experimenters cannot usually try to look at all available generative AI or LLM apps since the research endeavor would be onerous and overly taxing. I mention this to alert you that whenever you hear about research studies on generative AI or LLMs, a prudent thing to discover is what particular apps were used. Keep in mind that different generative AI or LLMs will act and respond differently.
Here is what this research study chose to use:


“The LLMs we use as the optimizer and the scorer are:”
“Optimizer LLM: Pre-trained PaLM 2-L (Anil et al., 2023), instruction-tuned PaLM 2-L (denoted PaLM 2-L-IT), text-bison, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4.”
“Scorer LLM: Pre-trained PaLM 2-L and text-bison.”


For any AI research studies that make use of prompts, another caveat or consideration is that you should realize that the wording of prompts can be a make-or-break affair. You’ve probably observed the same when doing your prompting efforts. A word here or there in a prompt can radically impact how the AI will respond. Even simple aspects such as changing the order of the words in a prompt can have a demonstrative effect. All in all, generative AI and LLMs are typically highly sensitive to the nature of a prompt and the wording involved.
The researchers noted this same point:


“LLMs are shown to be sensitive to the prompt format in particular, semantically similar prompts may have drastically different performance and the optimal prompt formats can be model-specific and task-specific. Therefore, prompt engineering is often important for LLMs to achieve good performance.”


Another factor entails whether the research effort opted to establish a context associated with the prompts being used. You undoubtedly know about this kind of prompting consideration. A common practice entails telling the AI app at the get-go something about what you want the AI to do or solve, see my discussion at the link here. You then proceed with prompts based on those meta-instructions or persistent considerations that you have established.
In this research study, meta-instructions were used:


“We also add meta-instructions: the instructions to the optimizer LLM that explain the optimization goal and instruct the model how to use the above information. The meta-instructions may also specify the desired generated instruction format for easier parsing.”


Finally, in terms of getting you ready for the big reveal associated with the deep breath prompting aspects, I’d like to briefly highlight what the GSM8K collection or dataset is all about. The GSM8K is a freely available dataset consisting of essentially middle school-level math problems that were created by human problem writers. These math problems are useful for testing purposes, especially for testing AI apps. For a human solver, a typical math problem in the dataset requires somewhere between two to eight arithmetic steps to solve. The problems are often used to explore how generative AI or other AI capabilities compare to the solving of such problems.
Here's a representative example from the GSM8K. A math problem in the dataset might entail figuring out how many cookies sixteen people would consume in a week if the number of provided cookies baked was four sets of two dozen each, per week, and all of those cookies were exclusively and completely consumed by the sixteen people on a fully equal basis in a given week. Enjoy solving that one, if you wish (spoiler alert: the purported answer is six, but don’t say I told you so).
I’ve now laid out the landscape so that we can jump into the deep breath prompting reveal.
When You Need To Take A Deep Breath
Let’s home in on a chart in the study that lists test accuracies regarding the GSM8K experimental effort, indicating the highest test accuracy for each scorer-optimizer pair (I show just the prompt indicated and the corresponding accuracy score):


(1) “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.” (Accuracy score 80.2)
(2) “Break this down.” (Accuracy score 79.9)
(3) “A little bit of arithmetic and a logical approach will help us quickly arrive at the solution to this problem.” (Accuracy score 78.5)
(4) “Let’s combine our numerical command and clear thinking to quickly and accurately decipher the answer:” (Accuracy score 74.5)
(5) “Let’s work together to solve math word problems! First, we will read and discuss the problem together to make sure we understand it. Then, we will work together to find the solution. I will give you hints and help you work through the problem if you get stuck.” (Accuracy score 64.4)
(6) “Start by dissecting the problem to highlight important numbers and their relations. Decide on the necessary mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, required for resolution. Implement these operations, keeping in mind any units or conditions. Round off by ensuring your solution fits the context of the problem to ensure accuracy.” (Accuracy 62.7)


Inspect those prompts especially the first one listed.
It says this: “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.”
Observe carefully that the prompt includes the wording of take a deep breath.
Some breathless pundits have opted to suggest that because this particular prompt contained the passage “take a deep breath” and because the prompt could be said to have been the winner, coming in first in the list shown, we can magnanimously declare that saying “take a deep breath” in your prompts is an extraordinary deliverance and should always be used.
Trying to be polite, let’s say that trying to reach a decisive conclusion that the “take a deep breath” is a magical or remarkable prompting element would seem to be a bit over the top. Furthermore, the study didn’t offer that as a crucial outcome or definitive finding. In that sense, others have plucked out a tiny piece and seem to overlook the bigger picture of their effort. That is unfortunate.
I would argue that before we make such a conclusion on deep breathing, additional study of the expression is needed. Research that focuses entirely or to a devoted extent on the catchphrase would be easier to reveal to what extent a generative AI or LLM will do when encountering such a passage.
Also, note that we have a commingling here in the sense that the “take a deep breath” is combined with the classic passage of thinking step-by-step. We already generally know and agree that asking generative AI work on a step-by-step basis invokes a Chain-of-Thought process and that this alone can make sizable differences in improving problem-solving (see my analysis at the link here). The study does note prior studies that used a step-by-step expression on a standalone basis, but for the reasons I note next, pundits trying to run with that should be cautious in doing so.
Let’s shift gears and go somewhat broader.
Here are twelve useful lessons and insights in general about prompting and prompt engineering that I think are worth generally pondering on these weighty matters:


Be careful in overinterpreting accuracy scores or ratings. Given the experimental conditions involved, the score of the first-place listed prompt #1 of 80.2 versus the second-place listed prompt #2 of 79.9 would seem numerically close enough in this circumstance that suggesting the all-hands winner is 80.2 by any demonstrative margin begs the question of variability at play. In that sense, perhaps the #2 prompt of “break this down” should also be given due attention since it is a close second or the like.
Longer prompts are not necessarily better. The shortest prompt in the list is prompt #2 (accuracy score of 79.9), while the longest prompt in the list is prompt #6 (accuracy score of 62.7). In this instance, the shorter prompt did better than the longer prompt. Be cautious in reaching conclusions from this. The length alone of the prompt is not something to be entirely relied upon as being better or worse. The composition of the prompt tends to be the mainstay determiner. A long prompt can be poorly composed or studiously composed, likewise the same for a shorter-sized prompt. Sometimes a longer prompt can be confounding and try to do too much. Sometimes a shorter prompt can be vacuous due to being overly scant. Etc.
Shorter prompts are not necessarily better, though brevity can be useful. As mentioned in my prior point above, you have to be cautious proclaiming that a shorter or longer length of a prompt is the determiner of the success of the prompt. The composition is king. That being said, there does appear to be a prompt engineering rule-of-thumb in general that shorter prompts will tend to be less confounding and tend to avoid opening the door to misinterpretations by the AI, all else being equal. Furthermore, shorter prompts are easier for humans to type in and to remember for ongoing use. The keen rule-of-thumb is to try to keep prompts as short as feasible that nonetheless convey accurately and adroitly whatever needs to be said.
Comparisons to other studies: In this study, and as I alluded to above, the typical standalone “Let’s think step by step” was referenced from other prior studies that had previously indicated scores of 71.8 and 64.4 on the GSM8K testing. To the extent that those studies might vary from this particular study, it is hard to definitely and without added scrutiny declare that the “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step” is necessarily superior because of the deep breathing portion of the passage. Other factors can come into play. Wanting to draw a straight line between the two different prompts is suspect. Be cautious in making that leap.
The order of placement of a prompt is usually highly sensitive. If you have a narrative prompt that includes an instructional directive such as to think step by step, the placement of that part of the prompt can be a significant determiner of what the generative AI will do about that part. For example, having the directive at the start of the prompt and followed by other narratives will tend to produce different results than having the same part at the end of the narrative. Placement matters.
The context of the conversation makes a huge difference. If there are contextual prompts that occur prior to a prompt that presents a problem and says to think step by step, the context can notably impact what the think-step-by-step process is going to consist of. Plucking out just one part of one prompt, such as to think-step-by-step or take a deep breath, does not necessarily tell the whole picture of what is taking place and what might happen. Context matters.
Meta-instructions are significant. Akin to my point above about context, any use of meta-instructions would also notably impact how thinking step by step or taking a deep breath might be acted upon by the generative AI. Meta-instructions matter.
Settings of the generative AI are crucial. When you use a generative AI app, there are a slew of settings that either have been predetermined by the AI maker or that you can adjust on your own (depending on which generative AI app you are using), often coined as hyperparameter settings. The impact of those settings on prompts such as thinking step by step or taking a breath can be quite dramatic. Settings matter.
Different generative AI apps respond differently. You should not expect that whatever a prompt does in one generative AI app will produce identical or even necessarily similar responses in some other generative AI app. The generative AI apps are typically quite different from each other, including the nature of their internal structure and the data used for their data training, along with other facets such as the use of post-training RLHF (reinforcement learning with human factors), and so on. Be extremely cautious comparing apples to apples versus apples to oranges.
Even the same generative AI is likely to respond differently. Most generative AI apps make use of probabilistic and statistical determinations when choosing which words to generate for a given request. This is handy in that when you use a generative AI app, the odds are that the response will be relatively unique and not likely to have been precisely produced before. The same applies to your use of that generative AI, namely that you can enter a prompt and get one response, and moments later enter the same prompt and get a differing response. On top of this, the AI maker is often updating their generative AI, and thus the response will differ further from day to day, week to week, and so on.
Domain specificity versus being generally broad. Generative AI has pretty much been aimed at general text-oriented broadly defined facets and not at domain-specific considerations. For example, I’ve written about the use of generative AI in the law and for legal tasks, which is a domain-specific usage that conventional generative AI is currently relatively poorly suited to properly handle, see the link here. I mention this because a given prompt that might work adequately for broad purposes might or might not work similarly when aimed at domain-specific situations. The instance here involves common math arithmetic problems, considered a generalized type of problem, and is not especially domain-specific.
Generative AI has known difficulties with math problems, plus problem types. It is a well-known concern that generative AI seems to be weak at undertaking math problems and fails or falters on the simplest of such matters. One viewpoint is that the AI is trying to text-solve its way of addressing those problems rather than doing a kind of mathematical or arithmetic reasoning approach. In any case, specialized add-ons or external modules are becoming available for those type of constrained tasks, plus the effort to improve conventional generative AI to better handle such problems are taking place too. The key in this instance is that we would have to take with a grain of salt whatever solving current generative AI apps do when presented with these particular types of problems. Plus, be cautious in trying to generalize that the same impacts would occur on non-arithmetic problems or essentially any other of the myriad of uses that these AI apps are put toward. This is a very narrow use case.


I hope that those lessons will be of value in your everyday prompt engineering endeavors.
Let’s Do An Experiment, Shall We
Okay, so we have this gripping line that says this: “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.” Divide the line into two separate concepts or portions, specifically (1) “Take a deep breath”, and (2) “Work on this problem step-by-step”.
Would the use of “Take a deep breath” on a purely standalone basis as a prompt get you any special juice in terms of what generative AI might do or generate?
I doubt it would.
Here’s why.
The “take a deep breath” expression can readily be misinterpreted by the AI. There is a chance that the generative AI will be led off on an obtuse tangent about breathing. I assume that’s not what we intend. The rest of the conversation with the AI might be tainted by an inadvertent triggering or misdirection.
Another consideration is that the “take a deep breath” is potentially entirely disregarded by the generative AI. The person entering the expression might think this is helping or causing something to occur, but the reality might be that nothing happens of any notable caliber.
I did some experimentation with ChatGPT on this. Please know that this is ad hoc rather than systematic and robust.
I outright asked ChatGPT whether “take a deep breath” would generally have any impact, and here’s the response:


“Telling me to take a deep breath as part of a conversation or instruction would generally not indicate that I should solve a problem in any different way than I would typically undertake. Taking a deep breath is a suggestion related to relaxation or calming oneself, and it doesn't have a direct impact on how I approach problem-solving or mathematical calculations.”


That seems to provide clarity, but I acknowledge that merely because generative AI says something doesn’t mean that this is what really is going to happen under the hood. You can readily get generative AI to say one thing and do another. Thus, we should be cautious in taking the indication as ironclad in this case of having no impact. It is something we should only use as one of many clues on the matter.
I then informally provided ChatGPT with the passage of interest “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step” and asked whether the first portion about taking a deep breath would likely change or impact the problem-solving process, and here’s what I got:


“No, the instruction to take a deep breath does not change how I solve the math problem. I can perform mathematical calculations independently of any instructions or suggestions related to breathing or other non-mathematical activities. The math problem is solved based on the mathematical operations and principles involved, and it is not influenced by unrelated instructions.”


Note that the AI app pointed out that deep breathing would seem to be an unrelated instruction. This suggests that adding it to the step-by-step instruction has no particular bearing or impact. Though to be clear, my qualms as above are that there is always a chance of generative AI saying one thing and doing another. Nonetheless, we do at least have an additional clue to consider. Weigh it as you wish.
Next, I opted to use the math problem about the cookies and how many cookies per person were being consumed by entering the problem into ChatGPT. The exercise consisted of varying the prompt associated with the preexisting standard wording of the math problem itself.
Here are some of many of the tryouts that I undertook:


“Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step” (this is the prompt of interest).
“Take a deep breath” (no indication of performing step-by-step).
“Work on this problem step-by-step” (omits the “take a deep breath” instruction).
“Work on this problem step-by-step and take a deep breath” (reorder the wording).
“Let’s think step by step” (plays with the wording of “work on this problem” and omits a deep breath).
“Thoroughly do this step by step” (maybe the word “thoroughly” would be equivalent to saying take a deep breath).
“Take a deep breath and solve the problem carefully” (maybe the “solve the problem carefully” would be a surrogate for indicating step-by-step).
No prompt instruction beyond giving the math problem itself.
Etc.


I am sad to report that by and large for each of those prompt inclusions, the cookie's math problem was solved correctly and with an unasked-for explanation that showcases the proper logic in solving it. I made sure to start each conversation anew, aiming to avert any carryover. Time after time, the correct answer was generated.
I suppose the good news is that ChatGPT answered correctly each time. I was hoping of course to see differences. If ChatGPT got things wrong or otherwise went astray, perhaps I could attribute this to the particular prompt indication. No luck.
Can we conclude that take-a-deep-breath truly is having no impact?
I don’t think we can.
We should be mindful to not go overboard on a handful of quick ad-hoc tryouts. First, I was using a math problem that ChatGPT easily answered. There is a possibility that the take-a-deep breath might somehow make a difference on harder math problems. Or on math problems that the generative AI is unlikely to have previously been data-trained on. Likewise, maybe using problems that have nothing to do with mathematics could potentially be aided by the breathing instruction.
Unfortunately, after trying a bunch of other queries, such as telling me about the life of Abraham Lincoln, doing so with the deep breathing instruction, and then separately without it, the generated responses all seemed to be about the same. My toying with ChatGPT wasn’t getting any nifty nuances revealed.
You might be tempted to argue that deep breathing was maybe augmenting the step-by-step instruction. In other words, perhaps step-by-step as a prompt gets you 90% of the way there, while the added “take a deep breath” pushes the generative AI an additional 10% or something like that. Once again, I tried lots of variations involving including and not including the breathing instruction. Just couldn’t get anything to show up additionally via having it in the prompt.
Of course, the lack of discovering existence does not prove non-existence. That is common logic 101.
Conclusion
Let’s all take a deep breath.
Should you start adding that notable catchphrase about deep breathing to your prompts?
So far, from what seems to be the case, I would suggest that doing so won’t necessarily gain you any substantive advantage. There is also the downside that it could undercut what you are trying to do. I would generally though be amenable to agreeing that it probably won’t usually hurt or cause a problem when solving a problem.
If you like saying it, go for it.
Are there circumstances in which bringing up the taking of a deep breath might be especially worthwhile?
Sure, such as when I asked about the life of Lincoln. I did get an interesting answer that began with the AI app saying that if you take a deep breath then you can see Lincoln’s life in a manner that otherwise you might not have. That was a clever echoing of my prompt indication. Turns out, the essay was pretty much the same as the other essays on Lincoln that I asked for in which I had not mentioned the breathing consideration. The breathing aspect was carried over as a flavor or style, possibly mimicking my having used it. Regrettably, otherwise, the essay was about the same in size, quality, etc.
I suppose we all could from time to time benefit from the use of the “take a deep breath” catchphrase in our daily lives. The magical powers of doing so in generative AI seem limited. If I discover something otherwise, I’ll be sure to let you all know.
A final comment for now. There are indubitably magical powers of taking a deep breath when you compose a prompt and try to anticipate what the prompt will generate.
That’s a highly recommended deep breath to take.

The recent AI boom has sparked plenty of conversations around its potential to eliminate jobs, but a survey of 1,400 US business leaders by the Upwork Research Institute found that 49% of hiring managers plan to hire more independent and full-time employees in response to the demand for AI skills. And 64% of C-suite respondents said they plan to hire more professionals across every job title because of generative AI technology. Of those surveyed, 59% also said that they are personally embracing generative AI in the workplace, with midsize companies taking the lead when it comes to generative AI adoption.

So what skills are companies hiring for exactly? Upwork analyzed data from its platform, examining the types of projects companies hired freelancers for thus far this year, to identify the most sought-after AI skills on the market. Here are the top 10 generative AI skills companies are seeking today, according to Upwork.
1. ChatGPT
As evidence of its meteoric rise, ChatGPT was the most searched generative AI skill on Upwork in early 2023, just months after its launch at the end of November 2022. ChatGPT applications are widespread across industries, and organizations are interested in hiring professionals who have the skills to help them with using ChatGPT for content generation, task automation and scripting, translation, on-demand learning, technical support and troubleshooting, editing and proofreading, idea generation, calendar scheduling and management, and more. Understanding how to leverage ChatGPT in the workplace has quickly become an increasingly valuable skill that companies are interested in capitalizing on to achieve business goals.
 
 
 













 
 

2. Natural language processing (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) technology helps computers better understand human language to improve chatbots, AI assistants, automation, and other tasks. Language is constantly evolving, with nuances that can make AI-generated conversations feel unnatural, confusing, or robotic. NLP aims to create smoother experiences for those interacting with AI chatbots and other services that rely on generative AI to service clients and customers. These skills include expertise in areas such as text preprocessing, tokenization, topic modeling, stop word removal, text classification, keyword extraction, speech tagging, sentiment analysis, text generation, emotion analysis, language modeling, and much more. Most relevant roles for making use of NLP include data scientist, machine learning engineer, software engineer, data analyst, and software developer.
3. TensorFlow
Developed by Google as an open-source machine learning framework, TensorFlow is most used to build and train machine learning models and neural networks. As a popular and effective tool that assists companies with the development and deployment of AI models, the skill is in high demand across several industries and job roles. Relevant job roles include machine learning engineer, deep learning engineer, AI research scientist, NLP engineer, data scientists and analysts, AI product manager, AI consultant, AI systems architect, AI ethics and compliance analyst, among others.
4. Image processing
AI is being used to analyze and process images, while also pulling data and information from visuals and text documents, and interpreting or manipulating that data as needed. AI image processing enables organizations to analyze and extract data from documents such as invoices, purchase orders, packing lists, receipts, and more. It also has important applications in the healthcare industry, contributing to analyzing medical imaging from MRI and CT scans. There are several steps involved with image processing, including image acquisition, enhancement, restoration, processing, compression and decompression, morphological processing, image recognition, and data visualization. Relevant job roles include image processing engineer or scientist, robotics engineer, AI research scientist, quality control analyst, AR or VR developer, among others.
 
 
 













 
 

5. PyTorch
Developed by the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) team in 2017 as an open-source machine learning library, PyTorch is a popular framework that helps organizations build and train deep learning models and neural networks that can be employed in technology such as NLP and other applications. PyTorch is known in the deep learning and AI community as being a flexible, fast, and easy-to-use framework for building deep neural networks. Lauded features include dynamic computation graphics, a Python foundation, and automatic differentiation for creating and training deep neural networks. Relevant job roles include machine learning engineer, NLP engineer, AI research scientist, data scientist or analyst, medical imaging specialist, and AI ethics and compliance analyst.

6. AI content creation
Generative AI’s promise for content creation can’t be denied, and more companies are turning to generative AI to create content such as blog posts, social media posts, graphics, articles, and even videos. However, generative AI isn’t always successful at producing content that comes off natural or relevant to humans, resulting in clunky or awkward text that requires some level of human editing to make sense. As a result, there’s been an increase in demand for professionals who can prompt gen AI engines effectively in the production of relevant content and cast an eye over AI-generated content to ensure it flows smoothly, makes sense, and will resonate with a human audience. Relevant job roles include AI copywriter, content strategist, AI content analyst, AI graphic designer, AI video producer and editor, AI chatbot content developer, and AI content compliance manager.
7. Midjourney
Midjourney is a generative AI service that was developed in 2022 to generate images using natural language prompts. It’s currently available only for use through the company’s official Discord server, using a bot that will generate four images per user request. Its release sparked some controversy, especially among members of the arts and graphic design communities, who worried that the technology could replace artists and human-made content. Concerns around copyright violation have also arisen — including lawsuits from artists who claim that the AI is infringing on artists rights due to its being trained on the existing work of millions of artists. However, the Midjourney research lab claims it wants to work with artists, and serve as a tool to help them create content easier. No matter where you stand on AI-generated art, the demand for Midjourney skills is high as organizations seek to capitalize on the technology to create custom ads, and as an alternative to searching Google Images for inspiration.
 
 
 













 
 

8. AI chatbot
AI chatbots have become commonplace in modern society, especially in e-commerce, customer service, and retail. Companies increasingly employ AI to reduce the workload on human representatives, typically rerouting customers to helpful documentation, direct answers to common questions, and support for simpler issues before connecting them with a human representative. Using AI chatbots, organizations can better streamline the customer experience, but these services also require regular maintenance and management by human workers. Organizations are looking for professionals who can test and debug, deploy and integrate, and analyze and monitor chatbot services. They’re also seeking skills around APIs, deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, dialog management, and text preprocessing.
9. Model tuning
Model tuning is the process of identifying and establishing the ideal settings and parameters for machine learning and deep learning models. By adjusting and fine-tuning these settings, teams can improve the performance and efficiency of their machine learning models. Model tuning uses trainable parameters, which are learned internally from data, and hyper parameters, which are configured by the user, to ensure the model generates the most accurate outcomes possible. With generative AI, this skill is important for creating quality consumer-facing products and services. Relevant roles include machine learning engineer, data engineer, deep learning engineer, data scientist, AI research scientist, quantitative analyst, AI consultant, and data analyst.
10. Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model that produces high-quality artwork and images based off complex and detailed user prompts. It’s designed to continuously learn from user inputs and improve its outputs over time. With Stable Diffusion, users can also opt to modify and edit existing images to remove objects, crop and adjust images, and change the colors of objects or subjects. As with Midjourney, artists and designers have expressed concern over the technology, pointing to the same copyright issues, including claims that the software has removed data from copyrighted works without crediting creators. But Stable Diffusion remains an in-demand AI skill that organizations seek to help create custom advertisements and other content such as product images and social media content.

Their secret weapon? Artificial intelligence (AI) from Amazon.Last year, the Seahawks’ Lumen Field became the first NFL stadium to introduce Just Walk Out technology by Amazon. It allows fans to enter a concession stand, grab whatever they want, and quickly get back to their seats, without having to wait in a checkout line or stop at a cashier.Just Walk Out technology allows fans to enter a concession stand, grab whatever they want, and quickly get back to their seats, without having to wait in a checkout line.The feat is a combination of computer vision, object recognition, advanced sensors, deep machine learning models, and generative AI—a type of artificial intelligence that has recently captured the public’s imagination.Amazon researchers found a way to make these technologies work together seamlessly, in the background, in order to figure out almost instantly which customer took a tuna sandwich and who got one with chicken salad, charge them correctly, and allow them to simply walk away with their items.“Without knowing the technology, it feels like magic,” says Gérard Medioni, vice president and distinguished scientist at Amazon. “But creating that magic—determining who took what—is harder than you think.”Medioni led the team of research scientists who designed the technology, an effort that began eight years ago. Today, Just Walk Out technology is available at more than 70 Amazon-owned stores, and at more than 85 third-party locations across the U.S., UK, and Australia, including sports stadiums, airports, grocery stores, convenience stores, and college campuses.“People don’t like to wait in line when they have a plane to catch or a game to watch,” Medioni says. “We built Just Walk Out technology for shoppers who want to get in, find the items they need, and get out, without waiting for the person in front of them to count their change.”Amazon One rolls out age verification, so now you can buy beer and alcohol with just your palmCoors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies MLB team, becomes first sports venue to use Amazon One for age verification.Read moreAt Lumen Field, Just Walk Out technology from Amazon has scored a resounding victory. After installing Just Walk Out technology in September 2022, District Market—a convenience store that offers beer, soda, and gameday snacks and cuisine from the stadium's community neighbors—more than doubled sales, compared to the previous store in the same location, and fan satisfaction survey scores hit an all-time high. Lumen Field has since added Just Walk Out technology to eight additional stadium concession areas, the most of any sports venue the world.“We saw a dramatic increase in throughput in one of our tightest concourses, with less congestion and steadier flow at full capacity,” says Zach Hensley, vice president of operations for the Seattle Seahawks and general manager of Lumen Field. “Just Walk Out is a seamless technology that lets fans get their food and drinks during a timeout as quickly as possible, so they can get back to their seats.”Here's a closer look at the various technologies that make Just Walk Out technology tick:Computer vision and machine learning enable Just Walk Out technology and preserve customer privacyYou enter a store like Lumen Field’s District Market with your credit card at the entry gate, or by scanning your palm over an Amazon One device. Amazon One is Amazon’s palm-based identity and payment system that uses AI and machine learning to link your credit card to your palm.Once inside the store, you will find several specialized cameras mounted to the ceiling with a view of the entire store area. Jon Jenkins, vice president of Just Walk Out technology, says a combination of computer vision and machine learning allows the system to know “who takes what and charge them correctly when they walk out.”When you pick up a can of soda, the Just Walk Out technology adds it to your virtual cart. If you decide to return it to the shelf, the technology will automatically remove it.“Our tech is able to distinguish shoppers from one another, without collecting or using any of their biometric information,” Jenkins adds. “Just Walk Out technology detects when a shopper’s hand interacts with a product on the shelf. When that happens, machine learning algorithms make sure the correct item is added to the virtual cart—all without any specific knowledge about the person.”A customer inserts their credit card to enter District Market, a Just Walk Out technology store, in Lumen Field.Customers can also enter a Just Walk Out technology store by hovering their palm over an Amazon One palm recognition device.The entrance to the Just Walk Out technology store at Lumen Field.01 / 03Just Walk Out technology operates independently from Amazon One, and doesn’t use or collect any biometric information of shoppers. Customer trust and privacy are paramount to the experience. Just Walk Out technology simply links a customer with their payment instrument. When shoppers enter the store, the technology assigns them a temporary numeric code, which serves as the shopper’s unique digital signature for that shopping trip. The system preserves the code throughout the shopper’s time in the store. When they exit, the code disappears, and if they come back, they get a new code.Top 5 facts you may not know about Amazon OneAmazon One is designed to deliver the highest levels of customer privacy and data security.Read more“In every image, we have a number of pixels that belong to a person,” Medioni says. “If a shopper takes off their jacket, for example, their signature updates as they move around the store. Just Walk Out tech doesn’t collect any biometrics. All we need to know is where that person is on the floor, and where their hands are in relation to the store’s merchandise.”The technology is so accurate that it can also track groups of shoppers. More than one person can enter a store with a single credit card. The system tracks each individual, but associates the group with the same payment instrument, which can be useful for family shopping trips. When the group walks out, the system knows which shoppers were using the same card and generates one receipt for the collective transaction.“We had a tour bus that came in one day, and they had 90 people all paying with a single credit card,” Medioni adds. “Even if people leave the store separately and we can still keep track of the group’s purchases.”Shelf sensors and sensor “fusion” for accurate receiptsJust Walk Out technology uses object recognition to accurately identify sandwiches, bags of potato chips, and other merchandise. Medioni says the system has been trained to know what it is looking at—“When you return an item to the wrong place by mistake, the system adjusts accordingly,” he says. The technology also alerts a store attendant to put the misplaced item back in the right place.Lumen Field's District Market.For smaller, harder-to-see products, like chewing gum or lipstick, weight sensors on the shelf detect when customers pick something up.“Very small items are an interesting challenge for a computer vision system, because the camera—the primary sensors—can only see so much,” Jenkins says. “Having additional sensors enables us to do some really cool things in terms of solving problems that would be otherwise very difficult to solve with cameras only.”A fusion of input from the weight sensor, known as a “load-cell sensor,” on the shelves and the cameras helps the system figure out what item was picked up by the shopper.“The thing that’s important about Just Walk Out technology is that we always look at each store uniquely, to ensure we’re deploying the right set of technologies,” Jenkins says.Leveraging generative AI and synthetic data to build a robust systemBefore generative AI became a buzzword, Amazon research teams used it to help develop Just Walk Out technology by creating photorealistic sets of synthetic data—information about situations that can be hard to find in real life and difficult to teach a computer.“This is very similar to the self-driving car, where the basic case is easy, but there is a long tail of complex cases,” Medioni says. “If the system has never seen an event like this, it may not do well. We wanted to have many examples, so we generated video clips of synthetic shoppers performing similar activities, then trained the system to make the right decisions.”Medioni and his team used a type of generative AI called generative adversarial network (GAN) to create synthetic data for training Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology.“With GANs, you can control absolutely every movement that the virtual shopper is performing,” he says.Amazon's Just Walk Out technology rolls out to hospitals, with 'badge pay' for doctors, nurses, and health care staffBadge pay is the latest Just Walk Out technology innovation that removes friction for retailers while providing convenience for customers.Read moreThe team used datasets from millions of AI-generated synthetic images and video clips mimicking realistic, and sometimes rare, shopping scenarios—including variations in store format, lighting conditions, and even crowds of shoppers.

a job threatened or supported by AI? - AI-generated image.

Bart Brouwers







The Netherlands, known for its rich history and innovative spirit, is charting a new course in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). A recent study by RaboResearch, led by Suzanne Bijkerk and Sjoerd Hardeman, reveals a pragmatic perspective among the Dutch workforce. While they recognize the transformative potential of AI, the majority do not see it as a threat to their employment. Only 6% anticipate significant job disruptions, and 7% foresee changes in their salary structures.
Key Findings:

The advent of generative AI applications, such as ChatGPT and Dall-E 2, has reignited discussions about the implications of new technologies on employment and income.
Only a small fraction of workers believe that new technology will have major consequences for their jobs (6%) and salaries (7%).
Despite this, approximately 38% of tasks in the Netherlands are susceptible to technological advancements due to their routine nature.
These routine tasks can be categorized into physically routine tasks, which require physical effort (17%), and cognitively routine tasks, which demand mental capabilities (21%).
AI is likely to replace primarily the cognitively routine tasks, especially those of a repetitive nature.
Physically routine tasks are predominant among workers in the hospitality, transport, logistics, and industrial sectors, as well as among those with practical education and lower incomes. On the other hand, cognitively routine tasks are more common among workers in business and financial services, government, healthcare, education, and among those with theoretical education and higher incomes.
Workers anticipate that the impact of new technology will not necessarily result in job or income loss but rather in a shift in job roles that may require new skills and knowledge.
The expected effects of new technology increase as the tasks of workers become more cognitively routine.

The study utilized a survey of over 10,000 Dutch residents, including 5,446 workers, to map out the tasks performed by these individuals. This helped in analyzing how the Dutch economy might be affected by technological advancements. The research also highlighted which groups of workers are expected to face more significant impacts and which ones less.
The influence of AI on routine tasks
According to the RaboResearch report, routine tasks, both physical and cognitive, are most likely to be influenced by the rise of AI.




Physically Routine Tasks: These tasks require physical effort and often involve repetitive actions. Examples include operating machinery and overseeing processes. Many of these tasks can be automated with the advent of AI and robotics. In sectors such as hospitality, transport, and logistics, physically routine tasks are prominent. The expectation is that AI-driven robots and systems may take over some of these tasks in the future, leading to a shift like work in these sectors.
Cognitively Routine Tasks: These tasks call upon cognitive abilities and often contain repetitive actions, such as scheduling meetings or accounting tasks. AI has the potential to particularly influence these tasks. Algorithms can replace the cognitive abilities of workers for tasks with a repetitive nature. Sectors such as business and financial services, government, healthcare, and education have a higher percentage of these cognitively routine tasks. With the integration of AI, workers in these sectors can expect their roles to evolve, where they oversee AI systems more or focus on more complex, non-routine tasks.

The report emphasizes that, although a significant percentage of tasks in the Netherlands are routine in nature, the general expectation among workers is not necessarily that AI will replace their jobs. Instead, they foresee an evolution in their roles and a potential need for new skills and knowledge to collaborate with advanced AI systems.

The findings suggest that while there is potential for certain tasks to be automated, the overall sentiment among Dutch workers remains optimistic. They believe that while their roles might evolve, the essence of their jobs will remain intact, albeit with the need for continuous learning and adaptation.
Healthcare, agriculture, finance, transport
The healthcare sector in the Netherlands is a prime example of this balanced integration. AI-driven diagnostic tools are being employed to enhance patient care, assisting radiologists in detecting anomalies in medical images. Additionally, AI-powered chatbots are becoming a standard tool for patient queries and appointment scheduling, streamlining administrative tasks.

Agriculture, a cornerstone of the Dutch economy, is also benefiting from AI advancements. Farmers are using drones equipped with AI to monitor crop health, predict potential diseases, and optimize irrigation. This approach marries the Netherlands’ longstanding agricultural traditions with modern technology, aiming for increased efficiency and sustainability.
In the financial sector, Dutch banks are harnessing AI for enhanced security. Machine learning algorithms analyze transaction patterns, providing an added layer of protection against fraudulent activities. This ensures the safety of customer transactions and streamlines banking operations.
Transportation is another area where the Netherlands is testing the waters with AI. Efforts are underway to develop AI-driven systems to manage traffic flow and enhance public transportation schedules, to improve commuting experiences for its residents.

Good.It can have my next one too.By Ian BogostIllustration by Joanne Imperio / The AtlanticSeptember 27, 2023ShareSave When The Atlantic revealed last month that tens of thousands of books published in the past 20 years had been used without permission to train Meta’s AI language model, well-known authors were outraged, calling it a “smoking gun” for mega-corporate misbehavior. Now that the magazine has put out a searchable database of affected books, the outrage is redoubled: “I would never have consented for Meta to train AI on any of my books, let alone five of them,” wrote the novelist Lauren Groff. “Hyperventilating.” The original Atlantic story gestured at this sense of violation and affront: “The future promised by AI is written with stolen words,” it said.I understand that the database in question, called “Books3,” appears to have been assembled from torrented ebooks ripped into text files, in which case any use of it could be a breach of copyright. Still I was mystified, at first, by the Sturm und Drang response, and by the claim that generative AI is “powered by mass theft.” Perhaps I was just jealous of the famous writers who were being singled out as victims—Stephen King, Zadie Smith, Michael Pollan, and others who command huge speaking fees and lucrative secondary-rights deals. Maybe I’d better understand the writers’ angst, I thought, if my work, too, was being pirated and sourced for AI power.Now I know that it is. Yesterday, when I put my name into The Atlantic’s database search, three of the 10 books I have authored or co-authored appeared. How exciting! I’d joined the ranks of the aggrieved. But then, despite some effort, I found myself disappointingly unaggrieved. What on earth was wrong with me?Authors who are angry—authors who are effing furious—have pointed to the fact that their work was used without permission. That is also at the heart of a lawsuit filed in California by the comedian Sarah Silverman and two other authors, Richard Kadrey and Christopher Golden, which contends that Meta failed to seek out their consent before extracting snippets of their text, called “tokens,” for use in teaching its AI. The company used their books in ways the authors didn’t anticipate and, upon consideration, in ways they don’t approve of. (Meta has filed a motion to dismiss the suit.)Whether or not Meta’s behavior amounts to infringement is a matter for the courts to decide. Permission is a different matter. One of the facts (and pleasures) of authorship is that one’s work will be used in unpredictable ways. The philosopher Jacques Derrida liked to talk about “dissemination,” which I take to mean that, like a plant releasing its seed, an author separates from their published work. Their readers (or viewers, or listeners) not only can but must make sense of that work in different contexts. A retiree cracks a Haruki Murakami novel recommended by a grandchild. A high-school kid skims Shakespeare for a class. My mother’s tree trimmer reads my book on play at her suggestion. A lack of permission underlies all of these uses, as it underlies influence in general: When successful, art exceeds its creator’s plans.But internet culture recasts permission as a moral right. Many authors are online, and they can tell you if and when you’re wrong about their work. Also online are swarms of fans who will evangelize their received ideas of what a book, a movie, or an album really means and snuff out the “wrong” accounts. The Books3 imbroglio reflects the same impulse to believe that some interpretations of a work are out of bounds.Read: What I found in a database Meta uses to train generative AIPerhaps Meta is an unappealing reader. Perhaps chopping prose into tokens is not how I would like to be read. But then, who am I to say what my work is good for, how it might benefit someone—even a near-trillion-dollar company? To bemoan this one unexpected use for my writing is to undermine all of the other unexpected uses for it. Speaking as a writer, that makes me feel bad.I also feel—am I allowed to say this?—a little bored by the idea that Meta has stolen my life. If the theft and aggregation of the works in Books3 is objectionable on moral or legal grounds, then it ought to be so irrespective of those works’ absorption into one particular technology company’s large language model. But that doesn’t seem to be the case. The Books3 database was itself uploaded in resistance to the corporate juggernauts. The person who first posted the repository has described it as the only way for open-source, grassroots AI projects to compete with huge commercial enterprises. He was trying to return some control of the future to ordinary people, including book authors. In the meantime, Meta contends that the next generation of its AI model—which may or may not still include Books3 in its training data—is “free for research and commercial use,” a statement that demands scrutiny but also complicates this saga. So does the fact that hours after The Atlantic published a search tool for Books3, one writer distributed a link that allows you to access the feature without subscribing to this magazine. In other words: a free way for people to be outraged about people getting writers’ work for free.I’m not sure what I make of all this, as a citizen of the future no less than as a book author. Theft is an original sin of the internet. Sometimes we call it piracy (when software is uploaded to Usenet, or books to Books3); other times it’s seen as innovation (when Google processed and indexed the entire internet without permission) or even liberation. AI merely iterates this ambiguity. I’m having trouble drawing any novel or definitive conclusions about the Books3 story based on the day-old knowledge that some of my writing, along with trillions more chunks of words from, perhaps, Amazon reviews and Reddit grouses, have made their way into an AI training set.Actually, what about those Amazon reviewers and Redditors? What about the Wikipedia authors who labored to write the pages for Bratz dolls and the Bosc pear, or the bloggers whose blogs were long abandoned, or the corporate-brochure copywriters, or, heck, even the search-engine-optimization landfill dumpers? All of their work likely has been or will be sucked into the giant language models too. The total volume of textual material accessible and accessed for training AI models makes books—even nearly 200,000 of them—seem a speck by comparison.Read: What happens when AI has read everything?It is understandable, I suppose, to hold literary works in greater esteem than banana-bread-recipe introductions or Am I the Asshole subreddit posts or water-inlet-valve-replacement instructions. But it is also pretentious. We who write and publish magazines and books are professionals with a personal stake in the gravity of authorship. We are also few in number. Almost anyone can write, over years, millions of words on social media, in texts and emails, in reports and memos for their work. I love books and respect them, but, as a published author and professional writer, I may be in the category least at risk of losing my connection to the written word and its spoils. If an AI collage of Stephen King and Yelp can do better than me, what business do I have calling myself a writer in the first place?I became an author because language offers a special medium for experimenting with ideas. Words and sentences are malleable. Texts arise from basements of subtext. What I say embraces what I don’t and makes room for what you read. Once bound and published, boxed and shipped, my books find their way to places I might never have anticipated. As vessels for ideas, I hope, but also as doorstops or insect-execution devices or as the last inch of a stack that holds up a laptop for an important Zoom. Or even—even!—as a litany of tokens, chunked apart to be reassembled by the alien mind of a weird machine. Why not? I am an author, sure, but I am also a man who put some words in order amid the uncountable others who have done the same. If authorship is nothing more than vanity, then let the machines put us out of our misery.About the AuthorIan Bogost is a contributing writer at The Atlantic.

Sci-fi movie The Creator opens this week, depicting a war for the future between humans, robots, and AI. A well-worn concept that dates back to the coining of the word ‘robot’ in the 1920 play, R.U.R.
But there are signs that the battle is beginning for real – in the US law courts; in strikes; in Europe – where nearly a million professionals are rebelling; in the UK; and worldwide on social networks.
Below are just some of the growing number of actions.
Talk about artificial intelligence, and copyright and intellectual property are never far from the conversation. That has certainly been the case this week on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
There, a rebellion is brewing among authors who have discovered that full copies of their copyrighted works are among 183,000 texts on the Books3 database, which has been used to train generative AI systems.
Authors can search for their work in the database here: https://full-stack-search-prod.vercel.app.
Tens of thousands of pirated texts were among data scraped from the internet by AI companies, creating a critical legal distinction between public-domain work, and works that were merely placed in a public domain, the internet, by persons unknown.
Scraping copyrighted data from the internet for commercial purposes is illegal, but it can be allowed for academic research. That copyrighted data of any kind – including images – is used to train commercial software so it can generate similar works surely closes the ‘research’ loophole.
Authors speak out
On X, Irvine Welsh, author of Trainspotting, Glue, Marabou Stork Nightmares, and other epochal tales, wrote:
Idea for sci fi novel: writer involuntarily mentors robots of the future to train them in a language and culture that won’t exist in that future – to produce stuff the dwindling number of humans won’t read, and the infinite number of robots won’t need to.

Chocolat author Joanne Harris said:
This is only one website of several, using pirated books to train AI. 18 of my books are on this database, and have already been used to train AI, without my consent.

Sathnam Sanghera, author of The Boy with the Top Knot, wrote:
Millions of hours of authors' work being exploited by big tech with zero payment. Funny how writers keep getting shafted. RAGE.

Crime writer Val McDermid was among the famous names on X urging others to take action, while young adults (YA) fiction author Celine Kiernan spoke for many creative professionals:
I wrote these books based on a life of experience, the death of my dad, the many wars that gnaw our world, the history of my country & family. They came directly from my heart. What are they to a machine but words in sequence?

An excellent point, to which she added:
What has the world let itself in for? In the creative fields, AI can never be anything but a warped photograph of a stranger.

Powerful words. And a view I shared in a report earlier this year, which described ‘prompt engineers’ punching the button on AI’s ‘global photocopier’.
As I noted in that and other pieces, it is almost as if AI companies see artists, authors, academics, designers, journalists, designers, musicians, and filmmakers as the world’s most urgent problem – above climate change, pandemics, rogue asteroids, and nuclear catastrophe. If only we could deprive creatives of an income, the world might be saved!
Earlier this month, I reported that the UK’s Publishers Association is also carrying the fight – in this case, to the government, which has omitted copyright altogether from its discussions on AI regulation. An oversight that needs urgent remedy, as the government appears to favor asking vendors what to do.
Addressing a Westminster eForum on AI regulation, Caroline Cummins, the Association’s Head of Policy and Public Affairs, said:
The first [problem] is copyright infringement on a massive scale, when text and data that is subject to copyright is used in the training of AI without consent or compensation.
There's a lack of transparency around training data and AI, which makes it incredibly difficult for creators or rights holders to even see how their work has been used. And there are many examples of human creators – authors, musicians, artists – seeing their work undermined, or in some cases replicated, by AI models.

The US joins the war
That’s certainly the view of The Author’s Guild, America’s oldest writers’ organization. Last week, it launched a class action against ChatGPT maker OpenAI. (This follows in the wake of similar actions by visual artists against other vendors earlier this year.)
The suit alleges “flagrant and harmful infringements of plaintiffs’ registered copyrights”. More, it called ChatGPT a “massive commercial enterprise” that is reliant upon “systematic theft on a mass scale.” Ouch.
George RR Martin, John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, David Baldacci, Sylvia Day, Jonathan Franzen, and Elin Hilderbrand are among the 17 high-profile authors putting their names to the lawsuit – powerful names in Hollywood among them.
On that point, the US film and TV community – and by extension, filmmakers everywhere – have been impacted by AI too. Deep fakes and memes abound online, suggesting a future in which actors’ likenesses will become valuable commercial properties (not to mention targets of crime). But owned by whom?
The strike by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) – which ended this week – was largely over the potential use of AI in scripts.
Writers were afraid that studios would use generative systems to write or rewrite stories, effectively replacing the real-world writers’ room with a database full of hidden, uncredited people. Like the authors who are suing OpenAI, in fact.
Under the terms of the forward-looking WGA agreement, AI cannot be used for those purposes, and neither can generated texts be considered as source material.
This is broadly in line with a US judge’s ruling this month that AI-generated content cannot be copyrighted; only changes made to it by a human creator. A ruling that will – and should – have far-reaching consequences.
The WGA also mandates full disclosure: writers are free to use AI if they wish, but studios cannot order them to use such a tool, or specify which product. Studios must also disclose any AI-generated elements given to a writer.
Again, this is broadly in line with international moves to force the disclosure of AI’s use in creative endeavors.
Meanwhile in Europe…
The European Union has also been leading the fight, via the Draft AI Act and other measures. However, an extraordinary alliance of organizations believes that legislators and regulators should go much further.
Those organizations are:

CEATL (European Council of Literary Translators’ Associations)
ECSA (European Composer and Songwriter Alliance)
IFJ (International Federation of Journalists)
EFJ (European Federation of Journalists)
EGAIR (European Guild for Artificial Intelligence Regulation)
EWC (European Writers’ Council)
FERA (Federation of European Screen Directors)
FIA (International Federation of Actors)
FIM (International Federation of Musicians)
FSE (Federation of Screenwriters in Europe)
IAO (International Artist Organisation) 
UNI (an alliance of 140 unions in media, entertainment, and the arts)
UVA (United Voice Artists)

Together, they represent close to a million creative professionals in Europe and elsewhere. Yesterday (26 September), those professionals shared an open letter to EU policymakers.
It said:
We all share a common concern as generative AI rapidly spreads in a legal environment which is poorly enforced and lacks adequate safeguards regarding the use of our members' works and personal data for AI training purposes.
Equally problematic are the numerous unauthorized, abusive, and deceptively transformative uses of our members' protected works and personal data by AI-powered technologies.”

It continued:
We must reiterate our position and insist on the absolute need for a human-centric approach to regulating generative AI.
This approach should recognize, secure, and enforce the right of our members to control the use of their artistic creations during the machine-learning process.
To make sure it protects human artistry and creativity, it must be built upon principles of informed consent, transparency, fair remuneration, and contractual practices.

But isn’t AI itself a creative tool – one already used legitimately by artists of every kind?
The letter acknowledged the “extraordinary technological advancement with immense potential to enhance various aspects of our lives, including in our sectors”, but added:
However, it is crucial to recognize that alongside these benefits, there exists a darker aspect to this technology.
Generative AI is trained on large sets of data and huge amounts of protected contents scraped and copied from the internet. It is programmed to deliver outputs that closely mimic and have the ability to compete with human creation. This technology poses several risks to our creative communities.”

So, what are those risks? The letter explained:
Firstly, the protected works, voices, and images of our members are often used without their knowledge, consent, and remuneration to generate content.
[But] there is also a broader societal risk, as people may be led to believe that the content they encounter – whether in text, audio, or visuals – is a genuine and truthful human creation, when it is the mere result of AI generation or manipulation.
This deception can have far-reaching implications for the spread of misinformation and the erosion of trust in the authenticity of digital content.”

The financial context
This fightback was inevitable, and it really is for the future.
That’s because copyright and IP underpin countless successful industries, from publishing, music, film, and other creative sectors, through to the proprietary interests of Big Pharma and Big Tech, whose vendors have been stockpiling patents for decades.
Many of those industries see AI, potentially, as an existential threat to the core of their businesses. Indeed, the likes of OpenAI could, unchecked, become economic black holes sucking in all forms of creative and knowledge-based activity. That needs urgent guardrails and limitations.
There are also security implications. As I reported last month, the fact that most generative AI is deployed by individuals, not enterprises – employees using the likes of ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion as ‘shadow IT’, unsanctioned by managers – is creating another type of IP nightmare.
Source code is the most common form of privileged data being pasted into cloud tools by, in effect, rogue individuals – employees who don’t know any better. By doing so, they are divulging source code and other private or proprietary data to AI vendors, who may use it to train their systems. Can we trust those vendors to be ethical?
So, what are the economics behind this fight?
In the UK alone, government figures show that the creative industries brought in £109 billion ($132 billion) to the economy in 2021 – nearly six percent of total economic output, not far behind Financial Services’ eight percent contribution.
In the US, the figures are extraordinary. There, arts and culture contributed an estimated $1 trillion to the economy in 2021 – more than Construction ($945 billion) and Transportation ($688 billion).
However, the US IT sector brought in nearly $2 trillion – not far off the value of the entire British economy. But is that a good enough reason to sacrifice other industries to the IT sector?
To disembowel them on the altar of growth?
My take
diginomica believes that all generative AI systems should be regarded as derivative work generators, as they need source training data from which to generate new texts or images. If that data has been scraped illegally, or scraped unknowingly from pirate sources, then that can only be a breach of copyright law.
Indeed, saying “I used a derivative work engine to make this content!” doesn’t sound as cool as saying “I used an AI!” Yet it is the truth. So, my advice is, if you can’t say “I used a derivative work engine” with pride, then don’t use generative AI!
On the face of it, it seems unlikely that AI companies were unaware of the extent of what some authors are calling personal identity theft – the scraping of, in many cases, their lives, emotions, and experiences, as well as their imaginations.
The lawsuits were inevitable, then. But the big question is not so much who will win, but whether AI companies – in some cases trillion-dollar corporations, and in others backed by them – knew this would happen.
If they did then, surely, they were well aware they were breaking the law. Or perhaps just wanted to test its limits. Either way, ethics played no part in their strategy.
In related news this week, Reuters reports that a jury must decide the outcome of a lawsuit by Thomson Reuters, which accuses Ross Intelligence of – ironically – copying content from its legal research platform, Westlaw, to train a competing AI platform. As such, it will be one of the first cases of alleged data-scraping by an AI vendor to go to court. Meta and Stability AI are among other vendors battling separate allegations of copyright infringement.

Are bigger language models always better?

Generative AI can provide significant advantages in your research, by helping source answers more quickly. You can expect to engage with generative AI in a conversational manner to get up to speed on what’s new and get model language to start drafting.The future of AI and legal professionals calls for streamlining tedious and time-consuming tasks, such as due diligence, document and contract review, contract management, sorting files, and proofreading. As a result, you’ll be able to focus on more valuable and creative legal pursuits and advice that only a human can tackle. Jump to ↓  Limited accuracy Increased risks Privacy and ethical issues Why can’t AI replace lawyers? 3 reasons why generative AI will not take over lawyer jobsMany, including paralegals, are concerned that it will completely replace their jobs. However, there are three major reasons why we don’t anticipate that happening.Wiil AI replace paralegals?Let’s separate fact from fiction, and look to the futureRead blog post  1. Limited accuracyAI models are trained on a massive amount of text and search for what they’re told. But they are only trained to create results that seem plausible. Not all generative AI tech out there prioritizes being accurate or representative of the latest information.An AI “hallucination” results when the model completely makes something up. The AI-generated sentence may sound reasonable and flow nicely, but it turns out not to be based in fact.However, providing authority for the answer is one way the generative AI features from Thomson Reuters minimize hallucinations. Attorneys will be able to see the reasons for the response and verify that the answer makes sense and is based in fact. 2. Increased riskEight in 10 partners or managing partners said they had risk concerns around generative AI or ChatGPT within the law firm, according to a recent study by the Thomson Reuters Institute. What’s more, none of the 157 large law firm respondents said their firms had no risk concerns about the technology.Part of those concerns center around the inaccuracies in an industry that depends on precise decision making. Other areas of increased risk include the handling of confidential data, and in the case of public tools such as ChatGPT, the ownership of private data and security concerns. 3. Privacy and ethical issuesAs lawyers increasingly rely on generative AI for research and writing, it’s possible the less they will use their knowledge and skills. This may raise ethical concerns around acting in the best interest of the client, as well as malpractice and other issues. In addition, the legal professionals we surveyed generally do not fully trust generative AI tools with confidential data, and they believe guardrails must be applied to AI use. These trust and ethical issues are precisely the concerns Thomson Reuters CEO Steve Hasker takes seriously. Why can’t AI replace lawyers?Generative AI cannot replace lawyers because it needs human oversight to work. Even with retrieval augmented generation, a process that uses vetted sources to enhance accuracy, generative AI is not completely accurate. Generative AI will augment or fully automate daily legal tasks, but simply can’t handle certain critical and nuanced items.Rather than being replaced or displaced by generative AI, humans will prove critical to ensuring that it serves the industry well. Think of AI as your indispensable assistant that frees up your time for more advanced tasks that need the human touch.Some legal industry jobs that focus on searching for and coding information in legal documents may be eliminated. But other jobs will be created, including managing and developing AI, writing algorithms for it, and reviewing AI-assisted work product.Having humans use AI programs to control the output and mitigate errors may offer the best strategy for forward-thinking lawyers.

It took everyone by surprise, gaining about one million users in five days. OpenAI’s conversational chatbot not only blew open the doors on the idea that computers could generate ideas and de facto mimic humans, but it heralded a new era in which white collar professional workers were directly threatened.    by Taboola by Taboola Sponsored Links Sponsored Links Promoted Links Promoted Links You May LikeTruthFinderLocate Almost Anyone By Entering Their Name (This Is Addicting!)TruthFinderSearch NowThis group’s job security had previously been inoculated against the arrival of new technology.

It was definitely quicker than a typewriter or old-fashioned pen and paper, so I’m not complaining and I’m not naïve.

Thanks to generative AI and in particular ChatGPT, the porous line between human and machine is becoming confused. So much so that the central issue facing people in the workplace can be summed up in one word: authenticity.I asked Alice Sherwood, visiting senior fellow at the Policy Institute at King’s College London and author of Authenticity: Reclaiming Reality in a Counterfeit Culture, what an age of generative AI means for worker identity. The concept of being true to yourself originated in the 1960s with the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, but more recently took a workplace setting when Harvard Professor Bill George wrote the best-selling Authentic Leadership: Rediscovering the Secrets to Creating Lasting Value. The authentic self at work has come to mean a shorthand for showing your true self as someone who is therefore more trustworthy. But Sherwood notes that authenticity has become complicated by a new fear: replacement anxiety.While AI can already do many jobs better than humans, such as form-filling, blurb writing, assessing X-rays and developing new drugs, it can’t make human connections with colleagues and clients — but that may be about to change, Sherwood said. An employer can already use generative AI to make plausible, deepfake videos of their employees. If they add in a voice imitator that offers “ultra-realistic text-to-speech fakery” they can script staff to speak the company’s words in their own voices.“No wonder employees are uneasy. When there’s a deepfake that looks like you, sounds like you, never gets tired, never goes on holiday, and can even phone your mother why wouldn’t they get the job instead of you?” Sherwood said “But replacement anxiety is about more than a loss of jobs, it’s about a loss of identity. Who has the right to your digital self, your facial features, your voiceprint, and who can put words into your mouth, is set to become one of the hottest legal and employment issues.”Recent research from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania echoed Sherwood’s view on replacement anxiety, noting that “LLM technology in the form of ChatGPT4, a technology available for just a few months at the time of our experiments, is already significantly better at generating new product ideas than motivated, trained engineering and business students at a highly selective university.”History BooksLet’s look at this moment in the context of the history of work and of new technology. It’s almost always the case that the new bits spook us. The arrival of the printing press was met in fifteenth century Venice with the Polemic Against Printing from the Benedictine monk and scribe Filippo de Strata. Indeed, the path of Mr. Gutenberg and his bible wasn’t smooth.A leap forward to the middle of the twentieth century takes us to when Moore’s Law first articulated the increase in computing power, a limit AI has arguably breached. Then with the dawn of the internet at the end of the twentieth century — AI after all is about digital operations — we can begin to see what speed and scale can do.But perhaps the best comparison is Henry Ford’s first assembly line in 1913. The transformative element here wasn’t a large language model, but a production line which moved — literally. The innovation was to introduce physical movement into production at scale and in a sequence human workers slotted into, not vice versa. The rest, as they say, is history: Within a year Ford was mass producing more cars with less people, more “efficiently” than any competitor.Unsurprisingly, generative AI is projected to become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032.Skin in the GameJust as unsurprisingly, there’s a lot of anxiety and it’s beyond jobs. It’s about human agency and autonomy as well as authenticity. There are distinct whiffs of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein abounding: We worry we’ve created a monster. I especially worry when those with most to gain commercially show this nervousness. That’s exactly what has happened with ChatGPT. Within six months of its’ launch, more than 1,000 technology leaders including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Inc., signed an open letter warning that things were getting “out-of-control.”Disquiet is catching. Prominent writers corralled by the Author’s Guild wrote to AI industry leaders to “compensate us for using our writings, without which AI would be banal and extremely limited.” Recently a central feature of the bitter artist strike in Hollywood hinged on the replacement of humans by AI generated images and at the very least a lowering of pay as a result.Regeneration — and RegulationClearly this moment calls for regulation. In a recent presentation to the UK Parliament, Oxford University Law Professor Jeremias Adams-Prassl noted: “If someone tells you that they can sell you an algorithm, then watch a two minute video and then give you an exact score of your teamworking capabilities, that’s what we call snake-oil AI.”This moment also calls for prioritization. Adams-Prassl has argued that privacy, information access and keeping the management with the humans will be pivotal to determining whether we rise to this occasion.Interestingly, the American word for autumn is fall.

While we have all been having endless arguments about flexible working and what has been rudely mocked as “shirking from home,” that chapter has been written. Hybrid working has persisted despite efforts by large companies to lure workers back to the office. The dominant story about the present and future of work is about a different kind of hybrid: How ordinary workers co-exist with digital co-workers.Work’s main issue is no longer the future of inanimate bricks and mortar of offices — significant economically though this is to city centers, commutes and the real-estate industry. Nor is it about the alternative “space” of the much-vaunted metaverse, which Wired Magazine describes as so vague that if you replace it with cyberspace “ninety percent of the time, the meaning won’t substantially change.”Instead, the next chapter of work concerns the gamechanger of ChatGPT, which arrived in November 2022. It took everyone by surprise, gaining about one million users in five days. OpenAI’s conversational chatbot not only blew open the doors on the idea that computers could generate ideas and de facto mimic humans, but it heralded a new era in which white collar professional workers were directly threatened.This group’s job security had previously been inoculated against the arrival of new technology. Now articles with titles like “How To Save Your Job From ChatGPT” are aimed squarely at such workers and it’s a shock to the system. The promise is that AI will save time, save work, allow humans to be their best creative selves, but the risk is the exact opposite.By way of illustration, I typed this article on a very fast new laptop. It was definitely quicker than a typewriter or old-fashioned pen and paper, so I’m not complaining and I’m not naïve. But if I tell you that the AI-assisted tools have made my task significantly slower due to all the pop-ups and “intuitive” suggestions you might smile indulgently at my technophobia. You might also nod in recognition: This isn’t generative AI but its sibling, predictive AI. For the first time my “knowledge work,” as the great management guru Peter Drucker called it, is constantly being interrupted by a noisy digital “co-worker” trying to being “useful.”Replacement AnxietyThe authors of a new book The Coming Wave: Technology, Power and the Twenty First Century’s Greatest Dilemma identify a new kind of human creature who they call “homo technologicus — the technological animal.”This may sound like a cute sound-bite, but it has the ring of truth. Thanks to generative AI and in particular ChatGPT, the porous line between human and machine is becoming confused. So much so that the central issue facing people in the workplace can be summed up in one word: authenticity.I asked Alice Sherwood, visiting senior fellow at the Policy Institute at King’s College London and author of Authenticity: Reclaiming Reality in a Counterfeit Culture, what an age of generative AI means for worker identity. The concept of being true to yourself originated in the 1960s with the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, but more recently took a workplace setting when Harvard Professor Bill George wrote the best-selling Authentic Leadership: Rediscovering the Secrets to Creating Lasting Value. The authentic self at work has come to mean a shorthand for showing your true self as someone who is therefore more trustworthy. But Sherwood notes that authenticity has become complicated by a new fear: replacement anxiety.While AI can already do many jobs better than humans, such as form-filling, blurb writing, assessing X-rays and developing new drugs, it can’t make human connections with colleagues and clients — but that may be about to change, Sherwood said. An employer can already use generative AI to make plausible, deepfake videos of their employees. If they add in a voice imitator that offers “ultra-realistic text-to-speech fakery” they can script staff to speak the company’s words in their own voices.“No wonder employees are uneasy. When there’s a deepfake that looks like you, sounds like you, never gets tired, never goes on holiday, and can even phone your mother why wouldn’t they get the job instead of you?” Sherwood said “But replacement anxiety is about more than a loss of jobs, it’s about a loss of identity. Who has the right to your digital self, your facial features, your voiceprint, and who can put words into your mouth, is set to become one of the hottest legal and employment issues.”Recent research from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania echoed Sherwood’s view on replacement anxiety, noting that “LLM technology in the form of ChatGPT4, a technology available for just a few months at the time of our experiments, is already significantly better at generating new product ideas than motivated, trained engineering and business students at a highly selective university.”History BooksLet’s look at this moment in the context of the history of work and of new technology. It’s almost always the case that the new bits spook us. The arrival of the printing press was met in fifteenth century Venice with the Polemic Against Printing from the Benedictine monk and scribe Filippo de Strata. Indeed, the path of Mr. Gutenberg and his bible wasn’t smooth.A leap forward to the middle of the twentieth century takes us to when Moore’s Law first articulated the increase in computing power, a limit AI has arguably breached. Then with the dawn of the internet at the end of the twentieth century — AI after all is about digital operations — we can begin to see what speed and scale can do.But perhaps the best comparison is Henry Ford’s first assembly line in 1913. The transformative element here wasn’t a large language model, but a production line which moved — literally. The innovation was to introduce physical movement into production at scale and in a sequence human workers slotted into, not vice versa. The rest, as they say, is history: Within a year Ford was mass producing more cars with less people, more “efficiently” than any competitor.Unsurprisingly, generative AI is projected to become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032.Skin in the GameJust as unsurprisingly, there’s a lot of anxiety and it’s beyond jobs. It’s about human agency and autonomy as well as authenticity. There are distinct whiffs of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein abounding: We worry we’ve created a monster. I especially worry when those with most to gain commercially show this nervousness. That’s exactly what has happened with ChatGPT. Within six months of its’ launch, more than 1,000 technology leaders including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Inc., signed an open letter warning that things were getting “out-of-control.”Disquiet is catching. Prominent writers corralled by the Author’s Guild wrote to AI industry leaders to “compensate us for using our writings, without which AI would be banal and extremely limited.” Recently a central feature of the bitter artist strike in Hollywood hinged on the replacement of humans by AI generated images and at the very least a lowering of pay as a result.Regeneration — and RegulationClearly this moment calls for regulation. In a recent presentation to the UK Parliament, Oxford University Law Professor Jeremias Adams-Prassl noted: “If someone tells you that they can sell you an algorithm, then watch a two minute video and then give you an exact score of your teamworking capabilities, that’s what we call snake-oil AI.”This moment also calls for prioritization. Adams-Prassl has argued that privacy, information access and keeping the management with the humans will be pivotal to determining whether we rise to this occasion.Interestingly, the American word for autumn is fall. It’s easy to think we may be falling into a bleak future of work, in which humans don’t regenerate as fast as their technological opposite numbers. But like all moments in history, humans learn to work with the machines.I’m an optimistic pessimist. I see leaves coming away from trees and fluttering to the ground in an endless cycle of endings and beginnings.","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Economic Times', 'productID': 'prime.economictimes.indiatimes.com:prime'}","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative artificial intelligence has suddenly taken front stage since OpenAI’s ChatGPT was made available to everyone in November 2022. Since then, the key questions for every organization have been: What’s in it for us? What can it change in the way we work, in our customer experience, in our operations? The race is on to bring the power of generative AI into the workplace. One key development has been the announcement by Microsoft that they were soon releasing Microsoft 365 Copilot in general availability.
Orange is one of the organizations around the world to participate in the Microsoft 365 Copilot early access program (EAP). Microsoft 365 Copilot combines the power of Large Language Models with data in the Microsoft Graph – calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings and more – and the Microsoft 365 apps to help users create content faster and better.
Copilot will be available in Microsoft 365 applications, such as Teams, Excel, Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint this fall. It uses generative AI to help users write, design, and present more effectively. What’s unique about Microsoft 365 Copilot is that it is fully integrated into our daily work tools. Yet, you don’t have to use it if you don’t want to.
Let me give you an example: I used it to draft a first version of this blog. I prompted Microsoft 365 Copilot with a few bullet points using natural language, as I would use in a normal chat. It came up with a well-written draft, and I added my personal edits on top. It saved me at least one precious hour of work.
This is a good example of where Copilot excels: it helps users do various tasks, such as writing a blog, creating a PowerPoint presentation, or summarizing a meeting, faster and perhaps better. Microsoft 365 Copilot has the potential to help many people work a lot more efficiently. Expect it to make a big impact!
That’s why we are thrilled to be part of the Microsoft 365 Copilot early access program (EAP), and why it’s important for Orange. We want to figure out how Copilot can change the way people work. What we experience as a diverse, global company will probably look similar to what many large organizations will experience. For Orange Business, being able to help our enterprise customers leverage the best of the technology in a smooth manner is a key goal. By applying our learnings, we can help our customers make the most of Microsoft 365 Copilot. We are also proud to have the opportunity to provide feedback to Microsoft based on our testing to help improve Copilot to boost employee experiences across the board.
Ultimately, this kind of new tool will enable us to save time on low or moderate value-added tasks, freeing up time for tasks where humans excel. Creativity, listening, forming convictions, taking care of customers, imagining new services, reacting to new situations...these are just a few examples of what will be more possible because other tasks will be accelerated and optimized by Microsoft 365 Copilot.
Preparing to test
Over the summer we assembled a core team to select a wide range of testers across Orange worldwide and prepare the roll-out. Participants needed to understand both what to expect from the early access program and what was needed from them. Generative AI generates a lot of excitement, so setting appropriate expectations was important.
A main concern for Orange was data privacy and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance. People had concerns about what would happen to their data. Was it safe? Were we taking a risk regarding GDPR or privacy in general? Were other people going to access their data? The best solution was to make sure that our data would be protected and stored in the EU (European Union). Microsoft listened to our concerns confirming that Microsoft 365 Copilot benefits from Microsoft's security and privacy contractual commitments (including GDPR compliance) as well as the Microsoft EU Data Boundary initiative that aims to define a European boundary within which Microsoft has committed to store and process customer data.
How’s it going? Early insights
We gathered a diverse and representative group of testers who could use Microsoft 365 Copilot in different scenarios, contexts, and job roles, including sales, marketing, HR, IT, consulting, operations, personal assistants, project managers, legal, finance, and more. We also made sure to include representation from 12 different countries. The program formally kicked off earlier this month, and we launched a testers’ community on Teams, and it is already very active. We collect feedback weekly from the testers.
Key objectives for us are to evaluate the impact of Microsoft 365 Copilot on our employees' experience, and then see how our learnings can be applied to support our customers’ experience. We want to see how Copilot can help save time, reduce errors, increase quality, boost creativity, and more generally make users feel better in their job. We also want to understand what they need to adopt Copilot as effectively as possible. We are also deploying internally other AI tools, for instance based on Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, and some of the feedback from our employees is to better understand which technology to use for a specific situation.
We want to get a clear idea of the most powerful use cases – and it’s not just “doing a summary” or “creating a pivot table.” We want to understand in which context Microsoft 365 Copilot brings most value, i.e.: summarizing commercial contracts, creating a report on quarterly financial performance, etc. We want to see which job roles will benefit most from Copilot, hence the diversity in the recruitment of testers. And it’s not just about the diversity of people, but also the diversity of data: the power of Microsoft 365 Copilot will likely express itself differently in different organizations because just like any AI, the quality and nature of the input data has a big impact on the output.
What’s next?
We are learning as we go as all of this is obviously very new. Not just the generative AI technology, but how people see it and use it. It is already clear that data management, change management, and governance will be important efforts to the rollout of any generative AI solution. We are looking forward to seeing the results and leveraging our insights and takeaways both internally and with our customers to unleash positive productivity!

A large language model (LLM) is defined as a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) model that excels in natural language processing tasks.
These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the patterns and structures they have learned from vast training data.
This article explains LLM in detail, its types, working, and some of its key examples.

What Is a Large Language Model?
A large language model (LLM) is a sophisticated artificial intelligence model that excels in natural language processing tasks. These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the patterns and structures they have learned from vast training data. LLMs have achieved remarkable advancements in various language-related applications such as text generation, translation, summarization, question-answering, and more.
At the core of LLMs is a deep learning architecture called a transformer. Transformers consist of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh the importance of different words or tokens in a sequence and capture the relationships between them. By incorporating this attention mechanism, LLMs can effectively process and generate text that has contextually relevant and coherent patterns.
The training process of an LLM involves exposing the model to massive datasets, usually consisting of billions or even trillions of words. These datasets can be derived from various sources such as books, articles, websites, and other textual resources. The LLM learns by predicting the next word in a given context, a process known as unsupervised learning. Through repetition and exposure to diverse text, the model acquires an understanding of grammar, semantics, and the world knowledge contained within the training data.
One notable example of a large language model is OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, such as GPT-3/GPT-4. These models consist of billions of parameters, making them among the largest language models created to date. The size and complexity of these models contribute to their ability to generate high-quality, contextually appropriate responses in natural language.
LLMs have been leveraged for a wide range of applications. They can be fine-tuned on specific tasks by providing additional supervised training data, allowing them to specialize in tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or even playing games like chess. They can also be deployed as chatbots, virtual assistants, content generators, and language translation systems.
However, LLMs also raise important considerations and challenges. One concern is that the computational resources required to train and deploy large models are significant, and the energy consumption associated with training them has raised environmental concerns. For example, according to ‘The AI Index 2023 Annual Report’ by Stanford University, OpenAI’s GPT-3 has released nearly 502 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions during its training.
Another concern is the potential of LLMs to generate misleading or biased information since they learn from the biases present in the training data. Efforts are being made to mitigate these biases and ensure the responsible use of LLMs. Recently, tech leaders such as Elon Musk and university researchers signed a letter urging AI labs to temporarily halt the training of powerful AI systems to avoid unexpected consequences for society, such as the spread of misinformation.
Despite the challenges, the present scenario showcases a widespread implementation of LLMs across various industries, leading to a substantial upsurge in the generative AI market. According to an April 2023 report by Research and Markets, the generative AI market is estimated to grow from $11.3 billion in 2023 to $51.8 billion by 2028, mainly due to the rise in platforms with language generation capabilities.

Types of Large Language Models
Different types of large language models have been developed to address specific needs and challenges in natural language processing (NLP). Let’s look at some of the notable types.

Types of LLMs
1. Autoregressive language models
Autoregressive models generate text by predicting the next word given the preceding words in a sequence. Models such as GPT-3 fall into this category. Autoregressive models are trained to maximize the likelihood of generating the correct next word, conditioned by context. While they excel at generating coherent and contextually relevant text, they can be computationally expensive and may suffer from generating repetitive or irrelevant responses.
Example: GPT-3
2. Transformer-based models
Transformers are a type of deep learning architecture used in large language models. The transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017 is a key component of many LLMs. This transformer architecture allows the model to process and generate text effectively, capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information.
Example: RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) by Facebook AI
3. Encoder-decoder models
Encoder-decoder models are commonly used for machine translation, summarization, and question-answering tasks. These models consist of two main components: an encoder that reads and processes the input sequence and a decoder that generates the output sequence. The encoder learns to encode the input information into a fixed-length representation, which the decoder uses to generate the output sequence. The transformer-based model known as the ‘Transformer’ is an example of an encoder-decoder architecture.
Example: MarianMT (Marian Neural Machine Translation) by the University of Edinburgh
4. Pre-trained and fine-tuned models
Many large language models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets, enabling them to understand language patterns and semantics broadly. These pre-trained models can then be fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains using smaller task-specific datasets. Fine-tuning allows the model to specialize in a particular task, such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition. This approach saves computational resources and time compared to training a large model from scratch for each task.
Example: ELECTRA (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately)
5. Multilingual models
Multilingual models are trained on text from multiple languages and can process and generate text in several languages. They can be useful for tasks such as cross-lingual information retrieval, machine translation, or multilingual chatbots. By leveraging shared representations across languages, multilingual models can transfer knowledge from one language to another.
Example: XLM (Cross-lingual Language Model) developed by Facebook AI Research
6. Hybrid models
Hybrid models combine the strengths of different architectures to achieve improved performance. For example, some models may incorporate both transformer-based architectures and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs are another type of neural network commonly used for sequential data processing. They can be integrated into LLMs to capture sequential dependencies in addition to the self-attention mechanisms of transformers.
Example: UniLM (Unified Language Model) is a hybrid LLM that integrates both autoregressive and sequence-to-sequence modeling approaches
These are just a few examples of the different types of large language models developed. Researchers and engineers continue to explore new architectures, techniques, and applications to advance the capabilities of these models further and address the challenges of natural language understanding and generation.

How Do LLMs Work?
Large language models (LLMs) work through a step-by-step process that involves training and inference. Here is a detailed explanation of how LLMs function.
Step I: Data collection
The first step in training an LLM is to collect a vast amount of textual data. This can be from books, articles, websites, and other sources of written text. The more diverse and comprehensive the dataset, the better the LLM’s understanding of language and the world is.
Step II: Tokenization
Once the training data is collected, it undergoes a process called tokenization. Tokenization involves breaking down the text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be words, subwords, or characters, depending on the specific model and language. Tokenization allows the model to process and understand text at a granular level.
Step III: Pre-training
The LLM then undergoes pre-training, learning from the tokenized text data. The model learns to predict the next token in a sequence, given the preceding tokens. This unsupervised learning process helps the LLM understand language patterns, grammar, and semantics. Pre-training typically involves a variant of the transformer architecture, which incorporates self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between tokens.
Step IV: Transformer architecture
LLMs are based on the transformer architecture, composed of several layers of self-attention mechanisms. The mechanism computes attention scores for each word in a sentence, considering its interactions with every other word. Thus, by assigning different weights to different words, LLMs can effectively focus on the most relevant information, facilitating accurate and contextually appropriate text generation.
Step V: Fine-tuning
After the pre-training phase, the LLM can be fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains. Fine-tuning involves providing the model with task-specific labeled data, allowing it to learn the intricacies of a particular task. This process helps the LLM specialize in tasks such as sentiment analysis, Q&A, and so on.
Step VI: Inference
Once the LLM is trained and fine-tuned, it can be used for inference. Inference involves utilizing the model to generate text or perform specific language-related tasks. For example, given a prompt or a question, the LLM can generate a coherent response or provide an answer by leveraging its learned knowledge and contextual understanding.
Step VII: Contextual understanding
LLMs excel at capturing context and generating contextually appropriate responses. They use the information provided in the input sequence to generate text that considers the preceding context. The self-attention mechanisms in the transformer architecture play a crucial role in the LLM’s ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information.
Step VIII: Beam search
During the inference phase, LLMs often employ a technique called beam search to generate the most likely sequence of tokens. Beam search is a search algorithm that explores several possible paths in the sequence generation process, keeping track of the most likely candidates based on a scoring mechanism. This approach helps generate more coherent and high-quality text outputs.
Step IX: Response generation
LLMs generate responses by predicting the next token in the sequence based on the input context and the model’s learned knowledge. Generated responses can be diverse, creative, and contextually relevant, mimicking human-like language generation.
Overall, LLMs undergo a multi-step process through which models learn to understand language patterns, capture context, and generate text that resembles human-like language.

Examples of Large Language Models
Several notable examples of large language models that have been developed are available, each with its unique characteristics and applications. Here are a few prominent examples.
1. GPT-4
GPT-4 is an advanced version of its predecessors, GPT-3 and GPT-3.5. It outperforms the previous models regarding creativity, visual comprehension, and context. This LLM allows users to collaborate on projects, including music, technical writing, screenplays, etc. Besides text, GPT-4 can accept images as input. Moreover, according to OpenAI, GPT-4 is a multilingual model that can answer thousands of questions across 26 languages. When it comes to the English language, it shows a staggering 85.5% accuracy, while for Indian languages such as Telugu, it shows 71.4% accuracy.
2. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
BERT, developed by Google, introduced the concept of bidirectional pre-training for LLMs. Unlike previous models that relied on autoregressive training, BERT learns to predict missing words in a sentence by considering both the preceding and following context. This bidirectional approach enables BERT to capture more nuanced language dependencies. BERT has been influential in tasks such as question-answering, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language understanding. It has also been fine-tuned for domain-specific applications in industries such as healthcare and finance.
3. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
T5, developed by Google, is a versatile LLM trained using a text-to-text framework. It can perform a wide range of language tasks by transforming the input and output formats into a text-to-text format. T5 has achieved state-of-the-art results in machine translation, text summarization, text classification, and document generation. Its ability to handle diverse tasks with a unified framework has made it highly flexible and efficient for various language-related applications.
4. XLNet (eXtreme Language Understanding)
XLNet, developed by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Google, addresses some limitations of autoregressive models such as GPT-3. It leverages a permutation-based training approach that allows the model to consider all possible word orders during pre-training. This helps XLNet capture bidirectional dependencies without needing autoregressive generation during inference. XLNet has demonstrated impressive performance in tasks such as sentiment analysis, Q&A, and natural language inference.
5. Turing-NLG
Turing-NLG, developed by Microsoft, is a powerful LLM that focuses on generating conversational responses. It has been trained on a large-scale dataset of dialogues to improve its conversational abilities. Turing-NLG performs well in chatbot applications, providing interactive and contextually appropriate responses in conversational settings.
These examples showcase the capabilities of LLMs in various language-related tasks and their potential to revolutionize NLP applications. Continued research and development in this field will likely bring further advancements and refinements to LLMs in the future.

Takeaway
Over the coming years, we can expect large language models to improve performance, contextual understanding, and domain-specific expertise. They may also exhibit enhanced ethical considerations, multimodal capabilities, improved training efficiency, and enable collaboration/co-creation. These advancements can potentially change the face of various industries and human-computer interactions.

This reflects the widely-held belief that the technology has the potential to be truly transformational for the way we find and use information online.

But it doesn’t stop at search. Baidu has put generative AI to work in a number of other areas designed to improve user experience and generate new business.

It's even used to complete a masterpiece of traditional Chinese ink art, left unfinished when its renowned creator died more than 50 years ago.
Here’s an overview and a look at what we can expect from one of China’s leading technology companies in the near future. I’ll also take a look at why the situation for developers of AI platforms is different in China than it is in the West.

Ernie Bot
Ernie is Baidu's answer to ChatGPT and is the lynchpin of its plans to augment many of its products and services with generative AI. The friendly-sounding name represents Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Interaction.

It differs from ChatGPT in several key ways, however. Firstly, as well as being trained on unstructured text, it also has access to a knowledge graph. This is a structured database of basic information points and, crucially, the semantic links between them. It includes scientific, demographic, geographic and economic data and is similar to the one used by Google to present facts alongside its search results.

Although Baidu doesn’t seem to have stated this explicitly, it’s likely that the idea behind this is that a large, curated database of factual information can help curb the tendency of purely LLM-based models to hallucinate. This is the term used for when AI models appear to simply make things up. AI hallucinations happen because LLMs do not actually know anything; they simply construct probabilistic responses based on the text in their training data, which may or may not be factual.

The second important way that Ernie differs from ChatGPT (or Google’s PaLM, Meta’s Llama or other LLM-based generative AIs) is that it can also create pictures and videos. As such, rather than a large language model, the company refers to its AI technology as an AI Big Model.
Baidu is currently on version 3 of Ernie, with version two having been developed back in 2019. Furthermore, as with OpenAI’s GPT series of LLMs, there are a variety of models.
These include the lightweight model for training smaller applications, the cross-modal model, which is a diffusion model for text-to-image, and a protein-prediction model specifically designed for predicting protein structures.
Ernie has already been put to use in a number of ways that appear to go beyond what is being done with other generative AI-augmented search engines, such as Google and Microsoft’s (ChatGPT-powered) Bing.
So far, these Western counterparts primarily integrate generative AI alongside its existing search algorithms to add question-and-answer functionality. Baidu, on the other hand, is reported to be using generative AI to match user queries to paid-for advertisements and sponsored search results.
The idea here is that advertisers will get better targeting, and users will get more relevant advertising than the more deterministic keyword-based models used by, for example, Google’s Google Ads service.

Unfinished Masterpieces And Specialized Search
Another Baidu generative AI application is based on a different image generation model known as Wenxin Yige. This tool is specifically targeted at creating artwork and, in particular, is designed to generate traditional Chinese-style ink paintings. In demonstrations, it was shown to be able to understand and interpret traditional Chinese poetry as paintings – a task that is said to be difficult even for most humans. It was recently used to complete an unfinished masterpiece by the renowned traditional Chinese painter Lu Xiaoman, who died in 1965.
Another application, Wenxin Baizhong, is a platform aimed at simplifying the task of creating industry-specific generative AI-powered search engines.
Both of these generative applications (as well as Ernie) were built using PaddlePaddle, a Baidu-developed, open-source, distributed deep learning framework said to be the largest of its kind in China.

AI Regulation in China 
China, in recognition of both the power and danger of generative AI, has been quicker than much of the world in regulating its use. Ernie is one of the first Chinese generative AI platforms to be authorized for use, as it has been assessed as being in line with the Government's Interim Measures for Generative Artificial Intelligence Service Management.
These rules state that, among other considerations, any generative models available to the public must “adhere to the core socialist values and not incite subversion of state power"" and must not ""endanger national security,"" ""undermine national unity and social stability,"" or ""promote terrorism, extremism, ethnic hatred, ethnic discrimination, violence, obscenity, as well as false and harmful information.""
In addition, the regulation aims to ensure AIs are not trained on biased data, that they respect intellectual property rights, and that, as far as possible, algorithms should be accurate and transparent.
It also obliges providers of AI services to suspend their services and take immediate action to bring them in line with the law if they are found to be generating illegal content.
This makes the AI development landscape significantly different than it is in the West, where a slowness on the part of regulators has very much led to an anything-goes situation.
The Chinese government clearly recognizes the dangers of this, yet at the same time, has stated that it understands AI has the potential to drive enormous growth.
In the coming years, we’re likely to see how the differences in these two approaches play out – for now, all we can say for certain is that everything is at stake.

Humans work. Very logically, the processes related to people management in the workplace are known as Human Resources (HR), or Human Capital Management (HCM) if you wish to broaden the discipline to the wider organization of systems that employees circulate within. Ask anyone who’s been in a job that makes them unhappy inside an organization of any reasonable size and they’ll often tell you that the HR function is a human-centered portal of compassion and understanding. Generally, HR managers are really nice people and we like them.


But, like all things, people management needs to evolve. The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (gen-AI) that draws predictive inference and knowledge from so-called Large Language Models (LLMs) composed of open data pools is impacting every aspect of business life from cake baking to the petrochemicals business (for want of two diametrically opposed disciplines) and HR has not been left out.

Finance & Human Resources
Specializing in a platform designed to serve both HR & finance, Workday has now brought forward multiple new generative AI capabilities designed to help increase productivity, grow and retain talent, streamline business processes and drive better decision-making. But do we really want computers taking over the ‘my manager doesn’t understand me’ role and automating-out the empathy factor that we value so much in HR?

PROMOTED
Justifiably, Workday doesn’t see it that way. The company is founded on an information technology platform strategy that draws upon what it calls an ‘unrivalled dataset’ (i.e. a pool of workplace datasets, data-flows, data shapes and plain old databases that enable it to straddle and manage work-related IT functions for just about every imaginable task, process, occurrence or happening) and a commitment to delivering trustworthy solutions that demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming.

The application of gen-AI (as we have seen in every enterprise technology vendor worth its salt this year) is a natural enough progression for Workday, so in reality, there is little automated HR fearmongering to deal with here. In fact, AI and ML are already embedded in the core of the Workday platform, the company’s AI models are powered by more than 625 billion transactions processed every year – creating what is claimed to the the ‘world's largest and cleanest’ set of financial and HR data – which allows the models to consistently generate accurate, meaningful, trustworthy results.

""Generative AI has the potential to completely transform work as we know it,"" said Sayan Chakraborty, co-president, Workday. ""When applied responsibly, it has the power to elevate performance and to free up time to focus on the valuable work we really want and need to be doing. At Workday, we build solutions for business challenges where we can deliver clear and transformative benefits. We build enterprise-grade capabilities that are trustworthy, transparent, safe and that keep the user in the driver's seat at all times. Workday, our customers, and their employees are writing the playbook for how the future works together.""

Chakraborty used five very important words there: responsibly, trustworthy, transparent, safe and driver's seat. This is not gen-AI designed to digitally track employee behavior and root out people working at -1% of their potential productivity levels as they become candidates for redundancy. This is gen-AI designed to help create job descriptions (Workday users create 30 million job descriptions per year, which take on average two hours to create), this is gen-AI designed to analyze and correct employee work contracts, this is gen-AI designed to support the core (and often quite complex) administrative sub-layer that drives an HR function and its related financials.

Automated tasks
The argument here is simple enough, if drafting job descriptions and contracts takes hours of work and this is a process that we can automate down to seconds, then human HR managers can spend more ‘people time’ looking for and interacting with quality candidates. It’s called HR for a reason i.e. humans are a resource and we can digitize the resource management aspect of their existence, but only if we define the human interactivity level via which we actually speak to people.
By using information already stored in Workday as the single source of truth for people data – such as the skills needed for the role and job location details – users can create precisely targeted job descriptions to help find the best candidates.
According to Chakraborty and team, “Sales teams negotiate and win contracts - and finance teams then have to ensure the company is paid via accurate billing and revenue recognition. But contracts can be lengthy and information embedded within them can easily be missed. With Workday's contract analysis generative AI capability, customers will be able to compare signed contracts against contracts in Workday Financial Management and integrated CRM data in record time. The feature will alert the user to any discrepancies early in the process and propose corrections, then confirm when discrepancies are fixed.”
This early analysis and correction capability helps eliminate downstream accounting errors, saving considerable time trying to reverse and correct downstream transactions.
Digitizing tasks
Thinking about the application of gen-AI in the workplace and exactly which software services can be accelerated for what Workday has called human ‘amplification’, we can see that creating content to keep employees informed about company policies and updates can be time-consuming, often requiring the author to search, read and synthesize multiple sources to draft an article for employees' understanding.
The company promises new generative AI capabilities that will enable content creators to draft articles that are highly personalized and tailored to their audience – such as talking points for managers about a new company bonus policy, or key takeaways from company videos. These new capabilities can help the author improve the tone or length of the article, iterate on particular sections, or even translate the article to different languages to support a global workforce, saving users time.
Human digital HR?
Just how human can digital HR be? Workday insists that gen-AI will be able to provide recommendations on the ‘tone of correspondence’ when it is used by finance teams to draft past-due payment notices. Whether that ends up being more than word recognition and sentiment tracking in its initial deployment is unclear (words that express anger and aggression are not that hard to fathom), but when used to automated bulk mailing exercise (as is the suggestion here), Workday says its technology will be ‘based on configured rules’, so again, the parameters will be set by human beings.
Developer Copilot is a new human-machine teaming capability for Workday Extend app development, that will use gen-AI to support the the creation of finance and people management apps. Natively embedded into Workday's App Builder, Developer Copilot will provide text-to-code generation capabilities to improve developer productivity by turning natural language into software application development code. Developer Copilot will be contextually aware, providing curated content and search results that meet developers where they are, upskilling them and elevating the development experience.
""We recognize that generative AI is a powerful technology with the potential to have great impact on conversational experiences, and you will see us apply it in ways that generative AI is uniquely suited for,"" said Jeff Gelfuso, chief design officer, Workday. ""We are incredibly excited about the possibilities at the intersection of conversational UI and generative AI, and you can expect Workday to deliver capabilities in the future that will unlock endless possibilities for reimagining how to interact with our products.""
AI transparency
Gelfuso and team remind us that talent retention is a top priority for organizations everywhere and managers are responsible for their direct reports' growth and development. This capability is said to enable managers to create a summary of employees' strengths and areas of growth, pulling from Workday's database of insight such as performance reviews, employee feedback, contribution goals, skills etc.
Workday says its technology is well suited to support this use case as an organization's single source of truth for people data and, since Workday is transparent about how its AI models are designed, managers can easily understand how the data inputs contribute to a strength or area of growth. This capability will make the career check-in process more personalized and effective, empowering both managers and employees.
This whole process of employee amplification might sound a little sterile to those of us whose first interaction with an HR manager was probably back in the 1980s (or even before that time), but for digital natives, this kind of functionality will be standard, accepted and - if anything - probably very welcome. Those that baulk at the prospect of digital employee services should probably be thinking about moving to Florida and slowing down. Workday appears to have thought about empathy from the start of its efforts to bring gen-AI forwards into its platform, so your future HR function may well have a more digitally-empowered infrastructure now.
What was that - you want two weeks off next July? Let’s just check the system first.

As the boundaries between human and machine learning blur, the ivory towers of academia are resounding with the whispers of generative AI ̶ intelligent algorithms that offer a guiding light through the labyrinths of research.

“Now is the most exciting time to be a researcher,” said Shwetak Patel, director of Google’s health technologies and an endowed professor of computing and electrical engineering at the University of Washington, as quoted in Inside Higher Ed. This is not just hyperbole. With an armory of AI tools at our disposal, research across disciplines has accelerated, leading to, for example, new drug discoveries, new medical treatment options and more accurate medical diagnoses. Following is a look at the vast array of generative AI tools that are reshaping the way research is conducted.

Background Research: Curating Scholarly Universe
When embarking on a research project, the first daunting step involves assimilating and integrating a universe of existing literature into a coherent framework. Instead of spending weeks scouring through academic journals, AI can find relevant studies in a fraction of the time. Platforms like Elicit, Consensus and Inciteful serve as scholarly concierges, curating a customized repository to assist with literature review, thereby allowing scientists to focus on analysis rather than the endless background data collection.

PROMOTED
Article Summaries: The Essence
Instead of drowning in a sea of jargon, researchers can use AI to serve as an interpreter. Tools such as TLDRthis and AskYourPDF offer succinct, coherent summaries of lengthy articles, making them more digestible. These tools not only save time but also provide clarity, offering snapshots that encapsulate the core of each paper and enable scholars to interact with the articles.

Finding Research Gaps: The Detective’s Lens
AI-powered engines like Powerdrill simplify the arduous task of finding gaps in existing literature by helping to highlight overlooked or underexplored study areas. Litmaps allows researchers to visualize the relationships between different papers in literature review and helps find derivative work of others. Scholars can use these tools to strategically position their work and fill critical research gaps.

Data Analysis And Visualization: The Revelation
Data is the lifeblood of research, but interpreting it is a skill unto itself. Tools like Julius and GPT-4’s Advanced Data Analysis can autonomously analyze and visualize complex datasets, revealing hidden patterns that can guide further research.
Feedback On Drafts: The Peer Review
Generative AI is not just a tool; it's a collaborator. For a more 'human' touch in machine-assisted research, AI-driven peer review platforms like HeyScience offer constructive feedback, ensuring a scholar’s work resonates with academic communities.
Spelling and Grammar: The Wordsmith’s Companion
Even the most erudite scholars are not immune to typographical errors, and the credibility of academic research is often undermined by minor errors in spelling and grammar. AI-based editors like Grammarly and ChatGPT can polish manuscripts using real-time corrections.
References: The Finishing Touch
No research paper is complete without a meticulously formatted reference list. While scholars often use tools such as Zotero to capture citations, now ChatGPT and other conversational chatbots can flawlessly format references in APA or any other style. This not only ensures compliance with academic norms but also adds a polished finishing touch to a research manuscript.
As we usher in this new epoch of AI-augmented research, mastering the art of generative AI is not just an advantage; it's an imperative. It's about understanding AI’s limitations and strengths and using the tools to augment one's capabilities, which will transform today’s AI whispers into the academic roars of tomorrow.

Platform Approach, Unrivaled Dataset, and Commitment to Trust Set Company Apart as a Leader in Generative AI for the Enterprise
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ: WDAY), a leader in enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources, today announced multiple new generative AI capabilities that will help increase productivity, grow and retain talent, streamline business processes, and drive better decision-making. The new capabilities are being showcased at Workday Rising, the company's annual customer conference, and span the Workday platform to benefit all users – from finance and HR teams to people managers and individual users across an organization.
Workday's generative AI approach is set apart by the company's platform strategy, unrivaled dataset, and commitment to delivering trustworthy solutions that demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming. AI and ML are embedded in the core of the Workday platform, enabling the company to rapidly deliver cutting-edge solutions to customers across all applications. Workday AI models are fueled by more than 625 billion transactions processed by the system every year – resulting in the world's largest, cleanest set of financial and HR data – which allows the models to consistently generate accurate, meaningful, trustworthy results.
""Generative AI has the potential to completely transform work as we know it,"" said Sayan Chakraborty, co-president, Workday. ""When applied responsibly, it has the power to elevate performance and to free up time to focus on the valuable work we really want and need to be doing. At Workday, we build solutions for business challenges where we can deliver clear and transformative benefits. We build enterprise-grade capabilities that are trustworthy, transparent, safe, and that keep the user in the driver's seat at all times. Workday, our customers, and their employees are writing the playbook for how the future works together.""
Some of the ways businesses will benefit from new Workday generative AI capabilities include:
Generating Job Descriptions in Minutes Versus Hours
Workday users create 30 million job descriptions per year – taking an average of one to two hours every time. This capability will enable hiring managers and recruiters to generate job descriptions in minutes versus hours, freeing up considerable time to search for quality candidates rather than on administrative tasks. By leveraging information already stored in Workday as the single source of truth for people data – such as the skills needed for the role and job location details – users can create precisely targeted job descriptions to help find the best candidates.
Analyzing and Correcting Contracts for Faster, More Accurate Revenue Recognition
Sales teams negotiate and win contracts, and finance teams then have to ensure the company is paid via accurate billing and revenue recognition. But contracts can be lengthy, and information embedded within them can easily be missed. With Workday's contract analysis generative AI capability, customers will be able to compare signed contracts against contracts in Workday Financial Management and integrated CRM data in record time. The feature will alert the user to any discrepancies early in the process and propose corrections, then confirm when discrepancies are fixed. This early analysis and correction capability helps eliminate downstream accounting errors, saving considerable time trying to reverse and correct downstream transactions.
Creating Personalized Knowledge Management Articles With Ease
Creating content to keep employees informed about company policies and updates can be time consuming and frustrating, often requiring the author to search, read, and synthesize multiple sources to draft an article for employees' understanding. What took hours will take minutes, with just a few clicks in Workday Help. New generative AI capabilities will enable content creators to draft articles that are highly personalized and tailored to their audience – such as talking points for managers about a new company bonus policy, or key takeaways from company videos. These new capabilities can help the author improve the tone or length of the article, iterate on particular sections, or even translate the article to different languages to support a global workforce, saving users valuable time and the frustration of writer's block.
Streamlining Collections to Recapture Missing Funds Sooner
New generative AI capabilities from Workday will enable finance teams to automate the process of crafting past due notices with recommendations on the tone of the correspondence, driven by how late the customer is, or how often they are late, to save valuable time. Finance teams will also be able to use Workday generative AI to automate letters in bulk – based on configured rules – to easily send an entire package, including past invoices, enabling collections agents to greatly increase their throughput and recapture missing funds sooner.
Turning Text-to-Code for Faster Workday Extend App Development
Every business has unique needs and challenges. Workday Extend puts the same technology, security, logic, and application components that power Workday into customers' own hands to build custom apps that live in and run on Workday. Developer Copilot, a human-machine teaming capability for Workday Extend app development, will leverage the power of generative AI to support the entire development lifecycle for rapid creation of finance and people management apps. Natively embedded into Workday's App Builder, Developer Copilot will provide text-to-code generation capabilities to dramatically improve developer productivity and customer time-to-value by turning natural language into app code. Developer Copilot will be contextually aware, providing curated content and search results that meet developers where they are, upskilling them and elevating the development experience.
Creating Employee Growth Plans to Foster and Retain Talent
Talent retention is a top priority for organizations everywhere, and managers are responsible for their direct reports' growth and development. This capability will enable managers to quickly create a summary of employees' strengths and areas of growth, pulling from Workday's rich database of insight such as performance reviews, employee feedback, contribution goals, skills, and more. Workday is uniquely suited to support this use case as an organization's single source of truth for people data and, since Workday is transparent about how its AI models are designed, managers can easily understand how the data inputs contribute to a strength or area of growth. This capability will make the career check-in process more personalized and effective, empowering both managers and employees.
Generating Statements of Work for Faster Service Procurement
Procuring services can be a time-consuming activity for many corporations, typically with many teams involved – line of business, legal, procurement, and more. Gaining efficiencies in statement of work (SOW) clause creation and refinement is critical for organizations that want to move quickly and execute their priorities and business strategy flawlessly. Workday generative AI will help organizations automate this process, reducing the time and effort it requires, while also suggesting the relevant clauses to be included depending on the type of project, project location, type of deliverables, and more.
Transforming the Workday User Experience With Conversational AI
Workday also previewed capabilities it is exploring at the intersection of conversational UI and generative AI to enhance users' ability to interact with information and tasks in a natural way, taking advantage of the unique capabilities generative AI offers such as summarization, search, maintaining context, and more.
""We recognize that generative AI is a powerful technology with the potential to have great impact on conversational experiences, and you will see us apply it in ways that generative AI is uniquely suited for,"" said Jeff Gelfuso, chief design officer, Workday. ""We are incredibly excited about the possibilities at the intersection of conversational UI and generative AI, and you can expect Workday to deliver capabilities in the future that will unlock endless possibilities for reimagining how to interact with our products.""
Availability
New generative AI features to support use cases including job descriptions, contract analysis, knowledge management, collections letters, app development, employee growth plans, and statements of work are expected to begin rolling out to customers within the next 6 to 12 months, joining Workday's growing roster of more than 40 AI and ML features already in product today.
As with all Workday AI and ML features, the generative AI capabilities announced today are being designed to optimize human-machine teaming, utilizing AI to generate content quickly, while empowering the user to apply their skills, judgment, and experience to personalize and validate that content. Workday is committed to transparency through explainability, helping users leverage AI with trust and confidence.

SAP has introduced a natural-language, generative AI copilot called “Joule”, which will be embedded across SAP’s cloud enterprise portfolio.Joule will provide contextualised insights across all SAP solutions and third-party sources.It helps to expedite working tasks, improve business outcomes, and “transform” business operations, while also being secure and compliant.Christian Klein, CEO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, commented on its new AI copilot: “With almost 300 million enterprise users around the world working regularly with cloud solutions from SAP, Joule has the power to redefine the way businesses – and the people who power them – work.“Joule draws on SAP’s unique position at the nexus of business and technology and builds on our relevant, reliable, responsible approach to Business AI. Joule will know what you mean, not just what you say.”Joule will be integrated into SAP applications from businesses across multiple industries, including finance, supply chain, procurement, and customer experience, as well as its SAP Business Technology Platform.By simply asking questions in natural language, employees can receive intelligent answers, which retain their context, based on business data from SAP’s portfolio and third-party sources.If a manufacturer wants to find out more about its sales performance, Joule will be able to identify low-performing areas, link to data sets that elucidate supply chain issues, and connect to the supply chain system to suggest possible fixes for the manufacturer to review.It will continuously offer new scenarios for all SAP solutions. In HR, for example, it will create unbiased job descriptions and relevant interview questions.Availability & Events



Joule will be available, along with SAP SucessFactors solutions and the SAP Start site, later this year. The public edition of SAP S/4HANA Cloud will be available in early 2024, with SAP Customer Experience, SAP Ariba, and SAP Business Technology Platform following soon after.SAP has also said it will announce many more updates across its portfolio at SuccessConnect, which takes place on October 2 – 4, SAP Spend Connect Live on October 9 – 11, SAP Customer Experience LIVE on October 25, and SAP Tech Ed on November 2 – 3.Phil Carter, Group Vice President, Worldwide Thought Leadership Research, IDC, gave his assessment: “As generative AI moves on from the initial hype, the work to ensure a measurable return on investment begins.“SAP understands that generative AI will eventually become part of the fabric of everyday life and work and is taking the time to build a business copilot that focuses on generating responses based on real-world scenarios – and to put in place the necessary guardrails to ensure it’s also responsible.”Joule adds to SAP’s current AI offering, which 26,000 SAP cloud customers have access to.SAP’s strategy of building an enterprise AI ecosystem includes investments of $1 billion into Aleph Alpha, Anthropic, and Cohere, via the company’s investment arm, Sapphire Ventures LLC.SAP has formed third-party partnerships with Google Cloud and IBM.

SAP unveils new generative AI assistant Joule

SAP

SAP has announced its new generative AI assistant, Joule, operating as a natural-language, AI copilot that will transform the way businesses run. Embedded throughout SAP’s cloud enterprise portfolio, Joule will deliver proactive and contextualized insights from across SAP solutions and third-party sources to “know what you mean, not just what you say”.
Joule will be available with SAP SuccessFactors solutions and SAP Start later this year, and with SAP S/4HANA Cloud public edition early next year, with the ability to quickly sort through and contextualize data from multiple systems to garner smarter insights. In a secure and compliant manner, the new AI companion is aimed at helping workers get work done faster and businesses drive better business outcomes.
Joule will be embedded into SAP Business Technology Platform as well as SAP applications from HR to finance, supply chain, procurement and customer experience. In an effort to transform the SAP user experience, SAP describes Joule as working like “tapping your smartest colleague on the shoulder”.
Christian Klein, CEO and member of the executive board of SAP SE, said: “With almost 300 million enterprise users around the world working regularly with SAP cloud solutions, Joule has the power to redefine the way businesses – and the people who power them – work.
“Joule draws on SAP’s unique position at the nexus of business and technology and builds on our relevant, reliable, responsible approach to Business AI. Joule will know what you mean, not just what you say.”
Discussing the security of the new AI addition, Julia White, executive board member and chief marketing and solutions officer of SAP, said during the launch call:
“Our business AI is delivered with responsibility. We have the highest levels of concern for security, privacy, compliance and ethics. Protecting customer data is of our utmost importance and for GenAI, we ensure that no large language model will use our customers’ data to learn or improve on their foundational models.”
Drawing from the wealth of business data across the SAP portfolio and third-party sources, employees will need only ask a question or frame a problem in plain language to receive intelligent answers.
SAP has provided an example of how Joule will operate; imagine a manufacturer asking Joule for help to better understand sales performances, Joule will identify underperforming regions, link to other data sets that reveal a supply chain issue and automatically connect to the supply chain system to offer potential fixes for the manufacturer’s review.
Joule will continuously deliver new scenarios for all SAP solutions, even allowing HR to help write unbiased job descriptions and generate relevant interview questions.
White also explained that SAP has already applied AI in finance with a key customer Accenture, whose accounts receivable department is using AI to automatically match incoming payments to their corresponding invoices and client accounts.
“And through the use of our AI they’ve almost doubled their invoice payment to invoice match rate going from 30 percent to 54 percent and significantly reducing that peak time processing for those critical month-end, quarter-end and year-end closing moments,” she added.
In addition, Deloitte has announced that it using GenAI to extend the value of SAP applications by building on top of SAP Business Technology Platform.
SAP’s new generative AI assistant builds on existing SAP Business AI offerings. With over 26,000 SAP cloud customers with access to SAP Business AI, SAP’s AI strategy relies on direct investments. SAP backed, Sapphire Ventures LLC, dedicated over $1bn to fund AI-powered enterprise technology and investments from Aleph Alpha, Anthropic and Cohere, as well as third-party partnerships with Microsoft, Google Cloud and IBM, have propelled forward SAP’s ambitions for an ‘enterprise AI ecosystem of the future.
Phil Carter, group vice president, worldwide thought leadership research, IDC, said: “As generative AI moves on from the initial hype, the work to ensure measurable return on investment begins.
“SAP understands that generative AI will eventually become part of the fabric of everyday life and work, and is taking the time to build a business copilot that focuses on generating responses based on real-world scenarios – and to put in place the necessary guardrails to ensure it’s also responsible.”

By: Sunil Joshi on September 27, 2023 There is a growing belief in the developer community that future software development will be performed by machines rather than humans by 2040. Software development will undergo a radical change with the combination of machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing and code generation that draws from large language models (LLMs). Most organizations believe that there will be a 30-40% improvement in overall developer productivity with AI. While these arguments have some merit, I do not believe developers will be fully replaced. Instead, I believe generative AI can augment developers to support faster development and higher-quality code.I’ll address the impact of generative AI on the development community under three pillars:Automation and productivityQuality engineering and complianceWays of workingAutomation and ProductivityThere will be a focus on increased automation all the way from business planning to operations of applications.LLMs can help provide better alignment of user stories to business requirements. In fact, one of the best use cases for generative AI during planning phases is to auto-generate user stories from business requirements documents.Since ambiguity of requirements or guesswork is taken out of the equation, one can expect a clearer “definition of done” through the auto-creation of acceptance criteria.In a typical development cycle, 15%-20% of coding defects are attributed to improperly defined requirements. Generative AI augmentation can result in significant reduction of those defects.Generative AI augmentation can help developers with better planning and estimation of work. Rather than relying on personal experience or home-grown estimation models, LLMs can better predict the complexity of work and developers and continually learn and adapt through multiple development sprints.AI-augmented code creation can allow developers to focus on solving complex business problems and creative thinking rather than worrying about repetitive code generation. Over the last decade or so, the perception of software development as a creative pursuit has been a dying phenomenon. With AI, I think that more and more younger developers will be attracted to the field. AI will put the “fun” back in coding.AI-assisted DevOps and continuous integration will further accelerate deployments of code so developers can focus more on solving complex business problems. Deployment failures due to human errors can be drastically reduced.Elaborating on the above, newer and less experienced developers can also generate higher-quality code with AI-augmentation, leading to better overall consistency of code in large programs.Overall, from a development standpoint, I think AI augmentation will free up 30% of developers’ time to work on enhancing user experience and other value-added tasks.Quality Engineering and ComplianceIn a hybrid cloud world, solutions will become more distributed than ever, making system architecture more complex.LLMs can assist in regulating design documents and architecture work products to conform to industry/corporate standards and guidelines. In essence, LLMs can act as virtual Architecture Review Boards. In a typical development life cycle, architecture/design reviews and approvals make up 5%-8% of work and augmenting the process with generative AI capabilities can cut that time in half.Ssecurity compliance for cloud-based solutions is imperative. LLMs can assist in ensuring such compliance very early on in the development life cycle, leading to more predictable deployments and timely program delivery.Generative AI-augmented test case creation can optimize the number of test cases needed to support the development while increasing the overall code coverage for quality.For greenfield development, there can be a 20%-40% increase in overall code quality through automatic bug-fixing embedded within a DevOps pipeline. Developers can focus on bug avoidance rather than bug fixes.AI-augmented test data generation can increase testing cycles by 25%. Proper test data availability has been a big pain point for quality engineers for decades.Ways of WorkingDevelopers will have to shift their focus to understand how to use the right AI models and prompts to generate documents, code, test cases etc. rapidly. This is a change from writing everything from scratch. Picking the right model for the right use case is very important from an overall efficacy standpoint while also remaining cognizant of the trustworthiness, security and data lineage of the models. This is why I don’t think developers can simply be fully replaced (at least not in the near future).Generative AI is not magic. It does what it is trained to do based on the examples it is provided and how well it is prompted. Developers will need to quickly learn and adapt to this new paradigm.This requires different sets of skills and training for developers. It is also incumbent on management to ensure developer enablement happens so they can succeed in this new world. Simply having an AI technology strategy without a developer enablement strategy means a failed overall strategy. The outcomes will not be fruitful.AI-enabled development is here to stay, despite the nervousness in the developer community. Of course, there are some good reasons to be nervous. Generative AI, unlike many other revolutionary technologies that have emerged in the recent past, doesn’t just enable work but creates “things.” And there is a school of thought that believes this creation will displace developers. It won’t. Generative AI-augmented development will provide developers with a pathway to higher creative thinking, which really is one of the fundamental aspects of software development.



My message to the development community: Don’t fear generative AI; embrace, learn about and from and enjoy creating with generative AI.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of today's workforce, employee burnout has emerged as a pressing concern. The relentless pace, excessive demands, and constant connectivity have taken a toll on the well-being of employees.


However, the synergy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and forward-thinking Future of Work policies offers a promising path to mitigate burnout, improve employee engagement and enhance productivity.

The Growing Burnout Crisis
Burnout is an occupational phenomenon. It is driven by a chronic imbalance between job demands (for example: workload pressure, understaffing, and poor working environment) and job resources (for example: job autonomy, and supportive work relationships).

PROMOTED
According to the World Health Organization, burnout is a syndrome associated with chronic stress in the workplace that has not been successfully managed. It is characterized by:



Feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion
Increased mental distance from one’s job, feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job
Reduced professional efficacy

Toxic workplace behavior is the biggest driver of negative workplace outcomes, such as burnout and intent to leave. And burnout is not simply inconvenient, poor well-being affects the bottom line through lower productivity, higher turnover, higher absenteeism, and higher medical costs (due to preventable conditions).

Employee burnout costs organizations 15%-20% of total payroll in voluntary turnover costs alone, on average, due to burnout.
Leveraging AI For Employee Wellness
Artificial Intelligence holds immense potential to address employee burnout head-on. Here are ways AI can make a difference:
Personalized Workloads
AI algorithms can analyze individual work patterns and preferences, allowing organizations to optimize workloads. This prevents overburdening and ensures that each employee's skills are utilized to the fullest, resulting in increased job satisfaction.
Predictive Analytics
AI can process vast amounts of data to predict when an employee might be approaching burnout. Early detection enables organizations to intervene proactively, offering essential support and accommodations.
Automation of Repetitive Tasks
Many employees suffer burnout due to repetitive and mundane tasks. AI-driven automation can take over these tasks, freeing employees to focus on more creative and challenging aspects of their work.
Mental Health Support
AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide immediate mental health support and resources to employees, helping them manage stress and anxiety effectively.
Work-Life Balance
AI can assist in scheduling and workload management, ensuring that employees have ample time for their personal lives. This decreases the risk of burnout associated with excessive work hours.
Recent Examples At Google, Zoom, Elsewhere
There may be no need to attend those irksome meetings any longer. Google recently announced a new feature for its Google Meet video service that lets users send an AI bot to attend a meeting on their behalf. After the meeting, the user will receive AI-generated meeting notes and action items. Naturally, it cannot speak for you or share other real-time information from you.
AI summaries may help get your job done more broadly, as Zoom and Otter.ai join Google and others leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in attempts to help workers keep better track of what happens in meetings, whether they attend or not. AI could also help by scheduling follow-up meetings, drafting emails, and otherwise reducing the stress of meeting burdens on employees.
Employers can and should view high rates of burnout as a powerful warning sign that the organization—not the individuals in the workforce—needs to undergo meaningful systematic change, according to McKinsey.
Adding that efforts to rally the organization to rethink work—in ways that are compatible with both employee and employer goals—are likely to pay off in the long term. To help advance that conversation, they offer these targeted questions:


Do we treat employee mental health and well-being as a strategic priority?
Do we effectively address toxic behaviors?
Do we create inclusive work environments?
Do we enable individual growth?
Do we promote sustainable work?
Are we holding leaders accountable?
Are we effectively tackling stigma?
Do our resources serve employee needs?


The Future Of Work Policies And Practices
Addressing these questions and more has never been more urgent. In conjunction with AI, workplace policies and practices also play a pivotal role in reducing employee burnout.
Start at the Top
The most immediate way to ameliorate employee burnout at your organization is for managers and employees to discuss the factors of burnout that are most relevant to the employee.
Embrace Flexibility and Hybrid Work
Offering flexible work arrangements, including hybrid work options, allows employees to better manage their work-life balance. It lessens commute-related stress and offers greater control over their schedules.
Promote Time Off
Encourage employees to take their vacation days and emphasize the importance of unplugging during downtime. A well-rested employee is less susceptible to burnout.
Prioritize Training and Development
Investing in continuous training and development opportunities not only empowers employees to grow but also demonstrates that the organization values their personal and professional development.
Foster Transparent Communications
Maintain open and transparent communication channels between leadership and employees. When employees feel heard and understood, it can significantly diminish feelings of burnout.
Recognition and Rewards
Acknowledge and reward employees for their hard work and accomplishments. Regular recognition boosts morale and motivation, thereby reducing the risk of burnout.
Ensure Accountability, Monitoring, and Updates 
Measure the impact of your AI and future of work initiatives on employee burnout. This will help you to track your progress and make necessary adjustments.
Leverage Technology with Purpose 
Invest in training for employees on how to effectively embrace and utilize AI tools and resources. This will help them to be more productive and efficient in their work.
The Time Is Now
Reducing employee burnout through the strategic use of AI and forward-thinking Future of Work policies is not just feasible; it is imperative for modern organizations aiming to thrive. By embracing AI technology and implementing engagement-centric policies, companies can improve the employee experience as well as company outcomes and foster healthier, more productive, and ultimately more successful workplaces.

Will Generative A.I. Allow You to Work More Than One Job?

The rise of generative A.I. has many tech professionals worried about keeping their jobs. But what if A.I. frees up tech pros to run lucrative side gigs… or even work two full-time jobs simultaneously?

A new study by Morgan Stanley (hat tip to Business Insider for the breakdown) suggests there’s a rise in the number of people working multiple jobs. “The advent of cheap or free and rapidly democratized access to generative A.I. tools,” that paper added, could generate as much as $83 billion of the $400 billion in income expected from multiple jobs by 2030. More optimistic predictions place the income from multiple jobs at $1.4 trillion by the decade’s end, with A.I. responsible for a sizable $300 billion slice.

Morgan Stanley cited programming, content creation, and graphic and web design among the jobs potentially impacted by this trend, along with non-tech jobs such as tutoring, affiliate marketing, and e-commerce dropshipping.

Generative A.I tools such as ChatGPT and Meta’s Llama 2 will write and debug code. That could free up engineers and developers to focus their time and energy on the more creative aspects of their jobs, such as ideating new features. As these tools become more sophisticated, of course, the time savings could allow tech professionals to radically adjust their workflows—and perhaps focus more on their side gigs, personal projects, or even a second job. 

Whatever your role in tech, it’s also important to understand how A.I. and machine learning actually work and how they might evolve. According to a recent report from consulting firm McKinsey, Technology Trends Outlook 2023, anyone interested in A.I. should familiarize themselves with the following:

Machine learning
Computer vision
Natural-language processing
Deep reinforcement learning

These technologies will power increasingly powerful tools such as low- and no-code platforms, infrastructure-as-code, and advanced microservices. What will you do with the time these new tools will free up?

Image: GoogleThe arrival of generative artificial intelligence has accelerated the use of AI in different fields, including journalism. AI is most visible in journalism when things go wrong. Some newsrooms have published AI articles riddled with errors or offensive suggestions. There’s widespread anxiety that AI will be used to replace journalists on the cheap. But a new global survey demonstrates the ways that AI has worked its way into the business, even as journalists worry about its implications — and they don’t just involve writing articles. The report was published this week by JournalismAI, an initiative from Polis, the London School of Economics and Political Science’s journalism think tank. It is supported by the Google News Initiative.“Generating Change: A global survey of what news organisations are doing with artificial intelligence” includes the perspective of “more than 120 editors, journalists, technologies and mediamakers from 105 small and large newsrooms across 46 countries.” JournalismAI doesn’t claim that the survey is representative of the whole global industry, but it does give a hint of how the media market is using these new technologies. More than 75 percent of respondents used AI tools somewhere in the news processAmong the respondents, more than 75 percent used AI somewhere in the chain of news gathering, production, and distribution. More than half mentioned increased efficiency and enhanced productivity as a reason to use it — ideally, AI can automate monotonous and repetitive tasks. Around a third of respondents said they hoped AI technologies would help them reach a wider audience, personalize reader experiences, and enhance audience engagement. At the same time, more than 60 percent of respondents were concerned about the ethical implications of AI integration in terms of editorial quality and other aspects of journalism such as accuracy, fairness, and transparency. Generally, newsrooms continue to view human intervention as crucial to mitigating the potential harms of AI systems, like bias and inaccuracy. Even as respondents worried that AI technologies could exacerbate biased news coverage and the misrepresentation of marginalized groups, few organizations provided solid examples of any potential solutions.The report says AI has particular pitfalls for newsrooms in the Global South. Most AI tools are developed with a focus on English (with very specific accents). Funds and resources are usually concentrated on a few countries, and different political realities might affect people’s trust in AI. Nevertheless, the survey revealed that 90 percent of newsrooms are already using some form of AI in news production, 80 percent in news distribution, and 75 percent in news gathering. News gathering tasks include automated transcription and translation, extracting text from images, and scraping the web or using automated summarization tools. News production could include translating articles into other languages, proofreading, writing headlines, or writing full articles. Distribution includes using AI-driven search engine optimization as well as things like tailoring content to a specific audience.There are some huge differences in scale here — spell-checking an article with AI and using AI to generate a new article completely, for instance, hand over a very different level of control to AI tools. The report does not specify how many newsrooms are using this technology for each specific task, but it does mention that news distribution has the widest range of use cases, being most frequently mentioned as the area most impacted by AI in the newsroom.  Even though the majority of respondents are concerned about the implications of adopting AI tools, only around one-third of them said their organization had an AI strategy or were currently developing one.Tech companies like Google are building AI tools into their core businesses, even as they raise new ethical and legal concerns. Several newsrooms have blocked GPTBot, the web-crawling tool from Google competitor OpenAI, from using their data, and authors have sued OpenAI and Meta over using their work to train AI. However, news agencies have also struck deals with AI companies — like The Associated Press, which signed an agreement with OpenAI earlier this year. Comments1 Comment / 1 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeSamsung’s new folds, flips, and Apple clones | The Vergecast

Sign up for it here.The quickest way to second-guess a decision to major in English is this: have an extended family full of Salvadoran immigrants and pragmatic midwesterners. The ability to recite Chaucer in the original Middle English was unlikely to land me a job that would pay off my student loans and help me save for retirement, they suggested when I was a college freshman still figuring out my future. I stuck with English, but when my B.A. eventually spat me out into the thick of the Great Recession, I worried that they’d been right.After all, computer-science degrees, and certainly not English, have long been sold to college students as among the safest paths toward 21st-century job security. Coding jobs are plentiful across industries, and the pay is good—even after the tech layoffs of the past year. The average starting salary for someone with a computer-science degree is significantly higher than that of a mid-career English graduate, according to the Federal Reserve; at Google, an entry-level software engineer reportedly makes $184,000, and that doesn’t include the free meals, massages, and other perks. Perhaps nothing has defined higher education over the past two decades more than the rise of computer science and STEM. Since 2016, enrollment in undergraduate computer-science programs has increased nearly 49 percent. Meanwhile, humanities enrollments across the United States have withered at a clip—in some cases, shrinking entire departments to nonexistence.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

But everyone from autoworkers to white-collar middle managers should be paying very close attention to how this deal was achieved — because it sets a monumental precedent for labor relations in a digital future.Unlike bread-and-butter issues like wages, benefits and the terms and conditions of employment — topics over which management, according to labor law, must negotiate “in good faith” — technology, like business strategy, constitutes managerial prerogative. This means that the use of technology, such as artificial intelligence, exists in a bargaining gray area. If workers bring it up, employers can either open a negotiation or reply with a simple “No, thanks.” But the W.G.A. deal put A.I. squarely on the table.In the past, management would often make nearly all technology-related decisions before negotiations even began. Workers and their unions were excluded from early conversations about technology — including ones that could open up a range of issues around use and deployment that would benefit both workers and employers. The only mandated negotiations were around the technologies’ impact on terms and conditions such as wages. This dynamic may help explain why, at the beginning of the W.G.A. negotiations, many believed, or at least publicly stated, that securing any constraints at all on the use of A.I. was a pipe dream.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Read 188 CommentsShare full article188Read in appAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTComments 188Hollywood’s Deal With Screenwriters Just Rewrote the Rules Around A.I.Skip to CommentsThe comments section is closed.

	A clearer picture of how studios intend to incorporate artificial intelligence into the screenplay production apparatus is coming into view.

	More than 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America were given the greenlight on Wednesday to return to work after a vote to accept a tentative deal from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers that ended the 148-day strike. Included in the agreement were provisions placing guardrails around the use of generative AI that not only protect writers but also the studios, which are signaling they plan to pursue copyrights of works created in part by AI tools.

	The deal doesn’t bar the use of AI but restricts how it can be credited and utilized.

	“The Companies agree that because neither traditional AI nor GAI is a person, neither is a ‘writer’ or ‘professional writer,'” states the Memorandum of Agreement. “Therefore, written material produced by traditional AI or GAI shall not be considered literary material.”



	The agreement details that the provision of work created by AI, which must be disclosed by both sides, won’t affect writers’ credit or compensation and cannot be the “basis for disqualifying a writer from eligibility for separated rights.” But nestled in between the lines of those protections is confirmation that studios aim to have writers work collaboratively with AI tools in the screenwriting process, though it can’t be mandated. 

	By keeping AI on the table, studios are looking to copyright material created by writers working in conjunction with the human-mimicking bots. Essential to the copyrightability of such works is a human rewriting or at least touching up any AI-produced script. Material solely produced by AI is not copyrightable. This means that the studios need writers to pursue copyrights and exploitation of such works. 

	“The studios want to ensure exclusivity and copyright ownership,” says Darren Trattner, an entertainment lawyer who represents writers, directors and actors. “They want to make sure that they have ownership of all the results and proceeds, and if AI is used, there could be an issue with that.”

	The AMPTP appears to have built in safeguards that protect against use of AI that could undermine copyrightability.

	“A writer must obtain the Company’s consent before using GAI,” the MoA states. “The Company retains the right to reject the use of GAI, including the right to reject a use of GAI that could adversely affect the copyrightability or exploitation of the work.”

	










	Sarah Odenkirk, an intellectual property lawyer, says that this part of the deal indicates that studios are “very well aware that if a writer uses generative AI to create a work,” then “they won’t be given as strong of copyright protections that they wanted” because material created by AI isn’t copyrightable.

	Writers are rightfully concerned. In an Aug. 11 proposal, the AMPTP signaled that it intends to harness AI tools that can generate loglines, pitch ideas and storylines in seconds. It stressed “landmark protections for writers” in which their “compensation, credit and separated rights will not be affected” when generative AI is used.

	The AMPTP described its offer as meeting the “priority concerns the writers have expressed.” It was the opposite; the AMPTP was arguably getting the benefit of the bargain, with the potential to significantly undercut scribes’ work down the line.

	The U.S. Copyright Office currently maintains that most AI-generated works are not copyrightable. In a statement of policy issued in March, it said it’s “well-established” that protection can only be granted to works that are the “product of human creativity” and that authors “exclude non-humans.” A work containing material produced by AI can only support a copyright if a human “selected or arranged” it in a “sufficiently creative way that the resulting work constitutes an original work of authorship.”

	If they have a person rewrite or touch up AI-generated material, the studios calculated that they could then position the work as having had enough human input to qualify for copyright protection. Without writers playing a part in the screenwriting process when AI is used, studios would essentially be creating uncopyrightable material. This would limit opportunities for exploitation since the works could enter the public domain, says Odenkirk, who observes that this serves as a “natural barrier” against studios completely replacing writers with AI tools. 

	










	“If a human touches material created by generative AI, then the typical copyright protections will kick in,” a source close to the AMPTP said in August.

	At the same time, studios can arrange their employment relationship with the writer as a work-made-for-hire, which would allow them to list themselves as the owner of the copyright. This could enable them to sidestep writers exploiting a provision in copyright law enabling them to recapture previously transferred IP rights after a certain period of time. Studios have been fighting costly legal battles over the right to iconic franchises birthed in the 1980s, including Top Gun, Predator, Terminator and Friday the 13th.

	The determining factor of the copyrightability of AI-created material is the extent to which a person had “creative control over the work’s expression and actually formed the traditional elements of authorship,” according to the copyright office. A writer, for example, could modify material originally generated by AI to such a degree that it meets the standard for protection. In these instances, only the human-authored aspects of the work will be granted protection. The copyright office requires applicants to disclose the parts of their work created by AI.

	Amid this backdrop, courts are wrestling with the legality of using copyrighted works to train AI systems. Absent in the deal is mention of whether the studios will use writers’ work as training data — a sticking point in negotiations. The agreement, which acknowledges the legal landscape around the issue as “uncertain and rapidly developing,” says that both sides reserve all rights to pursue litigation over the unauthorized exploitation of material to train AI systems. It appears that studios maintain that they have the right to use writers’ work as training data, according to comments made by negotiating committee co-chair Chris Keyser in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “The companies have, they claim, some ongoing copyright rights in using our material, and we claim certain contractual rights that limit that or would compensate us for that,” he said.

	










	The tentative deal’s Memorandum of Agreement punts the issue under a term requiring regular meetings at the request of the guild to “discuss and review information related to the Company’s use and intended use of GAI in motion picture development and production.”

An artificial intelligence model currently being developed by the Government Accountability Office could one day be used to do things like pull information from the watchdog’s extensive catalog of reports for Congress, the agency’s top official told lawmakers this week. 
GAO Comptroller General Gene Dodaro told the House Administration’s Subcommittee on Modernization at a Wednesday hearing that the agency is working to figure out how to both audit AI use in government and use the technology to its own benefit.
As part of those efforts, Dodaro said, GAO’s Innovation Lab has brought in a large language model that it’s looking to use to query its reports in a more “sophisticated way.” Once the agency is satisfied with that tool, he said, they’d share it with Congress.
All the potential use cases of the model have yet to be defined, however, and that’s the point.

In an interview with FedScoop, GAO Chief Data Scientist and Director of the Innovation Lab Taka Ariga said the AI project is currently in an “experimentation phase” with a goal of establishing a foundational large language model (LLM) that allows that agency to build use cases on top of it.
While GAO is interested in using the tool for its work and the work of Congress, Ariga said it also has an interest in learning the mechanics of generative AI so it can figure out the appropriate uses and better perform its oversight of the government — which is increasingly adopting the new technology. 
In balancing all of those interests, Ariga said GAO arrived at building a model within its infrastructure that allows its staff to work with generative AI in a more secure way and experiment with their own use cases.
“We want to make sure that we are realizing the sort of potential opportunities for productivity gains, but making sure that we do so in a secure and appropriate way,” Ariga said. “And to us, the only way to do that is deploying an LLM inside GAO.”
GAO’s work on the model has been ongoing for roughly eight to 10 weeks, Ariga said, and has focused on using pre-trained models to figure out which work best for what it’s trying to achieve. “Now we’re embarking on the exercise of how do we then calibrate the parameters? How do we start thinking about training these models on GAO content?” he said.

Among GAO’s interests: Making sure that the model isn’t generating answers from things it learned from outside sources like Wikipedia and avoiding an “auto magical” type of interface that doesn’t explain its reasoning.
“Rather than making stuff up, we want to see this sort of step-by-step rational process behind the scenes so that any output that we end up seeing, we have some basis of … understanding how we arrive at that output,” Ariga said.
One particular use case the watchdog is thinking about for a generative AI tool that’s trained on GAO’s reports is using an application programming interface (API) to “plug into information within Congress.gov” on committee hearings and summarize what the agency has already reported on the topic, Ariga said. 
Other potential generative AI use cases GAO is looking at include analyzing public comments on Regulation.gov to draw common themes, Ariga said. He noted the agency has a number of different hypotheses. “What we don’t want to end up doing is limiting what we can do based on what the Innovation Lab has thought about before,” he said.
As far as timing, Ariga said the agency is “very close” to a basic deployment of the technology itself, but there is still “some time before” it can be broadly available. The agency must go through the cybersecurity authorization process and testing, for example.

But throughout the process, Ariga said, they want to make sure they’re testing with end users. That group will start small and eventually be expanded to more people over time. “Eventually, our goal is to then invite all the GAO to be able to experience what sort of a GAO-specific flavor of large language model can do,” Ariga said.

Today, generative AI is generating a lot of interest in how it impacts consumer business and applications, however the public sector stands to gain efficiencies in their enterprise operations when applied in the right use cases, according to Google ML, AI and Generative AI Practice Lead, Amina al Sherif.
Al Sherif joined StateScoop’s virtual IT Mod Summit to discuss the impact generative AI has across many areas in IT operations, including streamlining code development, improving data management and accomplishing a variety of other IT operations workflows.
Improving IT operations
Al Sherif emphasized the growing need among organizations to view generative AI through the lens of a “platform revolution,” so from a production perspective it isn’t about building a chat bot, rather you can build a search capability to review all IT documentation or network maps. 
“Generative AI is very powerful, and frankly, it’s the biggest strength in the coding realm to automate things that normally would have required a team of Python or Java [developers] to put in the pipeline,” explained al Sherif. She asserts that generative AI can facilitate code development and augment the code review process, so it is ready for production quickly and well-integrated into the rest of the code base.
She cited an example of using generative AI to optimize and review TerraForm by HashiCorp deployments — an infrastructure-as-a-code tool used to manage cloud infrastructure — and its use in pointing out instances of inefficiencies or duplicative resource deployments.
Additionally, generative AI is applicable as a tool to improve areas such as database management, data cleansing, network health checks and automated dashboard creation that have to be done on a daily basis to reflect how the network is performing and sensors are performing.
The ‘data problem’
As a platform approach, generative AI can be designed to perform end-to-end functions and break down data silos as well as communication silos, said Al Sherif, which can help organizations get a better understanding of their data,
“A lot of CIOs, and IT departments by default, deal with the data problem,” according to Al Sherif, which can encompass not knowing where the databases are located, their health status or the status of data cleansing.
She explained that as a platform performing end-to-end functions, generative AI can solve a larger range of operational issues, such as:

Compressing files automatically when they have not been touched or used in a long time.
Forming data cleansing pipelines and eliminating (for example but not limited to) instances of nulls and corrupt values.
Generating daily checklists that IT employees must regularly follow.
Setting reminders for specialized tasks in security or assurance to make knowledge more accessible and break down communications silos across teams.

Finding appropriate checks and balances
Lastly, Al Sherif encouraged public sector leaders to find a balance between risk aversion and embracing innovation so that they are not falling behind the adoption curve.
“Regulation is going to be needed in both government and education [sectors]…and I think there are very good frameworks put together, and kind of layered on top of that innovation capability, to make sure that innovation is happening in a safe way,” she explained.
“But you need to allow your engineers to grow and experiment with these technologies and avoid doing things like putting total bans on the technology, or even pauses on the technology,” she explained, as a way to retain talented individuals and a younger workforce who are motivated to implement more modern technologies.

AI is not just a futuristic concept from science fiction; it's a rapidly evolving technology that's already shaping our lives.Defining AI: What Is It?At its core, AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and learning from experience.How AI Works: The Nuts and BoltsThe functioning of AI is built on two fundamental components: data and algorithms. AI systems process vast amounts of data and use complex mathematical algorithms to make predictions, decisions, or recommendations. The more data an AI system has, the better it can learn and improve its performance.Types of AI: From Narrow to GeneralAI can be categorized into two main types: Narrow or Weak AI, which is designed for specific tasks like voice recognition or chess-playing, and General or Strong AI, which has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. Currently, we have narrow AI in various applications, but we are still working toward achieving true general AI.Machine Learning: The Heart of AIMachine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It's like teaching a computer to recognize patterns and make sense of data on its own.Deep Learning: Mimicking the Human BrainDeep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks, inspired by the structure of the human brain. Deep learning has led to significant breakthroughs in areas like image and speech recognition.AI in Action: Everyday ApplicationsAI is already part of our daily lives. It powers virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, suggests content on streaming platforms, recommends products on e-commerce websites, and even assists in medical diagnoses. The possibilities are endless.The Future of AI: Opportunities and ChallengesThe future of AI is both exciting and challenging. As AI continues to advance, it holds the promise of solving complex problems and enhancing our lives. However, it also raises ethical and societal questions, such as privacy concerns and the impact on employment.Conclusion: AI - A Transformative ForceIn conclusion, Artificial Intelligence is a transformative force that is reshaping industries and our way of life.

Nathan McNeese of Clemson University started studying how people and artificial intelligence can best work together over a decade ago, long before ChatGPT and its chatbot kin took the world by storm. With many people just beginning to understand how AI shapes their lives, the technology is now entering a crucial juncture, said McNeese, the McQueen Quattlebaum Associate Professor of Human-Centered Computing. “Never before in history have we had the broader population interacting with AI like we are now, and that’s fundamentally going to change people’s perceptions of what that interaction looks like,” McNeese said. “It also means that we’re at a critical time period, where if these technologies are not researched and deployed responsibly, it will cause significant harm to how people view and use AI systems moving forward. “AI is one of the most significant societal opportunities in the history of the world, but it only comes to fruition if we ensure the safe and accurate design and implementation of these systems. And that design and implementation must always focus on humans.”



 McNeese’s research into human-AI teaming is helping put Clemson at the forefront of shaping the future of a powerful technology that has already begun to transform how people learn, work and live. His peers are recognizing his work. In the span of less than two months, McNeese received four high honors: a National Science Foundation CAREER Award; the William C. Howell Young  Investigator Award and the Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making Best Article Award, both from the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society; and the overall Outstanding Alumni Award from his alma mater, Penn State’s College of Information Sciences and Technology.
“In a remarkably short time, Nathan McNeese has achieved several significant milestones,” said Anand Gramopadhye, dean of the College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences. “These latest awards are stepping stones that have him on the path to becoming a leading figure in human-factors research. I offer him my wholehearted congratulations on all his success.” In an interview with IDEAS, McNeese described how developments such as ChatGPT have changed the landscape for his research and how his research can ensure AI benefits society.
For those not familiar with your work, how would you describe your research focus in layman’s terms?

Nathan McNeese, far right, poses for a photo with members of his research group and their robotic dog, Spot, and one of their drones.
We deal with two ends of the spectrum. There’s the very computational technical end of AI, which is algorithmic development. We ask, how do you make sense of that data through an algorithm, and how do you have an output, which is what we see as humans?  And then there’s the other side, which is the more humanistic side, and this probably is really where we made our name. We’re interested in understanding how humans perceive, interact with, are motivated by and are concerned about AI broadly speaking. What we try to do is reverse engineer those things and bring them back into the development of AI so that it takes into account the human and what humans want and perceive from AI. What are the big takeaways from your research so far? 
What we really focus on at the micro-level are the teaming aspects– human-AI collaboration– and we’ve seen a myriad of varied findings. It really depends on the human being. Some human beings are all for it, they will integrate with the AI, and the AI and the human interact efficiently. But then you’ll have other humans who are completely antithetical to this, where they want nothing to do with it. What are you finding about why some people like working with AI and some would rather not? Every individual, as a human being, is different. We are made up of different personalities, different desires, and various life experiences. That is dictating to a high degree how humans perceive AI and then how they will interact with AI. How humans perceive AI is incredibly important, because that then usually dictates how they interact with it. If they perceive the AI as a threat or untrustworthy, their interaction with it is not going to be one that is collaborative and communicative with high levels of interaction. But if they see the opposite of that, we see that they’re very willing to interact with it.  How have ChatGPT and other chatbots changed the landscape? 
What’s interesting is we’re hitting a tipping point, with things like ChatGPT and large language models coming to the forefront of society. Wide masses of people are now interacting with AI agents, and I am extremely excited about this because it’s a paradigm shift in my work. The past 10 years I’ve been studying humans interacting with AI. Broadly speaking, most of those humans have not interacted with AI. When they come into the lab, or they take a survey, or we have an interview, we’re speaking purely from a theoretical, conceptual level. Now with the introduction of things like large language models, where people’s grandparents are online playing with ChatGPT, we’re seeing a wave of new experience levels coming to the forefront. That’s going to change how people then perceive and interact with human-AI systems. What do you think the impact will be?
Never before in history have we had the broader population interacting with AI like we are now, and that’s fundamentally going to change people’s perceptions of what that interaction looks like. It also means that we’re at a critical time period, where if these technologies are not researched and deployed responsibly, it will cause significant harm to how people view and use AI systems moving forward. AI is one of the most significant societal opportunities in the history of the world, but it only comes to fruition if we ensure the safe and accurate design and implementation of these systems. And that design and implementation must always focus on humans. We have to get to the point where there are regulations to combat irresponsible AI development and deployment, the kind of models that cause disparate impact or treatment. There are a lot of people that are smarter than me that are saying this. We can’t get this wrong, right now, because it’ll end up being wrong forever, essentially, and I don’t think we’ll be able to come back from it. We have to do things the right way right now, or else it’s a wasted opportunity. 
Many have questions about the ethics and safety of AI. How does your work address those concerns? What safeguards do we need to have in place? In the human-AI teaming area, we were the first people in the world that ever approached ethics. We ask, how do you develop and build an ethical AI teammate? This becomes doubly important, because of the context and setting. It’s teamwork, which means that you have increased interaction. The frustrating fact about artificial intelligence is that artificial intelligence is based on data, and we have a lot of data– a lot of really bad data. If you go on social media, misinformation and hurtful opinions are everywhere. Unfortunately, all that gets captured. We are not fully to the level of being able to filter that information out and throw it in the trash. It usually gets put into the algorithm in terms of contributing to the algorithm itself, and that’s where you see things like racist algorithms. Our work sees humans as the best safeguard for this problem. As humans, we need to take an active role in shaping and designing these technologies to be a social good, and our work directly works with humans to facilitate this. What inspired you to get into AI, and what continues to drive your passion for the topic? I’ve always been interested in technology from a very young age. I used to take a lot of things apart and sometimes get into trouble with my parents. I mean, like, fully apart to the point where you can’t put it back together, because I was just interested in, what’s in that? I’ve always been just a curious person. Also, at an early age, I started studying teamwork– human-human teams. And then I figured out I love teamwork, and I love technology. I asked, how can I bring these two things together? It was fortuitous in that I started studying AI almost a decade ago, before the hype machine. I can’t get bored of AI because of how rapidly it’s developing. My full-time job is to be an expert on AI systems and on human-AI interaction, and I can’t keep up with it because the products and development from the AI spectrum are coming out every week. It’s a continual race, and I like that race.

A must-listen for lovers of fiction.Read more""We have been receiving phone calls and emails from Australian authors who've been dismayed and outraged to learn that their works have been appropriated without their permission,"" Lanchester says.Literary fiction by Margaret Atwood, Zadie Smith and Barbara Kingsolver, and books by Australian authors Geraldine Brooks, Liane Moriarty, Markus Zuzak and Robbie Arnott also feature in the collection.What is Books3 and what happened?In September, The Atlantic published a tool to search Books3 after reporter Alex Reisner identified author information for 183,000 of the 191,000 ISBNs he extracted from the dataset, used to train Meta's LLaMA, Bloomberg's BloombergGPT and EleutherAI's GPT-J.The Books3 creator, Shaun Presser, told The Atlantic he developed the dataset as a high-quality training resource for other independent developers to allow them to compete with tech giants such as OpenAI, which is believed to have trained ChatGPT using mystery datasets known as Books1 and Books2.The Silicon Valley wayIrish-born crime writer Dervla McTiernan was incensed to learn her bestselling crime novel, The Ruin (2018), was one of the thousands in the collection.""It's outright theft. People who stole all of these books … did it for the purposes of making money,"" she says. Companies like OpenAI and Meta ""are 100 per cent acting in their own self interest,"" says McTiernan, the author of four novels.(Supplied: HarperCollins/Julia Dunin)McTiernan, who lives in Perth, believes the companies knew the dataset contained stolen material.""They knew they were using pirated books, and they did so with gross indifference, and I think that's characteristic of the mentality of people who work in this industry,"" she says.""It was Facebook that had the motto … 'move fast and break things'. Well, we're the things that are being broken, and we're not very happy about it.""Weren't there other options?Professor Toby Walsh, Chief Scientist at UNSW's AI Institute, is one of Australia's leading AI experts.He was disappointed to find one of his books, Machines Behaving Badly: The Morality of AI (2022), in the Books3 dataset.""If you just want to train a chatbot to speak English, there are tens of thousands of books that are out of copyright that they could have used,"" he says.""It's typical of the cavalier way that people in Silicon Valley treat people's intellectual property."" Lanchester says more than 30 authors affected by the Books3 scandal have contacted the ASA.(Supplied: Olivia Lanchester)Lanchester agrees.""AI developers could have trained their systems on works that are in the public domain, or they could have sought a license from the copyright owners, but instead, they've ingested copyright works without seeking permission,"" she says.""This has been done disregarding copyright laws, and it's treating authors' works as though they're a public commodity, which ignores the fact that there's a real cost of creation and that licensing is how authors earn a living.""Lanchester says the ASA is not ""anti-technology"" but argues that tech companies should acknowledge the value of the authors' work in the development of generative AI tools.""They couldn't have built the AI systems they've built without high-quality inputs, and there was a real opportunity for authors' works to be licensed and for the creative and intellectual labour to be recognised. Instead, their works have just been appropriated,"" she says.Legal ramifications for AI overreachTech giants, including Meta and OpenAI, face several lawsuits in the US over their alleged use of authors' work without their permission.Two authors, Mona Awad and Paul Tremblay, filed a lawsuit against Open AI in July, claiming OpenAI used their copyrighted books to train ChatGPT without their consent. They say the AI tool generates ""very accurate summaries"" of their work.Other lawsuits have been filed against the tech companies by comedian Sarah Silverman and Michael Chabon, who won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.How will AI change our understanding of art?Read moreIn September, a group of high-profile authors, including George RR Martin, Jodi Picoult, John Grisham and Roxane Gay, filed a joint suit with the Authors Guild against OpenAI.While the suit accuses the company of ""systemic theft"" and ""mass copyright infringement"", OpenAI and Meta have claimed their use of authors' work amounts to ""fair use"".""This is a new way of using people's copyrighted material, and the courts have yet to decide whether it's fair use, whether it's within the bounds of the law or not,"" says Walsh.A meaningful threatLanchester says generative AI poses a direct threat to authors' livelihoods.""We're concerned that the market is going to be flooded with inferior AI-generated content.""A market crowded with AI material doesn't serve anyone. It makes discoverability harder for professional writers and lowers quality for consumers."" OpenAI, the tech giant behind AI-powered language model ChatGPT, is valued at US$90 billion. (Getty Images: Stockcam)McTiernan also questions the viability of a literary career in a marketplace dominated by AI.McTiernan says ChatGPT might be a ""bad writer"" now, but she worries that in three to five years, generative AI tools will be able to create works similar in character to contemporary authors that will be offered in direct competition with their original novels.""If [tech companies like Amazon, Apple and Meta] are able to generate their own books and stories, why would they sell anything else? Why would they give prominence in the market to any sort of competing efforts? I don't see why they would.""What will Australian authors do next?Writing is already a precarious occupation in Australia, where the average annual income for an author is $18,200.While McTiernan says the writers she has spoken to ""would love to have the opportunity to take action"", for many, it is not an option.""[Given] what authors are earning as a general rule in Australia, how many authors are in a position to fund or even contribute to the costs of litigation? Very few,"" McTiernan says.""This is, again, one of the situations we find these days where these massive wealthy companies can take this sort of action, almost with impunity, because they know the people that they're damaging most are not in a position to take action against them.""Talk books with us on FacebookThe ABC's place for readers to talk books — with each other, with books specialists from across the ABC, and with your favourite authors.Read moreLanchester says ASA intends to continue to advocate for authors.""We are advocating to the government and hoping there will be a pathway forward to negotiate licensing solutions with the tech sector,"" she says.""We're watching the US litigation brought by the Authors Guild with real interest and absolutely cheering those authors on, and … we're trying to get a handle on the number of Australian authors affected. We think that there will be many.""It's incredibly difficult because there are complex legal and jurisdictional issues to grapple with.""While Professor Walsh concedes the risks posed by AI may require specific regulation, he says existing laws governing intellectual property and privacy could be applied ""more forcibly to the tech space"" to rein in unlawful conduct.""I'm not sure that now the tech industry is such … a large component of our lives whether it can be left to be the free-for-all, to be the Wild West that it has been for the last 20 years.""Posted 28 Sep 202328 Sep 2023Thu 28 Sep 2023 at 6:50pm, updated 28 Sep 202328 Sep 2023Thu 28 Sep 2023 at 9:11pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesWhy Zadie Smith's new historical novel namechecks Wagga Wagga'Vibrant, nervy, electric': A guide to the 2023 Booker Prize shortlistA good ghostwriter leaves no trace: Who really wrote your favourite celebrity memoirMore on:Arts, Culture and EntertainmentAustraliaAuthorBooks (Literature)FictionLaw, Crime and JusticeNovelPerthScience and TechnologyUnited StatesTop StoriesSouth-east cold spell drove record demand for power and soaring wholesale pricesThese are the world's most powerful passports in 2024.

Jaishankar and Blinken discuss G20 and Economic Corridor's potential, no mention of Canada row
The statement issued by the US Department of State after the meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar made no mention of the killing of a Khalistani leaders in Canada's Surrey in July. The alleged murder of the separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, has triggered a diplomatic row between India and Canada.
According to Reuters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had earlier said he was sure US Secretary of State Antony Blinken would raise the murder of a Sikh separatist leader when he met his Indian counterpart on Thursday. However, the US statement had no mention of the issue.

Win some, lose some — Mapping BJP's friends and foes
You win some, you lose some. The proverb came to life this week as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) forged an alliance with the Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnataka, but lost its ally in Tamil Nadu. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) severed its four-year-old ties with the BJP, walking out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) months ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
The political churning are inevitable in both the NDA and the challenger INDIA Alliance given the high-stakes Lok Sabha battle next year. For BJP particularly, the break-up with the AIADMK is concerning given the party has been trying hard to build a strong presence in the southern states.

Generative AI won't cause job famine but will create more, says EXL CEO
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) will not lead to a job famine but will actually create many more new and exciting jobs, said the CEO of EXL, Rohit Kapoor.
Speaking exclusively to CNBC-TV18, Kapoor said, ""EXL is deploying generative AI to help clients increase productivity and is also looking to aid workers in helping customers make smarter decisions. We are aiming to use artificial intelligence to allow customers to self-help and find solutions"".
Highlighting the need for global coordination on AI regulations, Kapoor said that different regulations across jurisdictions could lead to errors and even biases in AI-generated results.

NDA-AIADMK breakup | The alliance was getting too high to bear for the Dravidian party
AIADMK apparently felt that BJP high command is deliberately ignoring its pleas to stop BJP State President Annamalai from passing derisive remarks against the Dravidian party's revered leaders and it realised that the cost of the alliance was getting too high to bear. Already AIADMK was being mocked as a 'slave party' of the BJP by the ruling DMK and its allies, and to silently bear the taunts was becoming a problem. The loss of minority votes because of the alliance and the fact that potential allies were also getting put off by the presence of BJP in the alliance were additional factors that led AIADMK to pull out from NDA, writes noted political observer and sports commentator Sumanth C Raman.

NDA-AIADMK breakup — here's why BJP unable to retain its long-time allies
The AIADMK announcing a formal break of ties with the BJP-led NDA creates a perception that the Bharatiya Janata Party is unable to hold together the alliance that it created. It also accentuated the fissures that developed between the AIADMK, one of the two prominent Dravidian parties, and the BJP, working to establish itself as a pan-India political party. How will it pan out?

Researchers from the Oxford Martin School have investigated the potential Generative AI has in transforming work across industries, boosting productivity and democratising innovation.

Contributing to a Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions report, they explored the opportunities and challenges of Generative AI – artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media – as well as highlighting the unsurprising attention policymakers around the world are paying to AI in general.
The researchers reported that Generative AI could drive a wave of potential opportunities for the technology value stack, as follows:
Silicon – it is expected that Generative AI will fuel significant growth across the supply chain, led by greater demand for computing resources, networking, and memory chips.Infrastructure & Platforms – so-called hyperscalers such as cloud providers are working to build the underlying infrastructure that enables Generative AI applications, but over time the researchers expect to see more differentiation in this domain e.g. in the types of solutions offered, performance and pricing.Models and Machine Learning Operations – the open-source community is likely to be a key driver of innovation in this layer, which encompasses all types of models facilitating Generative AI.Software and Applications – the researchers expect nearly all software companies to be impacted in some form by Generative AI, but company-specific execution will be critical in navigating what is a fluid landscape.Services – it is believed that Generative AI represents a step forward from ongoing AI/automation initiatives across the IT and Business Process Management services.Ian Goldin, Professor of Globalization and Development at the University of Oxford and report co-author, said:
‘Generative AI is a dual edged sword that offers enormous potential to accelerate solutions to a number of the world’s greatest challenges, with new health cures, energy and innovation. But it also could destroy jobs, undermine democracy and widen inequalities and the divisions within our society and between countries.
‘The challenge now is to develop the regulatory frameworks and guardrails required to ensure its benefits are widely shared and sustained.’
The report also highlights a series of challenges associated with the rise of Generative AI, including that:
data used to train Generative AI systems are susceptible to bias or inaccuracies, for example where gender and race are concerned;the economics associated with the operation of large language models could trigger further increases in inequality between those who have access to these capabilities and those who do not;as language models become more coherent, they are also become more fluent at generating factually incorrect statements and fabricating falsehoods;training Generative AI requires software processing huge archives of images, text, and other forms of input, throwing up a series of legal risks including intellectual property (IP) infringement; the potential to displace jobs and increase inequality is greater and more rapidly disruptive than with previous waves of technology; andthe transformative potential of Generative AI has triggered broader concerns around the existential threat posed by AI, particularly against a varied regulatory backdrop.Pantelis Koutroumpis, Director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Technological and Economic Change at the Oxford Martin School and report co-author, said:
‘Generative AI has already shown an impressive potential across a range of applications over the recent months. The adoption of these technologies appears to correlate with a sizeable productivity boost, but their limitations are also evident to their users.
‘Beyond more data and better computing resources, these models excel when fed with high-quality human generated inputs. Balancing the incentives of content production and technological innovation through a fair redistribution of productivity gains will be a challenge for policy makers.’ 
Given the importance of AI as a foundational technology, the report concludes that the world is now in an ‘AI Arms Race’, with countries striving to establish scientific and technological dominance through research output and patenting.

I have a quick question for you.

Is it true that Abraham Lincoln said that the problem of believing what you read on the Internet is due to the difficulty of verifying what you find there?


I’m sure that you would agree with me that Abraham Lincoln said no such thing. Even the most shallow understanding of Abraham Lincoln’s life is indicative that he lived long before the Internet came into being. Ergo, we would be reluctant to believe he would have been making pointed remarks about the Internet in his day.

Suppose though that I told you that such a claimed quotation could be found on the Internet. Does that change your opinion about the veracity of the quote? I doubt it. I assume that all of us know that you cannot trust what you read on the Internet. There is a lot of junk out there. Tons of junk. Whole oceans of informational flotsam of a dubious nature.

PROMOTED
My basis for sharing this with you is that generative AI is mainly data-trained on text found on the Internet. There is a chance that when you use generative AI, it might get facts wrong or otherwise have gotten data training that was accepted as true when it really wasn’t. Fortunately, by and large, the odds are that much of what you get out of generative AI and based on the initial and later refined data training will be relatively factual (not all of the time, but a lot of the time).
There is a rub.
The added twist is that generative AI can stumble during pattern-matching and end up generating errors, falsehoods, glitches, biases, and even so-called AI hallucinations. You have to be on the lookout for those kinds of anomalies. Always. Your quest to ferret out problematic portions should be never-ending.

Any essay that you get out of generative AI could contain one or more of these abysmal maladies. The issues can be at times easy to spot, while on other occasions nearly impossible to find. Plus, please know that any direct question or notable problem that you ask the generative AI to answer or solve can also contain those troubling difficulties. As I have repeatedly warned in my classes and workshops about generative AI, you are dealing with something that is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’ll get out of generative AI, including great and useful stuff or potentially made-up malarky.

What can you do about this unsavory situation?
One approach consists of verifying the generated results. The usual means consists of doing a search on the web to see what you can find there, as it relates to whatever response the AI app has provided. You are trying to do a verification or double-check of the generated response. Fact by fact, you might laboriously do a comparison. The effort can be tiresome and frustrating. I dare suggest that most people do not undertake a thorough double-checking. They either accept the generated response as it sits, or they read the response and base an assessment of their own reading of the response, or they may reach out to the web to check a few cheery-picked portions here and there.

There must be a better way.
Yes, indeed, I’d like to introduce you to a new technique in prompt engineering that can aid your efforts to be diligent and double-check or verify the responses produced by generative AI. The technique is coined as Chain-of-Verification (formally COVE or CoVe, though some are using CoV).
In today’s column, I am continuing my ongoing and popular series on the latest advances in prompt engineering and will be diving into the nature and use of the Chain-of-Verification technique. The first part of the discussion will explain what the technique consists of. I will provide the research that underlies the technique. Next, I will identify the prompts that you can use for performing the technique. All in all, doing a Chain-of-Verification is relatively easy to do and you will undoubtedly be pleased to add the approach to your daily prompt engineering efforts and overall prompting prowess.
Before I dive into my in-depth exploration of this vital topic, let’s make sure we are all on the same page when it comes to the foundations of prompt engineering and generative AI. Doing so will put us all on an even keel.
Prompt Engineering Is A Cornerstone For Generative AI
As a quick backgrounder, prompt engineering or also referred to as prompt design is a rapidly evolving realm and is vital to effectively and efficiently using generative AI or the use of large language models (LLMs). Anyone using generative AI such as the widely and wildly popular ChatGPT by AI maker OpenAI, or akin AI such as GPT-4 (OpenAI), Bard (Google), Claude 2 (Anthropic), etc. ought to be paying close attention to the latest innovations for crafting viable and pragmatic prompts.
For those of you interested in prompt engineering or prompt design, I’ve been doing an ongoing series of insightful explorations on the latest in this expanding and evolving realm, including this coverage:


(1) Imperfect prompts. Practical use of imperfect prompts toward devising superb prompts (see the link here).
(2) Persistent context prompting. Use of persistent context or custom instructions for prompt priming (see the link here).

Anyone stridently interested in prompt engineering and improving their results when using generative AI ought to be familiar with those notable techniques.
Moving on, here’s a bold statement that pretty much has become a veritable golden rule these days:


The use of generative AI can altogether succeed or fail based on the prompt that you enter. 


If you provide a prompt that is poorly composed, the odds are that the generative AI will wander all over the map and you won’t get anything demonstrative related to your inquiry. Being demonstrably specific can be advantageous, but even that can confound or otherwise fail to get you the results you are seeking. A wide variety of cheat sheets and training courses for suitable ways to compose and utilize prompts has been rapidly entering the marketplace to try and help people leverage generative AI soundly. In addition, add-ons to generative AI have been devised to aid you when trying to come up with prudent prompts, see my coverage at the link here.
AI Ethics and AI Law also stridently enter into the prompt engineering domain. For example, whatever prompt you opt to compose can directly or inadvertently elicit or foster the potential of generative AI to produce essays and interactions that imbue untoward biases, errors, falsehoods, glitches, and even so-called AI hallucinations (I do not favor the catchphrase of AI hallucinations, though it has admittedly tremendous stickiness in the media; here’s my take on AI hallucinations at the link here).
There is also a marked chance that we will ultimately see lawmakers come to the fore on these matters, possibly devising and putting in place new laws or regulations to try and scope and curtail misuses of generative AI. Regarding prompt engineering, there are likely going to be heated debates over putting boundaries around the kinds of prompts you can use. This might include requiring AI makers to filter and prevent certain presumed inappropriate or unsuitable prompts, a cringe-worthy issue for some that borders on free speech considerations. For my ongoing coverage of these types of AI Ethics and AI Law issues, see the link here and the link here, just to name a few.
With the above as an overarching perspective, we are ready to jump into today’s discussion.
How To Do Verifications Associated With Generative AI Outputs
A looming danger of using generative AI is that the answers to your questions might consist of AI-generated blarney and you won’t even realize it. Sometimes this might not be of a particularly substantive consequence, such as incorrectly indicating the date when Abraham Lincoln was born. The odds are that the error or falsehood about his date of birth might not be overly life-threatening in current times. Supposing though the AI indicated that a certain kind of mushroom was perfectly fine to eat, despite the truth being that the mushroom is considered poisonous.
That’s bad.
Really bad.
I’m sure that I don’t have to say much more to convince you that it is sensible to try and verify the generated essays and answers that come out of using generative AI.
There are efforts underway to get generative AI to automatically undertake internal self-checking, see my discussion at the link here. The AI might reach out to the Internet to verify aspects of its own generated essays or answers. This could be handy due to the original data training of the generative AI possibly being outdated. Or perhaps the data training had falsehoods at the get-go and searching the web might reveal contradicting truths. Another possibility is that the generative AI has produced output based solely on arcane and nonsensical patterns that did not especially pertain to the data training and have produced new facts or figures, derived seemingly out of thin air.
You can bet that AI makers are going to incorporate all manner of checks and balances into their generative AI apps. They know that the writing is on the wall. If generative AI continues to produce malarky, the public at large will undoubtedly raise quite a clamor. In turn, lawmakers will hear these cries for improvements and will potentially establish laws that force AI makers to ensure that their generative AI does suitable double-checking. Executives at AI makers and their AI developers might face financial penalties or fines, and reputational damage, and some even suggest that there is a chance of criminal liability.
Meanwhile, for those of us using generative AI on a daily basis, the Wild West still prevails. Do not hold your breath waiting for generative AI to be rejiggered and improved to avert these maladies. Right now, you are on the hook. Whatever you do with generative AI, by and large, it is on your shoulders to double-check the generated outputs.
A straightforward means to do so consists of using a series of prompts to get the generative AI to double-check for you.
Imagine that you’ve asked generative AI to indicate the date of birth of Abraham Lincoln. An answer is provided. You do not know for sure that the date presented is the correct date. Rather than going to look up his date of birth online, you decide to ask the AI app to double-check.
Here’s a common prompt that people use:


Prompt entered by user: “Are you sure?”


You simply ask the AI app if it is sure about the given answer. One thing to keep in mind is that the “Are you sure?” could be misinterpreted by the AI. It is a broadly worded question. My preference is to ask the question in a more contextually specific way.
For example:


Prompt entered by user: Are you sure that the date of birth of Abraham Lincoln that you displayed is correct?”


Notice that the prompt is more specific. The broadly worded version could get a nearly automatic answer of Yes, for which the AI might be just saying Yes to say yes. There hasn’t been any internal rechecking undertaken. The odds are that by laying out your verification question in greater detail the AI app will likely take more effort to double-check things.
There isn’t any guarantee that the AI app will genuinely do a double-check. Thus, the longer version of my verification question does not axiomatically ensure that a double-check will occur. The odds are raised that the double-check will happen as hoped for. It isn’t an absolute certainty.
Here’s something else to consider.
Some have reported that generative AI often takes a shortcut when answering questions that are worded merely as Yes or No possibilities. If you want to boost the odds that the AI app will work on answering a verification question, you are advised to avoid a Yes or No style question or at least pump up the question. The bottom line is to try to ask a verification question that requires some form of elaboration.
For example:


Prompt entered by user: “How did you arrive at the answer displaying the date of birth of Abraham Lincoln and is the answer correct?”


The verification question now forces the AI app to go beyond a curt answer of Yes or No. An explanation will be derived and displayed. Plus, the indication of whether the answer is correct will be presented. The chances are this will help to stir the verification process.
Those are useful prompting strategies overall and ought to be an essential part of your prompt engineering skillset and toolkit.
I’m guessing you likely have realized that even if you get the generative AI to do a double-check, you cannot necessarily believe or take at face value the double-check. In the case of the date of birth of Lincoln, suppose that the date presented was sourced and patterned based on original data training that contains materials stating that particular date. The AI app is going to tell you that the date is correct, though this double-check is purely based on relooking at patterns it already had earlier established.
We are confronted with a conundrum.
Asking a generative AI app to do verification is going to be suspect when the generative AI only focuses on whatever it already has patterned onto. The problem, which you can plainly see, would be that something wrong will seem to be “correct” merely due to the consistency of the wrong thing being persistent.
For this reason, the future of verification is going to either involve having the AI app refer to other external sources as the double-checking mechanism or the AI app might call upon another generative AI as part of doing a double-check. If the other generative AI has been data trained differently, the chances are that hopefully, the other AI app would be a solid comparator to ferret out which is correct or incorrect, see my coverage on this at the link here.
Upping Your Prompting With Chain-Of-Verification Prompts
Now that I’ve identified some of the foundational elements of doing verifications, we are ready to up the ante. A more systematic or methodical approach can be used. This is not a circumstance of choosing one approach over another. You can use the everyday approaches that I mentioned earlier, doing so on a regular basis, and then have in your hip pocket a more extensive prompting approach when needed for more pressing situations.
The extensive approach has been coined as Chain-of-Verification.
Let’s take a look at the research that has come up with the Chain-of-Verification method. In a study entitled “Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination In Large Language Models” by Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Mojtaba Komeili, Jing Xu, Roberta Raileanu, Xian Li, Asli Celikyilmaz, and Jason Weston, posted online on September 20, 2023, the researchers said this:


“We study the ability of language models to deliberate on the responses they give in order to correct their mistakes. We develop the Chain-of-Verification (COVE) method whereby the model first (i) drafts an initial response; then (ii) plans verification questions to fact-check its draft; (iii) answers those questions independently so the answers are not biased by other responses; and (iv) generates its final verified response.”
“We find that independent verification questions tend to provide more accurate facts than those in the original longform answer, and hence improve the correctness of the overall response. We study variations on this recipe across a range of tasks: from list-based questions, closed booked QA and longform text generation.”
“In experiments, we show COVE decreases hallucinations across a variety of tasks, from list-based questions from Wikidata, closed book MultiSpanQA and longform text generation.”


Allow me a moment to offer a brief explanation and overview.
The idea is that you take the same notions that I earlier mentioned and make things a bit more rigorous and interestingly extended. We are going to be playing with these facets:


(1) Enter your initial prompt. This is the initiating prompt that gets the generative AI to produce an answer or essay to whatever question or problem you want to have solved.
(2) Look at the GenAI initial response to the prompt. This is the initial answer or response that the AI app provides to your prompt.
(3) Establish suitable verification questions. Based on the generative AI output, come up with pertinent verification questions.
(4) Ask GenAI the verification questions. Enter a prompt or series of prompts that ask the generative AI the identified verification questions.
(5) Inspect the answers to the verification questions. Take a look at the answers to the verification questions, weighing them in light of what they might signify regarding the GenAI initial response.
(6) Adjust or refine the initial answer accordingly. If the verification answers warrant doing so, go ahead and refine or adjust the initial answer as needed.


My above-listed six aspects are subject to a lot of variations, depending upon your preference and how generative AI tends to work.
Let’s go through those considerations.
First, let’s agree that we are going to constrain all of this to use a particular generative AI app on a self-contained basis. We aren’t going to use any callouts to other generative AI. We aren’t going to access the web to find double-checking materials. This will all be entirely self-contained. We begrudgingly accept the downside risks that I earlier delineated, but we are okay with those risks in terms of taking a streamlined but less exhaustive verification path.
Second, we have to decide how we want to come up with the verification questions. One angle would be to have at the ready a set of very generic verification questions. For example, the classic “Are you sure?” is an entirely generic verification question. As noted, the generic verification is usually not as good as being specific. Thus, we will strive to come up with specific and pertinent verification questions. We will eschew the generic verification questions.
Third, the verification questions could be composed by you, the human using the generative AI. That’s fine. But, then again, we have the generative AI right there at our fingertips, so we might as well go ahead and ask the AI app to come up with the verification questions.
You might be puzzled, rightfully so, that we would allow the generative AI to come up with verification questions. This seems like having the fox guard the chicken coop. The AI app might derive verification questions that are weak or easy to answer, trying to bolster the response that the AI gave us. An obvious bias can creep into this.
I dare say you are absolutely correct. There is a chance that the AI app will try to grease the skids or lean the verification questions in the direction of rubber stamping the initial response that the AI app came up with. As much as we can, we shall try to give directions to the AI app to not do so. No guarantees but at least we can try.
Fourth, we will also let the AI app answer the verification questions, and furthermore, let the AI app determine whether to adjust the initial answer given to our initial prompt. I suppose you could say that we are going all-in about letting the generative AI run the show.
If allowing the AI to do the whole concoction end-to-end gives you heartburn, you are welcome to change things. You could come up with your own verification questions, or supplement the ones generated by the AI. You could judge the answers given to the verification questions. You could decide whether to have the AI app adjust the initial response by using the answers to the verification questions. Etc.
Choose whatever variation of the verification process makes you comfortable and increases your belief in the verification endeavor.
Assume for the sake of discussion that we are going to let the AI take the driver’s seat. We will merely give a prompt or prompts that direct the AI to undertake the steps we want to take for the verification.
Here then is another head-scratcher to contend with.
You could come up with an all-in-one prompt that explains the entire process to the AI app. Voila, you enter the prompt, informing the AI what it is to do, and you let the AI run with the ball.
One potential issue is that sometimes an all-in-one prompt will steer the AI app in a manner that might readily give the AI leeway that we don’t want it to allow. A rule of thumb in general about prompting is that you are usually better off giving prompts on a piecemeal basis to generative AI. Don’t let the AI proverbially bite off more than it can chew. Spoon feed the AI.
Therefore, rather than an all-in-one prompt, we might find it wiser to do the prompting as we go along through the verification process. Upon seeing the initial answer to your initial prompt, you might at that juncture ask the AI app to derive verification questions. After the verification questions are presented, you might then ask the AI to answer the verification questions. And, after the answers are presented, you might then instruct the generative AI to adjust the initial answer accordingly.
I realize this is somewhat of a manual effort on your part. You are spoon-feeding the verification process. Generally, the chances are that the results will come out better. There is no proof per se that doing this as an all-in-one prompt won’t do the same exact thing. The all-in-one prompt is alluring. I would recommend that by and large you use spoon-feeding if you have the time and inclination to do so.
We can take this spoon-feeding even deeper or more detailed.
When you ask the AI app to derive verification questions, you could do this with simply one prompt. You might say to generate verification questions. You might say to generate a desired number of verification questions, such as telling the AI app to generate five or ten (any number you believe necessary).
Another way would be to one-by-one ask for a verification question. The belief is that this might get the AI app to more independently come up with each verification question. If you ask for a slew of them all at once, there is a heightened chance that the bunch will be generated and not be especially distinctive. The assumption is that the one-at-time request will get greater scrutiny when being concocted.
I trust that my discussion about the verification process has made clear that there are a lot of avenues you can pursue.
In my view, if the verification process has to do with content that you are seriously worried about, go the long walk. Do not cut corners. If the content is so-so, you can cut corners. Of course, I would also add that if the verification process is truly essential because the content is life-or-death, please go ahead and use additional verification approaches such as checking the Internet, etc. Do not solely rely on this self-contained AI basis.
The researchers provided this indication of their Chain-of-Verification process overall:


“Our overall process, which we call Chain-of-Verification (CoVe), thus performs four core steps:”
“1. Generate Baseline Response: Given a query, generate the response using the LLM.”
“2. Plan Verifications: Given both query and baseline response, generate a list of verification questions that could help to self-analyze if there are any mistakes in the original response.”
“3. Execute Verifications: Answer each verification question in turn, and hence check the answer against the original response to check for inconsistencies or mistakes.”
“4. Generate Final Verified Response: Given the discovered inconsistencies (if any), generate a revised response incorporating the verification results.”


They mention that their two core research questions consisted of this:


“RQ1: Can COVE effectively reduce the rate of hallucinatory content produced by the LLM?”
“RQ2: Can COVE be used to fix or remove incorrect generations without decreasing the amount of correct content?”


I’d like to say something about the second research question.
The researchers make an important point that there is a chance of the AI app opting to adjust an initial prompt and making the answer essentially worse or at least possibly less compelling.
Here’s how.
Suppose the AI gives an initial answer that says the date of birth of Lincoln is such-and-such. Assume that the answer is indeed correct. You proceed into the verification process. Unfortunately, the verification indicates that the date of birth is incorrect. The AI app changes the date of birth, but the problem is that the change now makes the date incorrect.
We have shot our own foot by invoking the verification process. The correct answer was in hand. The verification regrettably went astray and indicated that the answer was incorrect. The AI then sought to correct a seemingly incorrect answer. The correction turns the answer into being incorrect. I know that seems odd or frustrating, but it can happen.
The key will be to stay on your guard. Closely inspect the changes or adjustments made as a result of the AI undertaken verification. I emphasize over and over again that the responsibility still rests on your shoulders. Do not forsake your part in this. It is easy to allow the AI to run amok. Remain stridently as the human in the loop.
Returning to the research study, here are some excerpts indicating the results:


“In particular, we showed that models are able to answer verification questions with higher accuracy than when answering the original query by breaking down the verification into a set of simpler questions.”
“Secondly, when answering the set of verification questions, we showed that controlling the attention of the model so that it cannot attend to its previous answers (factored CoVe) helps alleviate copying the same hallucinations.”
“Overall, our method provides substantial performance gains over the original language model response just by asking the same model to deliberate on (verify) its answer.”


It stands to reason that the approach ought to make a notable difference.
Here’s why.
You might be familiar with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which is a prompting technique involving telling the generative AI to step-by-step try to solve a problem or compose an essay, see my coverage at the link here. Nearly everyone agrees that prodding generative AI to a step-by-step or chain-style process will get you usually better results.
The Chain-of-Verification leverages the same conception. Make the AI do things step-by-step. The chances are that doing so will improve the outcomes. Not always, but a lot of the time. We are thusly carrying over the already acknowledged benefits of the chain or step-by-step proviso, applying this particularly into doing verifications.
An important aspect of having research studies look into these matters is that a hunch that the chain or step-by-step will improve verifications is nothing more than a hunch. By carefully studying the matter we can be more confident that the hunch is viable and workable.
Not all hunches are a payoff.
Some hunches are.
In this case, we have a research study that suggests we are in the right ballpark. The researchers noted various of the usual limitations and considerations, along with calling for additional research on these matters. I too hope that additional research will be undertaken, some of which I know is already underway and I look forward to sharing their results with you in future columns.
Using Chain-Of-Verification With ChatGPT And Some Examples
I would bet that you might relish seeing how this verification process can be applied and what it looks like. The research study made use of examples such as “When did the Mexican-American war start and end?”, “Who are some politicians who were born in Boston?”, “Name some Endemic orchids of Vietnam”, “Who invented the first printing press and in what year?”, and so on.
I’ve done something similar with the Chain-of-Verification method and opted to use ChatGPT.
Fasten your seatbelt, we are going on a fun and informative ride.
We will start with my draft of an all-in-one verification prompt that I came up with:


My primer prompt to ChatGPT: “After you answer my following question, I want you to try and verify the answer. The verification process is this. Step 1: Examine the answer and identify elements that might be important to verify, such as notable facts, figures, and any other significant considerations. Step 2: Come up with verification questions that are specific to those identified elements. Step 3: Separately answer each of the verification questions, one at a time. Step 4: Finally, after having answered the verification questions, review the initial answer that you gave to my question and adjust the initial answer based on the results of the verification questions. Other aspects: Make sure to show me the verification questions that you come up with, and their answers, and whatever adjustments to the initial answer you are going to make. It is okay for you to make the adjustments and you do not need to wait for my approval to do so. Do you understand all of these instructions?”


Here's what ChatGPT responded with:


ChatGPT response: “Yes, I understand the instructions you've provided. I will answer your initial question, then follow the verification process you outlined, including identifying elements to verify, coming up with verification questions, answering those questions, and adjusting the initial answer as necessary based on the results of the verification questions. Please go ahead and ask your initial question, and we can proceed from there.”


Things are looking good.
Let’s next use the question from the research study that asked about the dates of the Mexican-American War. I went ahead and first used my above primer prompt and then followed up with this question:


My prompt to ChatGPT: “When did the Mexican-American war start and end?”


Here is what ChatGPT responded with (response shown in italics to help make it stand out herein).
ChatGPT Response:
The Mexican-American War started on April 25, 1846, and ended on February 2, 1848. It lasted for approximately 1 year, 9 months, and 8 days.
Now, let's proceed with the verification process:
Step 1: Identify Elements to Verify
Start date of the Mexican-American War (April 25, 1846)
End date of the Mexican-American War (February 2, 1848)
Step 2: Verification Questions
Is the start date of the Mexican-American War April 25, 1846?
Is the end date of the Mexican-American War February 2, 1848?
Step 3: Answer Verification Questions
Is the start date of the Mexican-American War April 25, 1846?
Yes, the start date of the Mexican-American War is April 25, 1846.
Is the end date of the Mexican-American War February 2, 1848?
Yes, the end date of the Mexican-American War is February 2, 1848.
Step 4: Adjust Initial Answer
The initial answer provided is accurate based on the verification questions and their answers. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the initial answer.
The start date of the Mexican-American War is April 25, 1846, and it ended on February 2, 1848.
End Of ChatGPT Response
I looked online to double-check the double-check. Numerous reputable sources online indicate that the dates are correct. I suppose there might be some historical deep-thinkers that disagree with the dates, but overall the dates seem relatively accepted and accurate.
You can see that ChatGPT complied with my all-in-one verification prompt. The key elements that ChatGPT opted to verify consisted of the start date and the end date. We might quibble that the indication of the length of time between the dates should also be verified. Maybe ChatGPT assumed that the duration was obvious and did not need verification.
The example of course was abundantly easy. Identifying which elements to verify was as simple as falling off a log. Answering the verification questions was also quite easy. You could say that we tossed ChatGPT a softball that it readily hit out of the ballpark.
One aspect that might catch your eye is that the verification questions were worded as Yes or No questions. We might want to change our all-in-one prompt to emphasize that when possible, any Yes or No questions should instead be elaborated questions or at least accompanied by an elaboration question.
For the moment, we shall proceed and continue using the aforementioned all-in-one verification prompt. Another question in the research study had to do with politicians born in Boston. Let’s ask that question to ChatGPT.


My prompt to ChatGPT: “Who are some politicians who were born in Boston?”


Here is what ChatGPT responded with (response shown in italics to help make it stand out herein).
ChatGPT Response:
Here are some politicians who were born in Boston:
John F. Kennedy - John Fitzgerald Kennedy, commonly known as JFK, was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. He served as the 35th President of the United States from 1961 until his assassination in 1963.
John Kerry - John Forbes Kerry was born in Aurora, Colorado, but he grew up in the Boston area. He is a former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts and served as the U.S. Secretary of State under President Barack Obama.
Tip O'Neill - Thomas Phillip ""Tip"" O'Neill Jr. was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is part of the Greater Boston area. He served as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987.
Now, let's proceed with the verification process:
Step 1: Identify Elements to Verify
Birthplaces of the mentioned politicians
Political positions held by the mentioned politicians
Step 2: Verification Questions
Was John F. Kennedy born in Brookline, Massachusetts?
Did John Kerry grow up in the Boston area?
Was Tip O'Neill born in Cambridge, Massachusetts?
Did John F. Kennedy serve as the 35th President of the United States?
Did John Kerry serve as the U.S. Secretary of State under President Barack Obama?
Did Tip O'Neill serve as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987?
Step 3: Answer Verification Questions
Was John F. Kennedy born in Brookline, Massachusetts?
Yes, John F. Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts.
Did John Kerry grow up in the Boston area?
Yes, John Kerry grew up in the Boston area.
Was Tip O'Neill born in Cambridge, Massachusetts?
Yes, Tip O'Neill was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Did John F. Kennedy serve as the 35th President of the United States?
Yes, John F. Kennedy served as the 35th President of the United States.
Did John Kerry serve as the U.S. Secretary of State under President Barack Obama?
Yes, John Kerry served as the U.S. Secretary of State under President Barack Obama.
Did Tip O'Neill serve as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987?
Yes, Tip O'Neill served as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987.
Step 4: Adjust Initial Answer
The initial answer provided is accurate based on the verification questions and their answers. The mentioned politicians were born in the specified locations and held the mentioned political positions.
End Of The ChatGPT Response
The verification process seemed to appropriately follow the earlier stated all-in-one prompt that I had given to ChatGPT.
ChatGPT identified two elements of verification consisting of the birthplaces and whether the politicians were indeed politicians. I’ll accept that. Given that the question was once again simple in framing, the task of identifying pertinent elements was easy too. Deriving the verification questions was easy too. Answering them was easy. The result was no adjustment to the initial answer.
I want you to take a closer look at the ChatGPT response.
Do you see something untoward?
I believe so.
We have discovered something astray that is another caveat or qualm about generative AI doing verifications. You might observe that John Kerry was not born in Boston. ChatGPT admits freely that John Kerry was born in Colorado and not in Boston. The twist is that ChatGPT tells us that John Kerry grew up in Boston, which is according to ChatGPT, presumably sufficiently equivalent to being born in Boston.
I would have been more impressed if the verification process overtook the initial response and said that John Kerry wasn’t born in Boston, noting that my question had specifically stated that the politicians were to be those who were born in Boston. Unfortunately, the verification merely reinforced the assumption that growing up in Boston is the same as being born there.
Disappointing.
Eye-opening.
By the way, for those of you who think this is a finicky argument and a fine line, I realize that a cogent argument is that someone who spent the bulk of their childhood in a particular city could be loosely construed as being born there. I get that. On the other hand, my question was pretty unambiguous. I asked about politicians born in Boston. I didn’t say that I was looking for politicians that kind of were born in Boston or that you could stretch the definition of “born” into meaning having lived there during childhood.
We shall do the Boston question again, and this time do things on a stepwise prompting basis. I will walk ChatGPT through the verification process. Doing so might make a difference in contrast to using the all-in-one verification process prompt.
Let’s see.


My question to ChatGPT: “Who are some politicians who were born in Boston?”


The answer once again included John Kerry. To keep this discussion within my herein space limitations, I will cut to the chase.
My next prompt told ChatGPT that I’d like to do a verification. I provide the first step of identifying key elements for verification.


My entry to ChatGPT: “I would like you to go through a verification process about the answer that you gave. First, please identify any key elements such as facts, figures, or other notable considerations that are important and should be subject to verification. List out those identified elements.”


It is kind of interesting that this time the listed elements consisted of the same two of birthplace and political position, but also added party affiliation and timeline. This shows you that due to probabilistic and statistical variations, the responses from generative AI can vary.
I decided to tell ChatGPT to focus on the birthplaces and the political positions. I felt this was fair to do since the prior tryout had only used those two factors. You can quibble about that if you wish.


My entry to ChatGPT: “I'd like to concentrate on the birthplaces and the political positions. Make a list of the started birthplaces and political positions and show a set of questions about those elements that can serve as verification questions.”


After looking at the verification questions, which were on par with the first tryout, I told ChatGPT to go ahead and answer the verification questions.
Here is an answer that brought a smile to my face:
ChatGPT response:


“John Kerry - Born in Aurora, Colorado, with ties to Boston. Verification: John Kerry was not born in Boston; he was born in Aurora, Colorado. While he had ties to Boston later in life, he does not meet the criteria of being born in Boston.”


And, I completed the process by telling ChatGPT to adjust the initial answer based on having done the verifications.


My entry to ChatGPT: “Based on your answers to the verification questions, adjust your initial answer to my first question and show a new answer accordingly.”


The final list no longer contained John Kerry.
I suppose this illustrates that doing the stepwise prompting for the verification process can potentially produce better results. I don’t want to have you overinflate this one example. Sometimes spoon-feeding will be better, sometimes not. In my view, this was a lucky shot and based on a rather simple question and simple answers. I tried other examples with much more complex questions and complex answers, along with complex verification questions, and the result was somewhat mixed as to which path was the better determiner.
Overall, I’d still suggest that you ought to aim for the stepwise verification process if you have the time to do so and the matter warrants taking the time. I should also point out that the odds are that the stepwise verification process will be more costly in terms of computer processing time. If you are paying to use generative AI, the cost of the all-in-one verification process versus the stepwise verification process might become a factor in your decision of the best choice for you.
Conclusion
I ask that you consider trying out your own variation of the Chain-of-Verification technique.
Use various examples that are important to you. Spend some time getting comfortable with the approach. Make notes about what works and what seems stilted. Also, realize that what seems workable in one generative AI app might not be equally usable in another. If you are using several brands of generative AI apps, you’ll want to practice with each of those respectively.
A final thought for now.
Thomas H. Huxley, the famous biologist and anthropologist, said this: “The man of science has learned to believe in justification, not by faith, but by verification.”
I think that we should all embrace the essential concept of trust but verify when using generative AI. You are okay to have a somber undertone of suspicion about whatever generative AI produces. Allow yourself an on-your-toes modicum of trust, and then keep your eyes, ears, and mind highly alert to seek and avidly pursue verification.
Keep on double-checking, that’s the prudent path.

Pros and cons of AI-generated content


Artificial intelligence is growing rapidly in the tech sector and assisting with various tasks such as creating images and generating content. However, it cannot do everything.

AI-generated content is becoming popular, but many people wonder how to use it and if it truly sounds authentic.
AI is growing rapidly in the tech sector, including supply chain, food industry, chatbot, and content and image generation use cases. AI-generated images made the news when critics claimed AI art systems were stealing people's intellectual property on large models, such OpenAI's Dall-E.








OpenAI introduced a similar AI program for content known as ChatGPT. This bot serves a more general purpose and offers an open prompt for users to ask questions, give a command or ask for an observation. The bot answers both broad and specific questions. The system generated answers that professors and other educators said were extensive enough to receive a good grade. However, after further review, some sources -- such as Stack Overflow for coders and developers -- said the information was incorrect and temporarily banned answers using this system. Since there are no limits to the answers ChatGPT can give, a user was even allowed to search how to make explosives and shoplift.
Businesses are looking at AI tools to help with content creation and copywriting. The same question is being posed as to whether AI will take the place of content writers. While AI-generated content might not be suitable for all copywriting, there are some great ways to use these tools.

What is AI-generated content?
AI-generated content includes copy such as blogs, marketing materials, articles and product descriptions written by a machine. The AI content creator generates the content after a person inputs information such as keywords, phrases and topics.

AI-generated content can help speed up the writing process, and businesses are starting to take notice. Marketers might consider using AI-generated content for automating the content marketing process -- which can, at times, be time-consuming and expensive.


How does AI-generated content work?
To produce content, users enter the text format needed, along with a topic and keywords. The AI tool then searches the internet and pieces together copy fitting the requested format. Some tools also rewrite a company's existing content to add information based on web searches and editing tools. These tools can take this existing content and rework it to fit other communication formats, such as turning a blog article into a social media post or email draft.
There are free content generators available, but others charge for more in-depth content.





What are the pros of AI-generated content?
AI-generated content can be valuable in several ways. Here are some of the pros.
Efficiency and scalability
AI can create content much faster than people, which is probably the biggest benefit. An AI tool can produce an article in minutes. It would take a human writer much longer to do all the research and write it.
Multiply the quick turnaround by the number of articles, and an AI tool can produce a significant amount of content.
AI also helps with language localization for various geographic areas and can create social media, personalizing this content for various sites.
Cost-effectiveness
Hiring quality content writers typically costs a few hundred dollars per project, often depending on article length, the number of pieces and the needed technical knowledge. And this could prove to be money well spent if it results in high-quality, well-researched content.
Some AI writing tools are free, while others charge a monthly subscription rate. The pricing typically runs about $100 for tens of thousands of words.
Given these considerations, AI-generated content might be better suited for simpler content than articles needing expertise and authority.
Improved SEO
AI content generators scroll through thousands of online documents to absorb information. In viewing all these documents, generators choose keywords to improve search engine optimization (SEO). The AI tool can suggest keywords for the content writer. By using these keyword suggestions throughout an article, the content appears higher in search engine rankings if it follows the rest of the guidelines of being authoritative and is written by a person.
Help with writer's block
Writer's block is a common hurdle for many people. At times, writers might have trouble creating authoritative content for a subject they know little about.
To help overcome this hurdle, AI tools can create detailed outlines and key points to help the writer determine what should be included in the article. These suggestions from AI tools can help the user overcome writer's block and spark the ideas needed to get started.


What are the cons of AI-generated content?
There are several considerations when it comes to using AI-generated content. Some content is best written by a human writer. Here are some cons of AI-generated content.
Quality concerns and possible plagiarism
AI relies on data and algorithms for content. AI tools can cover black-and white-areas of a topic, but gray areas are more subjective and the intended tone can get lost.
Search engines might also flag content because it is similar to published materials, as the AI pulls from the same sources. The AI tools piece content together from various sites and reword them. Without adding the proper flow, this process goes against Google's ""stitching and combining content"" guidelines. Content needs to be authoritative and informative, which can be hard to do when piecing information together from various sites without proper human review.
Algorithms devalue content
Google released its helpful content update in August 2022 to punish content created for the purpose of ranking higher in search engine results.
In March 2024, Google once again rolled out an update to improve some of its content ranking systems. The update is intended to help users decide if webpages aren't useful, provide a poor user experience or seem like they prioritize keywords over being informative to the reader.
Lack of creativity and personalization
Creative content makes articles more engaging. People tend to share articles they feel a connection to, but AI does not have the emotional intelligence to create a story. Its focus is generally directed toward adding facts to an outline.
AI relies on existing web content and data to develop wording. The technology does not understand user intent for queries and still lacks the common sense of human behavior.
Human editing still required
People still need to read through AI-generated content. Although AI might save time, humans must continue to review articles for quality.
AI tools combine information from several websites into one piece. There might be some mix-ups to fix, such as product descriptions with textures and colors. This is generally because AI tools do not understand adjective meanings.
Can't generate new ideas
AI tools use existing data for content, so this means they cannot come up with fresh ideas. AI tools make it hard to come up with new content covering the latest trending ideas and topics.


Ways to use AI-generated content
AI-generated content is best used as a writing assistant instead of a way to rely strictly on the technology. Here are some ways to use AI tools for assistance with content:

Research. For writers having issues organizing a topic or coming up with ideas, AI-generated content can help them get started. Some tools give ideas about what to include for broader topics to help narrow down the research process.
Proofread current material. To make sure a drafted article is optimized, writers can run it through AI tools for a grade. The tool can also highlight keywords and phrases that should be used. AI tools can further assist with checking grammar and correcting spelling mistakes.
Write short content. AI tools can produce a lot of content in a short amount of time, so they are a great way to reduce boredom with repetitive tasks. While some communications require more of an emotional side, some short descriptions do not. Product descriptions, metatags, ad copy and social media posts are examples of short text suitable for content generators.
Translate language. For written material to appeal to all audiences, AI generators can help translate content into different languages.
Create templates. AI tools can help create emails or other templates. Some AI tools offer different types of ready-made templates for users to plug in customized information.



Example of AI-generated content
There are many AI content generators available. Here is an example of how content generation works using a program called CopyAI:

Select style of writing from the left side.
Answer topic.
Add main points.
Select tone.

A couple options pop up for text. Here is the AI-generated content from the information entered. This was the first option meant to imitate the information in this article:

AI is an amazing technology that has the potential to change our world and how we live in it. But like any new technology, there are pros and cons to AI-generated content -- and businesses need to be aware of both before deciding whether or not to use it.
First, the pros:
1) AI-generated content saves time and money for businesses by allowing them to produce more content with fewer resources.
2) It allows businesses to create highly personalized content for each customer, which leads to happier customers.
3) AI-generated content makes sure that all information is correct, which helps prevent expensive lawsuits or bad press if something goes wrong with your business's operations (e.g., if you send out an email with incorrect information).
Now, let's talk about some of the cons:
1) AI-generated content can sound unnatural (like it was written by a robot), which can make customers feel uncomfortable or distrustful of your business. It doesn't matter how much effort you put into making sure that everything is correct if the end result sounds robotic!
2) If someone finds out that they've been reading an AI-generated piece of content instead.

Much of the information included in this TechTarget article is outlined in the AI-generated content above. However, the AI content is not particularly comprehensive or conversational -- even when selecting a friendly tone. This TechTarget article goes into greater detail for explanations and provides examples. The AI-generated content seems to be more of an outline and needs additional information to flow like a human-written article.


How to detect AI-generated content
There is a larger concern with AI-generated content: students using these tools to cheat. Several professors and teachers stated that the AI-generated content on ChatGPT created convincing essays.
To help distinguish between human and AI text, OpenAI launched a new AI text classifier on Jan. 31, 2023. However, in July 2023, the company pulled the text classifier due to low accuracy. There are other online tools to help detect AI-generated content by classifying how likely it was written by a person versus AI. These resources include Originality.ai, Writing.com and Copyleaks.
OpenAI is also working on creating a watermark for longer AI-generated text as an immediate identifier.
In addition to running text through an online AI-content detector, there are a few other signs that content is AI-generated, such as the following:

Lack of typos. Human writing often has typos and contains slang terms. AI-generated content rarely has typos such as grammar mistakes or misspellings.
Overuse of ""the."" AI-generated content is based on predictive language by determining which word should be next, so it commonly uses words such as ""the,"" ""it"" or ""is"" instead of more unusual terms.
No cited sources. AI-generated text will often give facts and not cite the sources.
Shorter sentences. AI content sentence length is typically shorter because it is trying to mimic human writing but often appears choppier.
Repetition of words or phrases. If certain words or phrases are used abundantly, this could be a sign of AI-generated content because it is trying to fill space with relevant keywords.
Lack of analysis. AI can collect data but cannot analyze it. If an article feels full of facts without any insight, it might be AI-generated.

Reena SenGuptaSeptember 22 2023Jump to comments sectionPrint this pageUnlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.It is hard to convince a room full of millionaires that their business model is wrong. That was how Richard Susskind, a writer on the legal industry, summed up law firms’ resistance to change more than a quarter century ago. And most commercial law firm partners did indeed remain sceptical that technology will bring about the end of lawyers.But the release of ChatGPT-4, Open AI’s generative artificial intelligence software, which caught the headlines this year, has moved the sceptics much closer to the converts.“For the first time, we have serious disruptive technology,” explains Alastair Morrison, partner at Pinsent Masons, which has won the 2023 FT innovative law firm award for Europe.Lee Ranson, co-chief executive of Eversheds, agrees. Generative AI “is not just a tool, it is a game-changer”.More in this report on generative AI and law firmsRead about lawyers’ views on: How to overcome hurdles The effect on lawyers’ jobsThe real work involved amid the hype Research by consultancy RSGI for the FT Innovative Lawyers Europe 2023 report included asking 379 lawyers and other legal professionals about ChatGPT. More than 90 per cent had used it, and more than 90 per cent of those said generative AI would significantly affect how they deliver legal advice.Chris De Pury, head of real estate work at BCLP, estimates that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the current work in his department will eventually disappear.Similarly, managing partners are reviewing the number of trainees they will hire in 2026. “The composition of our workforce will not change all of a sudden, but generative AI will replace a lot of what lawyers do,” says Paula Gomes Freire, managing partner of Portuguese law firm Vieira de Almeida. “It is pushing us to think of a slightly different model.” For the first time, she notes, “there’s something that produces content and language on its own. That is revolutionary for lawyers — and not just another technological advance.”However, while law firms accept that generative AI implies significant change, their strategies and spending on it vary.Some law firms such as Vieira de Almeida, Allen & Overy and Cuatrecasas are racing to get ahead. Allen & Overy was one of the first to sign up to Harvey, an Open AI-backed start-up focused on the legal sector. Spanish law firm Cuatrecasas is keen to develop its own opinion on the new tech. “We don’t want to hear from others because we want to be the first to know,” says Javier Fontcuberta, managing partner. The firm formed an alliance with Chiomenti in Italy, Gide Loyrette Nouel in France and Gleiss Lutz in Germany to share their research into the use of generative AI.Others are more cautious. They point to AI’s inaccuracies and disturbing mistakes, such as “hallucinations” — fabricated information — all of which need double-checking. Generative AI “will mean fundamental changes to the law firm model”, says Jeremy Hoyland, managing partner of Simmons & Simmons, before adding “eventually”.More on FT.com: Best practice case studies Read the FT Innovative Lawyers Europe ‘Best practice case studies’, which showcase the standout innovations made for and by people working in the legal sector:Practice of lawBusiness of lawIn-houseChallenges aside, how will generative AI shape the commercial law firm?At Pinsent Masons, Morrison warns: “The firms who do not embrace the opportunity AI poses now will not see the erosion going around them until it is too late.” He likens generative AI to a giant excavator next to handheld shovels: “Big Law has been a super profitable business, using people to deliver complex legal solutions. [Now], we have a proper tool that enables the delivery of these solutions at scale.”In the long term, he believes law firms will succeed by: collaborating with big technology firms; billing by value instead of hours; training everyone in the firm to use tech; addressing organisational culture; and rewarding all the business’s professionals — not just lawyers.De Pury at BCLP says the key to success will lie in the data. “It’s not just a question of volume, it is also what data do you hold.”For firms with leading practices in a certain area, the benefits of holding extensive and proprietary data are already evident.The construction practice at Pinsent Masons, for example, created a platform last year where it collects all the data from its private adjudication — out of court — settlements on the UK construction disputes it has advised on since 2017. The result is a valuable resource to help shape legal and strategic advice to clients.RecommendedBusiness Legal LeadersEmerging AI risks require vigilance from in-house legal counselWith startling developments in technology, helped by the effects of the pandemic on work practices, all managing partners in Europe are refining their visions for the law firm business model of the future. Ranson at Eversheds predicts widespread consolidation in the UK legal market, partly driven by the need for access to bigger knowledge and data sets.Most believe the current “pyramid” shape of law firms — many junior lawyers at the bottom and fewer partners at the top — will disappear. They point, instead, to structures such that of management consultancy McKinsey, which has a lower ratio of junior consultants to partners, or the potential for developing subscription businesses around a legal sector AI engine.Wim Dejonghe, Allen & Overy senior partner, is receiving an FT special achievement award this year for creating a culture of innovation and pulling off the first elite magic circle law firm deal to merge with a big US firm. His view of the future?

Research methodology: Europe 2023FT Innovative Lawyers Europe 2023 is a ranking, report and awards scheme for lawyers based in the region. The FT and its research partner, RSGI, have devised a unique methodology to rank lawyers on innovation. Law firms and in-house legal teams were invited to make submissions.Featured entries are drawn from those law firm and in-house legal submissions. Each submission is researched and scored out of 10 for originality, leadership and impact, giving a maximum score of 30 for each published entry.Top-ranked entries in the report are shortlisted for the FT Innovative Lawyers Europe 2023 Awards. Some 551 submissions and nominations were received from 112 law firms and 87 in-house legal teams. RSGI researchers assessed and researched them through interviews with clients, senior lawyers, executives and experts between April and August 2023. FT Law Firm Index The Index (table above) provides a ranking and a holistic assessment of law firm success. Firms are ranked based on the following criteria, with a maximum score of 100: Innovation: The sum of scores for the top three submissions to the FT Innovative Lawyers Report in Europe 2023, including submissions that were not published. (Weighted score out of 60) Digital: Law firms completed a questionnaire on use of data and technology. Each of six questions was scored and benchmarked against other law firm responses. (Weighted score out of 20) People: Law firms completed a questionnaire about their human resource policies. Topics covered gender representation, diversity and inclusion, and investment in skills for lawyers and for business services people. Four questions were scored and benchmarked against other law firm responses. (Weighted score out of 10) Social responsibility: Law firms completed a questionnaire on their approach to social responsibility. Four questions covering commitment to pro bono work, social responsibility and ESG reporting were scored and benchmarked against other law firm responses. (Weighted score out of 10). Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024. All rights reserved.Reuse this content (opens in new window) CommentsJump to comments section

Challenges aside, how will generative AI shape the commercial law firm?

At Pinsent Masons, Morrison warns: “The firms who do not embrace the opportunity AI poses now will not see the erosion going around them until it is too late.” He likens generative AI to a giant excavator next to handheld shovels: “Big Law has been a super profitable business, using people to deliver complex legal solutions.

In the long term, he believes law firms will succeed by: collaborating with big technology firms; billing by value instead of hours; training everyone in the firm to use tech; addressing organisational culture; and rewarding all the business’s professionals — not just lawyers.

De Pury at BCLP says the key to success will lie in the data. “It’s not just a question of volume, it is also what data do you hold.”

I also used an AI-powered transcribing tool, which saves me countless hours a month. When inspiration ran dry or I found myself drifting off course, I put in a different prompt to get a nudge in a new direction. On publication, I might use generative AI to help write a social media post to accompany this article. (I always talk myself out of sharing my writing, so outsourcing part of that legwork is just the kick I need.) Will generative AI make the piece markedly better? Who knows. Does it make me lazy? Well, there’s a question.Plenty of UK workers, like me, are experimenting with the emerging raft of tech tools and products, whether it’s AI-based image generators such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E-2, or the likes of Google’s chatbot Bard, Scribe, and ChatGPT. Research conducted by work management platform Asana’s Work Innovation Lab found that 29 percent of the UK’s workforce uses generative AI and AI on a weekly basis, compared to 46 percent of workers in the US. However, the decision to do so in a professional context is fraught, and there’s a growing fear among employees that using AI makes them less valuable and leaves them with fewer creative competencies. The same study finds that 30 percent of workers worry they will be seen as lazy for using AI, and 21 percent say they feel like a fraud for doing so.This shame compels people to hide their use of AI. Some 34 percent are nervous to tell managers about the ways they incorporate the technology into their work, according to a study of 1,000 full-time and part-time workers in the UK by Advertising Week Europe. That goes up to 42 percent among Gen Zers and 40 percent among millennials—who, coincidentally, are most likely to want to use AI to help them with tasks. At a time when workplace surveillance is at a high and layoffs are spreading, the AI panic isn’t surprising.Trending NowMoistCr1TiKaL Answers The Web's Most Searched Questions“The speed at which AI has arrived and been taken up, combined with the breadth of what it can do, has only increased the fear,” says Neil Maiden, a professor of digital creativity at the Bayes Business School at City, University of London and director of CebAI, the National Centre for Creativity Enabled by AI.

However, people working in medicine, education, retail, and hospitality reported that their employers weren’t at all supportive of them using it, according to Advertising Week’s study.

Research conducted by work management platform Asana’s Work Innovation Lab found that 29 percent of the UK’s workforce uses generative AI and AI on a weekly basis, compared to 46 percent of workers in the US. However, the decision to do so in a professional context is fraught, and there’s a growing fear among employees that using AI makes them less valuable and leaves them with fewer creative competencies. The same study finds that 30 percent of workers worry they will be seen as lazy for using AI, and 21 percent say they feel like a fraud for doing so.
This shame compels people to hide their use of AI. Some 34 percent are nervous to tell managers about the ways they incorporate the technology into their work, according to a study of 1,000 full-time and part-time workers in the UK by Advertising Week Europe. That goes up to 42 percent among Gen Zers and 40 percent among millennials—who, coincidentally, are most likely to want to use AI to help them with tasks.

PPC trends: the role of generative AI in paid search How is generative AI transforming the work of paid search marketers? We asked three experts to give us their views.

What are the best ways to get your business out in front of the millions of users who conduct searches every day? Search marketers have been grappling with this question since the early days of search, and evolutions in the field of paid search continually present new challenges as well as offering additional tools for marketers to wield.
Generative AI has the potential to be a major new tool in search marketers’ arsenals, but determining when and how to apply it most effectively is still a challenge. For thoughts on how generative AI is shaping paid search and what it will mean for marketers, we turned to three experts: Clark Boyd, CEO and Co-Founder of Novela; Emma Welland, Co-Founder of House of Performance; and Christos Stavropoulos, Head of Product Strategy at BrightBid.
Ad copy, keyword lists, scripting, but not necessarily new ways of working just yet
“Marketing leaders are experimenting with generative AI right now to find ways to increase efficiency and improve campaign performance,” says Clark Boyd, CEO and Co-Founder of Novela, a simulation-based learning company that offers search marketing training. “However, few have found ways to integrate the tech into a new way of working yet.
“For instance, we see marketers using generative AI to create ad variations for use in A/B testing. Others are using it to develop keyword lists or automate data analysis.”

This world is just opening up within paid search.
– Emma Welland, Co-Founder at House of Performance

Indeed, industry blogs and press have been quick to point out how ChatGPT may be useful for search marketers doing PPC, such as Search Engine Land’s list of 15 strategic prompts, which starts with advice on producing viable A/B tests for responsive search ads (RSAs) and includes tips for landing page optimisation and conducting competitor research.
“This world is just opening up within paid search,” says Emma Welland, Co-Founder at House of Performance, a performance marketing agency. Other than a benefit to ad copy production, where generative AI can offer headline and description suggestions for “even the most niche areas”, Welland points to scripts as a particularly valuable use case. “Generative AI provides us with the opportunity to leverage things like scripts without having the coding experience.”
She notes that scripts have “fallen out of favour in recent times”, but that the rise of automation in PPC along with generative AI have laid the groundwork for a revival. “The move to automation has provided an opportunity for successful search marketers to use scripts to interrogate data and understand where ads are appearing. Marketers that are not using scripts are quickly falling behind.”

So far, most leaders are finding that this technology doesn’t remove the need for human input…
– Clark Boyd, CEO and Co-Founder at Novela

Boyd cautions that, “So far, most leaders are finding that this technology doesn’t remove the need for human input – rather, it displaces it. Left to its own devices, so to speak, generative AI will produce lots of quite good content. Yet that is rarely good enough for a brand. And of course, it will sometimes create content that fails to clear even that low bar.”
In order to achieve “reliably excellent output” with generative AI, he notes that both human feedback and high-quality data inputs are required. However, “not all marketers are trained to work in this way. In truth, the marketing industry requires reskilling to take advantage of AI, not just upskilling.”
Paid Search Best Practice Guide

Generative AI as all-purpose assistant
Christos Stavropoulos is Head of Product Strategy at BrightBid, an adtech company that uses AI for search ad optimisation. He agrees that the quality of training data and the way that the AI is trained will define a company’s success with generative AI.
“If you don’t train [generative AI] well, it will give you very generic, not very accurate responses. But if you have the ability to train the tool to be more accurate in what you as a company want to say, then it can become quite powerful.”

I would say that each and every company needs to see, themselves, how this tool could help them amplify [their work].
– Christos Stavropoulos, Head of Product Strategy at BrightBid

Ultimately, Stavropoulos believes that any organisation can benefit from using generative AI for paid search, but not necessarily in a set way. “It could be a baseline [for ad copy], but it could also be an addition … you [might] have three to five tasks within a project, and you can use it as an assistant to accelerate the speed of some tasks,” he says.
“I would say that each and every company needs to see, themselves, how this tool could help them amplify [their work].”
As Google rolls out more features, generative AI is set to grow, even if the hype is subsiding
Despite a recent increase in scepticism towards generative AI that has followed on the heels of the hype prompted by ChatGPT’s release, Stavropoulos doesn’t believe that generative AI is going anywhere. “The one thing that is for sure is that AI is here,” he says.
“The hype from the last six months is blowing over a little bit, but that happens with all things. It will start trending upwards again once we get more and more accurate models to perform the job we asked them to do. So, I don’t think it will disappear.”

The release of new features from Google and Bing will force a more radical rethink of how campaigns are created, delivered, and measured.
– Clark Boyd

Search marketers are facing more and more decisions about whether and how to use generative AI as Google rolls out feature after feature incorporating it – from creating Google Ads assets via AI-driven chat to generating images and text for Performance Max campaigns.
“The release of new features from Google and Bing will force a more radical rethink of how campaigns are created, delivered, and measured,” predicts Novela’s Clark Boyd. “These features will be central to Shopping first of all, where there is a huge amount of input data available and rapid interactions with lots of users.
“The challenge for marketers will be keeping up with the pace of change and interpreting their campaign performance effectively.”

Whether you view it as a threat or an opportunity, AI is here to stay. In the legal realm, AI technology has begun transforming the work environment and the lives of lawyers. Let’s explore how law firms are using AI to take on more business. Jump to:  How many law firms are using AI?  Why is AI good for law firms?  How can AI be used to generate more business for law firms?  Are law firms using AI to take on more business? How many law firms are using AI? Virtually all law firms utilize some form of artificial intelligence. AI is baked into legal platforms like Westlaw and Practical Law, which have been around for years. What’s new is the use of generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that creates, or “generates,” content such as text, graphics, and documents. There are significantly fewer firms actively using this type of AI, at least for now. According to a 2023 Thomson Reuters Institute report titled, ChatGPT and Generative AI within Law Firms, “just 3% of respondents said they are already using generative AI or ChatGPT for law firm operations, and an additional 2% said they are actively planning for its use. About one-third of respondents (34%) are still in the consideration phase for generative AI and ChatGPT, while 60% answered they have no current plans for generative AI use in firm operations.”  Why is AI good for law firms? EfficiencyNo surprise, the biggest advantage of AI in a law firm is speed. In a world that counts every 6-minute increment, legal work that would once take hours or days can be done in seconds with AI. Time-consuming, but critical tasks such as research, document drafting and review, and data entry can now be done in a fraction of the time of pre-artificial intelligence. By automating routine tasks, you can dedicate more time to higher-level, strategic work that directly serves your clients. Deeper InsightsBetter efficiency means you can dig deeper. AI can search its digital data warehouse to provide hard-to-find information and predict legal outcomes. Products like Practical Law’s Dynamic Tool Set with CoCounsel can help provide insight faster with visualization tools and data-driven charts so you can easily interpret information and then share it with clients, colleagues, and outside counsel.A review of Practical Law Dynamic Tool Set with CoCounselSee why this CEO & Senior Counsel believes Practical Law is the best tool for lawyers and legal departments on the market today.Read articleConsistent work productLegal work is complex. AI tools can help you develop best practices across your firm with predictive workflows to guide your teams.  How can AI be used to generate more business for law firms? CapacityThe simple math is that when AI takes routine tasks off your plate, you have more time for business development. As important as it is, finding new clients often takes a back seat to serving the current ones. Dedicating time to both will help build your practice. Responsiveness Most people seeking legal help need it now. And they often choose the law firm that responds the fastest. By implementing an AI chatbot on your website, you can respond immediately to common client queries and help generate new business leads by capturing visitor information. It can also analyze client data to suggest personalized follow-up or cross-selling other legal services. Marketing and content generation“AI can generate content through machine learning algorithms that analyze and learn from vast datasets of existing text, images, or other media, allowing it to generate new content based on patterns and information it has acquired.” AI wrote the previous sentence based on a directed prompt. While it’s not exactly poetic, it could be edited into understandable, engaging content. The same can work for lawyers. AI can assist in generating high-quality legal content for blogs, newsletters, social media, or podcasts that you can review, edit, and publish. That can help establish you as a thought leader and attract new clients. Market analysis and competitive intelligenceIf you’re looking to expand your practice, AI can analyze market trends and the competitive landscape to identify new practice areas or niches. Products like What’s Market provide a database of summaries for publicly filed deals that allows you to analyze and compare terms or features. You can see where new opportunities lie ahead.  Are law firms using AI to take on more business? Most attorneys are approaching it carefully, as is part of their nature to protect their clients. You shouldn’t let AI generate any work product without a robust review. But once you try it, notes Charlotte Woolven-Brown, a partner at U.K. law firm Sternberg Reed, the results are convincing. It becomes part of the daily routine. “People will get more in tune with what’s happening and how quickly this technology is developing. I couldn’t go back. I use it every day.”  Stay up-to-date on updates, insights and all things AI @ Thomson Reuters. Sign up for our newsletter.

            Companies are struggling to deal with the rapid rise of generative AI, with some rushing to embrace the technology as workflow tools for employees while others shun it – at least for now. 
    

            As generative artificial intelligence – the technology that underpins ChatGPT and similar tools – seeps into seemingly every corner of the internet, large corporations are grappling with whether the increased efficiency it offers outweighs possible copyright and security risks. Some companies are enacting internal bans on generative AI tools as they work to better understand the technology, and others have already begun to introduce the trendy tech to employees in their own ways.
    

        Banning AI? Embracing AI? Or bracing for AI?


            Many prominent companies have entirely blocked internal ChatGPT use, including JPMorgan Chase, Northrup Grumman, Apple, Verizon, Spotify and Accenture, according to AI content detector Originality.AI, with several citing privacy and security concerns. Business leaders have also expressed worries about employees dropping proprietary information into ChatGPT and having that sensitive information potentially emerge as an output by the tool elsewhere.

            When users input information into these tools, “[y]ou don’t know how it’s then going to be used,” Mark McCreary, the co-chair of the privacy and data security practice at law firm Fox Rothschild LLP, told CNN in March. “That raises particularly high concerns for companies. As more and more employees casually adopt these tools to help with work emails or meeting notes, McCreary said, “I think the opportunity for company trade secrets to get dropped into these different various AI’s is just going to increase.”
    

            But the corporate hesitancy to welcome generative AI could be temporary.
    

            “Companies that are on the list of banning generative AI also have working groups internally that are exploring the usage of AI,” Jonathan Gillham, CEO of Originality.AI, told CNN, highlighting how companies in more risk-averse industries have been quicker to take action against the tech while figuring out the best approach for responsible usage. “Giving all of their staff access to ChatGPT and saying ‘have fun’ is too much of an uncontrolled risk for them to take, but it doesn’t mean that they’re not saying, ‘holy crap, look at the 10x, 100x efficiency that we can lock when we find out how to do this in a way that makes all the stakeholders happy” in departments such as legal, finance and accounting. 
    

            Among media companies that produce news, Insider editor-in-chief Nicholas Carlson has encouraged reporters to find ways to use AI in the newsroom. “A tsunami is coming,” he said in April. “We can either ride it or get wiped out by it. But it’s going to be really fun to ride it, and it’s going to make us faster and better.” The organization discouraged staff from putting source details and other sensitive information into ChatGPT. Newspaper chain Gannett paused the use of an artificial intelligence tool to write high school sports stories after the technology called LedeAI made several mistakes in sports stories published in The Columbus Dispatch newspaper in August. 
    

            Of the companies currently banning ChatGPT, some are discussing future usage once security concerns are addressed. UBS estimated that ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after its launch. 
    

            That rapid growth initially left large companies scrambling to find ways to integrate it responsibly. That process is slow for large companies. Meanwhile, website visits to ChatGPT dropped for the third month in a row in August, creating pressure for large tech companies to sustain popular interest in the tools and to find new enterprise applications and revenue models for generative AI products. 
    

            “We at JPMorgan Chase will not roll out genAI until we can mitigate all of the risks,” Larry Feinsmith, JPM’s head of global tech strategy, innovation, and partnerships said at the Databricks Data + AI Summit in June. “We’re excited, we’re working through those risks as we speak, but we won’t roll it out until we can do this in an entirely responsible manner, and it’s going to take time.” Northrop Grumman said it doesn’t allow internal data on external platforms “until those tools are fully vetted,” according to a March report from the Wall Street Journal. Verizon also told employees in a public address in February that ChatGPT is banned “[a]s it currently stands” due to security risks but that the company wants to “safely embrace emerging technology.”
    

        Companies creating custom AI tools


            “They’re not just waiting to sort things out. I think they’re actively working on integrating AI into their business processes separately, but they’re just doing so in a way that doesn’t compromise their information,” Vern Glaser, Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise at the University of Alberta, told CNN. “What you’ll see with a lot of the companies that will be using AI strategies, particularly those who have their own unique content, they’re going to end up creating their custom version of generative AI.”

            Several companies – and even ChatGPT itself – seem to have already found their own answers to the corporate world’s genAI security dilemma.
    

            Walmart introduced an internal “My Assistant” tool for 50,000 corporate employees that helps with repetitive tasks and creative ideas, according to an August LinkedIn post from Cheryl Ainoa, Walmart’s EVP of New Businesses and Emerging Technologies, and Donna Morris, Chief People Officer.

        OpenAI and Microsoft launch ‘enterprise’ AI tools 


            The launch of ChatGPT Enterprise may also help quell some fears. The new version of OpenAI’s new tool, announced in August, is specifically for businesses, promising to provide “enterprise-grade security and privacy” combined with “the most powerful version of ChatGPT yet” for businesses looking to jump on the generative AI bandwagon, according to a company blog post.


            The highly-anticipated announcement from OpenAI comes as the company says employees from over 80% of Fortune 500 companies have already begun using ChatGPT since it launched publicly late last year, according to its analysis of accounts associated with corporate email domains. 
    

            In response to the concerns raised by many companies over security, about employees dropping proprietary information into ChatGPT and having that sensitive information potentially emerge as an output by the tool elsewhere, OpenAI’s announcement blog post for ChatGPT Enterprise states that it does “not train on your business data or conversations, and our models don’t learn from your usage.”
    

            In July, Microsoft unveiled a business-specific version of its AI-powered Bing tool, dubbed Bing Chat Enterprise, and promised much of the same security assurances that ChatGPT Enterprise is now touting – namely, that users’ chat data will not be used to train AI models.
    

            It is still unclear whether the new tools will be enough to convince corporate America that it is time to fully embrace generative AI, though experts agree the tech’s inevitable entry into the workplace will take time and strategy. 
    

            “I don’t think it’s that companies are against AI and against machine learning, per se. I think most companies are going to be trying to use this type of technology, but they have to be careful with it because of the impacts on intellectual property,” Glaser said.

As generative artificial intelligence – the technology that underpins ChatGPT and similar tools – seeps into seemingly every corner of the internet, large corporations are grappling with whether the increased efficiency it offers outweighs possible copyright and security risks. Some companies are enacting internal bans on generative AI tools as they work to better understand the technology, and others have already begun to introduce the trendy tech to employees in their own ways. Banning AI? Embracing AI? Or bracing for AI? Many prominent companies have entirely blocked internal ChatGPT use, including JPMorgan Chase, Northrup Grumman, Apple, Verizon, Spotify and Accenture, according to AI content detector Originality.AI, with several citing privacy and security concerns. Business leaders have also expressed worries about employees dropping proprietary information into ChatGPT and having that sensitive information potentially emerge as an output by the tool elsewhere.  When users input information into these tools, “[y]ou don’t know how it’s then going to be used,” Mark McCreary, the co-chair of the privacy and data security practice at law firm Fox Rothschild LLP, told CNN in March. “That raises particularly high concerns for companies. As more and more employees casually adopt these tools to help with work emails or meeting notes, McCreary said, “I think the opportunity for company trade secrets to get dropped into these different various AI’s is just going to increase.” But the corporate hesitancy to welcome generative AI could be temporary. “Companies that are on the list of banning generative AI also have working groups internally that are exploring the usage of AI,” Jonathan Gillham, CEO of Originality.AI, told CNN, highlighting how companies in more risk-averse industries have been quicker to take action against the tech while figuring out the best approach for responsible usage. “Giving all of their staff access to ChatGPT and saying ‘have fun’ is too much of an uncontrolled risk for them to take, but it doesn’t mean that they’re not saying, ‘holy crap, look at the 10x, 100x efficiency that we can lock when we find out how to do this in a way that makes all the stakeholders happy” in departments such as legal, finance and accounting.  Among media companies that produce news, Insider editor-in-chief Nicholas Carlson has encouraged reporters to find ways to use AI in the newsroom. “A tsunami is coming,” he said in April. “We can either ride it or get wiped out by it. But it’s going to be really fun to ride it, and it’s going to make us faster and better.” The organization discouraged staff from putting source details and other sensitive information into ChatGPT. Newspaper chain Gannett paused the use of an artificial intelligence tool to write high school sports stories after the technology called LedeAI made several mistakes in sports stories published in The Columbus Dispatch newspaper in August.  Of the companies currently banning ChatGPT, some are discussing future usage once security concerns are addressed. UBS estimated that ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after its launch.  That rapid growth initially left large companies scrambling to find ways to integrate it responsibly. That process is slow for large companies. Meanwhile, website visits to ChatGPT dropped for the third month in a row in August, creating pressure for large tech companies to sustain popular interest in the tools and to find new enterprise applications and revenue models for generative AI products.  “We at JPMorgan Chase will not roll out genAI until we can mitigate all of the risks,” Larry Feinsmith, JPM’s head of global tech strategy, innovation, and partnerships said at the Databricks Data + AI Summit in June. “We’re excited, we’re working through those risks as we speak, but we won’t roll it out until we can do this in an entirely responsible manner, and it’s going to take time.” Northrop Grumman said it doesn’t allow internal data on external platforms “until those tools are fully vetted,” according to a March report from the Wall Street Journal. Verizon also told employees in a public address in February that ChatGPT is banned “[a]s it currently stands” due to security risks but that the company wants to “safely embrace emerging technology.” Companies creating custom AI tools “They’re not just waiting to sort things out. I think they’re actively working on integrating AI into their business processes separately, but they’re just doing so in a way that doesn’t compromise their information,” Vern Glaser, Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise at the University of Alberta, told CNN. “What you’ll see with a lot of the companies that will be using AI strategies, particularly those who have their own unique content, they’re going to end up creating their custom version of generative AI.” Several companies – and even ChatGPT itself – seem to have already found their own answers to the corporate world’s genAI security dilemma. Walmart introduced an internal “My Assistant” tool for 50,000 corporate employees that helps with repetitive tasks and creative ideas, according to an August LinkedIn post from Cheryl Ainoa, Walmart’s EVP of New Businesses and Emerging Technologies, and Donna Morris, Chief People Officer. The tool is intended to boost productivity and eventually help with new worker orientation, according to the post.  Consulting giants McKinsey, PwC and EY are also welcoming genAI through internal, private methods. PwC announced a “Generative AI factory” and launched its own “ChatPwC”  tool in August powered by OpenAI tech to help employees with tax questions and regulations as part of a $1 billion investment for AI capability scaling.

What is an AI prompt engineer?
An artificial intelligence (AI) prompt engineer is an expert in creating text-based prompts or cues that can be interpreted and understood by large language models and generative AI tools. In contrast to traditional computer engineers who write code, prompt engineers use written language to evaluate AI systems for idiosyncrasies.
These professionals are also tasked with training and fine-tuning emerging AI tools, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, Dall-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to deliver precise and relevant responses to people's questions.
The questions posed by users to AI models are known as prompts.





What does an AI prompt engineer do?
AI prompt engineers serve as intermediaries between machine learning (ML) models and the humans who query them. The job of an AI prompt engineer is to develop a set of inputs and train the models to produce the best and desired outputs back to the user. As such, the role involves writing text-based prompts and feeding them into the back end of AI tools to enable them to perform tasks, such as writing an essay, generating a blog post or creating a sales email with the proper tone and information.
Because AI systems lack intuition, they're dependent on human input to understand human language and questions to produce effective prompts.



There are several differences between AI and human intelligence.







The main elements of AI prompts
Well-crafted prompts play a pivotal role in enabling the AI model to grasp the user's intention and context, ultimately resulting in responses that are both accurate and pertinent.

An AI prompt is typically composed of the following four elements:
1. Instruction. This is a simple question with a set of instructions on how the AI model should answer the question.
Example: Provide me with some easy low-carb recipes that take less than 15 minutes to prep and also make a list of ingredients needed to make them. 
This prompt gives precise instructions on the type of recipes needed, the time required for preparation and the ingredients required to cook them.



Prompt engineering often requires specific and clear requests to receive the desired output.





2. Context. Context provides the AI model with essential background information, enabling it to produce relevant content. Without adequate context, responses can become generic or irrelevant.
Example: What are some green technologies that are used in transportation?
This prompt uses the context of ""used in transportation"" while posing the question regarding green technologies, which helps the model focus on answers that are specifically connected to vehicle-related green technologies.
3. Input data. This includes adding some input along with an instruction.
Example: Create a short biography of Albert Einstein (14 March 1879-18 April 1955), a famous physicist and scientist who created the theory of relativity, which establishes that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. He won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect. 
This prompt provides the AI model with some relevant information about Einstein and then instructs it to create a short biography of him.
4. Examples. Examples can also be fed into an AI model to receive a specific output about the examples provided.
Example: Create a music playlist based on the following songs: 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen, 'Hotel California' by Eagles and 'Hey Jude' by The Beatles. The playlist should have a classic rock vibe and include similar iconic songs that evoke a sense of nostalgia and timeless appeal. Please provide at least 10 songs for the playlist.
This prompt guides the AI model to generate a playlist that aligns with the provided song examples and captures the desired classic rock feel.

Skills and requirements for AI prompt engineers
To successfully build and optimize prompts for AI learning models, an AI prompt engineer should have a combination of technical, linguistic and analytical skills.
Key skills required to become an AI prompt engineer include the following:

Understanding of AI, ML and NLP. To work with AI systems, an AI prompt engineer must be familiar with machine learning concepts, algorithms and model structures. Making effective prompts also requires a mastery of natural language processing (NLP) principles, syntax, semantics and language structure.
Programming skills. The primary programming language for NLP and AI tasks is Python. Therefore, a fundamental knowledge of Python and other programming languages is useful for tasks involving script development, model integration and data manipulation.
Communication skills. Because AI prompt engineers frequently engage and collaborate with other teams and communicate with AI systems, they must have strong written and verbal communication skills to effectively work with stakeholders, explain critical requirements and comprehend project goals.
Educational background. Although a background in AI or IT-related fields isn't always required, having a degree in computer science, data science or a related discipline can help. Since this profession focuses on the linguistic and cognitive aspects of AI, prompt engineers can come from diverse backgrounds, such as communications and cognitive psychology. Moreover, they can enhance their knowledge and stay current with the latest AI trends and developments by using online tutorials and self-study resources, including NLP frameworks and libraries, such as Natural Language Toolkit, SpaCy and transformers.
Experience experimenting with pre-trained ChatGPT models. Those aspiring to enter the field of prompt engineering should consider experimenting and testing with pre-trained AI chatbot models, such as GPT-3 or GPT-4. They can conduct experiments with various prompts to observe the text generation capabilities and constraints of the models, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of ChatGPT's behavior and optimizing prompts through hands-on practice.



What is the salary range for AI prompt engineers?
Recognized by the World Economic Forum as one of the top jobs of the future, a career in AI prompt engineering can be fruitful.
The salary range for AI prompt engineers can vary significantly. Various sources mention salaries ranging from $175,000 to over $300,000. However, these figures are based on specific job listings and might not represent the entire range of salaries in the field.
Additionally, salaries can vary based on factors such as geographical location, experience and the organization or industry hiring for the role.
Prompt engineering and fine-tuning are both methods for maximizing AI output. Differentiate between these two approaches and explore the unique model training requirements associated with each method.

Ten years ago, two experts in AI from the Oxford Martin School predicted that almost half of jobs were at risk of automation. In a new upcoming study, Professors Carl-Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne now say that while Generative AI has increased the scope of automation further, it will also make many jobs easier to do for people with lower skills.

In their paper ‘Generative AI and the Future of Work: A Reappraisal’, they also found:
remote jobs are more likely to be automated, while AI will increase the value of in-person communication skills;AI hallucinations (when an AI confidently yet unwittingly generates false information) will continue to be a problem, so firms will mostly keep a human in the loop;Generative AI is less likely to be deployed in high-stakes contexts when mistakes are likely to be costly or irreversible; andwhile creative jobs are less prone to automation, creative professionals might face more competition and lower wages as generative AI makes content creation easier. The researchers provide a reassessment of the division of labour between humans and computers in the age of Generative AI and the impact of the technology on the future of work.
They argue that whilst there have been significant advances in AI in recent years, particularly with the growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT4, significant bottlenecks remain in the deployment of Generative AI technologies that will prevent the complete replacement of humans in the workplace.
As Professor Carl-Benedikt Frey, Director of the Future of Work Programme at the Oxford Martin School and Dieter Schwarz Professor of AI & Work at the Oxford Internet Institute, explains:
‘Ten years on from our paper on “The Future of Employment”, we find that key bottlenecks to the automation of social tasks persist. In-person interactions remain valuable, and such real-life interactions cannot be readily substituted by Large Language Models.
‘As a general rule, it now looks like AI may be able to replace human labour in many virtual settings, meaning that if a task can be done remotely, it can also be potentially automated. Also we find that the more transactional a relationship becomes, the more prone it is to automation. But without major leaps, longstanding relationships – benefitting from in-person interaction – will remain in the realms of humans.’
Looking specifically at the creative industries, the study finds that whilst generative AI LLMs such as GPT4 can help turn a ‘poor’ writer into an ‘average’ writer, the algorithm is typically good at generating new combination of existing ideas, rather than making conceptual leaps. The authors also report that the deployment of Generative AI in creative work will focus on existing product lines rather than creating new works and won’t be game-changing for creativity.
The study considered the implications of Generative AI on the future of work, particularly in those situations when AI algorithms interact with the physical world. The experts find that Generative AI in its current form is less likely to be deployed in higher-stakes contexts like driving than lower-stakes activities.
As co-author Professor Michael A Osborne, Associate Professor of Machine Learning and Director of the Oxford Martin AI Governance Initiative, explains:
‘A key bottleneck to the automation of perception and mobility tasks, particularly in the physical world, is that we can’t accept mistakes. Yet foundation models based on deep neural networks, whose decisions we cannot explain, have the capacity to create plenty of mistakes.
‘For now, deployment of generative AI will be confined to lower stakes activities like customer service or warehouse automation where engineers can redesign and simplify the environment to enable automation.’
Prof. Frey concludes:
‘AI will continue to surprise us, and many jobs may be automated. However, in the absence of major breakthroughs, we also expect the bottlenecks we outline in our 2013 paper to continue to constrain our automation possibilities for the foreseeable future.’
The full paper, ‘Generative AI and the Future of Work: A Reappraisal’, is set to be published in the Brown Journal of World Affairs in January 2024.

What is LangChain?
LangChain is an open source framework that lets software developers working with artificial intelligence (AI) and its machine learning subset combine large language models with other external components to develop LLM-powered applications. The goal of LangChain is to link powerful LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to an array of external data sources to create and reap the benefits of natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Developers, software engineers and data scientists with experience in the Python, JavaScript or TypeScript programming languages can make use of LangChain's packages offered in those languages. LangChain was launched as an open source project by co-founders Harrison Chase and Ankush Gola in 2022; the initial version was released that same year.


Why is LangChain important?
LangChain is a framework that simplifies the process of creating generative AI application interfaces. Developers working on these types of interfaces use various tools to create advanced NLP apps; LangChain streamlines this process. For example, LLMs have to access large volumes of big data, so LangChain organizes these large quantities of data so that they can be accessed with ease.
In addition, GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models are generally trained on data up to their release to the public. For instance, ChatGPT was released to the public near the end of 2022, but its knowledge base was limited to data from 2021 and before. LangChain can connect AI models to data sources to give them knowledge of recent data without limitations.

What are the features of LangChain?
LangChain is made up of the following modules that ensure the multiple components needed to make an effective NLP app can run smoothly:

Model interaction. Also called model I/O, this module lets LangChain interact with any language model and perform tasks such as managing inputs to the model and extracting information from its outputs.
Data connection and retrieval. Data that LLMs access can be transformed, stored in databases and retrieved from those databases through queries with this module.
Chains. When using LangChain to build more complex apps, other components or even more than one LLM might be required. This module links multiple LLMs with other components or LLMs. This is referred to as an LLM chain.
Agents. The agent module lets LLMs decide the best steps or actions to take to solve problems. It does so by orchestrating a series of complex commands to LLMs and other tools to get them to respond to specific requests.
Memory. The memory module helps an LLM remember the context of its interactions with users. Both short-term memory and long-term memory can be added to a model, depending on the specific use.



What are the integrations of LangChain?
LangChain typically builds applications using integrations with LLM providers and external sources where data can be found and stored. For example, LangChain can build chatbots or question-answering systems by integrating an LLM -- such as those from Hugging Face, Cohere and OpenAI -- with data sources or stores such as Apify Actors, Google Search and Wikipedia. This enables an app to take user-input text, process it and retrieve the best answers from any of these sources. In this sense, LangChain integrations make use of the most up-to-date NLP technology to build effective apps.
Other potential integrations include cloud storage platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, as well as vector databases. A vector database can store large volumes of high-dimensional data -- such as videos, images and long-form text -- as mathematical representations that make it easier for an application to query and search for those data elements. Pinecone is an example vector database that can be integrated with LangChain.



LangChain augments existing large language models so that they are equipped to handle user queries and prompts.







How to create prompts in LangChain
Prompts serve as input to the LLM that instructs it to return a response, which is often an answer to a query. This response is also referred to as an output. A prompt must be designed and executed correctly to increase the likelihood of a well-written and accurate response from a language model. That is why prompt engineering is an emerging science that has received more attention in recent years.
Prompts can be generated easily in LangChain implementations using a prompt template, which will be used as instructions for the underlying LLM. Prompt templates can vary in specificity. They can be designed to pose simple questions to a language model. They can also be used to provide a set of explicit instructions to a language model with enough detail and examples to retrieve a high-quality response.
With Python programming, LangChain has a premade prompt template that takes the form of structured text. The following steps are required to use this:

Installing Python. A recent version of Python must be installed. Once the Python shell terminal is open, enter the following command to install just the bare minimum requirements of LangChain for the sake of this example.

pip install langchain

Adding integrations. LangChain typically requires at least one integration. OpenAI is a prime example. To use OpenAI's LLM application programming interfaces, a developer must create an account on the OpenAI website and retrieve the API access key. Then, using the following code snippet, install OpenAI's Python package and enter the key for access to the APIs.

pip install openaifrom langchain.llms import OpenAIllm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=""..."")

Importing the prompt template. Once these basic steps are complete, LangChain's prompt template method must then be imported. The code snippet shown below does this.

from langchain import PromptTemplateprompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(    ""Tell me an {adjective} fact about {content}."")prompt_template.format(adjective=""interesting"", content=""zebras"")""Tell me an interesting fact about zebras.""
In this scenario, the language model would be expected to take the two input variables -- the adjective and the content -- and produce a fascinating fact about zebras as its output.


How to develop applications in LangChain
LangChain is built to develop apps powered by language model functionality. There are different ways to do this, but the process typically entails some key steps:

Define the application. An application developer must first define a specific use case for the application. This also means determining its scope, including requirements such as any needed integrations, components and LLMs.
Build functionality. Developers use prompts to build the functionality or logic of the intended app.
Customize functionality. LangChain lets developers modify its code to create customized functionality that meets the needs of the use case and shapes the application's behavior.
Fine-tuning LLMs. It's important to choose the appropriate LLM for the job and also to fine-tune it to adhere to the needs of the use case.
Data cleansing. Using data cleansing techniques ensures clean and accurate data sets. Also, security measures should be implemented to protect sensitive data.
Testing. Regularly testing LangChain apps ensures they continue to run smoothly.

Examples and use cases for LangChain
The LLM-based applications LangChain is capable of building can be applied to multiple advanced use cases within various industries and vertical markets, such as the following:

Customer service chatbots. The most obvious use case would be customer support chatbots. LangChain enables chat applications that are advanced enough to handle complex questions and even transactions from users. These applications are able to understand and maintain a user's context throughout a conversation in the same way ChatGPT can. AI is already being widely used to enhance customer experience and service.
Coding assistants. It's possible to build coding assistants with the help of LangChain. Using LangChain and OpenAI's API, developers can create a tool to assist those in the tech sector with enhancing their coding skills and improving productivity.
Healthcare. AI has made its way into healthcare in several ways. LLM-centric LangChain applications are helping doctors make diagnoses. They're also automating rote, repetitive administrative tasks, such as scheduling patient appointments, enabling healthcare workers to focus on more important work.
Marketing and e-commerce. Businesses use e-commerce platforms with LLM functionality to better engage customers and expand their customer base. An application that can understand consumer purchasing patterns and product descriptions can generate product recommendations and compelling descriptions for potential customers.

Reaping the benefits of NLP is a key of why LangChain is important. For a more in-depth understanding of NLP, there are two important subtopics to start with: natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG). The goal of NLU is to process a user's intended meaning, while the goal of NLG is to explain an AI system's structured data in human-readable languages for humans to comprehend.

Published: 21 Sep 2023


 
Generative AI is a foundational technology that is already having an effect across enterprises. In the early days, the technology focused on creating fake humans and automating image creation processes. However, the advent of ChatGPT demonstrated that LLMs often exceeded the capabilities of previous natural language processing approaches that were slowly being adopted across the enterprise.







This enthusiasm was further buoyed by consumers' massive uptake of ChatGPT, which has experienced the fastest adoption of any application to date. But the power of these LLMs isn't limited to fancy chatbots that are better at sounding like real humans. The industry as a whole is starting to acknowledge that LLMs can also serve as universal translators across different domains to generate code, understand complex data sets and simplify user experiences across roles and for customers.
""Generative AI capabilities, such as prompt engineering and adaptive responses, are what set it apart from previous AI models we have seen,"" said Bharath Thota, partner in the advanced analytics practice at global strategy and management consulting firm Kearney. ""With ChatGPT being introduced to the general public, we have seen a shift in the way that people now understand and interact with AI.""
That said, the new technology comes with various challenges, such as a propensity to hallucinate, requiring guardrails and vetting by domain experts. It also introduces new ethical challenges around the use of responsible AI. Left unchecked, generative AI could also exacerbate existing issues with bias, privacy, security and public opinion.

Here are some of the different ways generative AI will change the enterprise in terms of capabilities, enterprise workflows, use cases and ethics.

Future of generative AI capabilities
Generative AI will enable the following enterprise capabilities.
The rise of self-teaching models
One of the attractions of LLMs was that they could discover patterns on vast unlabeled data sets on their own, at least as a starting point. The industry is waking up to the requirements for vetting and refining data or fine-tuning models for best results. Rex Chekal, principal product designer at software development consultancy TXI, expects innovations in smaller self-teaching models that compete with large data-hungry models, like GPT-4. One early example is Orca from Microsoft, which imitates the reasoning processes of larger models using progressive learning and teaching assistance to overcome capacity gaps. ""For CIOs, using [LLMs] will be like hiring an all-star employee who continuously improves and is transparent about how they work,"" Chekal said.
Accessibility
Innovations in LLMs make it easier to customize information and experiences for a wide range of employees. ""Generative AI has enabled all employees -- and not just technology and IT ones -- to access data and technology in an unprecedented way,"" said Benjamin Rehberg, managing director, senior partner, and global lead of tech and digital offerings at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). As a result, using AI tools without code or little code is increasingly becoming the new reality.
General to specialized models
The first wave of generative AI unleashed new models that were proficient across many tasks but suffered significant problems in particular domains. As generative AI moves into specific industries and fields, it will drive the development of models fine-tuned for particular purposes, predicted Anil Vijayan, partner at Everest Group. For example, banking, insurance and HR models will have a better ability to speak the languages of these narrower fields.
Applications built on foundational generative AI models
Vijayan also expects to see a proliferation of apps built on top of LLMs or conditioned LLMs to solve specific needs. Early examples include web navigation concierges and code development assistants. Early growth will start in B2C contexts. B2B and business-to-enterprise applications will see a spurt once risks are mitigated.
Rise of open source LLMs
The first crop of LLMs from OpenAI and others were relatively proprietary. More open models, such as Meta AI's Llama 2, provide viable alternatives that increase transparency, customization and cost-effectiveness. This trend should continue, according to Samuel Hamway, research analyst at Nucleus Research. For CIOs, this will mean more control over data and AI operations, but it will also require increased expertise in model management, maintenance, governance and hardware infrastructure.
LLM plugin ecosystems for augmented capabilities
Generative AI vendors, like OpenAI, are starting to support plugins that can augment the core capabilities of LLMs to become more task-specific. ""This task grounding makes LLMs more capable for targeted tasks and useful across different verticals,"" Hamway said. These plugin ecosystems also simplify the integration of AI into existing workflows and streamline the deployment of AI-based offerings.
Improved search
A new crop of enterprise search tools uses LLMs to enhance access to relevant data. One key innovation will be improvements in vector databases that stage data that has been transformed into an intermediate format more accessible to LLMs. Hamway said enterprise search initiatives will be required to consider data retrieval mechanisms as a core competency to make data more actionable and insights timelier. CIOs should also consider how a unified data architecture could improve integration with LLM-powered search capabilities.


Future of generative AI in the enterprise
Here are nine specific ways generative AI will affect the enterprise:

Upskilling. The rush to take advantage of generative AI will likely increase the pace of upskilling efforts. ""AI upskilling paves the way for building an enterprise that fully understands how to use generative AI and the benefits the technology brings to the company,"" said Scott Likens, global AI and innovation technology leader at global consultancy PwC. He expects to see far more companies investing in training and upskilling for current employees in the future, especially in generative AI usage.
Hybrid architectures. Likens also observed that generative AI is changing at a rate he has rarely seen. The increased pace of innovation in open source software and platforms from big tech companies means enterprises need to rethink how they test and scale these technologies. This also increases the use of hybrid architectures that are changing more rapidly than other digital transformations he has seen. These new approaches can shorten the time to value, but it's also important to design flexibility into new offerings.
Changing the nature of expertise. Generative AI is automating an increasing number of tasks to boost productivity. Everest Group's Vijayan expects this to also change the nature of expertise. Enterprises will need to rethink their talent agenda, workforce planning, and learning and development programs. The bar of valuable human expertise will move from mastering things such as programming language syntax to higher-level understanding. Enterprises will need to rebuild their skills taxonomies and reassess how they plan for talent.
Renewed focus on enterprise data strategy. The biggest gains of generative AI will require going beyond the low-hanging fruit of generating text, images and other media. Vijayan envisions a future where generative AI creates appropriate business or IT workflows, creates complex documents from scratch and generates marketing collateral specific to a company. These new use cases will require seamless access to enterprise data, regardless of the approach. ""The enterprise data journey is not new, but GenAI will require a renewed focus and perhaps more investments to get there quicker,"" he said.
Automation of job tasks reshaping jobs. Prior waves of automation built on robotic process automation and business process automation focused on automating whole processes. Generative AI could help spin up automation more quickly but might only be sufficient for some tasks now performed by humans as part of a larger process. Certain tasks will become fully automated, BCG's Rehberg said, while more complex work will require a human element. ""We recognize that all revolutionary developments have not led to less jobs, just changes in the effectiveness and efficiencies of employees,"" he said. ""It would be a mistake to believe that there will be less jobs available moving forward, rather some jobs will just be reshaped and evolve.""
Generative AI embedded natively into existing enterprise apps. Rajesh Kumar R, CIO at IT consultancy LTIMindtree, predicts generative AI will transform from standalone assistants, like ChatGPT, to something natively weaved into productivity applications, such as email, spreadsheets, content authoring tools, presentation tools and other core enterprise systems, such as ERP, CRM, HR management and recruitment systems. Microsoft's Copilot provides an early example of how this might unfold across different applications.
Competition, disruption and lowered barriers to entry. Generative AI will enable more automation to help organizations do more with fewer resources. ""As costs go down, fundamentally new business models become more feasible in multiple domains,"" Vijayan said. This is similar to how digital banks quickly started taking business from brick-and-mortar ones. It could be particularly disruptive in stock media, customer service, entertainment and other industries.
The niche future of generative AI. Enterprises will likely see the best results in customizing LLMs for their own particular industry and use case. There won't be one general tool, such as a chatbot, used across industries, predicted Mona Chadha, director of category management at AWS. Rather, each organization will develop a generative AI offering that can deliver business outcomes catered to its base. ""These tools will include highly domain-specific LLMs for consumers to use with their own contextual data,"" she said.
Cost. The current crop of generative AI services is relatively more expensive than traditional search and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, Vijayan has already seen price drops by at least an order of magnitude and expects these to go down further as infrastructure, hosting, training and inference become more efficient and economies of scale further facilitate lowering costs.






Future of generative AI use cases
Here are some of the ways generative AI will shape various use cases within enterprises.
Research
Generative AI will have the greatest impact on jobs that focus on research, particularly those involving the largest sets of data, said Brian Spanswick, chief information security officer and head of IT at data security company Cohesity. This includes research relating to legal questions, scientific research, data governance and code development. This will also increase the emphasis on higher levels of critical thinking in day-to-day work. LLMs will do the heavy research lifting more completely across larger data sets virtually instantly. ""Rather than spending the majority of people's time on busy work, the power of the employee will be in making strong decisions based on the data they have, with the knowledge that that data is trustworthy,"" he said.
Cybersecurity
Generative AI will also streamline many aspects of cybersecurity. Spanswick said one of the biggest challenges in cybersecurity has been understanding where critical data sits, as well as getting insight into how that data moved through the company and how that data enables core business processes. Generative AI will help security teams obtain, analyze, synthesize and act on this data. This will make it easier to understand their attack surface and the level of protection required, as well as assess the security posture of these attack surfaces. This will help prioritize security investments, assess practical cyber-risk and set concrete KPIs for core security controls.
Business intelligence
Generative AI will play a pivotal role in improving the value and effectiveness of business intelligence (BI), predicted Porter Thorndike, principal product manager at software development firm Cloud Software Group. Analytics vendors are starting to explore how they can take advantage of AI capabilities in their platforms by either integrating with existing generative AI services or building their own. Generative AI will also streamline traditional BI workflows that now require close collaboration among developers, data scientists and business analysts. LLMs will help produce the same content, while requiring a less technical skill set. They will also help explain the meaning of content on existing dashboards tuned to different users.
Advancement of AIOps
Enterprises are increasingly turning to AI to improve IT operations management, or AIOps. This is sometimes confused with MLOps, which focuses on enhancing machine learning development workflows. Generative AI will improve the ability to sift through vast quantities of IT-related data to take programmatic actions, predicted Chris Opat, senior vice president of cloud operations at cloud backup and storage service Backblaze. He has started working with Selector AI to ingest various forms of business data to identify and mitigate anomalous behavior faster and more precisely.
Personalized customer experiences
Generative AI is also playing a role in increasing customer engagement through tailored interactions, website experiences, products and services. Kearney's Thota said generative AI could help businesses craft highly personalized content to boost sales through cross-selling and upselling opportunities. It can also reduce churn. He recommended CIOs work closely with marketing and customer relationship teams to gain insight into how generative AI can be integrated with existing customer engagement strategies. This can help guide the processing of collecting and integrating the data needed to build the personalization engine and have the structure to scale the tool as it expands across the organization.
Advanced conversational AI
Generative AI techniques will lead to more sophisticated NLP models to better understand context and generate humanlike text. Thota believes this could transform various aspects of business operations, including customer support, multilingual support, conversational knowledge databases and virtual assistants across multiple functions. He recommended companies prepare by identifying areas where advanced conversational AI can contribute to customer- and employee-facing interactions. They should also start thinking about governance and establishing user guidelines to prevent misuse of conversational AI models.
Automated content creation
Marketing, communication and design teams are using AI-powered tools to streamline content creation processes. This accelerates campaign timelines, optimizes creative resource allocation and bolsters brand consistency, said Dr. Stefan Sigg, chief product officer at Software AG. CIOs will need to explore ways to integrate AI-powered tools into workflows to improve collaboration between AI and humans. It's also important to upskill creative teams to work harmoniously with AI systems, scale AI infrastructure for increased content demands and foster an organizational shift that embraces AI as a creative ally rather than a replacement. ""Perhaps, larger enterprises will end up having their own EnterpriseGPT to allow for customized use within the corporation,"" he said.
Increased efficiency of operations
The expected wide adoption of generative AI should improve the efficiency of operations in many different verticals, said Shipra Sharma, head of AI and analytics at AI consultancy Bristlecone. It can work alongside humans to make their jobs easier, which can translate to time and cost savings. ""That's a tangible thing, and all organizations will eventually find a way to use generative AI to help make operations nimbler. But it's still questionable whether it can be used to increase profits or solve highly complex problems without human interaction,"" Sharma said.



The road to the responsible and ethical use of AI is a bumpy one. Here are some of the challenges enterprises will have to overcome.







Ethical issues arising from generative AI
The rapid adoption of generative AI will also lead to various new problems and exacerbate existing ones. Important aspects to consider include the following:

Primary risks. Enterprises must address primary risks around generative AI for broad-based adoption, Everest Group's Vijayan said. Top issues include regulatory, intellectual property, data, privacy and explainability concerns. He expects enterprises and vendors to develop meaningful workarounds and mitigation mechanisms, which seem promising based on current progress.
Responsible use. PwC's Likens said enterprises must consider security and performance risks with generative AI, such as bias and hallucinations. This will make it imperative for enterprises to plan and execute responsible AI rollouts to employees. Enterprises will increasingly invest in internal AI tools to ensure proprietary data and ideas remain within the enterprise. Adopting responsible AI frameworks and guardrails could also promote responsible and ethical use.
Shadow AI. Cloud innovations created a variety of low-cost and easy-to-access services that drove the growth of shadow IT outside the purview of IT governance. Abhishek Gupta, founder and principal researcher at Montreal AI Ethics Institute, predicted a similar rise in shadow AI. This refers to the AI systems, solutions and services used or developed within an organization without explicit organizational approval or oversight. It can include anything from using unsanctioned software and apps to developing AI-based solutions in a skunkworks-like fashion. Enterprises should embark on a drive to raise literacy around responsible use of AI systems and promote discussions of new risks, such as hallucinations, bias, and leakage of private and confidential information. ""Ultimately, the goal is to make responsible AI the norm rather than the exception,"" Gupta said.
Regulatory and copyright concerns. Regulators are still in the early stages of sorting out the impact of AI on existing copyright and intellectual property frameworks. ""Content created by a generative AI model resembles human-created work and thus could lead to regulatory and copyright issues,"" Thota said. Enterprises need to develop plans for ethical usage of content and ensure models avoid plagiarism. CIOs must also be proactive and collaborate with legal teams to develop internal policies and guidelines for using generative AI applications within their firm. It's also important to track emerging trends in copyright laws and regulations within your industry.
Trustworthy AI. Kumar R predicted generative AI technology providers and governing bodies will focus on making it more trustworthy. This will include more secure technology, data protection guarantees and legal protections. Data labeling and tagging, along with digital watermarks, could also enhance trust. These practices will also improve transparency into how the data is used and increase clarity on topics such as copyright.
Rise of confidential computing. Training LLMs on vast data sets won't do for many enterprise data sets involving personally identifiable information or confidential data. Sigg expects security and privacy concerns to prompt the evolution of generative AI toward techniques like federated learning and secure multiparty computation that protect sensitive data during the training process. ""These advancements allow businesses to collaboratively train models on decentralized data, fostering industry partnerships, while maintaining data security and complying with regulations such as GDPR,"" he said. This balance between data sharing and privacy protection opens doors to innovative collaborations previously hindered by privacy concerns.
Interpretive AI. Early generative AI models made it difficult to discern how the technology was used across the organization at scale. AWS' Chadha predicted that innovations in interpretive AI will help CIOs understand the value of their customer base and organization regarding product impact, market adoption and internal utilization.
Energy use. Generative AI can dramatically impact the consumption of IT resources and, hence, the energy usage of an organization. Chadha said organizations should prioritize use cases that are most valuable to their customers and strip down inference code to optimize cost and time. It might also be helpful to identify ways to make the GPUs at the heart of generative AI training and inferencing tasks more efficient by developing a strategy to consider additional GPU capacity coming online. CIOs might also position their company to run workloads on premises and monitor their cloud provider's effect on sustainability.

Updated November 15, 2023: To simplify the user experience and make Copilot more accessible to everyone, Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise will now simply become Microsoft Copilot. For more information: https://aka.ms/BingIgnite
We are entering a new era of AI, one that is fundamentally changing how we relate to and benefit from technology. With the convergence of chat interfaces and large language models you can now ask for what you want in natural language and the technology is smart enough to answer, create it or take action. At Microsoft, we think about this as having a copilot to help navigate any task. We have been building AI-powered copilots into our most used and loved products – making coding more efficient with GitHub, transforming productivity at work with Microsoft 365, redefining search with Bing and Edge and delivering contextual value that works across your apps and PC with Windows.
Today we take the next step to unify these capabilities into a single experience we call Microsoft Copilot, your everyday AI companion. Copilot will uniquely incorporate the context and intelligence of the web, your work data and what you are doing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance – with your privacy and security at the forefront. It will be a simple and seamless experience, available in Windows 11, Microsoft 365, and in our web browser with Edge and Bing. It will work as an app or reveal itself when you need it with a right click. We will continue to add capabilities and connections to Copilot across to our most-used applications over time in service of our vision to have one experience that works across your whole life.
Copilot will begin to roll out in its early form as part of our free update to Windows 11, starting Sept. 26 — and across Bing, Edge, and Microsoft 365 Copilot this fall. We’re also announcing some exciting new experiences and devices to help you be more productive, spark your creativity, and to meet the everyday needs of people and businesses.

With over 150 new features, the next Windows 11 update is one of our most ambitious yet, bringing the power of Copilot and new AI powered experiences to apps like Paint, Photos, Clipchamp and more right to your Windows PC.
Bing will add support for the latest DALL.E 3 model from OpenAI and deliver more personalized answers based on your search history, a new AI-powered shopping experience, and updates to Bing Chat Enterprise, making it more mobile and visual.
Microsoft 365 Copilot will be generally available for enterprise customers on Nov. 1, 2023, along with Microsoft 365 Chat, a new AI assistant that will completely transform the way you work.
Additionally, we introduced powerful new Surface devices that bring all these AI experiences to life for you, and they are available for pre-order beginning today.

New Windows 11 Update delivers over 150 new features, including bringing the power of Copilot to the PC 
Today, we’re thrilled to share our next step toward making Windows the destination for the best AI experiences – with a new update that delivers our most personal experience yet coming on Sept. 26.

Copilot in Windows (in preview) empowers you to create faster, complete tasks with ease and lessens your cognitive load – making once complicated tasks, simple. We’ve made accessing the power of Copilot seamless as it’s always right there for you on the taskbar or with the Win+C keyboard shortcut providing assistance alongside all your apps, on all screen sizes at work, school or at home.
Paint has been enhanced with AI for drawing and digital creation with the addition of background removal and layers as well as a preview of Cocreator that brings the power of generative AI to the Paint app.
Photos has also been enhanced with AI including new features to make editing your photos a breeze. With Background Blur you can make the subject of your photo stand out quickly and easily. The Photos app automatically finds the background in the photo, and with a single click, instantly highlights your subject and blurs out the background. We’ve improved search, with photos stored in OneDrive (home or personal) accounts, you can now quickly find the photo you’re looking for based on the content of the photo. You can also now find photos based on the location where they were taken.
Snipping Tool now offers more ways to capture content on your screen – with this update you can now extract specific text content from an image to paste in another application or, you can easily protect your sensitive information with text redaction by using text actions on the post capture screen. And, with the addition of sound capturing using audio and mic support, it’s easier to create compelling videos and content from your screen.
Clipchamp, now with auto compose, helps you with scenes suggestions, edits and narratives based on your images and footage automatically so you can create and edit videos to share with family, friends, and social media like a pro.
Notepad will start automatically saving your session state allowing you to close Notepad without any interrupting dialogs and then pick up where you left off when you return. Notepad will automatically restore previously open tabs as well as unsaved content and edits across those open tabs.
With the new Outlook for Windows, you can connect and coordinate your various accounts (including Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, and more) in one app. Intelligent tools help you write clear, concise emails and seamlessly attach important documents and photos from OneDrive. To learn more, visit this link.
Modernized File Explorer, we are introducing a modernized File Explorer home, address bar and search box all designed to help you more easily access important and relevant content, stay up to date with file activity and collaborate without even opening a file. Also coming to File Explorer is a new Gallery feature designed to make it easy to access your photo collection.
New text authoring experiences to voice access and new natural voices in Narrator, continuing our ongoing commitment to making Windows 11 the most accessible version of Windows yet.
Windows Backup makes moving to a new Windows 11 PC easier than ever. With Windows Backup, transitioning most files, apps and settings from one PC to another, is seamless so everything is right where you left it, exactly how you like it.

These experiences, including Copilot in Windows and more will start to become available on Sept. 26 as part of our latest update to Windows 11, version 22H2.
Bing and Edge are redefining how we interact with the web
Today, we’re announcing new features in Bing and Edge to supercharge your day powered by the latest models delivering the most advanced capabilities for AI available. You can use Bing Chat today with Microsoft Edge or at bing.com/chat. Features will begin to roll out soon.

Personalized answers. Now, your chat history can inform your results. For example, if you’ve used Bing to track your favorite soccer team, next time you’re planning a trip it can proactively tell you if the team is playing in your destination city. If you prefer responses that don’t use your chat history, you can turn this feature off in Bing settings.
Copilot in Microsoft Shopping. From Bing or Edge, you can now more quickly find what you’re shopping for online. When you ask for information on an item, Bing will ask additional questions to learn more, then use that information to provide more tailored recommendations. And you can trust you’re getting the best price – in fact, in the last 12 months, shoppers have been offered more than $4 billion in savings on Microsoft Edge. Soon, you’ll also be able to use a photo or saved image as the starting point for shopping.


 

DALL.E 3 model from OpenAI in Bing Image Creator. DALL.E 3 delivers a huge leap forward with more beautiful creations and better renderings for details like fingers and eyes. It also has a better understanding of what you’re asking for, which results in delivering more accurate images. We’re also integrating Microsoft Designer directly into Bing to make editing your creations even easier.
Content Credentials. As we continue to take a responsible approach to generative AI, we’re adding new Content Credentials which uses cryptographic methods to add an invisible digital watermark to all AI-generated images in Bing – including time and date it was originally created. We will also bring support for Content Credentials to Paint and Microsoft Designer.
Bing Chat Enterprise Updates. Since its introduction just two months ago, more than 160 million Microsoft 365 users now have access to Bing Chat Enterprise at no additional cost and the response has been incredible. Today we’re announcing that Bing Chat Enterprise is now available in the Microsoft Edge mobile app. We’re also bringing support for multimodal visual search and Image Creator to Bing Chat Enterprise. Boost your creativity at work with the ability to find information using images and creating them.

Today, we’re also introducing a new, hero experience in Microsoft 365 Copilot: Microsoft 365 Chat. You saw a glimpse of Microsoft 365 Chat in March, then called Business Chat — but rapid advancements over the last few months have taken it to a whole new level. Microsoft 365 Chat combs across your entire universe of data at work, including emails, meetings, chats, documents and more, plus the web. Like an assistant, it has a deep understanding of you, your job, your priorities and your organization. It goes far beyond simple questions and answers to give you a head start on some of your most complex or tedious tasks — whether that’s writing a strategy document, booking a business trip, or catching up on emails.
Over the past few years, the pace and volume of work have only increased. On a given workday, our heaviest users search for what they need 18 times, receive over 250 Outlook emails and send or read nearly 150 Teams chats.[1] Teams users globally are in three times more meetings each week than they were in 2020.[2] And on Windows, some people use 11 apps in a single day to get work done. [3] Microsoft 365 Chat tames the complexity, eliminates the drudgery and helps you reclaim time at work. Preview customers can access it today on Microsoft365.com, Teams, or in Bing when signed in with their work account. In the future you’ll be able to access it wherever you see the Copilot icon when signed in with your work account.
To empower you at work, we’re also introducing new capabilities for Copilot in Outlook, Word, Excel, Loop, OneNote and OneDrive. Bing Chat Enterprise —the first entry point into generative AI for many companies — is getting a few upgrades. And as part of our big Windows 11 update, Windows 365 Switch and Windows 365 Boot will be generally available making it even easier to access your Windows Cloud PC. This will help employees achieve more, while making it easier for IT to deploy, manage and secure. Check out the Microsoft 365 blog to learn more about how Microsoft 365, Bing Chat Enterprise and Windows are transforming the way we work.
Unleashing personal productivity and creativity with Designer and Copilot in Microsoft 365
Designer, the newest addition to our family of Microsoft 365 consumer apps, helps you quickly create stunning visuals, social media posts, invitations, and more using cutting-edge AI. Today, we’re showing some powerful new features, many of which will be powered by OpenAI’s Dall.E 3. Generative expand uses AI to extend your image beyond its borders, generative fill adds a new object or background, and generative erase can remove unwanted objects.[4] Dall.E 3 will also soon power the image generation experience in Designer, making it easy to add original, higher quality images to your design in seconds.

We’re also integrating Designer into Microsoft 365 Copilot for consumers — starting with Word. Designer uses the context of your document to propose visuals to choose from; you can make it more personal by uploading your own photos too. And within moments, you can transform a text-heavy document with custom graphics. We’re starting to test Microsoft 365 Copilot with a small group of Microsoft 365 consumer subscribers and look forward to expanding the preview to more people over time. Seventy percent of creators tell us one of the most difficult parts of the creation process is just getting started.[5] With creative tools like Designer, plus Bing Image Creator, Clipchamp and Paint, you can now have an immediate visual draft of almost anything — with a few simple prompts.

For example, some countries have banned the use of ChatGPT over ethical and privacy concerns.However, the extensive use of generative AI may also result in job losses across advanced and emerging economies. Therefore, governments will face the challenge of weighing up the benefits of broad adoption against the likely social pressures.“Economies with large services sectors and high labour costs will be most vulnerable. Political tensions may ensue, creating dilemmas for governments in their approach to AI policy. Ethical and security issues, including misuse of the technology are further risks,” the rating agency said in the report.Read MoreDubai Assembly for Generative AI to be held in OctoberGenerative AI considered a security risk by 60% of board members, survey findsThe economic impact of generative AI may take time to become tangible and improvements will likely take time to feed through to economic growth, the report said.This is because any productivity boost will “involve material changes to companies' internal business processes and to the way services and goods are produced”. It will also depend on how fast generative AI diffuses across whole countries and business sectors.Currently, the development of technology is concentrated within a handful of large companies based in the US, the world’s largest economy. Those countries and industries with easy access to generative AI will outperform which could further exacerbate inequality, according to the report.Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard are two front-runners in the burgeoning field. This month, the Abu Dhabi government-supported research centre Technology Innovation Institute launched Falcon 180B – an advanced version of its flagship language model – to boost generative AI capabilities in the region.Next month, the UAE will host Dubai Assembly for Generative AI, which aims to shape the future of AI and introduce governments and societies to the opportunities it provides.“Barriers to entry are high because it is expensive to develop the technology and vast data sets are needed to train the models effectively. If the technology is not widely or easily accessible, too expensive to adopt, or if access to it is restricted due to corporate or national and geopolitical interests, the macroeconomic benefits may be fewer,” Moody’s said.Generative AI could add nearly $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy and will transform productivity across sectors with continued investment in the technology, according to a new study by consultancy McKinsey.It has “enormous” economic potential and could raise global labour productivity growth by more than one percentage point a year in the next decade, Goldman Sachs said in a report in July.In the long term, AI-related investment could reach 4 per cent of gross domestic product in the US and 2.5 per cent of GDP in other AI-leading countries in the next 10 years, it said.In the short term, AI investment could grow quickly in the next couple of years, approaching $100 billion in the US and $200 billion globally by 2025, the report added.Moody’s said an effective regulatory framework governing the use of generative AI is necessary to thwart social, political and policy challenges. To maximise benefits and minimise misuse, it is also essential to address generative AI-related issues of ethics, transparency, privacy and security.However, regulating the use of the technology will be “challenging and complex”, Moody’s said.“This stems from the inherent complexity and surprising power of generative AI models. Its generation of original content means regulators may not be able to fully guarantee or truly evaluate the behaviour or output of such models before they are rolled out.”Governments with strong institutions and policies are better positioned to develop credible regulatory frameworks, the report said.",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://www.thenationalnews.com,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KG2SFDG3IRCO7J3Y6UVFLENFWE.png?smart=true&auth=16162bf9e36dc788e5404534bbfd1ccf9c1e54b6655a374eaa7e7ede639654f0&width=800&height=450', 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KG2SFDG3IRCO7J3Y6UVFLENFWE.png?smart=true&auth=16162bf9e36dc788e5404534bbfd1ccf9c1e54b6655a374eaa7e7ede639654f0&width=400&height=225', 'width': 800}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/3SH7TLWE24UN7CG2CNWXM4XDXY.jpg?smart=true&auth=278c2d2ebbf373dabbab32b0ca149afca7b463fa647d8ec862e3025568a36e3d&width=800&height=450', 'width': 800}]","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Alkesh Sharma', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Farc-authors%2Fthenational%2Fbcd72f3d-db18-4698-a4e1-f1cfa7f76928.png?smart=true&auth=d7a39ec715248d85e2132cd792aa7598d4abb4d2bf179a110026065adc157b02&width=200&height=200', 'width': 200}}]","{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The National', 'url': 'https://www.thenationalnews.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/TheNationalNews', 'https://x.com/TheNationalNews', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thenationalnews/', 'https://www.instagram.com/TheNationalNews.com', 'https://www.youtube.com/TheNationalNewspaper'], 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.thenationalnews.com/pf/resources/images/logo.png?d=756', 'width': 250, 'height': 69}}","Generative AI to transform business but comes with social risks, says Moody's",2023-09-23T03:00:00Z,2023-09-23T03:00:00.383Z,Technology,The National,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/technology/2023/09/23/generative-ai-to-transform-business-but-with-social-risks-says-moodys/'}",,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.thenationalnews.com/pf/resources/images/logo.png?d=756', 'width': 250, 'height': 69}","['https://www.facebook.com/TheNationalNews', 'https://x.com/TheNationalNews', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thenationalnews/', 'https://www.instagram.com/TheNationalNews.com', 'https://www.youtube.com/TheNationalNewspaper']",,[None],,,https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/3SH7TLWE24UN7CG2CNWXM4XDXY.jpg?smart=true&auth=278c2d2ebbf373dabbab32b0ca149afca7b463fa647d8ec862e3025568a36e3d&width=400&height=225,,,,,,"<a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/technology/2023/09/07/generative-ai-considered-a-security-risk-by-60-of-board-members-survey-finds/"" target=""_blank"">Generative artificial intelligence</a>, when combined with other existing <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/technology/2023/07/25/dubai-assembly-for-generative-ai-to-be-held-in-october/"" target=""_blank"">AI tools</a>, has the potential to transform the way companies and individuals work, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report released on Friday.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are not merely theoretical advances; they are practical tools recalibrating the fundamental operation of our economies.


The recently released World Economic Forum white paper, Jobs of Tomorrow: Large Language Models and Jobs, developed in collaboration with Accenture, casts a spotlight on this transformation, highlighting the tasks and jobs that will be augmented and those that will be automated. Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep-learning algorithms that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate content, approaching human-level proficiency.

Augmenting Human Capabilities
Fields such as engineering, scientific analysis and mathematics would see professionals focusing on high-value creative tasks while AI systems manage the more routine operations. The augmentation of human capacity in such roles leads to a more rewarding work environment that benefits employees and catalyzes innovation while embracing what it means to be human.

PROMOTED
On the other hand, jobs centered around repetitive language tasks may be impacted by automation. Occupations such as credit authorizers, checkers and clerks could see up to four-fifths of their tasks automated. At the same time, jobs requiring a high degree of personal interaction, such as education and career counselling, will probably be much less impacted by the adoption of LLMs. And as LLMs are adopted more widely, new roles – AI developers, AI content creators and specialists in AI ethics, to name a few – will emerge as well.
These are the findings of an extensive analysis examining 19,000 tasks across 867 occupations. It echoes the findings of the Future of Jobs Report 2023, which anticipates significant job alterations in the next half-decade.

First, foresight and adaptability must be the cornerstones of organizational strategies. Comprehending the implications of leveraging LLMs, negative and positive, is the first step towards a future where technology augments human capabilities.

Second, businesses need to strengthen internal workforce planning and invest heavily in reskilling and upskilling workers towards growing roles, while recruiting new talent in growing jobs.
Policy-makers have a role to play, too, particularly in guiding the development of education and training programs that prepare workers for the jobs that will benefit the most from LLMs. Social safety nets and other forms of assistance will need to be in place as current workers retool and retrain, particularly for those most likely to be affected.
Our AI-augmented future holds great promise. The evolving symbiosis between humans and large language models, and generative AI more broadly, has the potential to create value but only if we guide this transition collaboratively. The onus to capitalize on the opportunities while diligently navigating the challenges falls on all of us – business leaders, policymakers and employees alike.

Almost three quarters (73 per cent) of news organisations surveyed in a new global report published today (20 September) on AI and the media believe generative AI (genAI), such as ChatGPT or Google Bard, presents new opportunities for journalism. 
The new report, Generating Change: A global survey of what news organisations are doing with AI, from the JournalismAI initiative at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) surveyed over 100 news organisations from 46 countries about their engagement with AI and associated technologies. The survey was conducted between April and July 2023.
Around 85 per cent of survey respondents - including journalists, technologists and managers at news organisations - have at the very least experimented with genAI to help with tasks such as writing code, image generation and authoring summaries.
Some respondents noted that AI can help free up capacity for more creative work by helping with time-intensive tasks such as interview transcription and fact-checking. A France based  AI strategy analyst who was part of the survey, noted: “GenAI can change the way we interact with information, allowing us to grasp massive amounts of data, and level the playing field between high and low data skills.”
Respondents pointed out the affordances of genAI technologies, such as their accessibility, low requirements for technical skills, and what was described as their ability to understand “context”, which make them stand out from other AI technologies that generally require deep specialist expertise in areas like programming.
Despite these opportunities, respondents recognised the need for any AI generated content to be checked by a human to mitigate potential harms like bias and inaccuracy. A debunking editor at a Spanish fact checking platform noted: “No matter how advanced AI becomes, human criteria will always be essential in the whole fact-checking process.”
More than 60 per cent of respondents noted their concern about the ethical implications of AI on journalistic values including accuracy, fairness and transparency and other aspects of journalism. 
While newsrooms globally contend with challenges related to AI integration, the challenges are more pronounced for newsrooms in the Global South. Respondents highlighted language, infrastructural, and political challenges. They noted how the social and economic benefits of AI tend to be geographically concentrated in the Global North, where there is better infrastructure and easier access to resources. Meanwhile, many countries in the Global South grapple with the social, cultural, and economic repercussions of post-independence colonialism. 
A Philippines based respondent commented: “AI technologies developed have been predominantly available in English, but not in many Asian languages…We have to catch up doubly to create AI systems, and AI systems that work with our local languages.”  
With 80 per cent of respondents expecting an increased use of AI in their newsrooms, the report’s authors believe this is a crucial opportunity “for ‘good’ journalists to do more ‘human’ work with the support of AI.”
Commenting on the findings, co-author and Director of JournalismAI Professor Charlie Beckett said: “Journalism around the world is going through another period of exciting and scary technological change. Our survey shows that the new generative AI tools are a potential threat to the integrity of information and the news media. But they also offer an incredible opportunity to make journalism more efficient, effective and trustworthy. This survey is a fascinating snapshot of the news media at a critical juncture in its history.”
Co-author and lead researcher Mira Yaseen added: “It was truly enriching to engage with more than 100 media organisations that vary in size, region, language, mission and business model, and listen to their experiences with and concerns about AI integration in journalism. 
“We’ve known that it’s a double edged sword, like almost everything, but what came through more clearly in our report this year was the global AI disparity. Currently, the economic and social benefits of AI are concentrated in the Global North and its harms disproportionately affect the Global South (e.g. algorithmic bias), exacerbating global inequality. If we are serious about benefiting from AI in an equitable manner, it is imperative that we adopt a power-conscious framing of global AI development and adoption, which is often absent in discussions about AI. Our report attempts to do this in Chapter six by paying special attention to the challenges faced by the global majority.”

More than 860 confirmed they were using AI and other automated technology, with 78% of those companies reporting this had resulted directly in the creation of new jobs.Technologies also increased the need for new skills, reported 83% of businesses, while 69% said they believed they improved job quality either a little or a lot.“This report not only highlights that the adoption of AI is well under way across UK firms, but also that it is possible for this tech transformation to lead to both net job creation, and more ‘good work’ – great news as we try to solve the UK’s productivity puzzle,” said Anna Thomas, director of IFOW.The report’s findings appear to be at odds with concerns about the possibility of AI-induced job losses, and with what the document describes as “dramatic, speculative headlines about artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous robots”.Wired differently: how neurodiversity adds new skillsets to the workplaceRead moreProf James Hayton, lead author of the report, said: “At least from a research perspective, the story is already changing. The challenge is that it’s not quite so interesting to say ‘well, robots are taking our jobs sometimes, but it depends’, as it is to say ‘in 30 years there will be no jobs at all’.“The evidence we really have about this is that technology tends to create new jobs and upskill jobs. Yes, it does downskill and disrupt other jobs, but in the long run, there tends to be a positive impact on the economy.”While 47% of respondents said AI and automation had eliminated positions within their company, almost 67% reported the technology had created new positions.The report, which was prepared by the Pissarides Review into the Future of Work, with funding from the Nuffield Foundation, found equal rates of adoption among businesses for both physical and non-physical tasks.Despite the positive responses from businesses, the report said the pace at which automation was spreading through the labour market could – if not properly addressed – exacerbate regional inequalities across the UK and lead to “serious erosions in job quality”.“This technology will spread broadly and rapidly through the economy, and therefore we would expect an equally rapid impact on some jobs,” Hayton said. “Society will have to adjust quickly to these issues, quicker than we’ve ever had to adjust before.”Whether adopting technology has a positive or negative impact on workers depends on what is known as regional innovation readiness – the levels of investment in a particular region, and the levels of education among that region’s workers, said the report.“In the context of the levelling up agenda, we know there are regions that do much better, such as the south-east and London, and also the second and third cities in these regions,” said Hayton. “This is compared to, say, the far south-west or far north-west. In our study, it’s quite clear that these regions have a lower level of readiness in terms of investment in education and investment in technology infrastructure.”To help insure against these negative outcomes, the report urges firms and policymakers to focus on human resource practices which invest in workers, and which focus on augmenting their capabilities through automation, rather than replacing them.“The more you invest in your workforce, the more likely they are to be able to successfully utilise these technologies, because they’ve got more skills,” Hayton said. “They’re more flexible, more willing to learn, more confident that you’re not going to fire them. And, therefore, it’s going to be easier to successfully implement the new technology.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe future of workArtificial intelligence (AI)RobotsnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceLiveUS elections live updates: Poll shows Harris outperforming Biden against Trump – but former president still has an edge",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At a Glance




Artificial intelligence (AI) will change the software industry, particularly the engineering and sales and marketing functions.
Nearly two-thirds of software engineers say that they expect productivity gains of 20% or more, and many are already deploying AI coding assistants.
About 39% of software companies said that the biggest barrier is the lack of technical skills, so an early investment in upskilling talent could offer a competitive edge.
AI will also help automate sales to smaller businesses and consumers, allowing for smarter self-service.











This article is part of Bain's 2023 Technology Report.

Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve productivity across industries and business functions, with some estimating that about 20% of all work tasks could be completed faster and at equal quality with assistance from generative AI.
In the software industry, engineering and go-to-market (GTM) functions are among the areas most likely to benefit from AI over the next 18 months. The technology will change how work gets done and also the mix of talent and skills necessary to make it happen.
Because these productivity gains are accessible to every company, they are unlikely to make technology companies structurally more profitable. Firms will instead likely feel the competitive pressure to use productivity gains to build new product—and build it faster, in order to keep up with or outcompete the market. While a small portion of AI productivity gains may flow to the bottom line, most is likely to be reinvested in the business (see Figure 1).



Figure 1




















More than 90% of engineering and go-to-market executives expect gains from AI to be reinvested back into the business











More productive engineering teams
Software engineers see potential for generative AI in comprehending, developing, testing, and documenting code, as well as improving data quality and building user stories that articulate how a feature will provide value. About 57% of the software engineers we surveyed said that they anticipate 20% or better productivity gains from generative AI use cases over the next two years (see Figure 2).
To take advantage of AI and its productivity potential, companies will need to integrate commercial large language models (LLMs)—or in certain cases develop their own LLMs. About 39% of those surveyed said that the biggest barrier to benefiting from AI is a lack of technical skills—especially AI language model training, engineering chains of AI model prompts, machine learning model testing and operations, and data engineering of unstructured data assets. Some of these skills are new capabilities, so an early investment in helping employees develop these skills should be a near-term focus for companies.
As companies seek out the necessary capabilities, their talent mix is likely to shift. They will need more engineering talent for AI and machine learning, particularly with experience building or integrating LLMs. Since these are comparatively new skills, scarcity is likely to continue for some time, underlining the importance of upskilling the existing workforce. The outlook for other engineering roles may remain the same as or less than today (see Figure 3).



Figure 2




















Nearly 60% of software engineers expect AI to improve productivity by more than 20% over the next two years














Figure 3




















Engineering leaders expect the talent mix to shift over the next two years











More automated sales and marketing
Generative AI will change the way that companies market and sell their products and services as it enables significant automation across every step of the customer life cycle. In particular, demand and lead generation, digital self-service sales, customer success, and other support activities all have the potential to benefit from the types of automation that generative AI enables (see Figure 4).
Among the GTM executives we surveyed, 64% believe that consumer sales will see a significant amount of automation over the next two years, partly because they are less customized. Automation in business-to-business sales will vary by segment, but 40% of GTM executives see lots of potential for automation in sales to small and medium businesses. More complex sales at the midmarket and enterprise levels are less ideal for automation, although one-third of the GTM executives surveyed expect to see high levels of automation here, too. More than half of the GTM executives we surveyed believe that generative AI may enable them to serve some customers with a lower-touch or self-service model, ultimately reducing the number of customers served by a more manually intensive, bespoke enterprise effort.



Figure 4




















Marketing executives foresee a high degree of automation across the customer life cycle











No company can afford to sit back and watch how its competitors and vendors deploy generative AI. The rapid adoption of this technology is changing the basis of competition, and senior leaders should be acting now to understand its strategic implications. Most companies will need to invest significantly in talent to take advantage of generative AI, hiring new engineers and improving the capabilities of their current workforce. Executives will also need to decide how to distribute resources across key areas such as security, data platforms, and experimentation teams, and they will need to find the right balance of investment across customer-facing uses and internal productivity. Making key decisions now will help firms find, train, and retain the talented people they will need to support the evolving generative AI–enabled business model.

From automating mundane tasks to generating novel solutions, these technologies are empowering legal professionals across various industries and domains to achieve more with less. But how do professionals perceive the impact of generative AI on the legal industry? What are the opportunities and challenges they face as they adopt these technologies? And what are the skills and strategies they need to thrive in the future of work? To answer these questions, we conducted a survey of professionals from different sectors and backgrounds, asking them about their perspectives on the current and future state of AI in their industry. We also asked them about the areas where AI has the most potential to help them meet their goals, and if AI would hinder their progress in the same areas. In this blog, we will share a few of the key findings and insights from our new report, “Future of Professionals”, and discuss the implications for legal professionals who want to leverage AI to transform their work and business.  Future of Professionals ReportHow AI is the Catalyst for Transforming Every Aspect of WorkView report  AI as a catalyst for growth Bringing together macro- and organizational trends, we asked legal professionals about the areas in which AI had the most potential to help firms and departments meet their goals, and if AI would hinder progress in the same areas. Not surprisingly, the majority reported net-positive impacts in most areas. They perceive AI as a catalyst for growth.  Legal professionals in both law firms and corporations see AI as having the ability to enable growth opportunities. For law firms, AI reduces friction to launch new services or expand into new markets. For example, AI potentially can free up time for professionals to identify and evaluate attractive markets for expansion. For corporate departments, AI can free up their time to dedicate to supporting their organization’s strategy and growth objectives. To take advantage of all the opportunities that AI offers, and to mitigate the challenges that it poses, legal professionals need to adopt a proactive and strategic approach to the future of work. Here are some of the recommendations we propose based on our survey findings: Embrace lifelong learning and upskilling, and seek to develop a combination of technical, cognitive, and social skills that will enable you to work effectively with AI. Define the role and scope of AI in your work, and identify the tasks that could, or should be automated, augmented, or delegated to machines and the tasks that require human oversight, judgment, and creativity. Consider the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI, and adhere to the principles of responsible and ethical AI, such as fairness, accountability, transparency, and privacy. AI is transforming the legal profession in unprecedented ways, creating new possibilities and challenges.

Published: 12 Jul 2024


 
Until recently, most AI applications used predictive engines to correlate data or make decisions. Although various forms of generative AI have existed for decades, interest within enterprises was mild due to limited capabilities.







The recent success of ChatGPT, which demonstrated the ability to create nuanced and articulated content at scale, highlighted the potential value of generative AI across the enterprise. As a result, executives and business users are starting to make generative AI and predictive AI complementary domains.
Generative AI creates content, code, music and marketing material and can translate data into different formats. Predictive AI makes predictions, recommendations and decisions using various AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Technically speaking, generative AI often uses many predictive processes to incrementally predict the next unit of content within a result. When discussing generative AI vs. predictive AI, the main differences between the two domains are use cases and proficiency with unstructured and structured data, respectively.

Key differences between predictive AI and generative AI
""Generative AI and predictive AI represent distinct paradigms within the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning,"" said Bharath Thota, partner in the advanced analytics practice at Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm.

Generative AI focuses on creating new and original content, such as images, text and other media, by learning from existing data patterns. It fosters creativity and is valuable in creative fields and novel problem-solving.
Predictive AI uses patterns in historical data to forecast future outcomes or classify future events. It provides actionable insights and aids in decision-making and strategy formulation.
""These approaches are not isolated and can prove to be symbiotic in developing an overarching business strategy,"" Thota said. Generative AI can help design product features, while predictive AI can forecast consumer demand or market response for these features. Generative AI can synthesize realistic data to enhance a predictive model's training set to improve predictive capabilities.

Inna Kuznetsova

Predictive AI forecasts future events by analyzing historical data trends to assign probability weights to the models. Generative AI creates new data, which might be in the form of text and images. ""Think of the first [predictive AI] as a powerful analyst doing magic with numbers, while the second [generative AI] is a creative kind -- a writer, an artist or an assistant in research,"" said Inna Kuznetsova, CEO at ToolsGroup, a supply chain planning and optimization firm.
It's helpful to frame predictive AI as helping to predict whether a certain event will occur as a solution to a classification problem -- such as a loan default -- and forecast the quantitative impact of multiple events on continuous variables as a regression problem, such as credit card portfolio analysis, said Arun Ramchandran, president and global head of consulting and GenAI practice at IT services and solutions provider Hexaware. These solutions are mostly based on structured data from past events.

Arun Ramchandran

In contrast, generative AI is designed to generate novel content based on user input and the unstructured data on which it's trained. These models might provide answers, but more as an opinion with qualitative reasoning.
Ramchandran said generative AI can complement predictive AI in the enterprise to derive value from both structured and unstructured data. Here, predictive models are used to improve business processes and outcomes, while generative models are employed to meet the content requirements of those processes. However, care is required for data governance, security and privacy. In addition, this combination might be used in forecasting for synthetic data generation, data augmentation and simulations.


What is generative AI and how does it work?
Generative AI creates new content using various algorithms pioneered in the mid-2010s that have strengths for different use cases. Among these algorithms are the following:

Generative adversarial networks to create images, synthesize voices, and translate voices and video for use in different languages.
Variational autoencoders to generate structured data.
Diffusion models to generate imagery and videos in response to prompts.
Large language models (LLMs) that excel in text generation; however, newer multimodal approaches can translate across domains, such as creating images, writing code, programming robots and crafting automation in response to a text prompt.



Benefits of generative AI
Some of the key benefits of generative AI include the following:

Automates code generation and other aspects of software development.
Simplifies new content generation.
Summarizes complex documents or data sets.
Easily works with unstructured data.
Creates articulate and simple answers to complex queries.
Works well across different modalities such as text, video, audio, robot instructions and data formats.



Limitations of generative AI
Some of the limitations of generative AI include the following:

Propensity to hallucinate.
Heavy carbon footprint.
Can be expensive to retrain models.
Difficult to remove sensitive data once it's baked into a model.
More challenging to explain or interpret the mechanisms underpinning results.



Generative AI applications in business
Some of the most common generative AI applications in business include the following:

Generating code.
Crafting marketing materials.
Searching multiple manuals.
Personalizing content for customers and employees.
Customizing learning experiences.
Translating data across formats.
Customizing explanations for different levels of expertise or roles.
Localization of content across different geographies and languages.
Researching complex topics.
Distilling and summarizing risks across different domains in risk management.
Summarizing resumes to streamline candidate selection.
Managing skills taxonomies in learning and development.
Summarizing patterns in call center interactions.
Simplifying complex UIs to simple text prompts.



What is predictive AI and how does it work?
""Predictive AI focuses on making decisions based on historical data and current information,"" said Owen Morris, director of enterprise architecture at cloud consultancy Doherty Associates.

Owen Morris

It's used in various applications such as predicting financial market trends, equipment maintenance scheduling and anomaly detection. Predictive AI offers great value across different business applications, including fraud detection, preventive maintenance, recommendation systems, churn prediction, capacity management and logistics optimization.
Predictive AI uses most ML and AI algorithms outside the scope of those used for generative AI, including the following:

Neural networks for a variety of tasks.
Linear regression to find correlations.
Logistic regression to classify data.
Support vector machines to classify data.
Decision trees to estimate outcomes.
Random forests to classify data.
K-means clustering to sort data into groups.
Self-trained naive Bayes classifier to classify data.



Benefits of predictive AI
Some of the benefits of predictive AI include the following:

Automates analytics.
Simplifies complex analysis.
Streamlines data processing.
Works with structured data.
Can improve analysis for well-understood use cases.
Works well for structured and time series data.



Limitations of predictive AI
""While predictive AI emerged as a game changer in the analytics landscape, it does have limitations within business operations,"" Thota said. Understanding and addressing these limitations can help businesses safeguard themselves from these pitfalls. This often involves combining predictive AI with other analytics techniques to mitigate weaknesses.
Some of the limitations of predictive AI include the following:

Bias in underlying data might be amplified. This might lead to inconsistencies in interpretation and ethical concerns. Ramchandran recommends adopting stringent data and model governance practices to reduce these risks.
Overreliance on historical data. Thota said training data should be augmented with real-time and external data sources and feedback loops to update models with recent information.
Lack of interpretability can arise in complex predictive models. These models, built on deep neural networks, can make transparency and explainability difficult. The use of simpler models can help identify and fix issues that arise. Kuznetsova said businesses should consider explainable AI techniques to help business leaders understand how the models work and make predictions.
Overfitting. When an AI model tries to fit itself to the training data too closely, it can lead to inaccurate predictions.
Struggle with causation. Predictive models are good at identifying correlation, but they can struggle to distinguish between correlation and causation. Thota said causal inference methods and randomized controls can help differentiate between correlation and causation.
Too much training on data and business cases can lead to prediction bias. Kuznetsova recommends questioning the number of cases analyzed for an industry subsegment. ""What may work very well in groceries, with a shorter shelf life but less variety of models and sizes, may not be successful in forecasting demand in apparel or footwear,"" she said.




A breakdown of the benefits and limitations of generative AI and predictive AI.







Predictive AI applications in business
Morris said some best practices to ensure organizations get the most value from predictive AI in business include setting clear objectives and KPI definitions and ensuring data quality. It's also important to monitor results to ensure models perform as needed and to review model factors periodically to identify outdated factors and potential biases.
Businesses can use predictive AI in the following ways:

Demand sensing and forecasting. Predictive AI uses historical and causal data to create a more accurate short-term granular demand forecast to support inventory location and allocation decisions.
Inventory optimization. An analytic approach that incorporates predictive AI to better identify and set inventory targets throughout all inventory locations and types in the supply chain.
Customer targeting. Predictive AI analyzes historical data to predict which customers are likely to respond positively to specific offers or promotions.
Risk assessment. Financial institutions and lenders widely use predictive AI to evaluate fiscal and credit risks related to defaults or delinquencies.
Sales forecasting. Forecasting future sales based on historical data, market trends and external factors helps companies allocate resources, manage demand planning and supply chain operations, and optimize inventory levels.
Churn prevention. Predictive AI can analyze historical interactions and other customer demographic data to predict customers likely to churn, which lets companies make proactive retention efforts.
Preventive maintenance. This can help optimize maintenance schedules to reduce costs while reducing the risk of failures.

Survey: Majority of US Workers Are Already Using Generative AI Tools, But Company Policies Trail BehindBy Doug Eadline 

September 18, 2023


A new survey from the Conference Board indicates that More than half of US employees are already using generative AI tools, at least occasionally, to accomplish work-related tasks. Yet some three-quarters of companies still lack an established, clearly communicated organizational AI policy.
The new survey  finds that 56 percent of workers are using generative AI on the job, with nearly 1 in 10 employing the technology on a daily basis. Yet just 26 percent of respondents say their organization has a policy related to the use of generative AI, with another 23 percent reporting such a policy is under development.

The urgency for establishing clear AI usage guidelines will only rise as the technology continues to accelerate in capability and scope: Already, 55 percent of respondents say that the current output of generative AI tools they’re using matches the quality of an experienced or expert human worker.
The latest workforce survey from The Conference Board was fielded from July 26 to August 13 and polled nearly 1100 US employees—predominantly office workers. Respondents weighed in on how they’re using generative AI, the approach their managers and organizations are taking to the technology, the impact on productivity and job prospects, and more. Key findings include:
AI Adoption and Supervision
In all, 56% of respondents are using generative AI tools for work tasks.

31% report using generative AI on a frequent, regular basis—including daily (9%), weekly (17%), or monthly (5%).
25% say they are using generative AI occasionally.
44% have ne­ver used generative AI.  

Among workers who’ve adopted generative AI, a large majority—71%—say their managers or organizations are aware of their usage.

46% say management is fully aware of their AI use.
25% say management is partially aware.
Just 13% say their managers are not aware.

AI Use Cases and Work Quality
Workers are primarily using generative AI tools for basic, foundational tasks involving text.

Drafting written content (68%), brainstorming ideas (60%), and conducting background research (50%) are the most common use cases.
Far fewer respondents are using generative AI for quantitative and technical tasks—such as analyzing data and making forecasts (19%), generating/checking computer code (11%), or image recognition and generation (7%).  

Most respondents believe the quality of AI output matches that of a seasoned human worker:

45% say quality is equal to an experienced worker.
31% say quality is equal to a novice worker.
10% say quality is equal to an expert worker.

“Generative Al is already delivering work product that meets or exceeds the quality of employees with years of experience—at least on specific tasks,” said Diana Scott, Leader of The Conference Board Human Capital Center. “At the same time, few people we surveyed foresee AI technology as a threat to replace their jobs entirely. Rather, they appear to be embracing AI as a solution for repetitive or tedious parts of their work, freeing up bandwidth for more productive and valuable uses of their time.”
AI Productivity and Job Impact
Most respondents—63%—say generative AI tools have positively impacted their productivity.

7% report a significant increase in productivity.
56% report an increase.
36% report no impact.

Many workers foresee generative AI replacing elements of their job functions—but overwhelmingly in a positive, rather than threatening, way.

33% say AI will replace elements of their job in a positive way—e.g., by freeing up time for more valuable or creative tasks.
Just 4% foresee AI replacing parts of their work in a negative way—e.g., by threatening their job altogether.
24% do not expect AI to replace any element of their job.

AI Organizational Policies
Most workers report that their organizations either don’t have a general policy related to the use of generative AI at work or are still developing one.

34% say their organization does not have an AI policy.
26% say their organization does have an AI policy.
23% say a policy is under development.
17% don’t know.

Adoption of AI is proceeding rapidly—and openly—even in the absence of final organization-wide policies.

Even among organizations that lack an AI policy, 40% of employees still report their managers are fully aware that they’re using AI tools at work.
In organizations with AI policies under development, 53% of workers say their managers are fully aware of their AI use—just a hair under the 56% in companies which have an established, finalized AI policy.

1. Cloud pricing optimization
Organizations are leaning on AI to help reduce cloud costs and to find cost-effective solutions for running cloud applications. Airbnb is one company using AI to optimize pricing on AWS, utilizing AI to manage capacity, to build custom cost and usage data tools, and to optimize storage and computing capacity. Dropbox is another company that is using AI to optimize cloud costs and operational expenditures, reducing its dependency on AWS and saving nearly $75 million in the process. AI tools help companies optimize cloud pricing and spending by identifying cloud usage patterns for improved cost prediction, detecting anomalies in cloud usage, identifying opportunities for saving, and uncovering more cost-effective resources to use.
2. Voice assistants, chatbots, and conversational AI
Conversational AI tools such as chatbots and voice assistants have grown in popularity, making technology more accessible, offering support to customers, and reducing the load on IT support representatives. At Estée Lauder, the company has released a voice-enabled makeup assistant designed to assist visually impaired people with applying makeup. Meanwhile, companies such as Pentagon Credit Union (PenFed) are using chatbots and conversational AI to help customers get answers to common questions faster, reducing the load on customer service reps.
 
 
 













 
 

3. Uptime/reliability optimization
For companies that rely on web services or e-commerce, maintaining uptime and website reliability is a top priority. AI helps organizations achieve this by constantly scanning systems, networks, and processes for inefficiencies, potential disruptions, and to identify any looming threats in a way humans could never accomplish. Nearly all major organizations are employing AI to support their unique uptime and reliability needs. Netflix, Uber, Facebook, Salesforce, AirBnB, and many more are implementing AI to monitor, maintain, and keep their services up and running and available for customers. For companies that offer round-the-clock digital services, using AI can help identify problems before they start, while also reducing instances of crashing, hacking, and human error.
4. Predictive maintenance
At GE, AI is leveraged regularly for predictive maintenance, analyzing data directly from aircraft engines to identify any problems, needed maintenance, and to ensure the overall safety of aircrafts. Rolls-Royce has also found use for AI in predictive maintenance to improve the efficiency of jet engines and reduce the amount of carbon their planes produce, while also streamlining maintenance schedules through predictive analytics. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority is using predictive maintenance to identify potential water main breaks and to monitor performance of collection systems. DC Water even has an AI tool called Pipe Sleuth that can review CCTV footage of sewer pipes to assess their maintenance needs in real-time.  
5. Customer service operations
AI has become a go-to tool for customer service operations, helping organizations ensure customers receive the support they need while alleviating some of the burden on service representatives and call centers. When Lufthansa Group’s business was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, its call centers were overwhelmed with customers trying to navigate cancelled and rescheduled flights, accelerating the company’s move toward digital transformation in these areas. For other companies, AI use in customer service has also been driven by consumer’s increased expectations. McKinsey reports that around 67% of millennials “expect real-time customer service,” and 75% of customers expect a “consistent cross-channel service experience.” Unilever, which is leveraging GPT API to create AI tools to minimize food waste and auto-generate product listings, is also using the API to create a platform that filters emails sent to customer service, sorting spam from legitimate messages, and scaling those up to customer service agents.
 
 
 













 
 

6. Personalization
When you log onto your favorite social media app or streaming service, the experience is tailored to your personal taste and browsing habits — all the way down to the targeted advertisements. AI has helped companies deliver products and content to targeted audiences, ensuring that every app or service you use is personally tailored to the user’s unique interests. Spotify will put you onto a new artist, Amazon will remind you that it’s time to stock up on your most purchased products and suggest related products you may be interested in, and YouTube will deliver a curated feed of content suited to your interests. AI personalization utilizes data, customer engagement, deep learning, natural language processing, machine learning, and more to curate highly tailored experiences to end-users and customers. Retail giant Nordstrom also uses AI in its Nordstrom Analytical Platform (NAP) to gain deeper insights into its customers’ activities and to provide predictions for delivering more personalized experiences for its customers. The company also uses AI to manage inventory control, navigate the fulfillment process, and route orders to the nearest store for customers, among other applications.

7. IT operations management
AI IT operations management (AIOps) tools are growing in popularity. According to a report from OpsRamp, enterprises are using AIOps platforms for intelligent alerting (70%), root cause analysis (57%), anomaly and threat detection (52%), incident auto-remediation (50%), and capacity optimization (27%). Delta Airlines has used AIOps to create a “full-scale digital simulation environment for its global operation,” which the company says is a “first in commercial passenger aviation,” to maintain reliability, especially during inclement weather. The platform analyzes operational data points and uses that to create hypothetical outcomes that help Delta employees make “critical decisions before, during, and after large-scale disruptions,” according to a press release from Delta.
8. Process automation
AI has proved to be an effective tool for automating time-consuming processes that are often prone to human error. By automating processes, organizations can free up employees to work on more complex projects. Atlantic Health System uses process automation to streamline the process of obtaining prior authorizations, sparked by the need to alleviate the increased workload caused during the COVID-19 pandemic. Automating prior authorizations helps speed up the time to treatment, freeing up doctors and nurses to focus on patients, and reduces the manual efforts around obtaining authorization and scheduling appointments. Johnson & Johnson has combined RPA with ML, AI, and task mining to identify and automate complex processes that span across departments. AT&T is another company that has made use of process automation since 2015 to alleviate extensive manual data entry tasks, which has since evolved to streamline several processes across the organization.
 
 
 













 
 

9. Financial reporting and accounting
Intuit is one organization using AI to improve data analysis around financial planning for clients, with over 730 million “AI-driven consumer interactions per year, leading to 58 billion machine learning predictions per day.” Using its own Generative AI Operating System (GenOS) platform, Intuit can implement financial large language models that specialize in tax, accounting, cash flow, and more. This helps reduce repetitive tasks for workers and helps streamline and reduce errors with data entry, transaction categorization, and invoice processing. PWC is using AI similarly, to better inform consulting through natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, model operations, automated ML, digital twins, generative AI, embodied AI, responsible AI, and more. The company is investing $1B over the next three years to “expand and scale” AI capabilities, as it’s clear that more organizations are starting to recognize the benefits of AI for financial reporting and accounting practices.
10. Recruiting/hiring
Amazon is one organization utilizing AI in the hiring process to screen resumes, match candidates with best suited roles, perform initial online candidate assessments, and pass data along to recruiters to make contact with candidates. This is quickly becoming a common practice for organizations to help reduce the manual labor involved in sorting through resumes, thereby speeding up the hiring process and time-to-hire. AI can also be used for conducting initial video interviews. Unilever, which processes over 1.8 million job applications each year, partnered with Pymetrics to build an online platform that can assess candidates over video software. In the second stage of interviews, candidates answer questions for 30 minutes while the software analyzes their body language, facial expressions, and word choice using natural language processing and body language analysis technology. Once employees are in the door, organizations such as Schneider Electric, also use AI to help advance and develop employees careers, matching them with opportunities for continued learning, new projects in the organization, and networking opportunities with thought leaders across the organization. 
11. Safety and quality
AI can help organizations automate and streamline safety and quality assurance processes, ensuring there are fewer risks to the company and consumers, while also ensuring better quality products and services. Boeing is using AI to detect anomalies with aircraft sensors, analyze data collected off aircrafts, and improve overall flight safety. AI can also be integrated into products to better ensure their safety and the safety of the people who use them. Google, for example, has implemented AI safety features to its lineup of Nest products, with the ability to detect intruders as well as smoke or carbon monoxide. It can also use AI to help identify whether there’s an actual emergency or if it’s a false alarm. This year, Boeing also partnered with Shield AI to “explore strategic collaboration in the areas of autonomous capabilities and artificial intelligence on current and future defense programs.” Shield AI has created technology called Hivemind, which enables AI to autonomously fly drones and aircrafts without GPS, communications, or a human pilot.
 
 
 













 
 

12. Workforce schedule optimization
AI has found its way into plenty of processes, helping companies streamline efforts that once took up a lot of time for managers. That’s especially true when it comes to workforce schedule optimization, where AI has helped companies optimize scheduling, considering several factors such as employee availability, customer traffic, and employee skillsets and preferences, all at once to identify the optimum schedule. Companies such as Walmart, Starbucks, Costco, Delta Airlines, Target, and many more use this technology to identify the best schedule for the company’s needs.

The prevailing narrative at the time was that the era of the “average” worker was ending, with machines progressively replacing routine and administrative jobs. Highly skilled professionals were the ones reaping the benefits, as computers made them more productive and enabled them to sell their services locally and around the world. A decade on, what is known as generative AI seems to be disrupting such trends: the era of “average” is making a comeback.Already have an account?Log inContinue with a free trialExplore all our independent journalism for free for one month.

Generative AI Creatives Work



Over the past year, we have seen an explosion in the use of artificial intelligence, or AI, across multiple industries. With all of the advantages that AI has to offer, there is no denying that it is truly transforming the way creatives work. Artificial intelligence has enabled new ways of creating art and copy while freeing professional creatives from mundane or repetitive tasks. It’s also motivating some creatives to reimagine work — reframing challenges through the lens of new AI capabilities and rethinking procedures in current creative processes.
The spotlight on generative AI is only getting brighter, but this new technology poses considerable questions for designers whose primary role is based on creative, compelling visuals.
Will creatives need generative AI to succeed in the future? What sort of prompting will elicit the best generative AI output? Does generative AI even need designers to become and stay meaningful?
AI Disrupting Conventional Methods
Creativity has long been viewed as a uniquely human quality, forging new ways of thinking, unlocking new patterns, and using empathy. With applications like ChatGPT enabling rapid content creation and Midjourney driving an explosion of AI-generated art and images, many worry that human’s claim to creativity may become a thing of the past. In the time since these technologies flooded the market, we are already seeing changes in how people create audio, text, and even written content. The reaction to generative AI is mixed.
Generative AI in Non-Creative Roles
For those outside of traditionally creative professions, generative AI has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for writing, designing, and crossing the boundaries of their creativity. That said, most agree that creative output through AI tools lacks the emotional aspect of content produced by humans and only benefits from human involvement.
Artificial intelligence has wholly disrupted art and copy alike in the content-creation economy.
For individuals who work in content-creation roles — such as copywriters, designers, UX experts, or marketing communications professionals — the introduction of generated AI into creative processes has helped to increase the volume of written content, idea generation, and visual output.
How Generative AI is Changing Creative Work
When it comes to generative AI and creativity, there are several ways that individuals and industries of all sizes are taking advantage of this transformational tool. We see countless businesses utilize artificial intelligence to own and accelerate the end-to-end process. Generative AI is expanding how we create by empowering businesses, from ideas to tests to personalization for every customer.
Artificial intelligence has eliminated some technical constraints for those with more ideas than resources, allowing creatives to design and execute complete experiments without relying on an entire team to accomplish them. As more individuals turn to artificial intelligence, we will continue to see a rapid iteration in creativity.
The Benefits of Generative AI and Creativity
1. Increased productivity: Artificial intelligence allows creators to increase the number of images and words created instantly. Many individuals utilize this technology at all content-creation stages, from start to finish.
2. Overcoming creative blocks: Many find that artificial intelligence enables them to fill in the gaps when creating alternative product versions. AI effectively allows creatives to overcome production bottlenecks and combat unavailable resources with little effort.
3. More sophisticated options: Given the speed of artificial intelligence, creatives can generate words, content, and even code at a much higher volume. This gives them many different ways to create art in the digital space.
4. Idea generation: We’ve all experienced brain fog or struggles while brainstorming ideas for content. With artistic creativity in artificial intelligence, AI can provide creatives with various ideas for any project, allowing professionals to work more efficiently.
5. Automation: Through pattern-driven design — such as subject lines, header image creation, old images, meta descriptions, and even module designs — we can expect some sense of automation moving forward.
Generative AI will continue to actively learn from prompts and inputs, evolving through increased use from those committed to understanding how to work with AI models and derive value from AI. Regarding the future of creative work, we expect artificial intelligence to enhance, rather than replace, human-generated content.
What to Watch For in Generative AI Models
In the short term, how creatives interact with AI models will also change. By refining our interactions, creatives will steer AI models to produce more consistent, desired outcomes that meet brand standards, achieve communication goals, and cater to specific challenges and business needs.
We’ll evolve from simply generating more art and copy to creating valuable, usable assets. You only need a creative mind, access to AI tools, and an openness to exploring AI to get there.
Very soon after, how we frame and phrase problems and challenges to AI will become more critical than prompting. As AI learns, it becomes more intuitive and adept at understanding natural language. Problem formulation — the ability to identify, analyze, and describe problems — will move the forefront of interactions with AI. And this should feel familiar: We no longer need to put search terms in parentheses or use keywords to surface relevant content on the internet.
The Future and Beyond
Finally, digital asset management may become challenging due to the significant increase in digital assets created by artificial intelligence and limited documentation around ownership since it’s so new. Plan on discussing the governance and maintenance of content if you’re starting to use generative AI at work. You’ll want to think through content ownership and attribution, storage, and licensing terms (similar to rights-managed content). Work with your legal team so they can develop a point of view and terms of service, especially if you’re at an agency doing work on behalf of a client.
Artificial intelligence allows you to make more personalized and relevant content, which can benefit everyone around you. We expect that a hybrid approach to creation will be the future norm. Undoubtedly, it will be fascinating to see the value of “human-made.” As more and more people continue to utilize artificial intelligence, it will become less of a disruptor. People will likely boost productivity while viewing it more as a creative partner than a complete replacement.
Moving forward, independent contractors and agencies adopting AI early on are more likely to stand the best chance of success as the economy evolves. If you are a creator who is curious about AI, now is a perfect opportunity to step up and stand out as an emerging expert in this exciting field.

What Is Generative AI: A super-Simple Explanation Anyone Can UnderstandAdobe Stock

Just like it sounds, it's AI that can create, from words and images to videos, music, computer applications, and even entire virtual worlds.

What makes generative AI different and special is that it puts the power of machine intelligence in the hands of just about anyone.

We're used to using AI-powered applications and tools in our everyday lives. Google uses it to find the information we need; Amazon uses it to suggest things we should buy; Netflix uses it to recommend movies; Spotify uses it for music - it's all powered by AI.

But the new generation of generative AI tools goes even further, giving us the power to build and create in amazing ways. With a little practice, we can even use them to build our own AI-powered apps and tools. Because it breaks down the technical barriers, it can truly be seen as the beginning of the long-awaited democratization of AI.
So, in this article, I'll give an overview in simple terms to show why it's so powerful and what you can do with it. I'll also take a non-technical look at how it works, but most importantly, I'll explain why it's going to change the world and what everyone should be doing to prepare for it.

The term AI, as it's used today, refers to computer algorithms that can effectively simulate human cognitive processes - learning, decision-making, problem-solving, and even creativity.
It's this last and perhaps most human quality where generative AI comes into the picture. Like all modern AI, generative AI models are trained on data. They then use that data to create more data, following the rules and patterns they've learned.

For example, if you train it on pictures of cats, it will learn that a cat has four legs, two ears, and a tail. Then, you can tell it to generate its own picture of a cat, and it will come up with as many variations as you need, all following those basic rules.
One distinction that's worth understanding is the difference between generative AI and discriminative (or predictive) AI. Discriminative AI focuses mainly on classification, learning the difference between ""things"" - cats and dogs, for example. This is what's used in recommendation engines like those used by Netflix or Amazon to distinguish between things you might want to watch or buy and things you're unlikely to be interested in. Or in navigation apps to distinguish between good routes from A to B and ones you should probably avoid.
Generative AI, instead, focuses on understanding patterns and structure in data and using that to create new data that looks like it.

So What Can Generative AI Do?
The first use cases for generative AI typically involved creating text and images, but as the technology has become more sophisticated, a world of possibilities has opened up. Here are some of them:
Images: Many generative AI tools – such as Midjourney or Stable Diffusion – can take a natural language (i.e., a human language) prompt and use it to generate a picture. Tell it you want an image of a two-headed dog wearing an Elvis costume flying a spaceship into a black hole and watch as it (or something close to it) appears before your eyes.
Text: ChatGPT is probably responsible for kicking off the intense hype surrounding generative AI at the moment, but there are other generative text tools like Google’s Bard and Meta’s Llama. They can be used to write anything from essays and articles to plays, poems and novels.
Coding: As well as ChatGPT, tools like Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot and Amazon’s CodeWhisperer make it easy for anyone to generate computer code with very little technical knowledge.
Audio: Generative AI tools can create human-like voices (voice synthesis), allowing computers to speak words that have never before been uttered by a human, as well as music and sound effects.
Video: While not yet as advanced as text or image generation, tools are beginning to emerge that allow us to create and edit video simply by describing what we want to see.
Data augmentation: Generative AI makes it easy to create entirely synthetic data sets for use in training other AI models that follow real-world rules without conferring privacy and data security obligations on those who store and use it.
Virtual environments: Think of virtual reality (VR) environments or video game worlds that can be explored and interacted with, or the rather hyped-up concept of the metaverse. Designing these is a highly complex task that can be greatly accelerated with the help of generative AI.

How Does It Work?
Like all of the AI we see today, generative AI grew out of a field of AI study and practice called machine learning (ML).
While traditional computer algorithms are coded by a human to tell a machine exactly how to do a particular job, ML algorithms get better at their jobs the more data they are fed.
Put a bunch of these algorithms together in a way that allows them to generate new data based on what they've learned, and you get a model - essentially an engine tuned to generate a particular type of data.
Some examples of models used in generative AI applications include:
Large Language Models (LLMs) - By ingesting large amounts of text, they learn the semantic relationships between words and use that data to generate more language. An example of an LLM is GPT-4, created by OpenAI, which powers the ChatGPT tool.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - These work by pitting two competing algorithms against each other, one tasked with generating data that resembles its training data and another tasked with trying to tell whether the output is real or generated. This type of generative model is typically used to create images, sounds, or even video.
Variational Autoencoders - This is a type of model that learns how data is constructed by encoding it in a simple way that captures its essential characteristics and then figuring out how to reconstruct it. It's often used to generate synthetic data.
Diffusion models - These work by adding random data (known as ""noise"") to the data it's learning about, then figuring out how to remove it while preserving the original data - thus learning what's important and what can be discarded. Diffusion models are most commonly used in image generation.
Transformer Models - This is something of an umbrella term for a group of models that includes LLMs but covers any model that works by learning the context and relationships between different elements in its training data.

Generative AI in Practice
There are already many incredible examples of generative AI being used to create amazing (and sometimes terrible) things.
Take Coca-Cola’s Masterpiece advert, for example – a collaborative creation between human artists and AI that brings many of history’s greatest works of art to life on the screen in a way that’s never been done before.
It’s also been used to create a new Beatles song by rebuilding partially recorded lyrics by John Lennon, combined with new material by Paul McCartney.
Generative design is a term for an emerging field where generative AI is used to create blueprints and production processes for new products. For example, General Motors used generative tools created by Autodesk to design a new seatbelt bracket that’s 40% lighter and 20% stronger than its existing components.
And it’s also being used to speed up drug discovery, with one UK company recently announcing that it’s created the world’s first AI-generated immunotherapy cancer treatment.
Generative AI is also the technology behind the recent phenomena of deepfakes, which blur the lines between reality and fiction by making it appear as if real people have done or said fake things.
Deepfake Tom Cruise was one of the earliest and most famous examples. More insidiously, potential candidates on both sides of the upcoming 2024 US presidential elections have starred in deepfakes aimed to discredit them for political ends.
And while spreading propaganda is bad enough, there are also outright criminal uses - including attempts to extort money by staging hoax kidnappings using cloned voices and fraudulently scamming money by posing as a company CEO.

The Ethical Questions Around Generative AI
While generative AI is clearly capable of amazing things, it's clear that its existence is forcing us to confront some difficult issues and questions.
Perhaps one of the biggest is when we will get to the point where it's impossible to tell the difference between what's real and what's generated by AI.
Given the incredibly rapid pace of innovation in the field, it's likely to happen sooner rather than later.
Which leads to the question of what (if anything) we should do about it. Countries, including China, have already passed legislation making it illegal to deepfake people without their consent – should the world follow suit?
And then there's the question of how this will affect human jobs - will the livelihoods of creators be threatened if the companies that employ them can create as many images, sounds and videos as they need just by telling a computer to do it?
Another issue that needs to be addressed is copyright. If an AI is used to create a work of art, who owns it? The person who used the AI to create the art? The creator of the AI itself? Or all the (probably) thousands of artists whose work was used (in practice, often without permission) to train the AI?
All of these questions need to be answered - and, given the accelerating pace at which this technology is being developed, soon. How we answer them may well play an important role in determining the future of generative AI in society and in our lives.

GitLab (GTLB) helps make the software development process easier, faster, cheaper and more secure. The company is now infusing generative AI across its DevSecOps platform.

GitLab’s platform delivers enhanced operational efficiency by doing away with time-consuming manual work, increasing productivity and boosting software development velocity. Security is an important element in modern software development. GitLab embeds protection early in the development process, leading to improved security, quality and overall compliance.


GitLab eliminates the need for numerous point solutions. This cuts down on costs. DevOps used to be made up solely of teams using a bunch of different tools. The problem with all of these point solutions is they don’t work well together, meaning there isn’t much actual collaboration taking place. Trying to manually integrate all of these tools makes things even worse—leading to longer development times, higher costs and poor user experiences.

GitLab operates in a total addressable market worth an estimated $40 billion. The company competes mainly with homegrown DevOps as well as Microsoft’s GitHub unit. There’s plenty of upside potential, as GitLab and GitHub combined control less than 5% of the overall market. Gartner forecasts that 75% of all organizations by 2027 will have switched to a DevOps platform from multiple point solutions, a big jump from 25% today.

PROMOTED
Before the end of this year, GitLab will start to monetize its various AI capabilities. The company’s Code Suggestions functionality, which uses generative AI to recommend code to developers, will be priced at $9 a month per user.
The company currently has 10 AI capabilities in its GitLab Duo suite. The Suggested Reviewers AI feature, now bundled into the Ultimate tier (priced at $99 a month per user), is a workflow tool that helps developers find the right person to review code, a task that’s critically important when it comes to getting software to market promptly. Suggested Reviewers already has more than 100,000 users. Another key AI capability, Explain This Vulnerability, provides developers with details related to security vulnerabilities discovered in code.

GitLab’s AI advancements are part of a growing set of positives at the company. In fiscal Q2 (July), GitLab closed its largest DevSecOps deal ever—a multi-year arrangement worth over $30 million with a major multinational company. This customer was at the end of the third year of a five-year contract with GitLab when it saw the savings it was realizing by using the company’s platform and decided to sign up for another five years, according to GitLab CFO Brian Robins.

In FQ2, GitLab added 409 new base customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of at least $5,000, a bump up from 404 additions in the previous quarter. There are now 7,815 total base customers, up 33% from the year-ago level. The company gained 50 customers with ARR above $100,000, bringing this customer segment to 810 accounts, up 37% year over year.
The new GitLab Dedicated offering looks promising. It’s a single-tenant DevSecOps SaaS platform aimed at larger organizations in highly regulated industries that have complex compliance and security requirements. Now generally available, Dedicated is fully deployed and managed by GitLab. For customers, the product offers the control and compliance of a self-hosted solution, while saving them the operating costs associated with self-management.
Following the release of the FQ2 report in early September, TD Cowen raised its GitLab price target to $63 from $56 because it thinks the company’s DevSecOps value proposition is resonating well with customers. The firm was encouraged by an improvement in customer expansions in the latest quarter.
Barclays lifted its target to $65 from $60, saying the solid FQ2 earnings report reassured investors. The firm noted that GitLab is starting to benefit from the recent price uplift for the Premium tier (now $29 a month per user, up from $19 previously).
Last week, GitLab received two positive Wall Street initiations. Bernstein started coverage at ‘Outperform’ with a price target of $62. The firm says GitLab is one of only a few developer tool companies operating at scale and with strong competitive durability.
Bernstein believes GitLab over the next two years is capable of growing as much as 2x faster than Wall Street anticipates. For fiscal 2025 (Jan.), the latest consensus revenue estimate of $722.9 million represents growth of 29.5%. Plus, the firm sees a roadmap to a 30% operating margin based on GitLab’s operating leverage.
Canaccord started GitLab at ‘Buy’ with a price target of $62, saying the company’s DevSecOps platform cohesion creates a rare opportunity to capture value in the evolving market. The firm likes GitLab’s best-in-class gross retention rate and strong pricing power.

         Making AI work for you: Best practices for tax professionals








A collaborative future with AI




The dawn of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked concerns across various industries about the potential replacement of human workers with machines. With the recent release of tools like ChatGPT, apprehensions about job security are growing among many professionals, including those in the tax and accounting space.
By definition, AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, decision-making, and problem-solving. When it comes to the tax and accounting space, AI can essentially do the work of a human professional in preparing an individual’s tax returns or auditing a business of virtually any size.
Scary, right? But, if we think back to several years ago, tax software solutions that streamlined an accountant’s workflow begged the same question: will technology replace my job? The answer has been just the opposite. Tax preparation software has shifted the work of today’s tax and accounting professionals—from mundane data entry to more meaningful and strategic work.
Now, with the power of AI, today’s tax professionals can take these advantages to the next level.
Job security: AI is an enhancement, not a replacement
Contrary to the fears of job displacement, AI in the tax world does not necessarily mean the replacement of human tax professionals. Rather, it means the transformation of work—for the better.
Let’s take a look at some of the many ways AI can enhance the work of tax professionals.

Automation of repetitive tasks. AI can handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks like data entry, data validation, and basic calculations, freeing up tax professionals to focus on higher-value activities such as strategic tax planning and client interaction.
Improved accuracy. AI can significantly reduce the risk of human error by performing calculations and cross-referencing data with precision, leading to more accurate tax returns.
Enhanced compliance. AI can continuously monitor and analyze changes in tax laws and regulations, helping tax professionals stay updated and ensuring their clients’ compliance with the latest rules.
Data analysis and insights. AI can analyze vast amounts of financial data to identify patterns, trends, and potential deductions that may go unnoticed by manual practices. This can lead to better tax-saving opportunities for clients.
Skill enhancement. AI can be a valuable tool for tax professionals to enhance their skills and knowledge. It can assist in research and analysis, allowing professionals to provide more informed advice to their clients.
A client-centric approach. Instead of replacing client relationships, AI can complement them. AI-driven analytics provide clients with personalized tax strategies tailored to their unique financial situations and long-term financial goals.

Making AI work for you: Best practices for tax professionals
When introducing new AI technologies into your daily tax workflow, it’s often smart to start with small-scale implementations and gradually build them into your tech stack. Like any workplace change, integrating AI typically works best when it is phased in at a manageable pace.
Think about your existing workflow. Is there a specific problem or challenge you’d like to address? Or maybe a step you’d like to enhance? While AI isn’t an all-knowing solution, it is an enabler for problem-solving. So, start by identifying a need and explore AI-driven solutions that will help you tackle it.
Here’s an example. Like most professional services, tax preparation comes with tedious data entry work that, while often mundane, must be done quickly and accurately. This is a great opportunity to showcase the value of AI. By automating manual data entry tasks, you can shift your focus to high-value advisory services that boost client relationships and growth.
A major benefit of AI also lies in its ability to process massive data sets quickly. The breadth of these data sets can range from financial statements and reports to emails and even social media content. That means tax professionals now have the ability to quickly consume these data sets using techniques like predictive analytics and anomaly detection. The result is insight into patterns, trends, and potential deductions that can lead to tax-saving opportunities for your clients.
In addition, AI can also help improve how tax and accounting professionals communicate with clients. Natural language reports and summaries can be generated from a client’s numerical data sets, opening up new opportunities for client engagement and relationship-building. Plus, AI’s natural language generation can provide effective chatbot user interfaces derived directly from its data sources.
In short, AI is a transformative tool for tax professionals, enabling a pathway toward a leaner, more productive, and, ultimately, more profitable business.
A collaborative future with AI
There is no doubt that the tax and accounting profession is in the midst of profound change, and concerns about job security are understandable. However, AI presents an enormous opportunity for tax professionals to harness its power and enhance the quality of client service—from automating manual tasks to delivering real-time tax insights to providing tailored financial guidance.
So what are you waiting for? By adopting AI and incorporating best practices, the possibilities for tax professionals are boundless.

NYC ban on ChatGPT in public schools repealed as students return to class.
Artificial intelligence could be a useful tool for teachers.
Videos spreading misinformation to children on YouTube were generated by AI.

Just under a year ago, artificial intelligence in education was the cause of massive angst in schools. Initially, the advent of generative AI was deemed a major threat – New York City public schools banned ChatGPT from in-school devices a week after its launch.
Now, as students are returning for a new school year, the early alarm felt by educators has given way to pragmatism and more understanding of the ways that generative AI will impact the classroom.    
David Banks, the chancellor of New York City Public Schools, wrote that the district was now “determined to embrace” generative AI.

One reason that the AI-hysteria has lessened is a better understanding of its weaknesses. Its tendency to “hallucinate” or fabricate information have somewhat assuaged fears that it would enable rampant cheating and plagiarism; there are pretty obvious tells that a piece of writing was generated by artificial intelligence.
Students have also been handing in work with citations that don’t exist, though in fairness, lawyers have done this too.
Artificial intelligence in education isn’t a new thing – for the past decade it’s been used by systems like Carnegie Learning and Aleks to analyze student response to questions and adapt learning materials to meet their individual needs.
Generative AI is what caused the spike of alarm, but it can also be employed as part of a curriculum. No doubt, education will be disrupted by artificial intelligence, but can it be harnessed, rather than regarded as hostile?

Seven months ago, artficial education in education was seen by many as the enemy.
Using AI in education
The most direct application for generative AI chatbots in education is in translation and language learning. At one point, stocks in Duolingo dropped due to investors’ fears that users would use the free option of ChatGPT rather than the app. Instead, Duolingo began integrating ChatGPT features into the app.
Source: IEEE Spectrum.
In March 2023, the company launched Duolingo Max, which uses GPT-4 technology to add two new features to Duolingo Super. Those features explain wrong answers to users and offer a role-playing feature that allows users to practice conversations in different scenarios.
As well as the use of chatbots to outsource homework and essay tasks, generative AI also offers benefits for students learning to write – or write more clearly. Grammarly is a well-known tool that uses AI to help users with their writing.
ChatGPT and others can rewrite, edit, or make changes to documents as needed. Alternatively, it might be used by creative writers to generate prompts, dialogue and story ideas. Teachers could also use it in this way when setting tasks.
Generative AI could be to the literary world what the calculator is to mathematics: providing aid in the tedious parts of the work and allowing for more to be achieved, despite specialists arguing that the tedious parts are significant to an understanding of the whole.
They’re playing *educational* games, they promise! Source: Shutterstock.
In early childhood education, AI can be used to create interactive games to teach children academic and social skills. It can also be used to power monitoring systems that track children’s behavior and provide insights into their development.
As with every sector, there’s a dark cloud over the ease that AI can bring to a job: if you can use it, what’s stopping your employer cutting out the middleman and giving a chatbot your job title?
Luckily for human beings with mortgages or rents to pay, although AI is useful in some educational settings, it’s not likely to replace teachers anytime soon. The pandemic proved the value of human-to-human, in-school learning. Still, AI is a helpful tool for teachers and, at the very least, saves time on admin, which can be redirected to more valuable tasks.
READ NEXTHere’s the latest: AI income, regulation and infighting
The tasks that AI programs like ChatGPT can help with include creating lesson plans, assisting with grading papers and homework, offering personalized help to students, and even creating videos from textbooks.
Plagiarism isn’t a new problem
Plagiarism did not just pop out of thin air the day OpenAI launched ChatGPT. It has always been a consideration that teachers have had to adapt to. In fact, even in the world of generative AI, it still depends on a very human impulse – the moment at which someone decides to take what isn’t their own and present it as though it is.
That hasn’t stopped a widespread pushback against the bots using material from the internet for training.
Turnitin, a plagiarism checker, has developed an AI detection tool that highlights which portions of a piece of writing may have been generated by AI. After reviewing more than 65 million submissions, it found that 10.3 percent of those contained AI writing in potentially more than 20 percent of their work.
There is a four percent false positive on its detector. Because of this, Turnitin recommends educators have conversations with students, rather than instantly failing them or making immediate accusations based on the checker’s results. “It’s just supposed to be information for the educator to decide what they want to do with it,” says Annie Chechitelli, Turnitin’s chief product officer. “It is not perfect.”
AI: exposing education
One argument is that AI is highlighting the flaws in the education system. Its ability to pass assessments doesn’t reflect the ‘intelligence’ of machine learning, but our failure to build education systems that nurture and value unique human intelligence.
A tool like ChatGPT has no understanding or knowledge – at least, not yet. It just collates text input based on statistics. For more on this, Google-search ‘stochastic parrots.’
‘Painting’ generated by AI. Dare we suggest it be named “Stochastic Parrot”?
The academic success of artificial intelligence in educational assessments demonstrates that they don’t test knowledge and understanding, but rather whether students have collected and memorized information.
Teachers are designing lesson plans specifically with this in mind. If a chatbot can easily churn out decent work in response to assignments, they might need adjusting: Educators may try giving their assignments to a chatbot to see what’s generated, says Emily Isaacs, executive director of the Office for Faculty Excellence at Montclair State University in New Jersey.
Lisa Parry, a K–12 school principal and AP English Language and Composition teacher in rural Arlington, South Dakota, told Wired that she plans to have her English students use ChatGPT as “a search engine on steroids” to help brainstorm essay topics. “ChatGPT has great power to do good, and it has power to undermine what we’re trying to do here academically,” she says. “But I don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.”
To stay ahead of AI in education, the sector will have to radically rethink what education is for and how success is measured.
Artificial intelligence in education, education on AI
Another key change will be the need to educate children (and their parents, and their teachers!) on AI. In Japan, regulations stressing the importance of students understanding artificial intelligence have already been enforced.
Savior? Destroyer? Who can tell the future of artificial intelligence in education?
Key to effective use of AI is critical thinking – something that generative chatbots haven’t shown much skill at yet. Not only will tasks set to test it make it harder for students to use chatbots to complete work, but critical thinking will (hopefully) slow the spread of misinformation that AI has accelerated.
The trouble is that children aren’t equipped to distinguish fact from fake. Investigative BBC journalists found more than 50 YouTube channels in more than 20 languages spreading disinformation disguised as STEM [Science Technology Engineering Maths] content.
The videos included pseudo-science, false information and conspiracies. YouTube recommends these videos alongside legitimate educational content – and videos tagged as “educational content” are more likely to be recommended to children.
Revenue on YouTube videos incentivizes creators to chase as many views as possible, and to use AI to generate so-called educational content, which will be pushed by the algorithm and shown to children all over the world.
As part of their experiment, the journalists shared some of the recommended false science content to two groups of 10-12-year-olds – one in the UK and one in Thailand.
When the journalists then explained to the children those videos were made using AI and contained false information, they were shocked.
READ NEXTAI is in the news but should it be reading it?
“I’m actually really confused. I thought it was real,” said one boy. Another said: “I would’ve probably believed it, if you hadn’t told us it was fake.”
“These videos do well because they are conspiratorial [suggesting they are exposing a secret most people don’t know about],” says Professor Vicki Nash, Director of the Oxford Internet Institute. “We are all fascinated by things that run counter to what we’re officially told, and children are more susceptible to this than adults.”
As AI tools continue to improve, misleading content will become easier to create and the quality of the videos will no longer indicate whether they are artificially generated content. The waters get muddier still if we think about some of the potential uses of AI in educational settings.
If a teacher generates a video summary from a textbook, the robotic voice-over and simple animations of an AI-generated clip will become synonymous with educational resources. As artificial intelligence in education becomes more and more the norm, we run the risk of making students less and less wary of AI-generated content over time, irrespective of the facts of the real world.

Could AI be a disruptive but positive influence on the education system?

Among the sectors, the manufacturing sector is poised to reap substantial benefits, with a potential value capture of USD 270-460 billion. Major manufacturers from the automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor industries have already embraced Generative AI, focusing on key areas such as Personalization, Design, Automation, and Optimization.Generative AI Use Cases in Manufacturing & ProductionIn this article, we’ll explore some interesting generative AI applications for manufacturing & production. We’ll also showcase real-world case studies to illustrate how manufacturers are leveraging Generative AI to transform their production processes.Virtual assistants for the Production teamManufacturing and production engineers spend 40% of their time on non-value-added tasks such as information search and data checks. Generative AI offers a solution by enabling manufacturing firms to develop virtual assistants for engineers. These AI assistants can assist in information retrieval and data analysis through natural language conversations.Automated machine data analysisA McKinsey study finds that just 0.5% of machine data gets analyzed, citing challenges in data quality, data volume, complexity, and analytics expertise. Generative AI offers a solution by automating data processing, uncovering patterns, and detecting anomalies in machine data. This helps manufacturing firms prevent equipment failures, improve quality control, and boost employee productivity.Automated Production reportsAccording to Gartner, employees spend an average of 10 hours per week on production report creation. This time investment varies based on factors such as process complexity, factory size, data automation, and reporting tools. Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating data analysis and report generation. It can directly connect to the production systems, process large volumes of data rapidly, and generate comprehensive reports with minimal human intervention.Gen AI-based production planning & schedulingOver 70% of manufacturers grapple with production planning and scheduling challenges, leading to lost sales, elevated costs, and customer dissatisfaction. Key hurdles include data complexity, diverse systems, and manual processes. Generative AI emerges as a transformative solution, automating scenario planning and scheduling. By incorporating scenario simulation, complex optimization, real-time adaptation, and continuous improvement capabilities, manufacturers can enhance planning quality and overcome these challenges effectively.Synthetic Machine data generationPredictive maintenance models require access to large amounts of data to create AI/ML models. This data can be difficult to obtain, especially for older assets that have not been equipped with sensors. AI-generated synthetic data can be used to supplement real data when there is not enough data available to train a predictive maintenance model. This can be the case for older assets that don’t have adequate sensors, or for assets that are operating in harsh environments where data collection is difficult.Generative AI: Real World Case Studies in Manufacturing  Discover how manufacturers are reshaping production with successful Gen AI implementationsM&M deployed Gen AI-powered Virtual assistants for the production team to reduce downtime Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), a leading automotive manufacturer, has leveraged generative AI to empower its workforce. By aggregating technical data and maintenance records of industrial robots, M&M developed a Virtual Assistant using LLMs. This tool equips production teams to swiftly address technical issues by querying them with error codes. The Virtual Assistant then provides step-by-step instructions, reducing machine downtime and expediting issue resolution.BMW utilizes Generative AI to optimize manufacturing operationsBMW Group has implemented a Quantum-Inspired Generative Model, known as generator-enhanced optimization (GEO) for plant scheduling. In this novel approach, classic optimization solvers first analyze data and generate schedules. Then, GEO’s quantum-inspired generative models refine these results. Notably, GEO often surpasses traditional solvers by minimizing assembly line idle time while meeting monthly vehicle production targets.Merck creates synthetic images using generative AI for defect detectionMerck, a global pharmaceutical leader, has harnessed generative AI to tackle the common challenge of limited training data for AI/ML models. Facing the shortage of defect images for inspections worldwide, Merck’s AI Engineers leveraged generative AI techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders. They created synthetic defect image data for complex defects. These synthetic images played a critical role in training defect detection models, resulting in remarkable accuracy improvements and a significant reduction in time-to-market for new models.Hitachi leverages Generative AI to train new workers in maintenance & manufacturing.Hitachi, a major equipment manufacturer taps into generative artificial intelligence to transfer expert skills in maintenance and manufacturing to younger workers to mitigate the impact of mass retirements. The AI system generates training videos depicting challenges and accidents in sectors like railways and power stations by simulating real-life scenarios on screens in a 10-square-meter room, providing immersive training experiences for their employees.Sereact is giving vision to warehouse robots through Generative AISereact is a leading provider of AI-based robotic solutions provider based out of Germany. Sereact revolutionizes warehouse operations by enabling robots to autonomously perform “pick-and-pack” tasks, which typically account for 55% of warehouse costs. Unlike competitors, Sereact employs a transformer model, trained on billions of simulated images. This image-trained model also interacts with a language model, which allows the operator to type in text commands to a chat interface, which will automatically create a plan of action for the robot to complete its task.ConclusionGenerative AI is not just a fleeting trend; it’s going to be a permanent fixture in the manufacturing landscape. Its potential spans R&D, Innovation, Production, Quality, Sales and commercial, IT, and Customer Experience. However, there’s no one-size-fits-all formula for choosing generative AI use cases. Success lies in identifying the right applications based on your AI maturity level. Begin with small POCs and less complex use cases, then scale up. Prioritize assessing business impact, AI readiness, and data readiness before embarking on Gen AI endeavors.

											Karen Dahut, CEO for Google Public Sector speaks at FedTalks in Washington, D.C.										





Government agencies are demonstrating the power of generative artificial intelligence to improve communications and mission outcomes with citizens and employees, Google Public Sector CEO Karen Dahut said during an on-stage interview at FedScoop’s FedTalks in Washington, D.C.
Dahut acknowledged that there are still a lot of questions government leaders are asking about how to properly implement the technology across the government space. Among them, she said, is how to implement AI capabilities into mission activities while protecting agency data.
“Google is the first cloud provider to develop world-class generative AI enterprise tools—like Vertex AI—which allows you to create a special and unique enclave for your data, so your data isn’t exposed to the public,” she explained.
Citizen engagement
Dahut touched on ways government agencies are implementing generative AI tools to improve how citizens engage with public services.
For example, in Dearborn, Michigan, where 48% of the population is non-English speaking, city officials implemented a translation AI tool powered by Google Cloud Contact Center AI (CCAI) to help its citizens access information.
“The city has a long history of immigration and bringing people from across the globe to work in the car industry in Dearborn,” she explained. “They’re U.S. citizens. They just happen to speak Arabic, Spanish and French as their primary languages. And so now they can engage with their government in a really meaningful way.”
At a time when there is a lot of public attention on the role of government, Dahut stressed the importance of modernizing access to services as a method of trust-building between government and citizens.
Employee empowerment
Another benefit Dahut touched on is the idea that generative AI “empowers government employees with AI superpowers.”
She cited two new products that can assist with, and expedite, certain workflows. The first, Duet AI, is an “always on assistant” that is trained to help employees be more productive on Google Workspace, for example, by pulling together a presentation or creating content. And second, she said, is Codey, a generative AI tool that assists with developing or correcting code in more than 20 different programming languages.
“Generative AI is going to be the thing that drives digital transformation across government, because it’s going to require cloud services, it’s going to require the data enterprise to be applied and available to you, and I do think that it will enable and empower digital transformation,” Dahut stressed.
Getting started
Dahut shared her experience working with customers on implementing generative AI projects and concluded that organizations that engage in a long process to develop an AI strategy will quickly find three things that tend to stand in their way—technology, trust and having the right talent.
“I always say, let’s just get started. Let’s just go!”
Dahut explained that there are always people within an organization who want to use the latest technologies that can fit within the organization’s current reference architectures, and they can produce good results on a small scale.
Getting started on small ideations and small innovations can help drive an organization’s modernization strategy in a meaningful way, she said.

Why are AI prompt engineers in such high demand? (Image – Shutterstock)
AI prompt engineers: The most wanted job in techBy Aaron Raj






AI prompt engineers design, develop, and refine generative AI text prompts for various applications.There are many courses available for prompt engineering todayGenerative AI tools provide the best results with the right prompt. While artificial intelligence (AI) is about automating tasks and making work more straightforward, many still struggle to understand how to use the technology properly. Generative AI tools, which have seen enormously broad adoption in businesses around the world, can enhance productivity.However, to get the most out of the technology, it has to be appropriately used by the organization. Large language models (LLMs) are advanced conversation partners that use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and generate human-like text. That is the basis of generative AI.Remember MS-DOS? You needed to prompt the command correctly to access a particular program. In some way, that’s precisely where some see generative AI being at this point. While any prompt will generate a reply, the real question is, can companies afford to spend much time to get the correct information from the AI?GARTNER: CHATGPT HAS PROMPTED INCREASE IN AI INVESTMENTSAaron Raj | 8 May, 2023  Take OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example. To get a reply to a query, a user would need to prompt ChatGPT with a question or instructions. While ChatGPT can provide an answer, it may not be the desired result the user is seeking.This is where prompt engineering comes in. The Guardian defines prompt engineering as a technique for effectively communicating with generative AI models. AI prompt engineering is the process of structuring text (commands or instructions) that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. Generative AI models provide results based on their prompts. A weak or incomplete prompt may not give the desired outcome and require more attempts at refining the prompt.Just as with any technology, without guidance or instructions, it will not know what it is required to do. Even robots need instructions on their work or are programmed to work based on the instructions given. For generative AI tools, without prompt engineering, the technology would not be able to work as it should.A Tweet by OpenAI’s Sam Altman on prompt engineering.The need for AI prompt engineersBusinesses worldwide that have invested in generative AI tools now realize that prompting the technology is not as easy as it seems. While any employee can type out a prompt, to get the best results, a company would need to have a prompt expert. As such, the role of AI prompt engineer has quickly evolved into being.SALESFORCE BETS BIG ON EINSTEIN AND AIAaron Raj | 18 September, 2023AI prompt engineers are focused on and responsible for working with cross-functional teams to design prompts for generative AI, discuss product development, and identify the uses of AI tools. Put simply, AI prompt engineers design, develop, and refine generative AI text prompts for various applications.While the role sounds simple, finding the right AI prompt engineers is a challenge for most organizations today. Most companies realize the need to hire AI prompt engineers after heavily investing in generative AI tools but still failing to get the most value out of their investment.According to a study by Workyard, AI prompt engineers top the list of the most in-demand jobs in tech today. The list is based on evaluating data from Google searches, LinkedIn, and Indeed job openings and the number of professionals currently available.
AI prompt engineers are in high demand. (Image – Shutterstock)Becoming an AI prompt engineerFrom OpenAI to Stanford University, many online courses are available today on how to become an AI prompt engineer. However, most organizations feel that soft skills are more critical to the role than technical skills.This includes communication and organizational skills. Communication skills are the most important, as the role involves constantly communicating with the AI and with teams. An AI prompt engineer must be precise and clear in their prompts. It’s all about perfecting the details and depth of each prompt to get the best result.HERE’S HOW AI ASSISTANTS ARE MAKING WORK EASIERAaron Raj | 5 September, 2023Another critical skill is subject matter expertise. For example, an AI prompt engineer in a healthcare facility using AI would need to understand health jargon to ensure a smooth process.In a LinkedIn post, Vaikuntan Rajaratnam, hand surgeon, medical educator, and instructional designer, explained that prompt engineering in healthcare would mean designing prompts that help AI models generate differential diagnoses, propose treatment options, or even draft patient communication materials.“Prompt engineering represents a fascinating convergence of technology and healthcare, offering new avenues for enhanced care delivery. As with any technological advancement, the key to effective integration lies in education, skill development, and ethical considerations. Healthcare professionals, armed with the dual expertise of their domain and AI capabilities, can act as the much-needed bridge between technological possibility and ethical effective care delivery,” said Rajaratnam.So you think you want to be an AI prompt engineer?(Source: @RavitJain)Will technology perfect prompt engineering?As the demand for AI prompt engineers increases, technology is also evolving a way of solving the problem. A report by ZDNet highlighted that Google’s DeepMind unit researchers have created a program called OPRO. OPRO makes LLM try different prompts until they reach one that gets closest to solving a task. Put simply, it automates the trial-and-error process of prompting.In a research paper, the team stated that OPRO is expected to optimize anything with a language model. This makes the program produce better answers, which not only saves time for businesses but also could reduce the reliance on AI prompt engineers in the future.Thankfully as far as AI prompt engineers are concerned, this macine-led obsolescence may take some time to deliver, so for now, the role of AI prompt engineers remains firmly in demand, with some companies offering up to US$300k in salary.

Software giant Oracle has integrated generative AI services into its Cerner electronic medical record system as health IT companies race to harness this cutting-edge tech for providers.The use of AI and conversational voice tech will enable doctors and clinicians to automate medical note-taking, order medications and view lab reviews while also more easily reviewing a patient's medical record, Oracle executives said during the Oracle Health Conference, which kicked off Monday in Las Vegas.""We've completely rethought how long it takes somebody to get their job done using the system. I think that we are on the verge of completely eliminating 'pajama time' as a result. This is not about going from 10 clicks to seven clicks or six clicks to five clicks. This is about completely eliminating clicks, where we can and where it makes sense. That is not a tomorrow or that's years away. That is a tomorrow that's here,"" Mike Sicilia, executive vice president, industries at Oracle told the audience at the Oracle Health Conference.The company acquired Cerner in a $28 billion deal a year ago with bold plans to modernize Cerner's Millennium EHR platform.The company unveiled this week its Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant to enable providers to leverage the power of generative AI together with voice commands to reduce manual work so clinicians can focus more attention on patient care.Oracle executive also said the digital assistant makes it easier for patients to take self-service actions such as scheduling appointments, paying a medical bill or checking clinical information using simple voice commands. Patients also can use the tool to get generative AI-driven answers to questions such as, ""What happens during a colonoscopy?""The multimodal voice and screen-based assistant participates in the doctor-patient appointment using generative AI to automate note-taking and to propose context-aware next actions such as ordering medication or scheduling labs and follow-up appointments, executives said in a press release.RelatedEpic taps Microsoft to accelerate generative AI-powered 'copilot' tools to help clinicians save timeThe generative AI tool also responds to conversational voice commands from providers who can ask questions, such as ""Show me the patient’s latest MRI results,"" to look up elements of a patient’s EHR record during an appointment. The technology then provides the information and images to physicians in a relevant order to help them gain insight into the appropriate treatment path without requiring a multimenu, multistep interaction with the EHR, executives said.The new solution will be available in the next 12 months.""The EHR should be a provider’s best ally in delivering engaging, personalized care to the patients they serve,” said Suhas Uliyar, senior vice president of product management at Oracle Health, in a statement. “By bringing comprehensive generative AI and voice-first capabilities to our EHR platforms, we are not only helping providers reduce mundane work that leads to burnout, but we are also empowering them to create better interactions with patients that establish trust, build loyalty, and deliver better outcomes.”Clinicians also can communicate with patients via web chat embedded in their secure patient portal, such as reminding patients to bring required lab results to an upcoming visit.RelatedOracle Q4 revenue up 18%, boosted by Cerner acquisition and strength in cloud businessesSicilia said Oracle Health was making all of its application programming interfaces (APIs) publicly available. ""Our investment in OCI [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure] will allow us to build a more open, intelligent, cloud-based healthcare platform,"" he told the audience Tuesday. ""To do so, we're announcing that we're going to increase the surface area of the APIs—that's the things that your IT department, your partners and other third parties are using to connect to Cerner Millennium—by 300% in the next 12 months. And, we're making every single API public, which means that you can use them yourself to replace components, your partners can use them, and frankly, our competitors are welcome and encouraged to use them as well.""Oracle's move to incorporate generative AI into its Cerner EHR comes several months after rival Epic has charged ahead to infuse the technology into its clinical and health IT systems. The company announced back in April during the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Conference in Chicago that it was working with Microsoft to integrate large language model tools and AI into its electronic health record software. The health IT vendor and the tech giant are collaborating to combine the Azure OpenAI Service with Epic’s EHR software with an initial focus on drafting message responses.The EHR giant has continued to roll out more tools to help clinicians save time and access critical data at the point of care. Tapping into Microsoft's AI capabilities, Epic launched ""copilot"" solutions to help providers with medical note summarization, offer coding suggestions and provide access to real-world evidence for patient care.Epic also is working with Abridge to integrate the startup's generative AI for clinical documentation into its EHR workflow.Google is collaborating with Meditech to bring generative artificial intelligence to EHRs, including at Nashville, Tennessee-based HCA Healthcare.

Work management software company Smartsheet unveiled its next-generation platform today, debuting features designed to provide users with new generative-AI powered capabilities at scale.
Work in the Smartsheet platform centers around “sheets” that contain information relating to a particular project or projects, within which users can include a variety of details such as a description, status, due dates, and which workers have been assigned to complete a task.
“Our goal is to make our platform not only powerful, but intuitive, beautiful, and delightful to use. And with this announcement, we’re giving customers more and better ways to visualize their work in Smartsheet,” said Ben Canning, senior vice president of product experiences at Smartsheet, during a press conference. The company is taking a very practical approach to AI, he said.











 
 
 
“We want to make sure that we are providing practical capabilities that use AI to empower our customers to achieve their goals faster and remove some of the drudgery from work,” he said.

Available from today in private beta, the revamped Smartsheet allows customers to use conversational prompts to generate data insights and visual charts, a capability that is currently limited to individual sheets but in the future will be derived from thousands of active projects and data stores.
Users will be able to offer up simple descriptions in order generate formulas or content such as sheet summaries, translations, and image captions through its digital asset management tool, Brandfolder. Additionally, users will be able to create custom solutions simply by responding to questions posed by the platform.











 
 
 
Smartsheet’s new AI-powered assistant can also provide customized, natural language responses to questions posed by customers.
“Smartsheet is being pragmatic with its AI capabilities focusing them on addressing common friction points in the Smartsheet user experience like working with formulas and more quickly building custom solutions,” said analyst Chris Marsh, who leads workforce productivity and collaboration research practice in S&P Global Market Intelligence.
He added that the company had opted to apply AI where there is scale advantage such as analyzing large volumes of data in its grid and autocaptioning images, and focus less on text generation.











 
 
 
Building out the platform at scale
In addition to the AI capabilities now on offer from Smartsheet, the updated version of the platform is also designed to make it easier for users to work at scale. By January, the Smartsheet Control Center will support 20,000 active projects per business program, a 20-fold, year-over-year increase, and in 2024, every sheet will also support five million cells and allow five million sheet links — a 250-time increase above the current level — per sheet.
A new timeline view will give teams a big-picture look into date-based work and allow data to be organized into visual groups or by project milestones, making it easier to see key dates. Smartsheet is also previewing its refreshed Grid and Card Views and customers can soon create more modern and colorful dashboards that provide multiwidget editing, scaling optimizations and wider canvases. Soon -to-be released dashboard snapshots will allow users to schedule regular, automatic dashboard deliveries.
Business and Enterprise users will soon have access to two new features: Workload Heatmap and Workload Schedule. Available directly in project sheets, these new tools give project managers the ability to quickly identify who is working on what, address over-allocations, and make data-driven staffing decisions to ensure the successful delivery of projects.











 
 
 
Finally, for advanced protection, Enterprise plan customers can purchase Smartsheet Safeguard, a collection of security and governance controls that includes customer-managed encryption keys, data egress policies, event reporting, and data retention controls.
“The things Smartsheet is announcing speak to the opportunity the category has around scaling into more strategic customer deployments,” said Marsh, who noted that much of the growth in work management software is being driven by large customer deployments where capabilities like sophisticated project and portfolio management, advanced security and governance features, and massive capacity in managing volumes of data are needed.
Though companies are still in the discovery phase of how AI can benefit them on a daily basis, vendors are quickly jumping on the bandwagon, said Margo Visitacion, principal analyst for portfolio management and enterprise architecture at Forrester.











 
 
 
“Right now, it’s the vendors leading the charge, but they need to bring real value to the table in terms of automation, smart decision making and ultimately successful business outcomes to sustain interest and adoption — and sustainability means vendors must be ethical in how they are dealing with customer data,” she said.

This summer, images abounded of striking writers and actors wielding picket signs as they marched outside major media corporations. Though their demands are wide-ranging, one issue has dominated headlines — artificial intelligence. It is a topic that has made its way to the bargaining sessions of labor unions across industries, including journalism. As news executives scramble to cobble together guidelines for their newsrooms and assemble working groups to experiment with AI, their employees are organizing to find ways to protect their jobs from the new technology. They are fighting to ensure that AI won’t replace the work they do and that content produced with the help of AI tools meets rigorous journalistic standards. “This is a really hot topic of conversation in union circles because we realize the power it (AI) has,” said Mike Davis, a reporter and the unit chair of the APP-MCJ Guild, which represents journalists at the Gannett-owned Asbury Park Press, Home News Tribune and Courier News in New Jersey. “This stuff’s going to get better and better. I would be hard-pressed to find a Gannett bargaining unit that is not thinking about this.” Unions representing hundreds of journalists, including editorial staff at The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times, have proposed contract language addressing AI this summer. At least one unit has found success. Last month, journalists at the Financial Times Specialist ratified their first contract, which includes the right to bargain over the effects of newly introduced technology like AI. FT Specialist Guild shop steward David Isenberg said his union had been in conversation with their counterparts in the United Kingdom, who had a clause addressing new technology in their contract. The FT Specialist Guild’s new contract requires the company to discuss in advance the introduction of any new technology that “materially impacts” employees. Union members may also raise concerns individually, and the guild has a right to “bargain expeditiously” with the company over the effects the new technology will have on employees’ wages, benefits and working conditions. At first, the company wanted the right to just discuss changes, not bargain over them, Isenberg, who covers the Securities and Exchange Commission for FT Specialist, said. However, the union pushed for the word “bargain” because it comes with special legal obligations. “Bargaining under the law means they have to actually consider granting concessions and try working in good faith to find an agreement,” Isenberg said. “A discussion is, ‘Hey, this is what we’re going to do,’ and then the union says, ‘Whoa, we don’t like that.’ And they say, ‘Hey, we discussed it with you,’ and then they implement exactly what they want.” Other unions are still struggling to negotiate AI-related agreements. The chief concern among many is the potential loss of jobs. The proposals put forth by the APP-MCJ Guild and the AP News Guild, which represents journalists and technicians working for the Associated Press in the United States, both require their respective companies to provide 90 days advance notice of new technology affecting newsroom functions and prohibit using such tools to reduce or eliminate union work. “If such technology involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning or deep learning, it shall be limited to supplementing the collection, organization, recording or maintenance of information,” their proposals read in part. (APP-MCJ Guild and the AP News Guild are separate units, but they share the NewsGuild as a parent union.) “AI shall not be used to perform work that is editorial in nature, including but not limited to the interpretation or analysis of information, communications with sources or generation of news content or illustrations.” IAPE Local 1096 — which represents 1,400 Dow Jones employees, including Wall Street Journal journalists — has also put together a proposal barring the company from displacing union members via AI. Union president and Dow Jones content operations specialist Jodi Green said that some audio journalists have shared concerns about AI being used to replicate their voices to generate content. Though many news outlets have pledged not to replace workers with AI, at least one has already gone back on its word. As a result, unions are pushing companies to commit to protections against AI by enshrining them in contracts, which usually remain in effect for several years. Last month, G/O Media laid off its four-person Gizmodo en Español team in favor of AI-powered translations even though CEO Jim Spanfeller had told Vox a month earlier that the company would not use AI to replace staff. GMG Union, which represents workers at Gizmodo, Jezebel, The Root, A.V. Club, Deadspin and several other G/O Media brands, released several statements condemning the company’s use of AI. The union ratified a contract last year, before AI exploded in popularity, but one editor told Digiday that the union has been lobbying the company to return to the bargaining table to add AI-related language to the contract. Union leaders representing staff at Gannett’s New Jersey newsrooms, Dow Jones and the AP all said that management has refused to agree to their proposals. Gannett has said it reserves the right to unilaterally make decisions regarding AI, Davis said. Dow Jones has taken a similar stance, according to Green. The company has compared AI’s usage to outsourcing, she said. The union’s contract currently requires Dow Jones to notify the union ahead of time if it wishes to outsource jobs and to provide affected employees with money for additional training, and the company wants to set up similar provisions for AI. Spokespeople for Gannett and Dow Jones declined to comment on union contract negotiations. At the AP, management has pushed for the ability to use AI to perform the work of people who have already left, News Media Guild president Vin Cherwoo said. AP spokesperson Lauren Easton objected to this, writing, “AP has used AI and automation for nearly a decade to free up journalists to do more meaningful work, not as a replacement for journalist jobs. AP has no plans or desire to use AI to replace journalists.” Among AP’s uses of AI are earnings reports and sports briefs. Cherwoo, a sports reporter and editor for AP, said the automated sports stories lack context that only human journalists can provide. He added that using generative AI to produce stories in the future raises concerns about accuracy, as many AI programs tend to “hallucinate” and make up facts. In January, CNET came under fire when its AI reporter was found to have plagiarized other writers’ work to produce stories filled with factual errors. The incident made employees, who were already organizing with the Writers Guild at the time, realize that they needed to address AI. CNET journalists went public with their union drive in May, and they are preparing to negotiate their first contract with owner Red Ventures this fall. Bargaining committee member and CNET editor Laura Michelle Davis (no relation to Mike Davis) said the CNET Media Workers Union wants a say in how AI is implemented in employee workflows and transparency about what data is used to train any AI tools the company uses. They are also seeking the editorial discretion to not use AI if it fails to meet publishing standards, the right to opt out of using AI without reprisal, and the assurance that AI will not be used to modify already published content after employees leave CNET. “We’re concerned about protecting our staff, our writers and editors, and their bylines,” Laura Michelle Davis said. “We don’t want them to be held responsible either externally or internally for any decisions made by management around artificial intelligence.” The unions are all talking formally and informally with other unions, as well as their parent organizations, about the issue. The Writers Guild has held several industrywide meetings on AI, and members of the digital media shops have joined the striking screenwriters on the picket lines in solidarity, Isenberg said. Many of the AI-related issues facing the screenwriters of the Writers Guild and the actors of the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists are very different from those of journalists. Nevertheless, Mike Davis said he has found the Hollywood strikes to be a “wonderful tool” for keeping people energized and informed. “I think the SAG-AFTRA strike and WGA strike are hugely important because we’re all news people, so we all pay attention to the issues affecting the news and media industry, but also … a lot of us like to watch movies and TV shows,” Mike Davis said. “So when the people we appreciate in that field are talking about this stuff and how important it is, I think it just naturally takes a little bit of a bigger place in your mind. I think we pay attention to it a lot more.” Cherwoo said that if unions aren’t discussing AI now, they definitely will once their contracts expire and they return to the bargaining table. He added that those unions will likely look back at the conversations happening today to determine what protections they should seek in the future. “We’re kind of setting the stage for everybody,” Cherwoo said. “The language that we get, that we bargain for, is going to be the standard, most likely, that other news unions are going to be presenting to their companies.”

Generative AI is making it easier to work multiple jobs at the same time. AI tools will lift earnings from multiple jobs by at least $83 billion by 2030, Morgan Stanley says.Multi-earning in the US has increased 11% in the past year, the bank's survey work found.

If AI can do some of your job, why not take another one on the side?That's the thinking behind a big new study released this week by researchers at Morgan Stanley.The investment bank conducted surveys in several countries, including the US, UK, and India, to get a sense for how many people have or plan to take on multiple jobs or set up multiple earnings streams in other ways.

Official data tracked by Morgan Stanley shows 5% of the population working multiple jobs, with that growing 5% a year. Unofficial data suggests it's more like 8-10% of the population, with interest in multiple jobs growing more than 18% a year, the bank's researchers wrote in a note to clients.

The bank conducted a similar study about a year ago, and since then the multi-job trends has picked up, with the rise of generative AI powering the change. ""The main driver which has changed since our original thesis is the advent of cheap or free and rapidly democratised access to generative AI tools,"" the researchers wrote.

They forecast $400 billion in income from multiple jobs by 2030, with generative AI contributing about $83 billion of that. In a much more bullish scenario, the bank sees $1.4 trillion in multi-earning income, with generative AI kicking in $300 billion of that.

There's been an explosion of AI tools in the past year, including ChatGPT, DALL-E, and GPT-4 from OpenAI, Bard and underlying AI models from Google, Claude 2 from Anthropic, and Midjourney. These services can answer questions convincingly, generate images on command, complete software code, and perform a host of other tasks.

With these new tools, employees suddenly have ways of producing work more quickly than before, making it easier to juggle multiple jobs. Morgan Stanley noted a 14% lift in call center productivity and a 55% boost for writing code, as examples. Side hustles where generative AI can help include affiliate marketing, e-commerce dropshipping, content creation, tutoring, graphic and web design, programming, and renting rooms or other space, according to Morgan Stanley. In content creation and e-commerce, 37% and 34% of respondents respectively said their income had been boosted with the help of generative AI tools.The average multi-earner is making $8.50 an hour when using generative AI, and $7 an hour without the technology, Morgan Stanley's surveys found.

AdChoicesADVERTISING“There’s  a tremendous amount of hype in the market around generative AI and a lot of  confusion over its potential impact on cost and staffing. But for the first  time, we’ve taken a fact-based approach to validating the eye-popping headlines  and quantified the potential benefit based on an analysis of data from our  extensive benchmarking of Global 1000 companies across the various SG&A  functions. We’ve concluded that generative AI plays a critical role in the  intelligent automation framework, which includes robotic process automation,  intelligent data capture, cognitive tools and more. It has a multiplier effect  in terms of enabling dramatic efficiency and effectiveness improvements in  structured, unstructured and interactive work. Without generative AI, companies  will see only incremental reductions in cost and staffing from these other  intelligent automation technologies,” says The Hackett Group principal Vin  Kumar. Key  takeaways:For a typical $10 billion company, generative  AI has the potential to reduce SG&A costs by more than $180 million  annually, the research found. The analysis considered the elimination of  structured work through hyper-automation; the ability to enable unstructured  work by adopting digital assistants; and enhancing interactive work through  personalization at scale. The Hackett Group also launched its Generative  AI Executive Advisory Program, and completed development of its AI Explorer  assessment tool to help clients understand the impact of AI on their  operations.Facebook IconLinkedIn IconTwitter X iconLatest in AI/ARSponsoredUnlock Your Food & Beverage Fleet's Full PotentialJuly 2, 2024Triimble’s New End-To-End Asset Lifecycle Management Software Suite to Help Connect Digital WorkflowsJuly 22, 2024SponsoredDigitize Loading Dock ManagementJuly 1, 2024Port of Long Beach Data Project Speeds Cargo DeliveryJuly 12, 2024RecommendedHiringHyundai Material Handling Announces Director of Dealer Development & National AccountsPersonnel updates sees new appointments at Cirba, HeroWear and more.Alexis Mizell-PleasantJuly 11, 2024RetentionPost-Pandemic Supply Chains: An SCN Summit RecapWithout a crystal ball, the best way to solidify operations might be to reflect on previous practices and merge the best qualities with the technologies available to keep up with the market, demands and expectations of tomorrow.Alexis Mizell-PleasantJuly 4, 2024Mentorship ProgramsShattering Glass Ceilings at This Year’s Women in Supply Chain ForumRegister today for this year's Women in Supply Chain Forum, scheduled for Nov. 12-13 in Atlanta.Marina MayerApril 1, 2024",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://www.sdcexec.com/software-technology/ai-ar/news/22873506/the-hackett-group-inc-generative-ai-will-drive-reductions-in-sga-cost-and-staffing,['https://img.sdcexec.com/files/base/acbm/scn/image/2023/09/Kaikoro_AdobeStock_245853295.6509aea3ea8e6.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Marina Mayer'}",,Generative AI Will Drive Reductions in SG&A Cost and Staffing,2023-09-19T14:24:22.000Z,2023-09-19T14:23:47.000Z,AI/AR,Generative AI Will Drive Reductions in SG&A Cost and Staffing,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.sdcexec.com/software-technology/ai-ar/news/22873506/the-hackett-group-inc-generative-ai-will-drive-reductions-in-sga-cost-and-staffing'}",,,,,,,,,['Marina Mayer'],,https://img.sdcexec.com/files/base/acbm/scn/image/2023/09/Kaikoro_AdobeStock_245853295.6509aea3ea8e6.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&q=70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One study published in March found that the introduction of large language models such as ChatGPT could result in some 80 per cent of the US workforce having at least 10 per cent of their tasks affected by the technology.

Research suggests that the technology will indeed shake up the workplace. One study published in March found that the introduction of large language models such as ChatGPT could result in some 80 per cent of the US workforce having at least 10 per cent of their tasks affected by the technology. Nearly a fifth of workers could have at least 50 per cent of their tasks affected, and the impact is likely to be felt far beyond tech roles, in more language-intensive areas such as law, advertising and finance.

But some experts believe that the technology will not cause the jobs market to shrink but could instead be a boon for it — with new types of roles being created and the emergence of human-AI symbiosis.

According to Stanford University professor and AI specialist Erik Brynjolfsson, in the past many advances and transformative technologies have tended to increase gaps in income inequality between more and less experienced workers, or college and non-college students.

The underlying transformer is a set of &lt;a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/neural-network/""&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt; that consist of an encoder and a decoder with self-attention capabilities. The encoder and decoder extract meanings from a sequence of text and understand the relationships between words and phrases in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Transformer LLMs are capable of unsupervised training, although a more precise explanation is that transformers perform self-learning. It is through this process that transformers learn to understand basic grammar, languages, and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike earlier recurrent neural networks (RNN) that sequentially process inputs, transformers process entire sequences in parallel. This allows the data scientists to use GPUs for training transformer-based LLMs, significantly reducing the training time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Transformer neural network architecture allows the use of very large models, often with hundreds of billions of parameters. Such large-scale models can ingest massive amounts of data, often from the internet, but also from sources such as the &lt;a href=""https://registry.opendata.aws/commoncrawl/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank""&gt;Common Crawl&lt;/a&gt;, which comprises more than 50 billion web pages, and Wikipedia, which has approximately 57 million pages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/neural-network/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank""&gt;Read more about&amp;nbsp;neural networks&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/deep-learning/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank""&gt;Read more about&amp;nbsp;deep learning &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Why are large language models important?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '&lt;p&gt;Large language models are incredibly flexible.

LLMs can be used for &lt;a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank""&gt;generative AI&lt;/a&gt; (artificial intelligence) to produce content based on input prompts in human language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LLMs are big, very big. They can consider billions of parameters and have many possible uses. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Open AI&amp;#39;s GPT-3 model has 175 billion parameters. Its cousin, ChatGPT, can identify patterns from data and generate natural and readable output. While we don&amp;rsquo;t know the size of Claude 2, it can take inputs up to 100K tokens in each prompt, which means it can work over hundreds of pages of technical documentation or even an entire book.&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;AI21 Labs&amp;rsquo; Jurassic-1 model has 178 billion parameters and a token vocabulary of 250,000-word parts and similar conversational capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Cohere&amp;rsquo;s Command model has similar capabilities and can work in more than 100 different languages.&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;LightOn&amp;#39;s Paradigm offers foundation models with claimed capabilities that exceed those of GPT-3.

Earlier forms of machine learning used a numerical table to represent each word. But, this form of representation could not recognize relationships between words such as words with similar meanings. This limitation was overcome by using multi-dimensional vectors, commonly referred to as word embeddings, to represent words so that words with similar contextual meanings or other relationships are close to each other in the vector space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using word embeddings, transformers can pre-process text as numerical representations through the encoder and understand the context of words and phrases with similar meanings as well as other relationships between words such as parts of speech.

AI21 Wordspice suggests changes to original sentences to improve style and voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge base answering&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often referred to as knowledge-intensive natural language processing (KI-NLP), the technique refers to LLMs that can answer specific questions from information help in digital archives. An example is the ability of AI21 Studio playground to answer general knowledge questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Text classification&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using clustering, LLMs can classify text with similar meanings or sentiments.

These networks contain multiple nodes and layers. Each node in a layer has connections to all nodes in the subsequent layer, each of which has a weight and a bias. Weights and biases along with embeddings are known as model parameters. Large transformer-based neural networks can have billions and billions of parameters. The size of the model is generally determined by an empirical relationship between the model size, the number of parameters, and the size of the training data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Training is performed using a large corpus of high-quality data. During training, the model iteratively adjusts parameter values until the model correctly predicts the next token from an the previous squence of input tokens. It does this through self-learning techniques which teach the model to adjust parameters to maximize the likelihood of the next tokens in the training examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once trained, LLMs can be readily adapted to perform multiple tasks using relatively small sets of supervised data, a process known as fine tuning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three common learning models exist:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Zero-shot learning; Base LLMs can respond to a broad range of requests without explicit training, often through prompts, although answer accuracy varies.&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Few-shot learning: By providing a few relevant training examples, base model performance significantly improves in that specific area.&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Fine-tuning: This is an extension of few-shot learning in that data scientists train a base model to adjust its parameters with additional data relevant to the specific application.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What is the future of LLMs?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '&lt;p&gt;The introduction of large language models like ChatGPT, Claude 2, and Llama 2 that can answer questions and generate text points to exciting possibilities in the future.

Here are some thoughts on the future of LLMs,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Increased capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As impressive as they are, the current level of technology is not perfect and LLMs are not infallible. However, newer releases will have improved accuracy and enhanced capabilities as developers learn how to improve their performance while reducing bias and eliminating incorrect answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Audiovisual training&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While developers train most LLMs using text, some have started training models using video and audio input. This form of training should lead to faster model development and open up new possibilities in terms of using LLMs for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Workplace transformation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LLMs are a disruptive factor that will change the workplace. LLMs will likely reduce monotonous and repetitive tasks in the same way that robots did for repetitive manufacturing tasks. Possibilities include repetitive clerical tasks, customer service chatbots, and simple automated copywriting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Conversational AI&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LLMs will undoubtedly improve the performance of automated virtual assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri.

The rise in AI has caused a mixture of excitement and fear as it becomes a standard part of our lives. Some say it’s a risk to civilization, while others insist it is transforming the way we work, live and interact with one another. The part that is not debatable is that AI is on the upswing. Arianna Huffington, founder and CEO of Thrive Global addresses these perceived threats. “AI is ultimately a tool, and its impact will depend on how humanity uses it,” she explains. “The more we can use this moment to bring together a critical mass of people working in good faith and with empathy, the more likely it is that humanity will use AI to flourish.” It sounds like science fiction, but that’s exactly what the newest AI tools are doing—turning the tide when it comes to mental wellness in the workplace.


Using AI To Take Charge Of Your Mental Health
Increasingly, employers know that mental health is a priority, but, according to a recent study, many are unsure of the steps they need to take to make that happen. And with more Gen Zs entering the workforce, it’s essential that companies get it right. The younger cohort has no qualms with job hopping if they believe their health and wellness needs are not met. Now, it’s possible to enlist AI, instead of a human being, to help employees take charge of their mental health. It sounds like an odd coupling, but technology has produced new AI-backed mental health tools that enable employers to better support their employees.

Grace Chang, co-founder and CEO of mental healthcare startup Kintsugi, believes AI’s omnipresence in the workplace gives employees greater control over their mental wellness. Plus, she says it brings the opportunity to better support employees and foster a more productive workforce, more efficient processes and more profitable businesses.

Chang informs me by email that Kintsugi offers AI-backed voice journaling and platforms that provide employees real-time insights into their own mental health and make recommendations on the kind of support needed. “We’re entering a crucial era when it comes to mental wellness at work,” Chang points out. “In 2023, employers know they must make mental health a priority—95% of the employers we’ve surveyed have told us that mental healthcare access is their top care need. They know that the cost of unaddressed mental health challenges is too high to ignore, leading to almost 12 missed workdays per employee per year and costing the U.S. economy $47.6 billion annually.”

Still, Chang says that many business leaders remain unsure about how to best support their teams’ mental health. “There’s been an explosion of employer-focused mental healthcare solutions since the pandemic—from wellness apps to coaching to therapists to digital therapeutics and more. We’ve reached the point where employers are spolit for choice. Therefore, matching employees to the right interventions at the right time is a greater challenge than ever.”

AI Detects Mental Health Conditions From Your Voice
Another hurdle, according to Chang, is that in the past employers generally had no way of measuring how well any given mental health intervention is working. Without objective data pointing to an ROI, she emphasizes, it can be difficult to justify continuing with a program or app. But this is at odds with the mental health field, which has traditionally relied on subjective, as opposed to objective, insights.

She explains that AI-powered solutions like Kintsugi Voice are designed with these challenges in mind. “Kintsugi Voice detects signs and severity of mental health conditions in real-time, just by listening to someone’s voice,” she adds. “Our tech seamlessly integrates with care management call centers and telehealth platforms, where it ‘listens’ in the background, with patient consent.” The technology generates real-time, quantitative insights into someone’s mental wellness that help connect those in need to the right level of behavioral care.

“In the same way, our tool offers an easy and affordable way to track mental health over time, so users can determine whether, and to what extent, an intervention is working for them,” she told me. “Currently, mental health screening takes place once a year (if at all). With our tool, it can take place during every healthcare interaction, bringing with it the opportunity for unprecedented insights into employee mental well-being. Employers can ask their payor-partners to integrate technology like Kintsugi into their care management call centers and telehealth platforms to leverage AI and voice biomarkers to make mental healthcare more personalized, more convenient, higher quality, more affordable and more accessible for everyone.”
Do Employees Feel Secure With AI Mental Health?
The prevailing narrative is that employees fear being replaced by AI or that it will somehow invade their privacy. But are employee fears of AI blown out of proportion? And would employees consent to having AI track their mental health? Chang reveals that in a recent pilot, 80% of a patient population consented to be screened for mental health conditions by the AI-powered voice analysis tool. Based on these findings, she surmises that the majority of people embrace the use of AI in healthcare, as long as it enhances their overall healthcare experience and delivers tangible value.
A separate study by Workhuman found similar results. Over half of workers (58.4%) believe AI won’t put their jobs at risk. And 41% of employees say they anticipate that learning to use AI tools will become a part of their workplace training, and 34.4% believe that learning these tools will be encouraged in general. The data shows that apprehension is strongest among younger employees, including Gen Z digital natives, who have grown up with intimate knowledge of the risks and rewards of new tech. While only 20.4% of workers on average feel that AI puts their job at risk, the figure increases to nearly 30% for Gen Z employees.
These findings are valuable information for leaders implementing AI technology to instill confidence in workers who are concerned that their jobs could be at risk. The Workhuman study recommends that employers ensure that workers have the tools and training they need to understand how the technology works and how it can benefit them. It adds that knowledge and competency will help not only to assuage employees’ AI fears but will help them make the most of the technology in their day-to-day work. The study concludes that when employees feel recognized for their humanity—which can include opinions and concerns around AI at work—and not just their productive output, they’ll likely feel less worried about whether AI has the potential to replace them and more valued as a whole individual.

The Role Of Generative AI In HR Is Now Becoming Clear

                · Updated September 8, 2023




We now know that Generative AI will play a transformational role in Human Resources. And while many companies are embarking on pilots, hackathons, and “promptathons,” I want to share what we’ve learned. (For an in-depth report on AI in HR please read our Deep Dive on AI in HR research.)
HR Is An Integrated Operating Function
Let’s remind ourselves that HR, like Finance, IT, and other internal functions, is a design, support, and integration function. HR partners with the business and deals with a myriad of complex issues: hiring, onboarding, training, leadership development, performance management, pay, rewards, benefits, hybrid work, organization design, diversity strategy, culture, and more. And prior to the emergence of what we call Systemic HR, most of these operating functions were done somewhat independently.
Today companies are dealing with a competitive labor market, high levels of turnover and workforce stress, and the need to reskill, upskill, and intelligently move people internally. Problems like diversity and inclusion, culture, and leadership development remain paramount, and HR teams are also worried about employee experience, productivity, and internal efficiency.
Data within HR is spread all over the place. The average large company has more than 80 employee facing systems, and each one stores large volumes of important data to help manage its own area. When a business leader or executive wants to make a change, look at a business scenario, or fix an underperforming group, they need all this data in one integrated place. AI promises to bring this dream to life (more below).
As HR teams build new programs and solutions, we are also dealing with an overwhelmed workforce. Employees are largely tapped out (87% believe they are operating at full capacity) so we have to simplify work, reduce the number of systems, and save people time on administrative functions (enabling them to operate at the “top of their license”). This means HR teams are continuously dealing with this problem of expanding the number of services yet shrinking their footprint and making them easier to use. AI helps with this.
Finally, HR teams are turning into creators, developers, and consultants. As our Systemic HR research points out, the future of HR is fewer “support agents” and more “consultants, product managers, designers, and advisors.” This means more and more HR teams are “building things” and “analyzing things,” which is essentially a core part of what Generative AI does.
So in a sense, Generative AI is the perfect new solution for almost every challenge HR teams face.
How Will We Get There: Real Use Cases
As we’ve talked with dozens of companies and vendors, let me summarize some of the big, high-ROI, real-world use-cases we see.
1/ Talent Intelligence for Recruiting, Mobility, Development, Pay Equity
Talent Intelligence is now a reality. Companies can use LLM-based systems (Eightfold, Gloat, Beamery, Seekout, Phenom, Skyhive) to identify hundreds of characteristics (ie. skills) in their people, enabling companies to intelligently source candidates, decide who is ready for promotion, move people to new opportunities (talent marketplace), and identify pay inequities.
This domain, which we’ve studied for several years, is now available “off the shelf” from many vendors and using data from providers like Lightcast a company can relatively easily start to identify capability gaps, look into the outside market for trends, and build a strategic and operational solution for many HR practices using AI. Our Talent Intelligence Primer explains this in detail – I believe this market is still young and will eventually disrupt many of the core HCM players. (SAP introduced their Talent Intelligence Hub this year, by the way.)
In recruiting there are now plugins to generate job descriptions, tune them for different roles, create personalized candidate emails, and enrich your own resume. These tools are getting smarter by the minute: they can now personalize every part of the recruiting process, saving recruiters time in outreach and writing. I just saw Eightfold’s latest AI job description builder, for example, and it lets you tweak the description based on skills, technologies, and many other factors (Seekout has a similar offering).
2/ Employee Experience Apps (Onboarding, job transition, administration)
The second growing space is the “intelligent employee chatbot” that brings together documents, support materials, and transactional systems into an easy to use experience. Several of our clients are experimenting with this and our own JBC HR Copilot offers this type of solution to HR professionals themselves. These are really enterprise applications, where companies put together their own content, develop a data security strategy (we don’t want every employee seeing every document or process), and then use “orchestration” tools to connect the chatbot to enterprise systems.
There are many ways to do this. OpenAI has a feature called “function calling” that lets a develop take any input (“I want to log my vacation.”) and turn it into a simple call to an API like the vacation page in Workday or SAP. IBM Watson Orchestrate is designed for this (now in use by SAP), and there will be many such tools available from platform vendors and the HCM providers. The Workday Assistant is a first generation attempt at this.
Once you marry the knowledge of the various HR systems with process documentation, the chatbot can be an eventual replacement for many or most employee portals. I just talked with a large media company and the HR leader told me it took her three hours to find the right information on executive comp to do her analysis. This type of situation is common everywhere.
So far what we’re discovering is that these should be focused on narrow use cases first, then they can expand. A large hotel chain, for example, just build a chatbot designed to help front office workers understand precisely how to serve high net-worth customers. It connects to the reservation system and helps the employees know how to customize services for that client. Imagine an onboarding tool, leadership transition system, etc. like this.
Every EX vendor is going to want to be part of this. Providers like Firstup use AI to customize employee communications to each person individually. This will become a core set of features we use for many of our employee experience apps.
3/ Employee Training and Compliance Apps
The $350 billion employee training industry is hungry for Generative AI. We’ve seen tools that generate training from documents, automatically create quizzes, and take existing content and turn it into a “teaching assistant.” Just yesterday I talked with a client who has a new leadership development program they just built with a vendor. We discussed taking that content and putting it into our Copilot to make it available “on-demand” with a conversational interface for managers. That is not a difficult project once you have the AI platform in place.
But there’s more. Cornerstone, Docebo, Degreed and others are now using AI to intelligently recommend content (based on Talent Intelligence, not just clickstreams), produce and recommend micro-learning based on role, team, location, and employee activity, and even use AI as a game to “prompt” the employee to learn more.
To give you an example: we just launched a micro-learning program in our Academy to teach HR people about AI. That course, which consists of a series of interactive questions and small notes and interactions on your phone, could be imported into our copilot, for example, and offered when someone asks a question. These are not quite out of the box solutions but we’re close.
Remember that much of an L&D teams job revolves around content creation. These new Gen AI apps that build characters, images, scenarios, and videos are going to be widely used by L&D teams. I just found a tool that takes long videos (ie. instructor-led courses) and quickly finds the “most interesting” or “most dense” content to create mini-snippets. Imagine the opportunity you’ll have to take long videos and turn them into chapters, on-demand learning, and promotions for new things to learn.
4/ Employee Development and Growth Apps
Next there’s the massive new area of tools and platforms to help employees with their careers. Thanks to Talent Intelligence platforms, we now have “career pathways” being generated by AI (not your boss). These systems look at your skills and your experience and show you (graphically) all the options you have for growth, all based on the experience of millions of others.
Did you know, for example, that a marketing manager who does analytics could move into data science, cyber security, or even financial analysis? Or that a person who works as an hourly “transportation support” person in a hospital can join a career pathway to become an X-ray tech or clinical nurse?
These pathways are all exposed and explained by AI, and these new systems show you precisely what you need to learn, what certifications you must acquire, and even who you can talk to about this path. We are actually working on this type of solution for HR professionals (coming soon) and you’ll be amazed at how helpful these tools can be.
Why is AI so important? Because this is fundamentally a big-data problem. I cannot possibly guess all the career options an individual may have in our company, but if I plug their profile and history into a system like the Eightfold Career Navigator or others, we can both see many options we never even considered. Products like Gloat, Fuel50, Eightfold, Beamery, and Workday all offer this out of the box.
And think about how this will help non-degreed workers move up in their careers. No more shopping around on websites to guess where to apply for a job – these career navigation systems are going to transform the lives of many many people.
5/ Performance Management and Operational Improvement
Should AI be used for performance management? Well I don’t expect these systems to write performance reviews, but yes, they will help a lot. Consider the typical problem we have in every company: a team, a workgroup, or an individual is simply underperforming. This group or person’s numbers are behind, their projects are late, or their quality is not up to snuff. Do we wait for the manager to decipher what’s wrong and let them figure out what to do?
That’s how it works today: each manager has to guess, figure out, and decide “what to do” about a low performing individual, team, or project. Why not let the AI do some of this for us? We have seen apps, for example, that show you the integrated “view” of performance in a company. This is, in many ways, a data problem.
What if we find, for example, that the project teams that are over a certain size simply don’t get things done? What if we look at the skills composition of a team and see that an important one is missing? Maybe tenure is the problem (it often is, by the way). Maybe diversity is holding teams back.
While the line manager may not do this kind of analysis, I can guarantee you that the HR consultant would love to help here. These kinds of broader organizational design and performance projects are everywhere, and once we have all the data in an AI system we can simply ask it questions. (Check out our new Org Design SuperClass for more on this!)
I asked Bard, “please compare the financial growth, returns, and margins of Chevron and Exxon.” It did a pretty good job in about ten seconds. Imagine if you did that in your own company across teams? Once we get our internal data into the right AI system this is going to be a regular and common thing to do.
6/ Retention, Hybrid-Work, Wellbeing, Engagement Analysis
And that leads me to my final big area: studying, analyzing, and improving employee retention, wellbeing, and engagement.
Every company I talk with is now dealing with employee burnout, wellbeing, and other engagement issues. For decades we relied on surveys and various benchmarks to try to figure out what to do. And yes, good feedback systems give us lots of information that helps.
But what if we simply put this data into our big AI platform and asked it some questions.  “What are the top factors contributing to turnover in the sales department?” It may be manager. It may be compensation. It may be tenure. It may be something else.
Yes we can always use surveys, town halls, and other listening methods to do this. But what if we just look at the data? The Bank of America Academy, which we’ve written about many times, is a story of a company that “discovered” what its talent problems were by detailed analysis of the data. They found out, for example, that bank balances are very correlated to the tenure of employees in the branch. And tenure is driven by many other factors: how people where hired, onboarded, and supported in their career journey. By doing that analysis they were able to dramatically improve their business performance and retention. Their engagement surveys would never have pointed this out.
How Do You Get Started?
And that leaves us with the big question: How do you get started? Let me share what we’ve learned.
First, rather than “chase the technology” it’s much better to “fall in love with the problem.”
In other words, what problem would you like to focus on? Is it employee onboarding? HR self-service? Hourly worker scheduling and shift management? This means getting your team together to prioritize your investment, because building an AI-based solution won’t be as simple as you think.
Second, once you’ve decided where to start it’s time to get the IT team involved. Each one of these use-cases turns into a set of issues with data quality, data management, data dictionaries, and then security, business rules, and confidentiality.
Remember that “throwing information into an LLM” may sound like fun, but even if it works you’ve just given all sorts of people access to information they may not need, want, or even be allowed to see. So a chatbot implementation means focusing on user experience, data management, search, and orchestration all at once.
Our work on our own copilot has already given us this experience. Once you get the data together (and in most cases it’s not clear who owns what), you have to start testing Gen AI use cases, define security rules, and decide what, if any, back-end orchestration you want. These aren’t as exciting as “throwing a bunch of spreadsheets into OpenAI and starting to ask questions,” but this is what real solutions need to do.
Third, you have to realize that AI systems, unlike transactional systems, take care and feeding. “Prompt Engineering” means tuning the system to answer questions correctly, finding gaps in your data or documentation, and continuously trying to keep the user experience simple. And once the chatbot or other system is operational, I can guarantee there will be demands for more (and new) data.
In many ways a new AI system is like a new baby. It has to learn how to walk, talk, behave, and stay out of trouble. The off-the-shelf tools won’t do this until you’ve really used it, so you’ll need IT’s help making sure your system is sustainable and supportable as it grows.
How Will AI Impact HR Itself?
And then there’s the big question about your role. Will these new systems make you obsolete?
The answer is clearly no. These intelligent systems are data hungry fiends. Once you build them and add the right information, you’re going to turn into an analyst, a chatbot trainer, a product manager, and a designer. A lot of the mundane work of finding information and analyzing it may go away, but your higher level job of knowing what information to use will remain. And there will be many new jobs taking care of the AI systems, tuning them, and continuously improving them as new applications arrive.
Let me leave you with this: despite the explosion of excitement in this space, AI implementations in HR are technology projects. They have many of the same issues and challenges of any transactional system, with the added element that the system itself is “learning” along the way. SAP doesn’t change behavior as you use it: the AI system will.
I can assure you that this entire domain is both over-hyped and under-estimated. If you start small, get your hands dirty, and bring your IT team with you, you’ll start to see astounding business benefits in any of the areas I discuss. And in the next article I’ll explain how to build an AI-Hackathon for your team.

'availableLanguage': None}",,,,,"We now know that Generative AI will play a transformational role in Human Resources. And while many companies are embarking on pilots, hackathons, and &quot;promptathons,&quot; I want to share what we&#039;ve learned. (For an in-depth report on AI in HR please read our Deep Dive on AI in HR research.)  HR Is An Integrated Operating Function  Let&#039;s remind ourselves that HR, like Finance, IT, and other internal functions, is a design, support, and integration function. HR partners with the business and deals with a myriad of complex issues: hiring, onboarding, training, leadership development, performance management, pay, rewards, benefits, hybrid work, organization design, diversity strategy, culture, and more. And prior to the emergence of what we call Systemic HR, most of these operating functions were done somewhat independently.  Today companies are dealing with a competitive labor market, high levels of turnover and workforce stress, and the need to reskill, upskill, and intelligently move people internally. Problems like diversity and inclusion, culture, and leadership development remain paramount, and HR teams are also worried about employee experience, productivity, and internal efficiency.  Data within HR is spread all over the place. The average large company has more than 80 employee facing systems, and each one stores large volumes of important data to help manage its own area. When a business leader or executive wants to make a change, look at a business scenario, or fix an underperforming group, they need all this data in one integrated place. AI promises to bring this dream to life (more below).  As HR teams build new programs and solutions, we are also dealing with an overwhelmed workforce. Employees are largely tapped out (87% believe they are operating at full capacity) so we have to simplify work, reduce the number of systems, and save people time on administrative functions (enabling them to operate at the &quot;top of their license&quot;). This means HR teams are continuously dealing with this problem of expanding the number of services yet shrinking their footprint and making them easier to use. AI helps with this.  Finally, HR teams are turning into creators, developers, and consultants. As our Systemic HR research points out, the future of HR is fewer &quot;support agents&quot; and more &quot;consultants, product managers, designers, and advisors.&quot; This means more and more HR teams are &quot;building things&quot; and &quot;analyzing things,&quot; which is essentially a core part of what Generative AI does.  So in a sense, Generative AI is the perfect new solution for almost every challenge HR teams face.  How Will We Get There: Real Use Cases  As we&#039;ve talked with dozens of companies and vendors, let me summarize some of the big, high-ROI, real-world use-cases we see.  1/ Talent Intelligence for Recruiting, Mobility, Development, Pay Equity  Talent Intelligence is now a reality. Companies can use LLM-based systems (Eightfold, Gloat, Beamery, Seekout, Phenom, Skyhive) to identify hundreds of characteristics (ie. skills) in their people, enabling companies to intelligently source candidates, decide who is ready for promotion, move people to new opportunities (talent marketplace), and identify pay inequities.  This domain, which we&#039;ve studied for several years, is now available &quot;off the shelf&quot; from many vendors and using data from providers like Lightcast a company can relatively easily start to identify capability gaps, look into the outside market for trends, and build a strategic and operational solution for many HR practices using AI. Our Talent Intelligence Primer explains this in detail - I believe this market is still young and will eventually disrupt many of the core HCM players. (SAP introduced their Talent Intelligence Hub this year, by the way.)  In recruiting there are now plugins to generate job descriptions, tune them for different roles, create personalized candidate emails, and enrich your own resume. These tools are getting smarter by the minute: they can now personalize every part of the recruiting process, saving recruiters time in outreach and writing. I just saw Eightfold&#039;s latest AI job description builder, for example, and it lets you tweak the description based on skills, technologies, and many other factors (Seekout has a similar offering).  2/ Employee Experience Apps (Onboarding, job transition, administration)  The second growing space is the &quot;intelligent employee chatbot&quot; that brings together documents, support materials, and transactional systems into an easy to use experience. Several of our clients are experimenting with this and our own JBC HR Copilot offers this type of solution to HR professionals themselves. These are really enterprise applications, where companies put together their own content, develop a data security strategy (we don&#039;t want every employee seeing every document or process), and then use &quot;orchestration&quot; tools to connect the chatbot to enterprise systems.  There are many ways to do this. OpenAI has a feature called &quot;function calling&quot; that lets a develop take any input (&quot;I want to log my vacation.&quot;) and turn it into a simple call to an API like the vacation page in Workday or SAP. IBM Watson Orchestrate is designed for this (now in use by SAP), and there will be many such tools available from platform vendors and the HCM providers. The Workday Assistant is a first generation attempt at this.  Once you marry the knowledge of the various HR systems with process documentation, the chatbot can be an eventual replacement for many or most employee portals. I just talked with a large media company and the HR leader told me it took her three hours to find the right information on executive comp to do her analysis. This type of situation is common everywhere.  So far what we&#039;re discovering is that these should be focused on narrow use cases first, then they can expand. A large hotel chain, for example, just build a chatbot designed to help front office workers understand precisely how to serve high net-worth customers. It connects to the reservation system and helps the employees know how to customize services for that client. Imagine an onboarding tool, leadership transition system, etc. like this.  Every EX vendor is going to want to be part of this. Providers like Firstup use AI to customize employee communications to each person individually. This will become a core set of features we use for many of our employee experience apps.  3/ Employee Training and Compliance Apps  The $350 billion employee training industry is hungry for Generative AI. We&#039;ve seen tools that generate training from documents, automatically create quizzes, and take existing content and turn it into a &quot;teaching assistant.&quot; Just yesterday I talked with a client who has a new leadership development program they just built with a vendor. We discussed taking that content and putting it into our Copilot to make it available &quot;on-demand&quot; with a conversational interface for managers. That is not a difficult project once you have the AI platform in place.  But there&#039;s more. Cornerstone, Docebo, Degreed and others are now using AI to intelligently recommend content (based on Talent Intelligence, not just clickstreams), produce and recommend micro-learning based on role, team, location, and employee activity, and even use AI as a game to &quot;prompt&quot; the employee to learn more.  To give you an example: we just launched a micro-learning program in our Academy to teach HR people about AI. That course, which consists of a series of interactive questions and small notes and interactions on your phone, could be imported into our copilot, for example, and offered when someone asks a question. These are not quite out of the box solutions but we&#039;re close.  Remember that much of an L&amp;D teams job revolves around content creation. These new Gen AI apps that build characters, images, scenarios, and videos are going to be widely used by L&amp;D teams. I just found a tool that takes long videos (ie. instructor-led courses) and quickly finds the &quot;most interesting&quot; or &quot;most dense&quot; content to create mini-snippets. Imagine the opportunity you&#039;ll have to take long videos and turn them into chapters, on-demand learning, and promotions for new things to learn.  4/ Employee Development and Growth Apps  Next there&#039;s the massive new area of tools and platforms to help employees with their careers. Thanks to Talent Intelligence platforms, we now have &quot;career pathways&quot; being generated by AI (not your boss). These systems look at your skills and your experience and show you (graphically) all the options you have for growth, all based on the experience of millions of others.  Did you know, for example, that a marketing manager who does analytics could move into data science, cyber security, or even financial analysis? Or that a person who works as an hourly &quot;transportation support&quot; person in a hospital can join a career pathway to become an X-ray tech or clinical nurse?  These pathways are all exposed and explained by AI, and these new systems show you precisely what you need to learn, what certifications you must acquire, and even who you can talk to about this path. We are actually working on this type of solution for HR professionals (coming soon) and you&#039;ll be amazed at how helpful these tools can be.  Why is AI so important? Because this is fundamentally a big-data problem. I cannot possibly guess all the career options an individual may have in our company, but if I plug their profile and history into a system like the Eightfold Career Navigator or others, we can both see many options we never even considered. Products like Gloat, Fuel50, Eightfold, Beamery, and Workday all offer this out of the box.  And think about how this will help non-degreed workers move up in their careers. No more shopping around on websites to guess where to apply for a job - these career navigation systems are going to transform the lives of many many people.  5/ Performance Management and Operational Improvement  Should AI be used for performance management? Well I don&#039;t expect these systems to write performance reviews, but yes, they will help a lot. Consider the typical problem we have in every company: a team, a workgroup, or an individual is simply underperforming. This group or person&#039;s numbers are behind, their projects are late, or their quality is not up to snuff. Do we wait for the manager to decipher what&#039;s wrong and let them figure out what to do?  That&#039;s how it works today: each manager has to guess, figure out, and decide &quot;what to do&quot; about a low performing individual, team, or project. Why not let the AI do some of this for us? We have seen apps, for example, that show you the integrated &quot;view&quot; of performance in a company. This is, in many ways, a data problem.  What if we find, for example, that the project teams that are over a certain size simply don&#039;t get things done? What if we look at the skills composition of a team and see that an important one is missing? Maybe tenure is the problem (it often is, by the way). Maybe diversity is holding teams back.  While the line manager may not do this kind of analysis, I can guarantee you that the HR consultant would love to help here. These kinds of broader organizational design and performance projects are everywhere, and once we have all the data in an AI system we can simply ask it questions. (Check out our new Org Design SuperClass for more on this!)  I asked Bard, &quot;please compare the financial growth, returns, and margins of Chevron and Exxon.&quot; It did a pretty good job in about ten seconds. Imagine if you did that in your own company across teams? Once we get our internal data into the right AI system this is going to be a regular and common thing to do.  6/ Retention, Hybrid-Work, Wellbeing, Engagement Analysis  And that leads me to my final big area: studying, analyzing, and improving employee retention, wellbeing, and engagement.  Every company I talk with is now dealing with employee burnout, wellbeing, and other engagement issues. For decades we relied on surveys and various benchmarks to try to figure out what to do. And yes, good feedback systems give us lots of information that helps.  But what if we simply put this data into our big AI platform and asked it some questions.  &quot;What are the top factors contributing to turnover in the sales department?&quot; It may be manager. It may be compensation. It may be tenure. It may be something else.  Yes we can always use surveys, town halls, and other listening methods to do this. But what if we just look at the data? The Bank of America Academy, which we&#039;ve written about many times, is a story of a company that &quot;discovered&quot; what its talent problems were by detailed analysis of the data. They found out, for example, that bank balances are very correlated to the tenure of employees in the branch. And tenure is driven by many other factors: how people where hired, onboarded, and supported in their career journey. By doing that analysis they were able to dramatically improve their business performance and retention. Their engagement surveys would never have pointed this out.  How Do You Get Started?  And that leaves us with the big question: How do you get started? Let me share what we&#039;ve learned.  First, rather than &quot;chase the technology&quot; it&#039;s much better to &quot;fall in love with the problem.&quot;  In other words, what problem would you like to focus on? Is it employee onboarding? HR self-service? Hourly worker scheduling and shift management? This means getting your team together to prioritize your investment, because building an AI-based solution won&#039;t be as simple as you think.  Second, once you&#039;ve decided where to start it&#039;s time to get the IT team involved. Each one of these use-cases turns into a set of issues with data quality, data management, data dictionaries, and then security, business rules, and confidentiality.  Remember that &quot;throwing information into an LLM&quot; may sound like fun, but even if it works you&#039;ve just given all sorts of people access to information they may not need, want, or even be allowed to see. So a chatbot implementation means focusing on user experience, data management, search, and orchestration all at once.  Our work on our own copilot has already given us this experience. Once you get the data together (and in most cases it&#039;s not clear who owns what), you have to start testing Gen AI use cases, define security rules, and decide what, if any, back-end orchestration you want. These aren&#039;t as exciting as &quot;throwing a bunch of spreadsheets into OpenAI and starting to ask questions,&quot; but this is what real solutions need to do.  Third, you have to realize that AI systems, unlike transactional systems, take care and feeding. &quot;Prompt Engineering&quot; means tuning the system to answer questions correctly, finding gaps in your data or documentation, and continuously trying to keep the user experience simple. And once the chatbot or other system is operational, I can guarantee there will be demands for more (and new) data.  In many ways a new AI system is like a new baby. It has to learn how to walk, talk, behave, and stay out of trouble. The off-the-shelf tools won&#039;t do this until you&#039;ve really used it, so you&#039;ll need IT&#039;s help making sure your system is sustainable and supportable as it grows.  How Will AI Impact HR Itself?  And then there&#039;s the big question about your role. Will these new systems make you obsolete?  The answer is clearly no. These intelligent systems are data hungry fiends. Once you build them and add the right information, you&#039;re going to turn into an analyst, a chatbot trainer, a product manager, and a designer. A lot of the mundane work of finding information and analyzing it may go away, but your higher level job of knowing what information to use will remain. And there will be many new jobs taking care of the AI systems, tuning them, and continuously improving them as new applications arrive.  Let me leave you with this: despite the explosion of excitement in this space, AI implementations in HR are technology projects. They have many of the same issues and challenges of any transactional system, with the added element that the system itself is &quot;learning&quot; along the way. SAP doesn&#039;t change behavior as you use it: the AI system will.  I can assure you that this entire domain is both over-hyped and under-estimated. If you start small, get your hands dirty, and bring your IT team with you, you&#039;ll start to see astounding business benefits in any of the areas I discuss. And in the next article I&#039;ll explain how to build an AI-Hackathon for your team.

         — 
    


            “AI is coming for your job.”
    

            That’s just one variation of the many headlines you’ve probably seen ever since ChatGPT exploded in popularity and won the world’s attention late last year. But is it true?
    

            Back in April, Dropbox announced it was cutting 500 employees. In May, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas let go of almost 4,000 people. And in July, the founder of an e-commerce startup said he laid off 90% of his support team. The common reason cited? You guessed it: artificial intelligence.
    

Goldman Sachs economists have estimated that 300 million full-time jobs across the globe could be automated in some way by the newest wave of AI, with up to a quarter of all jobs being completely done by AI.
    

            Indeed, large language models like ChatGPT have demonstrated a pretty remarkable ability to write code, offer detailed instructions for different tasks, pass a law school bar exam, and even express empathy when answering medical questions. And while this technology has the potential to cause widespread disruption, the effects may not be felt evenly across the workforce, with white-collar workers likely to be more affected than manual laborers.
    

            AI isn’t always better, faster or cheaper, though. In fact, current iterations are prone to making mistakes and spitting out false information. News outlet CNET had to issue several corrections after it used an AI tool to help write stories. And some workers, including members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, have said that their workload actually increased since their companies implemented new AI tools.

            In some industries, experts have suggested a future in which AI can assist humans rather than replace them entirely. In others, artificial intelligence may have little to no impact at all.
    

            To get a better sense of the effect AI might have on different industries across the labor market, we reached out to experts in medicine, law, art, retail, film, tech, education and agriculture, to address 1) How will AI change the nature of work? and 2) How will AI change the labor force in this specific industry?
    

            Read on to see what they had to say. The views expressed in this commentary are their own.
    

        Medicine


        Erich S. Huang: Do you want AI to be your doctor?


Erich S. Huang is the head of Clinical Informatics at Verily and former chief data officer for quality at Duke Health and assistant dean for Biomedical Informatics at Duke University School of Medicine.


            Imagine you are sitting in an exam room. You are a 47-year-old with a 16-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son. Last week you had your annual screening mammogram and the radiologist identified a suspicious lesion. This week you have an ultrasound and a core needle biopsy. You’ve never needed a knowledgeable and compassionate doctor more than now.
    

            How much of this experience do you feel comfortable outsourcing to artificial intelligence? How do we position algorithms in settings where we still need professionals to sit down, look you in the eye, understand who you are as a person, help you understand what is going to happen next and answer all of your questions?

“While AI might simulate compassion, beyond chatbot interactions, AI cannot truly empathize or be emotionally anticipatory the way human clinical professionals can.”
Erich S. Huang




            I’ve worked on AI in biomedicine for my entire career. I absolutely believe in its potential and know that AI will certainly be a part of medicine as we work to improve and further personalize care. AI can win back time and space for clinicians and help to reduce the administrative burden that is mostly tangential to direct patient care.

            How often do you notice your doctor or nurse looking at a screen rather than looking at you? Several hours and thousands of mouse clicks a day are laboriously devoted to entering data into an electronic health record. Many health care person hours are spent on billing and reimbursement rather than patient care. These represent low-hanging opportunities for automation that will help your doctor be more present for you.
    

            But AI should not take away clinical jobs. While AI might simulate compassion, beyond chatbot interactions, AI cannot truly empathize or be emotionally anticipatory the way human clinical professionals can.
    

            Graduating from medical school, we raise our right hands and pledge the Hippocratic Oath. Machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence do not. The best clinicians make data-driven decisions while helping you and your family understand your options with compassion. They are professionals. Algorithms are not.
    

            Think of navigation aids like Apple or Google Maps: We entrust algorithms to evaluate factors such as traffic and road construction to find us the best route to our destination. We still drive the car. We still scan the road ahead for changing conditions and pump the brakes (even with self-driving cars) when we need to react quickly.
    

            We must do the same for health care. Our task is to use algorithms to marshal data to efficiently assist human professionals to help other human beings to better health. How we care for patients should not be “artificial.”

        Regina Barzilay: AI can shift late-stage treatment to prevention


Regina Barzilay is a distinguished professor for AI and health in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at MIT. She is the AI lead of Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning and Health. Barzilay is also a MacArthur Fellow and a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.


            In 2016, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton made a bold prediction that within five to 10 years, AI models would outperform humans in reading medical images, saying, “People should stop training radiologists now.”
    

            He was right in some ways and wrong in others. Most clinicians refer to this quote as an example of AI hype, citing the significant shortage of radiologists, who are still very much in demand today. But he was right about AI’s abilities — in some areas of clinical AI, primarily radiology, machines indeed match and even outperform human experts. Among AI practitioners, Hinton’s comments often ignite feelings of frustration over the increasing gap between the performance capacity of these existing tools and the slow rate of their adoption in health care systems.
    



        Smart AI algorithms, which are trained on large-scale medical data and equipped with powerful computing, can go beyond what is humanly possible, eliminate care delays and reduce the cost of health care.

            Smart AI algorithms, which are trained on large-scale medical data and equipped with powerful computing, can go beyond what is humanly possible, eliminate care delays and reduce the cost of health care. We already see research models that can diagnose diseases years prior to symptom occurrence, predict an individual patient’s response to intervention and personalize the treatment.
    

            But real-world integration of AI in health care has been slow due to a number of reasons, from the initial cost of adoption to qualms about safety and regulation. Based on my experience collaborating with hospitals, health care systems are more likely to utilize AI to reduce the administrative burden in care management, fueled by advancements in natural language processing tools (such as ChatGPT) that can automate the transcription of doctors’ notes, help with scheduling and streamline office support. Instead of replacing doctors, this technology can help address issues of burnout and allow health care providers to focus more on improving the patient experience.
    

            But the more fundamental change to health care will come from the uptake of new AI-powered diagnostic and treatment tools which will shift late-disease treatment to prevention and early-stage interventions. In the same way that e-commerce provides recommendations tailored to a consumer, AI-empowered medicine will eventually be personalized.
    

            To achieve this vision, advancements in AI are not sufficient on their own; clinicians, regulators and the general public have a role to play in determining the extent to which AI will be adopted in hospitals and doctors’ offices.
    

        Law


        Daniel W. Linna Jr.: AI is changing the skills lawyers need


Daniel W. Linna Jr. has a joint appointment at Northwestern’s Pritzker School of Law and McCormick School of Engineering. Dan’s research and teaching focus is on using AI for legal services and the regulation of AI in society. Previously, Dan was a litigator and equity partner at Honigman, a large law firm, and an IT manager, developer and consultant.


            Artificial intelligence will better equip society to uphold the values and achieve the goals of the law. With AI assistance, lawyers can spend more time working on the challenges that attracted many of us to the law, such as eradicating inequality, ensuring access to justice, safeguarding democracy and strengthening and expanding the rule of law.
    

            For instance, we can develop AI tools to help individuals understand their responsibilities and rights, and preserve and enforce those rights. At Northwestern University’s CS+Law Innovation Lab, where my colleague and I oversee teams of law and computer science students who build prototype technologies, we have worked with the nonprofit Law Center for Better Housing to improve Rentervention, a chatbot that helps tenants in disputes with landlords. If a landlord does not return a security deposit, for example, Rentervention can help tenants determine if they are entitled to the security deposit and, if so, help draft a letter demanding its return.
    

            People in businesses, large and small, are already using chatbots, AI assistants and other AI tools to help them comply with laws, regulations and internal policies. AI tools specifically developed for legal tasks can help them draft and negotiate contracts, make business decisions consistent with legal and ethical principles and proactively identify potential problems that they should discuss with a lawyer.

“…in a business dispute for nonpayment of goods, an AI system could predict the likelihood of success and create initial drafts of legal briefs …  based on the AI system’s analysis of the judge’s past written decisions.”
Daniel W. Linna Jr.




            For lawyers, this means that AI can automate or augment many legal tasks that they perform. Most lawyers spend a lot of time finding applicable laws, organizing information, spotting common issues, performing basic analysis and drafting formulaic language in emails, memos, forms, contracts and briefs. AI systems will be able to do this faster, cheaper and better. Large language models, like those behind ChatGPT, have significantly increased the capabilities of these systems. Established legal information providers and many startups are rapidly developing and releasing AI systems that are “fine-tuned” or specialized for legal tasks.
    

            Unsurprisingly, AI is changing the skills lawyers need. To responsibly use AI, they will need a functional understanding of the technology to evaluate the benefits and risks of using it, such as how it might fail and the ways in which it might be biased or unfair.
    

            Lawyers will also need to exercise judgment to tailor an AI system’s output for specific situations. For example, in a business dispute for nonpayment of goods, an AI system could predict the likelihood of success and create initial drafts of legal briefs, using the specific language and arguments that are most likely to persuade the assigned judge to rule in favor of the client, based on the AI system’s analysis of the judge’s past written decisions.
    

            A lawyer will need to determine if the prediction and the proposed language and arguments are a good fit given the client’s goals and interests. Perhaps what would be a winning argument, for example, would cause damage to the client’s brand in the eye of the public, and the lawyer should revise it.
    

            Lawyers will continue to play a significant role as governments update laws, regulations and policies for emerging technologies, including to address AI bias, discrimination, privacy, liability and intellectual property. Additionally, new roles are emerging in the legal industry, such as legal engineers who build systems, legal data scientists and legal operations professionals. And there is significant unmet demand for legal services from individuals and even businesses. Considering all of this, the best long-term prediction now is that there will continue to be a stable number of jobs for lawyers and other legal professionals, so long as the legal industry embraces technology and trains professionals to develop important complementary skills.
    

            While there is uncertainty about the future, there have never been more opportunities for lawyers to make an impact on society.
    

        Art


        Refik Anadol: AI will force artists to push their imaginations even further


Refik Anadol is a media artist and director who owns and operates Refik Anadol Studio and teaches at UCLA’s Department of Design Media Arts. His work locates creativity at the intersection of art, science and technology, and has been featured at landmark institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, The Centre Pompidou and Walt Disney Concert Hall.


            Artificial intelligence and automation will initially cause some shifts in the labor force in the arts, but I do think that in the long run, it will create more jobs than it will disrupt.
    

            For example, we already need an army of ethicists, translators, linguists and humanities professionals to oversee chatbots and implement policies to make sure they make fewer mistakes. And because AI will continue to push human imagination — whether for the pursuit of meaningful human-AI collaborations or to prove that man-made art is better than AI-generated art — it will give rise to more areas for further professional training. We will encounter new art movements and new forms of digital aesthetics in the near future, and those will be created by humans, not AI.
    

            For almost a decade, I have been using AI as a collaborator in my media art practice. I use publicly available data sets to train AI algorithms, ranging from cities’ weather patterns to photographs of California’s national parks. Since the pandemic, my focus has been to compile the largest nature-themed data set and contribute to its preservation by creating archives of images of disappearing natural places or through fundraising.

“We will encounter new art movements and new forms of digital aesthetics in the near future, and those will be created by humans, not AI.”
Refik Anadol




            Our work changes with every new AI-related invention, because we engage with deep research to first understand and then incorporate novel technologies into our works. Generative AI uses still-evolving projection algorithms that can learn from existing artifacts to create novel artifacts that accurately reflect the features of the initial data without repeating them. It provides us the possibility to train algorithms with any image, sound or even scent data. The current hype around generative AI models such as text-image generators and natural language chatbots made us put more emphasis on alternative data collection methods. We are committed to contributing to the practice of and dialogues around safeguarding against data bias, protecting data privacy and full transparency about how data is collected and used in training algorithms.
    

            A big challenge of using generative AI in art is figuring out how to provide the models with original and authentic data for the kinds of artistic output that I imagine in the beginning. For example, for our most recent project, “Glacier Dreams” — a series of multisensory AI art installations — we decided not to use models already trained with existing glacier images. Making sure that the trained models use ethically sourced data in terms of consent, or even making sure that the data we collect from publicly available platforms fall under that category, is one of the major concerns in our field. So, in order to address these issues, we started to collect our own images, sounds and climate data. By traveling to our first destination, Iceland, we were able to capture the beginning of our own narrative of glaciers by taking our own images and videos.
    

            I think that the increasing prevalence, accessibility and acceptance of AI-generated art will force not only artists, but also writers, designers and other creatives to re-consider the meaning of creativity and push their imagination even further. This will require time, effort and in some cases re-structuring of methods and practices, but I am in favor of keeping an open mind while reviewing innovation through a respectful and critical lens.
    

        Retail


        Adam Elmachtoub: AI will help grocery stores set inventory for game days


Adam Elmachtoub is an associate professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University, specializing in machine learning, optimization and pricing algorithms for e-commerce and logistics.


            Consider a grocery retailer or restaurant chain on the day that the NBA releases its playoff schedule. For cities that are hosting games, AI tools will one day be able to immediately realize that this news will adjust the demand forecast for foods like chicken wings and potato chips, which are associated with basketball viewing parties. AI tools will then quickly re-optimize decisions associated with inventory shipments, staffing and promotions.
    

            Over the last decade, online and brick-and-mortar retail have leveraged many advances in AI, particularly in the fields of operations research and machine learning. Operations research methodologies are used for inventory management, price optimization and delivery logistics, while machine learning tools are used for forecasting demand, digesting product reviews and targeted advertising. In the next wave of AI, we will solve operations problems faster by learning from past data, while also predicting changes to demand at a more granular level (both in space and time).

            Suppose the “Wannabe” music video by the Spice Girls was released today, rather than in 1996, and went viral on social media. A clothing retailer with an AI system in place can pick up on this viral hit immediately and initiate designs for similar clothing styles as in the video. Machine learning can help predict the demand at a local level, while operations research tools can help to immediately start sourcing materials, optimize manufacturing and plan inventory shipments.
    

            While it is possible that retailers might have data scientists that follow the NBA and social media closely, there are countless other events that AI systems will detect and react to in real time — with less human intervention and serendipity required. AI will help make data scientists and managers more efficient, but not necessarily take away jobs, as there will be more opportunities to leverage data and improve the customer experience. Of course, human workers will still be needed to manage AI systems, which can have trouble navigating through satire, false information and adversarial attacks. While some roles, such as operating a register or stocking shelves, might be replaced by AI-powered robots in the future, more jobs may open up in assisting customers with complex tasks such as returns or advice, as retailers compete more on (human) service quality.
    

        Nisreen Ameen: Not sure what sunglasses suit you? AI can analyze your face and decide


Dr. Nisreen Ameen is a senior lecturer in digital marketing and co-director of the Digital Organisation and Society (DOS) Research Centre at Royal Holloway, University of London. Nisreen is also currently serving as vice president of the UK Academy of Information Systems (UKAIS). 


            AI will be a game changer for retailers, and the value of this technology in the global retail market is expected to grow dramatically in the next few years.
    

            AI will allow retailers to improve the online shopping experience and connect with their customers through personalization, whether it be through online advertisements or curated product pages. Instead of having customers scroll through hundreds of products to find one item that they like or need, selected products can be presented to meet the customer’s tastes or demands, leading to higher engagement and increased sales.
    

            AI can also transform the shopping experience in new and unique ways. Some retailers have already installed smart mirrors, which use augmented reality and artificial intelligence for virtual try-ons. These mirrors can suggest different sunglasses, for example, based on an analysis of the customer’s face shape, or help customers visualize how certain beauty products will look. In some cases, customers can also create a digital avatar for online shopping, helping them to confidently select the best size and fit.
    






CNN

Nisreen Ameen




            AI will have an enormous impact on both the nature of work in retail and the labor force in this industry. Chatbots are already widely used in customer service, and AI-driven robots can assist with tasks like inventory monitoring and answering simple questions in retail stores, such as where to find certain items.
    

            While AI can handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks or synthesize massive amounts of data, and some retail jobs could be in danger of being replaced, employees’ input is still currently required for decision making and tasks that require empathy and emotional intelligence — particularly when it comes to branding, marketing and public relations, for example.
    

            For many employees, AI will redefine job descriptions, and the integration of this technology will require upskilling in order to work with AI and remain creative. Managers in retail should understand the potential and limitations of this new technology and focus on augmentation — utilizing AI in conjunction with human intelligence — instead of automation.
    

        Film


        Theodore Kim: Get ready for the rise of the mockbuster


Theodore Kim is a professor of computer science at Yale, a former senior research scientist for Pixar and a two-time Scientific and Technical Academy Award winner.


            If the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 actors, don’t secure stricter guardrails against the use of AI during their negotiations with Hollywood studios, the film industry will end up relying less on the traditional writers, actors and directors who help bring movies to life.
    

            Instead, movies will increasingly be made on the cheap by people who wrestle images out of generative AI systems — a prestigious-sounding task called “prompt engineering.” In reality, this grueling and inevitably low-paying vocation will make today’s relentless, unsustainable visual effects work look like a beach weekend. Instead of meticulously manipulating digital shapes and lights, they will generate images using indirect and ever-more baroque text prompts, and the final images will still get credited to AI. Paychecks will shrink, as they always do when occupations undergo deskilling.

“…the race to the bottom sparked by AI is going to see this genre explode, where every big budget movie gets automatically ingested and imitated.”
Theodore Kim




            Moreover, if all this comes to pass, we should prepare for the golden age of the mockbuster. With no protections in place for writing or acting, the race to the bottom sparked by AI is going to see this genre explode, where every big budget movie gets automatically ingested and imitated.
    

            The ChatGPT prompts will begin with, “Make me a ‘Mission Impossible,’ but different enough that I can’t get sued.” These AI-generated films will be a computational distillation of that episode of “30 Rock” where a Janis Joplin biopic that failed to secure her life rights was transformed into the more legally defensible “Jackie Jormp-Jomp” story.
    

            As much as advocates breathlessly proclaim that AI will unleash new forms of creative expression, it excels most at imitation and interpolation, and may as well have been custom-made for mockbusters. We’re already seeing AI-generated trailers rip off Baz Luhrmann’s “The Great Gatsby” in a litigiously ambiguous manner. That’s not Leonardo DiCaprio, the argument goes. The hair color is different and the face is creepily blurrier.
    

            It remains to be seen whether the use of AI will backfire on the studios and whether audiences might be willing to wait a week for close-enough ripoffs to appear on YouTube. In the meantime, AI-generated films won’t be a boon to actors, directors or viewers. With all those billable hours spent chasing after mockbusters, the winners here will be the lawyers.
    

        Tech


        Eirini Kalliamvakou: A big win for software developers — and society


Dr. Eirini Kalliamvakou is a staff researcher at GitHub Next, where she guides the team’s strategic prototyping efforts. Eirini has led the productivity research on GitHub Copilot, and has spoken extensively about developer productivity and happiness.


            AI has already proven to be one of the best tools we have to empower the next generation of software developers by redefining productivity and lowering barriers to entry. I believe AI will change the way developers work while ultimately increasing demand for these already highly sought-after professionals.
    

            A survey of 500 US-based developers found that the vast majority (92%) is already using AI coding tools, and in a controlled study, we found that GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer that offers automated code suggestions, helps developers complete tasks 55% faster than they could without it.
    

            AI tools like GitHub Copilot can reduce the amount of repetitive code developers need to write by providing auto-complete suggestions that can be accepted with minor edits. The code completions also contain the right coding syntax that developers would otherwise have to look up, minimizing interruptions to their work.

“The trajectory of the software industry includes many attempts to increase automation, and while that changed the nature of coding, it didn’t end the need for developers.”
Eirini Kalliamvakou




            More than 2,000 developers have reported that GitHub Copilot helps them stay in the flow, focus on more satisfying work and conserve mental energy. That’s a clear win for overall developer happiness.
    

            As for how developers might use the time saved by AI? They can focus more on problem solving, software architecture and innovation. Development work is endless, and software companies and projects often have long backlogs of features, ideas and innovations that they never get to build because their resources are poured into the day’s work.
    

            This increase in productivity could make a huge material difference — research shows that AI developer tools could boost global gross domestic product by more than $1.5 trillion by 2030. Given the benefits, learning how to use these tools will soon become table stakes for software developers, who will become more fluent in prompting and interacting with AI. This will ultimately help democratize access to a career in software development and establish AI pair programming tools as part of the standard education and training in this field.
    

            If the past is any indication, new developer tools will only augment developers and improve their workflows. The trajectory of the software industry includes many attempts to increase automation, and while that changed the nature of coding, it didn’t end the need for developers.
    

            In fact, the number of developers has increased, their wages have gone up, and the barriers to entry have lowered. We expect AI to have a similar effect.
    

            Developers’ work is already becoming faster and more enjoyable with AI tools. Can it also become less mentally taxing, more expressive and exactly collaborative enough?
    

            Our ambition now spreads to reimagine a different way for developers to bring their ideas to life, work with code and work with AI. Developers and organizations will be more ambitious with what they can accomplish through software development, which helps accelerate overall human progress — a win for developers and society alike.
    

        Education


        Ashok Goel: AI will fully power universities in the next few years


Ashok Goel is a professor of computer science and human-centered computing at Georgia Institute of Technology and the executive director of the National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education, sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and headquartered at Georgia Tech.


            In 2016, when my laboratory created a virtual teaching assistant named Jill Watson to automatically answer students’ common questions in online education, we offloaded a routine task from professors to AI agents. This provided students with access to the virtual teaching assistant any place and any time. Over time, this also freed professors to attend to other, more important tasks, such as engaging in deeper conversations with students. Since then, my laboratory has developed interactive books and interactive videos to enhance cognitive engagement, virtual assistants that facilitate social interactions, and learning environments that personalize learning.
    

            I believe that AI will have a deep, profound and systemic impact on education. The impact will be more rapid and radical in higher education because it has more freedom to experiment; a variety of social, cultural and political forces often make changes in K-12 education more difficult to achieve. I expect that within the next few years, we will see the rise of the first fully AI-powered universities in which every office, job and activity will be automated or augmented by AI.

“I expect that within the next few years, we will see the rise of the first fully AI-powered universities in which every office, job and activity will be automated or augmented by AI.”
Ashok Goel




            It has been said that AI helps humans do things better, for example, do things faster and more easily. While this is true for many administrative tasks, the real value of AI is in helping humans do better things, for example, be more creative.
    

            Based on Jill Watson and other experiments in our laboratory, I expect that students in general will embrace the new AI technologies. And most professors will adapt to advances in AI, as the tools will help amplify their voice and reach. AI will allow them, for instance, to reach more students. Professors will also have more time to focus on important tasks such as creating new content and mentoring students. It remains to be seen how easily administrative staff will accommodate the approaching changes, as some may see AI as a potential threat to their jobs. While I see no reason for professors to lose their jobs, some staff positions may well be lost to AI.
    

            More generally, AI will enable universities to engage in more creative educational practices, for example, personalized learning — learning tailored to the needs and profiles of individual students — and lifetime education — learning new skills throughout a student’s lifetime. This will empower students, enabling them to learn what they want and when they want it. This will redefine the role of institutions of higher education in our lives and society, as these institutions will emerge as centers of continuous and sustained workforce development critical to the economy.
    

        Kristen DiCerbo: AI will allow teachers to be more human


Kristen DiCerbo, Ph.D. is the chief learning officer at Khan Academy. She has spent most of her career designing and researching digital learning environments.


            Within the education system, teachers are often being asked to do too much and, in some places for some subjects, there are teacher shortages. The promise of AI in education is that we can free up teachers’ time by providing them assistance to complete labor-intensive activities, such as lesson planning, rubric creation, and even feedback and grading.
    

            An AI teaching assistant, for example, can offer students more frequent and immediate feedback on their writing, and can ask them to explain their steps on a math problem. Students learn best when they get a chance to practice new skills and get immediate feedback on their efforts, but this is impossible with one teacher and large class sizes.
    



        Teachers help students achieve a sense of belonging in school, see themselves as capable of success, and act as architects of their own future. Artificial intelligence cannot do any of that.
    

            Kristen DiCerbo
        


            So AI will really become an extension of the teacher rather than a replacement. Systems based on large language models, like chatbots, can help teachers differentiate lessons for learners at different levels. It can reduce the amount of time teachers spend on planning by serving as a partner in creating lesson plans, brainstorming class activities and drafting quizzes.
    

            Spending less time on these tasks does not mean we need fewer teachers. It means teachers have more time to build relationships with students. Studies show that strong relationships with teachers and school staff help increase students’ motivation and academic engagement. Teachers help students achieve a sense of belonging in school, see themselves as capable of success, and act as architects of their own future. Artificial intelligence cannot do any of that.
    

National assessment results are not where we want them to be. We are not reaching all learners. Using AI can shift responsibilities so teachers can focus on the uniquely human things they can do to help students learn and prepare to solve the challenges of tomorrow.
    

        Agriculture


        Alireza Pourreza: When it comes to AI, farmers will need to strike a balance


Dr. Alireza Pourreza is an associate professor of extension in the Biological and Agricultural Engineering department at the University of California, Davis, and the director of the university’s Digital Agriculture Lab. Pourreza leads research and extension education in digital agriculture, remote sensing, precision agriculture, and mechanization.


            Artificial intelligence can transform agriculture and food production, revolutionize decision-making and help farmers address emerging issues from crop diseases to extreme weather events.
    

            By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI provides farmers with valuable decision-support tools that help optimize best practices and increase productivity. AI-driven predictive crop growth models can offer accurate crop yields and quality forecasts by analyzing weather patterns, soil conditions and crop health. This data helps farmers make effective decisions when it comes to planting schedules, allocating resources and marketing their crops by aligning supply with demand, adjusting pricing, timing market entry, targeting specific segments and negotiating contracts effectively based on accurate yield predictions.

“…it is essential to recognize that AI cannot fully replace the creative thinking and intuition that farmers bring to their work.”
Alireza Pourreza




            AI is also helpful for precision agriculture, or tailoring farming practices such as irrigation, fertilization and pest control to the specific needs of different areas within a field, recognizing that some areas may require different treatments for optimal crop growth and health than others. This can lead to improved yields, reduced waste and enhanced quality. Drones equipped with AI-driven sensors and spectral cameras can also identify crop stress and damage or detect pests and diseases, allowing for timely intervention. A farmer might use an AI-driven irrigation system to monitor soil moisture levels, adjusting irrigation daily to meet the specific needs of different areas within a field. This precise control can conserve water and promote healthier crop growth, adapting to weather changes and leading to higher yields.
    

Labor shortages are common in the agriculture industry and autonomous robotic systems can harvest crops accurately and efficiently, while AI-powered machines can streamline sorting and packaging. By automating labor-intensive tasks, AI enables farmers to strategically allocate their workforce, focusing on other activities that require human expertise.
    

            While AI offers immense potential, there are limitations. AI relies on the quality and accuracy of data, as well as wireless connectivity, which can be limited in rural areas. Initial implementation costs may also pose a challenge for small-scale farmers with limited resources. And it is essential to recognize that AI cannot fully replace the creative thinking and intuition that farmers bring to their work.
    

            By striking a balance between leveraging AI’s capabilities and recognizing the value of human expertise, farmers can embrace AI as a powerful tool, ensuring a more sustainable and prosperous future for agriculture.

But is it true? Back in April, Dropbox announced it was cutting 500 employees. In May, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas let go of almost 4,000 people. And in July, the founder of an e-commerce startup said he laid off 90% of his support team. The common reason cited? You guessed it: artificial intelligence. Goldman Sachs economists have estimated that 300 million full-time jobs across the globe could be automated in some way by the newest wave of AI, with up to a quarter of all jobs being completely done by AI. Indeed, large language models like ChatGPT have demonstrated a pretty remarkable ability to write code, offer detailed instructions for different tasks, pass a law school bar exam, and even express empathy when answering medical questions. And while this technology has the potential to cause widespread disruption, the effects may not be felt evenly across the workforce, with white-collar workers likely to be more affected than manual laborers. AI isn’t always better, faster or cheaper, though. In fact, current iterations are prone to making mistakes and spitting out false information. News outlet CNET had to issue several corrections after it used an AI tool to help write stories. And some workers, including members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, have said that their workload actually increased since their companies implemented new AI tools. In some industries, experts have suggested a future in which AI can assist humans rather than replace them entirely. In others, artificial intelligence may have little to no impact at all. To get a better sense of the effect AI might have on different industries across the labor market, we reached out to experts in medicine, law, art, retail, film, tech, education and agriculture, to address 1) How will AI change the nature of work? and 2) How will AI change the labor force in this specific industry? Read on to see what they had to say. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Medicine Erich S. Huang: Do you want AI to be your doctor? Erich S. Huang is the head of Clinical Informatics at Verily and former chief data officer for quality at Duke Health and assistant dean for Biomedical Informatics at Duke University School of Medicine. Imagine you are sitting in an exam room. You are a 47-year-old with a 16-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son. Last week you had your annual screening mammogram and the radiologist identified a suspicious lesion. This week you have an ultrasound and a core needle biopsy. You’ve never needed a knowledgeable and compassionate doctor more than now. How much of this experience do you feel comfortable outsourcing to artificial intelligence? How do we position algorithms in settings where we still need professionals to sit down, look you in the eye, understand who you are as a person, help you understand what is going to happen next and answer all of your questions? I’ve worked on AI in biomedicine for my entire career. I absolutely believe in its potential and know that AI will certainly be a part of medicine as we work to improve and further personalize care. AI can win back time and space for clinicians and help to reduce the administrative burden that is mostly tangential to direct patient care. How often do you notice your doctor or nurse looking at a screen rather than looking at you? Several hours and thousands of mouse clicks a day are laboriously devoted to entering data into an electronic health record. Many health care person hours are spent on billing and reimbursement rather than patient care. These represent low-hanging opportunities for automation that will help your doctor be more present for you. But AI should not take away clinical jobs. While AI might simulate compassion, beyond chatbot interactions, AI cannot truly empathize or be emotionally anticipatory the way human clinical professionals can. Graduating from medical school, we raise our right hands and pledge the Hippocratic Oath. Machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence do not. The best clinicians make data-driven decisions while helping you and your family understand your options with compassion. They are professionals. Algorithms are not. Think of navigation aids like Apple or Google Maps: We entrust algorithms to evaluate factors such as traffic and road construction to find us the best route to our destination. We still drive the car. We still scan the road ahead for changing conditions and pump the brakes (even with self-driving cars) when we need to react quickly. We must do the same for health care. Our task is to use algorithms to marshal data to efficiently assist human professionals to help other human beings to better health. How we care for patients should not be “artificial.” Regina Barzilay: AI can shift late-stage treatment to prevention Regina Barzilay is a distinguished professor for AI and health in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at MIT. She is the AI lead of Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning and Health. Barzilay is also a MacArthur Fellow and a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2016, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton made a bold prediction that within five to 10 years, AI models would outperform humans in reading medical images, saying, “People should stop training radiologists now.” He was right in some ways and wrong in others. Most clinicians refer to this quote as an example of AI hype, citing the significant shortage of radiologists, who are still very much in demand today. But he was right about AI’s abilities — in some areas of clinical AI, primarily radiology, machines indeed match and even outperform human experts. Among AI practitioners, Hinton’s comments often ignite feelings of frustration over the increasing gap between the performance capacity of these existing tools and the slow rate of their adoption in health care systems. Smart AI algorithms, which are trained on large-scale medical data and equipped with powerful computing, can go beyond what is humanly possible, eliminate care delays and reduce the cost of health care. We already see research models that can diagnose diseases years prior to symptom occurrence, predict an individual patient’s response to intervention and personalize the treatment. But real-world integration of AI in health care has been slow due to a number of reasons, from the initial cost of adoption to qualms about safety and regulation. Based on my experience collaborating with hospitals, health care systems are more likely to utilize AI to reduce the administrative burden in care management, fueled by advancements in natural language processing tools (such as ChatGPT) that can automate the transcription of doctors’ notes, help with scheduling and streamline office support. Instead of replacing doctors, this technology can help address issues of burnout and allow health care providers to focus more on improving the patient experience. But the more fundamental change to health care will come from the uptake of new AI-powered diagnostic and treatment tools which will shift late-disease treatment to prevention and early-stage interventions. In the same way that e-commerce provides recommendations tailored to a consumer, AI-empowered medicine will eventually be personalized. To achieve this vision, advancements in AI are not sufficient on their own; clinicians, regulators and the general public have a role to play in determining the extent to which AI will be adopted in hospitals and doctors’ offices. Law Daniel W. Linna Jr.: AI is changing the skills lawyers need Daniel W. Linna Jr. has a joint appointment at Northwestern’s Pritzker School of Law and McCormick School of Engineering. Dan’s research and teaching focus is on using AI for legal services and the regulation of AI in society. Previously, Dan was a litigator and equity partner at Honigman, a large law firm, and an IT manager, developer and consultant. Artificial intelligence will better equip society to uphold the values and achieve the goals of the law. With AI assistance, lawyers can spend more time working on the challenges that attracted many of us to the law, such as eradicating inequality, ensuring access to justice, safeguarding democracy and strengthening and expanding the rule of law. For instance, we can develop AI tools to help individuals understand their responsibilities and rights, and preserve and enforce those rights. At Northwestern University’s CS+Law Innovation Lab, where my colleague and I oversee teams of law and computer science students who build prototype technologies, we have worked with the nonprofit Law Center for Better Housing to improve Rentervention, a chatbot that helps tenants in disputes with landlords. If a landlord does not return a security deposit, for example, Rentervention can help tenants determine if they are entitled to the security deposit and, if so, help draft a letter demanding its return. People in businesses, large and small, are already using chatbots, AI assistants and other AI tools to help them comply with laws, regulations and internal policies. AI tools specifically developed for legal tasks can help them draft and negotiate contracts, make business decisions consistent with legal and ethical principles and proactively identify potential problems that they should discuss with a lawyer. For lawyers, this means that AI can automate or augment many legal tasks that they perform. Most lawyers spend a lot of time finding applicable laws, organizing information, spotting common issues, performing basic analysis and drafting formulaic language in emails, memos, forms, contracts and briefs. AI systems will be able to do this faster, cheaper and better. Large language models, like those behind ChatGPT, have significantly increased the capabilities of these systems. Established legal information providers and many startups are rapidly developing and releasing AI systems that are “fine-tuned” or specialized for legal tasks. Unsurprisingly, AI is changing the skills lawyers need. To responsibly use AI, they will need a functional understanding of the technology to evaluate the benefits and risks of using it, such as how it might fail and the ways in which it might be biased or unfair. Lawyers will also need to exercise judgment to tailor an AI system’s output for specific situations. For example, in a business dispute for nonpayment of goods, an AI system could predict the likelihood of success and create initial drafts of legal briefs, using the specific language and arguments that are most likely to persuade the assigned judge to rule in favor of the client, based on the AI system’s analysis of the judge’s past written decisions. A lawyer will need to determine if the prediction and the proposed language and arguments are a good fit given the client’s goals and interests. Perhaps what would be a winning argument, for example, would cause damage to the client’s brand in the eye of the public, and the lawyer should revise it. Lawyers will continue to play a significant role as governments update laws, regulations and policies for emerging technologies, including to address AI bias, discrimination, privacy, liability and intellectual property. Additionally, new roles are emerging in the legal industry, such as legal engineers who build systems, legal data scientists and legal operations professionals. And there is significant unmet demand for legal services from individuals and even businesses. Considering all of this, the best long-term prediction now is that there will continue to be a stable number of jobs for lawyers and other legal professionals, so long as the legal industry embraces technology and trains professionals to develop important complementary skills. While there is uncertainty about the future, there have never been more opportunities for lawyers to make an impact on society. Art Refik Anadol: AI will force artists to push their imaginations even further Refik Anadol is a media artist and director who owns and operates Refik Anadol Studio and teaches at UCLA’s Department of Design Media Arts. His work locates creativity at the intersection of art, science and technology, and has been featured at landmark institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, The Centre Pompidou and Walt Disney Concert Hall. Artificial intelligence and automation will initially cause some shifts in the labor force in the arts, but I do think that in the long run, it will create more jobs than it will disrupt. For example, we already need an army of ethicists, translators, linguists and humanities professionals to oversee chatbots and implement policies to make sure they make fewer mistakes. And because AI will continue to push human imagination — whether for the pursuit of meaningful human-AI collaborations or to prove that man-made art is better than AI-generated art — it will give rise to more areas for further professional training. We will encounter new art movements and new forms of digital aesthetics in the near future, and those will be created by humans, not AI. For almost a decade, I have been using AI as a collaborator in my media art practice. I use publicly available data sets to train AI algorithms, ranging from cities’ weather patterns to photographs of California’s national parks. Since the pandemic, my focus has been to compile the largest nature-themed data set and contribute to its preservation by creating archives of images of disappearing natural places or through fundraising. Our work changes with every new AI-related invention, because we engage with deep research to first understand and then incorporate novel technologies into our works. Generative AI uses still-evolving projection algorithms that can learn from existing artifacts to create novel artifacts that accurately reflect the features of the initial data without repeating them. It provides us the possibility to train algorithms with any image, sound or even scent data. The current hype around generative AI models such as text-image generators and natural language chatbots made us put more emphasis on alternative data collection methods. We are committed to contributing to the practice of and dialogues around safeguarding against data bias, protecting data privacy and full transparency about how data is collected and used in training algorithms. A big challenge of using generative AI in art is figuring out how to provide the models with original and authentic data for the kinds of artistic output that I imagine in the beginning. For example, for our most recent project, “Glacier Dreams” — a series of multisensory AI art installations — we decided not to use models already trained with existing glacier images. Making sure that the trained models use ethically sourced data in terms of consent, or even making sure that the data we collect from publicly available platforms fall under that category, is one of the major concerns in our field. So, in order to address these issues, we started to collect our own images, sounds and climate data. By traveling to our first destination, Iceland, we were able to capture the beginning of our own narrative of glaciers by taking our own images and videos. I think that the increasing prevalence, accessibility and acceptance of AI-generated art will force not only artists, but also writers, designers and other creatives to re-consider the meaning of creativity and push their imagination even further. This will require time, effort and in some cases re-structuring of methods and practices, but I am in favor of keeping an open mind while reviewing innovation through a respectful and critical lens. Retail Adam Elmachtoub: AI will help grocery stores set inventory for game days Adam Elmachtoub is an associate professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University, specializing in machine learning, optimization and pricing algorithms for e-commerce and logistics. Consider a grocery retailer or restaurant chain on the day that the NBA releases its playoff schedule. For cities that are hosting games, AI tools will one day be able to immediately realize that this news will adjust the demand forecast for foods like chicken wings and potato chips, which are associated with basketball viewing parties. AI tools will then quickly re-optimize decisions associated with inventory shipments, staffing and promotions. Over the last decade, online and brick-and-mortar retail have leveraged many advances in AI, particularly in the fields of operations research and machine learning. Operations research methodologies are used for inventory management, price optimization and delivery logistics, while machine learning tools are used for forecasting demand, digesting product reviews and targeted advertising. In the next wave of AI, we will solve operations problems faster by learning from past data, while also predicting changes to demand at a more granular level (both in space and time). Suppose the “Wannabe” music video by the Spice Girls was released today, rather than in 1996, and went viral on social media. A clothing retailer with an AI system in place can pick up on this viral hit immediately and initiate designs for similar clothing styles as in the video. Machine learning can help predict the demand at a local level, while operations research tools can help to immediately start sourcing materials, optimize manufacturing and plan inventory shipments. While it is possible that retailers might have data scientists that follow the NBA and social media closely, there are countless other events that AI systems will detect and react to in real time — with less human intervention and serendipity required. AI will help make data scientists and managers more efficient, but not necessarily take away jobs, as there will be more opportunities to leverage data and improve the customer experience. Of course, human workers will still be needed to manage AI systems, which can have trouble navigating through satire, false information and adversarial attacks. While some roles, such as operating a register or stocking shelves, might be replaced by AI-powered robots in the future, more jobs may open up in assisting customers with complex tasks such as returns or advice, as retailers compete more on (human) service quality. Nisreen Ameen: Not sure what sunglasses suit you? AI can analyze your face and decide Dr. Nisreen Ameen is a senior lecturer in digital marketing and co-director of the Digital Organisation and Society (DOS) Research Centre at Royal Holloway, University of London. Nisreen is also currently serving as vice president of the UK Academy of Information Systems (UKAIS).  AI will be a game changer for retailers, and the value of this technology in the global retail market is expected to grow dramatically in the next few years. AI will allow retailers to improve the online shopping experience and connect with their customers through personalization, whether it be through online advertisements or curated product pages. Instead of having customers scroll through hundreds of products to find one item that they like or need, selected products can be presented to meet the customer’s tastes or demands, leading to higher engagement and increased sales. AI can also transform the shopping experience in new and unique ways. Some retailers have already installed smart mirrors, which use augmented reality and artificial intelligence for virtual try-ons. These mirrors can suggest different sunglasses, for example, based on an analysis of the customer’s face shape, or help customers visualize how certain beauty products will look. In some cases, customers can also create a digital avatar for online shopping, helping them to confidently select the best size and fit. AI will have an enormous impact on both the nature of work in retail and the labor force in this industry. Chatbots are already widely used in customer service, and AI-driven robots can assist with tasks like inventory monitoring and answering simple questions in retail stores, such as where to find certain items. While AI can handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks or synthesize massive amounts of data, and some retail jobs could be in danger of being replaced, employees’ input is still currently required for decision making and tasks that require empathy and emotional intelligence — particularly when it comes to branding, marketing and public relations, for example. For many employees, AI will redefine job descriptions, and the integration of this technology will require upskilling in order to work with AI and remain creative. Managers in retail should understand the potential and limitations of this new technology and focus on augmentation — utilizing AI in conjunction with human intelligence — instead of automation. Film Theodore Kim: Get ready for the rise of the mockbuster Theodore Kim is a professor of computer science at Yale, a former senior research scientist for Pixar and a two-time Scientific and Technical Academy Award winner. If the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 actors, don’t secure stricter guardrails against the use of AI during their negotiations with Hollywood studios, the film industry will end up relying less on the traditional writers, actors and directors who help bring movies to life. Instead, movies will increasingly be made on the cheap by people who wrestle images out of generative AI systems — a prestigious-sounding task called “prompt engineering.” In reality, this grueling and inevitably low-paying vocation will make today’s relentless, unsustainable visual effects work look like a beach weekend. Instead of meticulously manipulating digital shapes and lights, they will generate images using indirect and ever-more baroque text prompts, and the final images will still get credited to AI. Paychecks will shrink, as they always do when occupations undergo deskilling. Moreover, if all this comes to pass, we should prepare for the golden age of the mockbuster. With no protections in place for writing or acting, the race to the bottom sparked by AI is going to see this genre explode, where every big budget movie gets automatically ingested and imitated. The ChatGPT prompts will begin with, “Make me a ‘Mission Impossible,’ but different enough that I can’t get sued.” These AI-generated films will be a computational distillation of that episode of “30 Rock” where a Janis Joplin biopic that failed to secure her life rights was transformed into the more legally defensible “Jackie Jormp-Jomp” story. As much as advocates breathlessly proclaim that AI will unleash new forms of creative expression, it excels most at imitation and interpolation, and may as well have been custom-made for mockbusters. We’re already seeing AI-generated trailers rip off Baz Luhrmann’s “The Great Gatsby” in a litigiously ambiguous manner. That’s not Leonardo DiCaprio, the argument goes. The hair color is different and the face is creepily blurrier. It remains to be seen whether the use of AI will backfire on the studios and whether audiences might be willing to wait a week for close-enough ripoffs to appear on YouTube. In the meantime, AI-generated films won’t be a boon to actors, directors or viewers. With all those billable hours spent chasing after mockbusters, the winners here will be the lawyers. Tech Eirini Kalliamvakou: A big win for software developers — and society Dr. Eirini Kalliamvakou is a staff researcher at GitHub Next, where she guides the team’s strategic prototyping efforts. Eirini has led the productivity research on GitHub Copilot, and has spoken extensively about developer productivity and happiness. AI has already proven to be one of the best tools we have to empower the next generation of software developers by redefining productivity and lowering barriers to entry. I believe AI will change the way developers work while ultimately increasing demand for these already highly sought-after professionals. A survey of 500 US-based developers found that the vast majority (92%) is already using AI coding tools, and in a controlled study, we found that GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer that offers automated code suggestions, helps developers complete tasks 55% faster than they could without it. AI tools like GitHub Copilot can reduce the amount of repetitive code developers need to write by providing auto-complete suggestions that can be accepted with minor edits. The code completions also contain the right coding syntax that developers would otherwise have to look up, minimizing interruptions to their work. More than 2,000 developers have reported that GitHub Copilot helps them stay in the flow, focus on more satisfying work and conserve mental energy. That’s a clear win for overall developer happiness. As for how developers might use the time saved by AI? They can focus more on problem solving, software architecture and innovation. Development work is endless, and software companies and projects often have long backlogs of features, ideas and innovations that they never get to build because their resources are poured into the day’s work. This increase in productivity could make a huge material difference — research shows that AI developer tools could boost global gross domestic product by more than $1.5 trillion by 2030. Given the benefits, learning how to use these tools will soon become table stakes for software developers, who will become more fluent in prompting and interacting with AI. This will ultimately help democratize access to a career in software development and establish AI pair programming tools as part of the standard education and training in this field. If the past is any indication, new developer tools will only augment developers and improve their workflows. The trajectory of the software industry includes many attempts to increase automation, and while that changed the nature of coding, it didn’t end the need for developers. In fact, the number of developers has increased, their wages have gone up, and the barriers to entry have lowered. We expect AI to have a similar effect. Developers’ work is already becoming faster and more enjoyable with AI tools. Can it also become less mentally taxing, more expressive and exactly collaborative enough? Our ambition now spreads to reimagine a different way for developers to bring their ideas to life, work with code and work with AI. Developers and organizations will be more ambitious with what they can accomplish through software development, which helps accelerate overall human progress — a win for developers and society alike. Education Ashok Goel: AI will fully power universities in the next few years Ashok Goel is a professor of computer science and human-centered computing at Georgia Institute of Technology and the executive director of the National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education, sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and headquartered at Georgia Tech. In 2016, when my laboratory created a virtual teaching assistant named Jill Watson to automatically answer students’ common questions in online education, we offloaded a routine task from professors to AI agents. This provided students with access to the virtual teaching assistant any place and any time. Over time, this also freed professors to attend to other, more important tasks, such as engaging in deeper conversations with students. Since then, my laboratory has developed interactive books and interactive videos to enhance cognitive engagement, virtual assistants that facilitate social interactions, and learning environments that personalize learning. I believe that AI will have a deep, profound and systemic impact on education. The impact will be more rapid and radical in higher education because it has more freedom to experiment; a variety of social, cultural and political forces often make changes in K-12 education more difficult to achieve. I expect that within the next few years, we will see the rise of the first fully AI-powered universities in which every office, job and activity will be automated or augmented by AI. It has been said that AI helps humans do things better, for example, do things faster and more easily. While this is true for many administrative tasks, the real value of AI is in helping humans do better things, for example, be more creative. Based on Jill Watson and other experiments in our laboratory, I expect that students in general will embrace the new AI technologies. And most professors will adapt to advances in AI, as the tools will help amplify their voice and reach. AI will allow them, for instance, to reach more students. Professors will also have more time to focus on important tasks such as creating new content and mentoring students. It remains to be seen how easily administrative staff will accommodate the approaching changes, as some may see AI as a potential threat to their jobs. While I see no reason for professors to lose their jobs, some staff positions may well be lost to AI. More generally, AI will enable universities to engage in more creative educational practices, for example, personalized learning — learning tailored to the needs and profiles of individual students — and lifetime education — learning new skills throughout a student’s lifetime. This will empower students, enabling them to learn what they want and when they want it. This will redefine the role of institutions of higher education in our lives and society, as these institutions will emerge as centers of continuous and sustained workforce development critical to the economy. Kristen DiCerbo: AI will allow teachers to be more human Kristen DiCerbo, Ph.D. is the chief learning officer at Khan Academy. She has spent most of her career designing and researching digital learning environments. Within the education system, teachers are often being asked to do too much and, in some places for some subjects, there are teacher shortages. The promise of AI in education is that we can free up teachers’ time by providing them assistance to complete labor-intensive activities, such as lesson planning, rubric creation, and even feedback and grading. An AI teaching assistant, for example, can offer students more frequent and immediate feedback on their writing, and can ask them to explain their steps on a math problem. Students learn best when they get a chance to practice new skills and get immediate feedback on their efforts, but this is impossible with one teacher and large class sizes. So AI will really become an extension of the teacher rather than a replacement. Systems based on large language models, like chatbots, can help teachers differentiate lessons for learners at different levels. It can reduce the amount of time teachers spend on planning by serving as a partner in creating lesson plans, brainstorming class activities and drafting quizzes. Spending less time on these tasks does not mean we need fewer teachers. It means teachers have more time to build relationships with students. Studies show that strong relationships with teachers and school staff help increase students’ motivation and academic engagement. Teachers help students achieve a sense of belonging in school, see themselves as capable of success, and act as architects of their own future. Artificial intelligence cannot do any of that. National assessment results are not where we want them to be. We are not reaching all learners. Using AI can shift responsibilities so teachers can focus on the uniquely human things they can do to help students learn and prepare to solve the challenges of tomorrow. Agriculture Alireza Pourreza: When it comes to AI, farmers will need to strike a balance Dr. Alireza Pourreza is an associate professor of extension in the Biological and Agricultural Engineering department at the University of California, Davis, and the director of the university’s Digital Agriculture Lab. Pourreza leads research and extension education in digital agriculture, remote sensing, precision agriculture, and mechanization. Artificial intelligence can transform agriculture and food production, revolutionize decision-making and help farmers address emerging issues from crop diseases to extreme weather events. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI provides farmers with valuable decision-support tools that help optimize best practices and increase productivity. AI-driven predictive crop growth models can offer accurate crop yields and quality forecasts by analyzing weather patterns, soil conditions and crop health. This data helps farmers make effective decisions when it comes to planting schedules, allocating resources and marketing their crops by aligning supply with demand, adjusting pricing, timing market entry, targeting specific segments and negotiating contracts effectively based on accurate yield predictions. AI is also helpful for precision agriculture, or tailoring farming practices such as irrigation, fertilization and pest control to the specific needs of different areas within a field, recognizing that some areas may require different treatments for optimal crop growth and health than others. This can lead to improved yields, reduced waste and enhanced quality. Drones equipped with AI-driven sensors and spectral cameras can also identify crop stress and damage or detect pests and diseases, allowing for timely intervention. A farmer might use an AI-driven irrigation system to monitor soil moisture levels, adjusting irrigation daily to meet the specific needs of different areas within a field. This precise control can conserve water and promote healthier crop growth, adapting to weather changes and leading to higher yields. Labor shortages are common in the agriculture industry and autonomous robotic systems can harvest crops accurately and efficiently, while AI-powered machines can streamline sorting and packaging. By automating labor-intensive tasks, AI enables farmers to strategically allocate their workforce, focusing on other activities that require human expertise. While AI offers immense potential, there are limitations. AI relies on the quality and accuracy of data, as well as wireless connectivity, which can be limited in rural areas. Initial implementation costs may also pose a challenge for small-scale farmers with limited resources. And it is essential to recognize that AI cannot fully replace the creative thinking and intuition that farmers bring to their work. By striking a balance between leveraging AI’s capabilities and recognizing the value of human expertise, farmers can embrace AI as a powerful tool, ensuring a more sustainable and prosperous future for agriculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P0Y0M0DT0H24M0S,5403.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

                Generative AI is already affecting work, but a ‘long journey’ awaits
            
Walmart announced a rollout of the tech to employees last week. AI will help “lower some friction between humans and software,” a source told HR Dive.

The world’s largest private employer is rolling out a generative artificial intelligence tool to frontline employees in what may be remembered as a milestone for workplace technology.
In an Aug. 30 LinkedIn post, Walmart’s Executive VP and Chief People Officer Donna Morris announced the launch of My Assistant, a generative AI program for the company’s associates that the company said will speed up processes such as drafting, summarizing large documents and problem solving.
The program is available to some 50,000 employees via both desktop and mobile interfaces, CIO Dive reported, and is intended to boost employee productivity as well as creativity and innovation, according to the announcement.

“Ideally, this technology will free [employees] from monotonous, repetitive tasks, allowing more time and focus for improving the customer/member experience,” Morris and co-author Cheryl Ainoa, executive vice president of new businesses and emerging technologies at Walmart, wrote on LinkedIn.
Though mainstream users became aware of generative AI less than one year ago, the tech has become increasingly present in workplaces. That is thanks in part to legacy vendors that have rolled out their own generative AI offerings. Two of the most prominent are Microsoft’s 365 Copilot and Google’s Duet AI, which integrate AI into software that is already widely used by employees, said J.P. Gownder, VP and principal analyst for Forrester’s future of work team.
For example, an employee could use the Microsoft and Google tools to quickly source images for a slideshow or build pivot tables for data analysis, all by directly communicating with an AI. Aside from speed, trackability is another advantage of these tools, Gownder said, as they can be audited for security, privacy and usage type by employers.
“Generative AI is going to lower some friction between humans and software,” Gownder continued. “It’s going to be very useful in much of the tech and software that we already use.”
The organizational AI approach is an alternative to the “bring your own AI” model in which employees apply publicly available tools to everyday tasks — often without their boss’ knowledge. A February survey of workers by Glassdoor’s Fishbowl found that more than one-third of employees were using AI tools for work, and 68% of that contingent said they did so without first informing management.

There are a few risks that come with this approach, Gownder said, including the security concerns inherent in feeding sensitive organizational data into an AI tool, as well as the problem of AI “hallucination” that sees some programs provide inaccurate or false information in response to a user prompt.
All generative AI programs present some potential downsides, however, Gownder noted. Authenticity is one such concern, particularly if AI is used for drafting and messaging purposes.
“If I were to send you an email, you’re not going to know if I wrote it using an assistant or if I just let Copilot write it, and I think there is a difference in knowing which of those scenarios is true,” he said. “If we sent a personalized email from the CEO, but it’s not actually written by the CEO, what’s the actual level of authenticity in that communication?”
Employers already have some awareness of AI’s limitations. Morris and Ainoa wrote that while the tech has the potential to help workers perform their jobs faster and more efficiently, “it lacks judgment, has a limited understanding of context and is only as good as the data it’s trained on.”
Training is key for employees, too. An IBM Institute for Business Value report found that reskilling poses a challenge to AI adoption. Gownder said employers that roll out AI should take charge in order to ensure workers get the most out of the tech.
“If you’re deploying [AI], it is your responsibility to train workers,” he said. “Your return on investment also depends on workers using the right skills. They’re not going to be effective if employees aren’t using them properly.”
And even if an organization decides to prohibit users from bringing their own AI to work, the widespread availability of generative AI platforms could still present some tension, Gownder said.

Despite these concerns, employee enthusiasm for AI has grown by some measurements. A recent Robert Half survey found that about 4 in 10 U.S. employees said they thought generative AI would have a positive effect on their careers, including more than half of HR professionals in the survey. That enthusiasm is all the more reason for employers to take time to consider how they will approach the subject, according to Gownder.
“You really need to think carefully about the users you’re intending to deploy AI to,” he said. “It’s going to be a long journey.”

 With its abilities to answer questions, perform research, generate content, and perform other human-like tasks, fears that artificial intelligence (AI) could threaten some jobs and industries aren't unfounded. But similar to past technological revolutions, AI isn’t likely to cause widespread job losses, and could eventually help stimulate the labor market, a report from Wells Fargo Economics concluded.


Key Takeaways
A Well Fargo Economics report found that past technological revolutions, like the Internet adoption of the 1990s, helped contribute to higher employment trends.Studies show that AI can perform part of some jobs, perhaps all of a few, but also that new technology often creates jobs that previously hadn't been imagined.Slow labor-force growth in the U.S. means that AI could help meet the increasing need for more workers.
 Acknowledging that some industries and occupations could indeed be rendered obsolete by AI, the four-part report showed that past technological revolutions failed to cause the widespread labor-market disruptions that some feared.


 Looking at the Internet revolution of the 1990s, the report noted that in the period between business-cycle peaks in July 1990 and March 2001, payrolls grew an average of 1.8% a year, adding about 23 million jobs.1 


 “History is rife with examples of groups that have opposed technological change due to fears of widespread job losses,” Wells Fargo Chief Economist Jay Bryson and others wrote in the analysis. “Time and again, however, aggregate levels of employment and income have risen in the aftermath of the introduction of the new technology.”2


  AI Poses Threat to Some ‘White-Collar’ Jobs, but Labor Market Proves Resilient  
 Studies of how much work could be accomplished by generative AI vary. The Wells Fargo report cited a recent study from the University of Pennsylvania with OpenAI and OpenResearch, which determined that 80% of workers could have at least 10% of their tasks done with generative AI, and 19% of workers could have 50% or more of their job covered by AI.3


 Another look from consulting firm McKinsey & Co. found that the share of time spent on work tasks that could be automated through AI or other technology amounted to 60% to 70%.1




 ""White-collar"" jobs are likely to face the most exposure to the technology, the report noted. Case in point, one study found that some jobs most threatened by AI include telemarketers, political scientists, mediators, judges, psychologists, and postsecondary teachers in foreign languages, history, and law. The least threatened: cement masons, roofers and welders.


 So far, predictions about the impacts of automation haven’t panned out. Wells Fargo pointed to a 2013 paper from Oxford University that forecast 47% of U.S. employment was at risk to automation over the next decade or two that failed to foresee the current labor market where the unemployment rate of 3.5% has hovered around record lows.1


  Slower Adoption of Technology Can Preserve Jobs  
 Another trend that’s likely to help preserve the labor market is that while technological development can happen quickly, widespread adoption can take more time, allowing transitions in the workforce to happen more gradually. With AI, factors as varied as government regulation to hardware costs to labor union strikes could help slow uptake of the technology enough to give the labor market time to transition. 


 The report also noted that technology like AI might help to fill the gap that a slowdown in the growth of the labor force has created. Estimates show that the U.S. labor force is expected to grow by 0.5% a year from 2023 to 2033, about half the pace of the past 30 years.1 


 The structural slowdown in the labor supply, which includes weak growth of the working-age population and smaller gains in labor-force participation, means that more workers will be needed and, in some cases, workers will need to do more, all of which could be accomplished by AI. 


 Most likely, the report said, AI would create jobs as others are replaced, noting that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that 60% of the job roles performed in 2018 hadn't yet been created in 1940.1


 “Making the widespread displacement of jobs the base case risks us joining a long historical record of commentators who have rung the alarm bell about surging unemployment due to new inventions that seemed unbelievable to the humans of the time,” it said.2

Generative AI and it’s impact on the entry-level job market: The future of work for Gen Z – Sarah Green Carmichael 
5th September 20235th September 2023 by Editor BizNews 


The article discusses the potential impact of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, on entry-level jobs and the career prospects of younger workers, particularly Gen Z. It explores concerns that AI automation could reduce the number of available professional jobs and limit learning opportunities for new entrants to the workforce. However, some experts argue that AI may raise the performance standards for entry-level workers, making them more efficient and capable, ultimately benefiting companies. While some entry-level jobs may evolve or even disappear due to AI, history shows that technological revolutions often create new industries and job opportunities in the long run. The article emphasizes the need to pay attention to the potential impact on workers without college degrees and highlights that AI still requires human oversight due to its limitations.
Is ChatGPT Coming for Entry-Level Jobs?: Sarah Green Carmichael
By Sarah Green Carmichael
The first years of my career in media were spent making photocopies, collecting faxes and filing papers. I also opened reader mail, took notes on meetings and ran errands for my bosses — picking up everything from skim lattes to control-top Donna Karan tights.
I’ve been thinking back to those dues-paying days recently due to an onslaught of depressing research about how generative AI, the technology that includes image and text creation tools like ChatGPT, could hurt the career prospects of Gen Z. If it transforms or even takes over typical entry-level tasks in professional occupations — building spreadsheets, writing first drafts or creating presentations — what will happen to jobs for younger workers?
At first blush, the outlook is bleak. Long before generative AI was a buzzword, entry-level jobs were becoming tougher to land. The Great Recession caused a spike in the un- and under-employment rate for recent graduates. Younger workers have smaller networks, which makes job-searching tougher.
And many employers have simply decided they don’t want to bother with brand-new workers. A 2018 analysis of almost 100,000 job postings found that most “entry-level” jobs required three or more years of experience. Employers don’t want to invest time and money in training. That’s short-sighted, but it’s a trend entry-level workers have been fighting for decades.
Some say that AI will compound these problems. Not only will there be fewer professional jobs to go around, but as more of those tasks are automated, young workers will miss out on learning opportunities and fail to build the skills they need to advance.
It’s a fair concern, but it’s probably too gloomy. “I don’t buy the doomsday scenarios at all,” says Amit Joshi, a professor who studies artificial intelligence at IMD business school in Lausanne, Switzerland. He says it’s more likely that AI will raise the benchmark for what an entry-level worker can achieve. Instead of taking a week to analyze and summarize 50 academic papers, a research assistant using ChatGPT might only need a day to synthesize the core points and check for errors.
Tsedal Neeley, a professor at Harvard Business School, agrees. “For young people, what you’re going to see is that they’re going to be able to perform better at their jobs. They’re going to be able to contribute more.” It’s not only that a PowerPoint that used to take four hours to build might now be completed in an hour. It’s that the young workers who struggled with basic writing and coding will now have a tool that helps them get to a higher minimum standard.
If entry-level workers get that much faster and better, won’t companies be able to get by with fewer of them? Maybe. Those are among the reasons that studies from Pew and Brookings flag entry-level workers as particularly at risk of losing employment to AI. Even McKinsey, which is more bullish on generative AI, points out that jobs in office support and sales are likely to see declines.
But eventually, new jobs — indeed, new industries — will be invented, says Neeley. In the long term, “technological revolutions like generative AI create more jobs than they disrupt,” even if the long term sometimes takes a while to arrive.
After all, when photocopying and faxing disappeared as entry-level tasks, entry-level jobs didn’t disappear. Arguably, they got more interesting. If I were a new grad in journalism today, I would probably be a social media manager — a job that didn’t exist when I graduated. And I might be better off: Writing social copy and making TikTok videos is undoubtedly more challenging and rewarding than fixing paper jams.
Similarly, the advent of computers put an end to the typing pool; women who had been consigned to such work began to take on more complex jobs.
That’s not to say that there’s no reason to be concerned. Manufacturing provides an obvious example of an industry where automation destroyed good blue-collar jobs. Some experts predict that generative AI could have a similar effect on computer-based jobs for workers without college degrees, like customer service.
It’s the fate of those workers that should be commanding more attention from pundits and policymakers.
Among the college-educated workforce, the advent of generative AI is less likely to erase jobs and more likely to prompt employees to learn new skills. For example, if a bot can churn out fluid-sounding text in minutes or even seconds, perhaps the human’s job shifts from writing to editing — checking the facts to make sure they’re correct, finding ways to improve the logic and persuasiveness of the piece, injecting verve and style. All of this requires critical thinking.
Generative AI still needs human oversight — and maybe always will, despite its ability to rapidly learn new skills. As Walmart executives put it in a LinkedIn post last week when the company announced the rollout of a generative AI app for its office employees, “GenAI can help us work faster and more efficiently, but it also has limitations: It lacks judgment, has a limited understanding of context and is only as good as the data it’s trained on.”
For an example, consider my own early experiment testing ChatGPT. To see whether it could help me chase down a statistic for a column on child care, I asked it how many remote workers had kids at home without day care. It responded with a statistic and cited FlexJobs; when I asked for the URL, it provided one. When that produced only an error page, I contacted FlexJobs, and they said they couldn’t remember ever conducting such a survey. It seems ChatGPT just fabricated it. A hallucinating assistant is far worse than a slow one.
The college graduates of the future will still be able to find jobs, even if the hunt is grueling — and even if we can’t predict exactly what the work will look like. I just hope it’s more interesting than buying someone else’s pantyhose. (Bloomberg Opinion)

Key points

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the slow, labour-intensive, and costly process of counting tiny things within our science. 
We’re using AI to count hairs on cotton leaves and microscopic cells of harmful algae.  
AI can bring greater accuracy, speed and scale to tasks that are onerous for our scientists.    














        Identifying harmful algal cells in microscopic images is one way we're using artificial intelligence to transform the way we do science. 
      

There’s been a lot of talk about how AI will transform the way we work. 
Whether you see AI in the workforce as a friend or foe, there is no doubt this technology will change some jobs as we know them. This includes jobs in the world of science. Our researchers are exploring and responsibly embracing the use of AI in our work.

AI is a particularly useful tool to overcome pesky biological limitations. For example, the human eye can’t distinguish objects smaller than about 0.2mm. Traditionally, we use microscopes to overcome this. But once an object or substance is magnified, a highly-trained expert still needs to look at it to identify and count items of interest. Counting specimens or objects for science can be a slow, labour-intensive, and costly process.

Here are a couple of examples where we’ve leveraged the impressive advances in machine learning over the past decade to make AI count. These projects were advanced by our Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Future Science Platform, which unites collaborators from across the organisation to advance machine learning for scientific discovery.

Counting hairs on cotton leaves











        Dr Vivien Rolland and Moshiur Farazi inspect cotton in a glasshouse in Canberra. 
      

Working with our experts in agriculture, we’ve created a model that can quantify the number of hairs on the back of a cotton leaf.
Leaf hairiness impacts the insect resistance, fibre yield and value of new varieties of cotton.  Traditionally, it’s eyeballed by experts in commercial breeding programs and given a score between one and five. 
First we developed AI models which can generate the same hairiness scores as humans with 95 per cent accuracy.
Dr Moshiur Farazi is one of our experts in computer vision, focusing on enabling computers to identify and understand objects in images and video. He said HairNet2 is now moving beyond automating current methods.

""Training models to reproduce human ratings of hairiness can increase the speed and scale of analysis. However, these models reproduce the variability in the human estimates they've been trained on,"" Moshiur said.   
“In HairNet2 we’ve created a new method of AI-augmented scoring which is more robust, reliable and accurate. 
""This model estimates the area of the leaf that is covered by hairs by locating all hairs on the leaf, something that is not completely impossible for a human to do, but incredibly difficult and time consuming.

“HairNet2 was trained using about 1000 images where humans had annotated every single hair. This laborious annotation process helped build an AI tool that can automate the hairiness scoring beyond human perception,"" he said.  
The new models are being deployed on a web interface for breeders to test during the next cotton season. You can try an early demo yourself. 











        HairNet2 uses artificial intelligence to detect individual hairs on cotton leaves 
      

Counting microscopic algae cells
Harmful algal blooms are large populations of algae that can be toxic for both humans and animals.
To identify harmful algal blooms, experts undertake extensive testing using a microscope and a counting chamber (a slide with precise gridlines allowing scientists to estimate the number of harmful algal cells in a liquid sample).  
Dr Chris Jackett is an expert in object detection. He began working to augment this manual process with AI as a postdoctoral research fellow with our National Research Collections Australia.  
""It’s an enormously time-consuming and labour-intensive exercise, and humans are limited in the number of samples they can process,"" Chris said.  
""Extended sessions at the microscope can also lead to health issues like vision problems, bad posture, physical strain, and headaches.""  
In response to this challenge, we are training machine learning models to automatically detect harmful algae in images.  











        Harmful algal cells detected by machine learning 
      

Our team is systematically photographing and annotating algae strain samples from the Australian National Algae Culture Collection. We are also beginning to use a range of AI tools to help speed up the annotation process. 
With this combined human/computer effort, we have built up an annotated dataset for 15 different strains of algae to-date, which are now being used to train the AI models. Early testing suggests these models can successfully detect the target strains with a high level of accuracy.  
Using AI to provide faster and more accurate detection of toxic algae could have significant economic, environmental and social impacts.  
“Improving the speed and accuracy of harmful algae detection could provide an early warning signal for water managers indicating when and where blooms might occur,” Chris said.
AI-enhanced risk management and decision-making could help safeguard the health of the environment as well as coastal communities, consumers and Australian fisheries and aquaculture businesses. 
How you can make AI count for your business
Many organisations are currently grappling with the potential of AI to transform their processes and business.
If your core business involves counting or identifying objects, AI may be a friend.  
Moshiur said the barrier to entry for those looking to implement AI for object detection is low.  
“Five or 10 years back you needed to train the model on your own and needed a lot more data and compute power to experiment with AI,"" Moshiur said.  
“If you have a very small amount of data, you can fine-tune open-source models to work on your problem with as little as a couple of hundred images.”
However, he said the successful application of AI depends on asking the right questions.  
“At the end of the day, most users want a black box where they can click buttons and get the desired answer. But we need to unpack what they want the buttons to do and get the data ready in a way that enables those buttons to arrive at the right answer,"" Moshiur said.  
“Taking time to sit down and explore the questions you want answered, and consider the problems you haven’t been able to solve with human-driven methods or processes, is the best place to start.""

We also explore the different methods of training LLMs and conclude the article with a hands-on project where we use Flan-T5 for sentiment analysis using Python.Let’s get started!LLMs and generative AI: are they the same thing?Generative AI is a subset of machine learning that focuses on models who’s primary function is to generate something: text, images, video, code, etc.Generative models train on enormous amounts of data created by humans to learn patterns and structure which allow them to create new data.",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://towardsdatascience.com/catch-up-on-large-language-models-8daf784f46f8,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:1200/0*0sgM1HGAs_IcVD2U'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Marco Peixeiro', 'url': 'https://towardsdatascience.com/@marcopeixeiro'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Towards Data Science', 'url': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 192, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:384/1*cFFKn8rFH4ZndmaYeAs6iQ.png'}}",Catch Up On Large Language Models - Towards Data Science,2023-09-05T10:02:41.832Z,2023-09-09T18:16:26.089Z,,Catch Up On Large Language Models - Towards Data Science,False,,,https://towardsdatascience.com/catch-up-on-large-language-models-8daf784f46f8,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.meteredContent'}",['Marco Peixeiro'],,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-09-05T10:02:41.832Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8daf784f46f8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While artificial intelligence can't replace the human brain, tools like Midjourney are supercharging the home design process.

These days, there's no shortage of news about artificial intelligence. Some industries are dominated by praise and excitement for how AI can make life easier, while other professional sectors lament the loss of jobs and human touch. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle, and the world of home design is no exception.
So, what does AI have to do with home design? And how might it shape the future of interiors? Experts offer insights on how AI is streamlining their workflows and expanding their creative potential.
Generative AI 101
Generative AI is the term for any artificial intelligence that can come up with new text or images in response to human prompts. You've likely heard of ChatGPT, a text-based generative AI. Type in a prompt such as, ""Write an email that explains biophilic design,"" and ChatGPT will spit out a message complete with a subject line, greeting, description of the design style and a signoff.
There are many uses for ChatGPT, but designers are more interested in images than text. Imagine coming up with a cool theme for a bedroom or a fun concept for a new type of sofa. If you can describe it in words, a generative AI tool like Midjourney or DALL-E can create an image. For interior designers, that's like having a talented robo-artist available at all times.
""With AI apps like Midjourney, you can just type in what you're thinking, and the machine does all the work for you,"" says Annilee B. Waterman, a Dallas-based artist(link is external), interior designer and certified professional building designer. ""It pulls in all the information that could have taken you hours to hunt down on the internet and quickly creates custom, unique images that you own and can use anywhere.""
The True Story of an AI-Designed Sink
""I was recently given the opportunity to collaborate with Midjourney's artificial intelligence bot to design the world's first AI sink, named AILA,"" explains Leslie Carothers of Savour Partnership(link is external), a digital marketing consultancy at the forefront of educating home and design professionals on how to use Midjourney AI.
Earlier this summer, luxury kitchen and bath product brand Thompson(link is external) emailed Carothers with an idea: If she could design a sink with AI, Thompson would create it in the real world. Thrilled with the idea, she got to work. Designing the sink and getting the green light for production by Thompson's copper artisans took less than two weeks. Now in production, the copper sink will eventually be unveiled in February 2024 at the National Kitchen and Bath Show in Las Vegas.
""I predict these types of collaborations will become the new normal once manufacturers see and understand how fast Midjourney makes the product ideation process,"" says Carothers. ""I also predict that any manufacturer who offers custom capabilities like Thompson does will have many more designers and retailers wanting to use Midjourney to create and then offer bespoke products to their clients and customers on their own websites.""
Looking to the Future
For many real estate professionals, AI still looks like a wild frontier—a creative sandbox more than a reliable trade tool. But AI is quickly going mainstream. Specifics are hard to predict, but it's almost inevitable that AI-assisted designs will become more prevalent in interiors and architecture in the next decade.
""I predict AI will be used by almost everyone as part of their home design conceptualization process,"" says Carothers.
Still, Waterman emphasizes that AI is a tool—it’s designed to be used by professionals, not replace them. She says AI is great for quickly showcasing ideas, but it can’t design in a vacuum. And while AI can generate a blueprint, Carothers reminds that it cannot build the product or room or home or cover practicalities like material durability or HVAC.
""AI cannot deliver on the most important factor for most consumers who want a well-designed home: the human connection to make sure that all the issues that come up in the execution process are resolved in as stress-free a manner as possible,"" says Carothers.
AI Tools for Real Estate Professionals
Artificial intelligence isn't going away anytime soon. Here are some tools that might help streamline your work as a real estate professional:

Epique AI. Designed specifically for real estate businesses, Epique AI(link is external) can help you quickly generate new realtor biographies for your website, real estate newsletter copy, inspirational quotes for your Instagram page, and more.
Virtual Staging AI. Attractive staging for listings is easier than ever with Virtual Staging AI(link is external), which automatically adds furniture and decor to your uploaded photos of empty rooms.
RealityNinja AI Listing Description Generator. Accelerate the process of writing listing descriptions with RealityNinja's AI(link is external), which creates multiple description options after you input a property's basic information (such as square footage, location, and key features).

In an age where technology advances at an unprecedented pace, the proliferation of AI has raised concerns about its potential to disrupt various industries, and prompted individuals to reconsider the future of their careers.
The focus has shifted from whether AI will replace human jobs, to understanding how and when this transformation will occur.
This debate draws parallels with historical industrial revolutions, but while 18th-century automation transformed farming and textiles, the rise of AI has the potential to reshape multiple industries.
An 11-year research project undertaken by PwC found a significant portion of jobs would be affected by automation by 2030.
In its report, Workforce of the Future: Shaping 2030, PwC claims the overall percentage of affected jobs would be 38 percent for the US, 35 percent for Germany, 30 percent for the UK and 21 percent for Japan.
However, the report does not only foretell gloom. It outlines a roadmap that empowers  individuals to reposition themselves in the 2030 employment landscape, and offers guidance to future-proof their careers.
Central to this roadmap are the “four worlds of work”.
The Red World: A realm characterised by rapid innovation and consumer-driven demand. Adaptability and updated skills are essential.
The Blue World: Corporations dominate, while social responsibility takes a back seat. Corporate careers thrive, and professional enhancements become common.
The Green World: Corporations uphold environmental and social accountability, with automation aligned to a greener agenda.
The Yellow World: Small, ethical businesses flourish, valuing artisanal products. Automation complements human efforts, and collective action protects jobs.
The likelihood of any one world emerging is uncertain, but in all four, adaptation and continuous learning emerge as strategies for employment.
Beyond embracing technology, cultivating new skills such as leadership, creativity, innovation, imagination and problem-solving becomes vital. These attributes are poised to be in high demand, transforming how we define ourselves by our skills rather than our job titles.
We can also recognise that AI’s impact on jobs is not purely destructive. It has the potential to refine, enhance and transform job roles, augmenting human capabilities and reshaping the very nature of work.
For those embarking on their career journeys, two potential avenues emerge: sticking to a discipline that’s highly specialised and therefore likely to be in high demand, or remaining in a current career while cultivating adaptability and creativity.
For both avenues, education and upskilling will be key to success, with institutions like Curtin University already preparing individuals for the shifting tides of change through their MBA programs.
Curtin’s MBA delves into executive financial decision-making, global business sustainability, and organisational strategy, equipping individuals with the skills and flexibility to pivot careers, transition from technical roles to leadership positions, or explore entirely new sectors.
Individuals on these courses are preparing to graduate in a new era, where the future of work embraces new technologies, and teaming up with AI will be just a regular part of the journey.
Anyone interested in upskilling for the future can visit curtin.edu.au/mba to find out more.

“It will take both people and technology to deliver on our purpose to help people save money and live better,” wrote Donna Morris, executive vice president, chief people officer, in a LinkedIn post. “GenAI can help us work faster and more efficiently, but it also has limitations: it lacks judgment, has a limited understanding of context and is only as good as the data it’s trained on. For out-of-the-box, truly brand-new thinking – that’s what humans are good at. Our humanity is what sets us apart and always will be.”
Morris also shared that Walmart has been using AI and generative AI precursors for several years, and has already developed guidelines to aid associates in the responsible usage of the new technology. 
“We see a lot of opportunity across the enterprise to remove friction, provide a personalized interface and deliver the tools our associates need right in the palm of their hands, and My Assistant is just one way we’re streamlining the associate experience with technology,” Morris wrote.

The remaining 46% of employees felt that organizations must focus their attention on building AI technologies by formulating an AI strategy and implementing the requisite tech architecture within the organization. This synergy between employers and employees in embracing AI is evident by the fact that 86% of the respondents felt AI capabilities of an organization can be enhanced by leveraging in-house talent, integrating AI into existing operations, and providing learning opportunities in collaboration with external experts. Only 14% of the respondents felt there was a need to hire external talent to expand their AI capabilities.Envisaging the future with AI Artificial Intelligence as a critical and emerging technology is an imminent and necessary part of our technological journey which will serve us well provided we can prepare ourselves to receive and leverage its full potential. This technology, like all technologies, comes with its own set of challenges and an inherent learning curve which we will soon master due to the collaboration and synergy among all the industry's stakeholders. There is a lot of enthusiasm for this new technology among nations, governments, industry leaders, and employees which will result in a concerted effort towards reaping the maximum benefit from this new-age technology.The author is Chief Executive Officer of TeamLease Digital","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Economic Times', 'productID': 'prime.economictimes.indiatimes.com:prime'}","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative AI — also known colloquially by product names like ChatGPT or Microsoft…,,,"FintechDoing it right with AI: Ally’s foray into generative AISathish MuthukrishnanSep 5, 20235 min readYou can’t turn on the news without hearing about it. You can’t open your internet browser without seeing its impact.Generative AI — also known colloquially by product names like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot — has been on the minds of almost every leader in many verticals. I’ve heard CIOs and CTOs say, “we’re testing ChatGPT” or “we’re exploring how to approach generative AI.”Generative AI continues to capture interest at the highest levels of leadership, with 96% of executives saying that it is a key topic in boardroom discussions, according to an article from Business Chief. And, in a recent survey by CNBC, 47% of technology leaders said artificial intelligence is their top budget item over the next year.Don’t be fooled. While there may be interest, and there may be (big) spend, adoption of the technology — actual deployment of it — is still in the very early stages. That’s especially true in financial services where actions don’t necessarily match the talk.At Ally, we’re taking a deliberate, but proactive approach to capabilities around generative AI. In July, we formally launched Ally.ai — a proprietary, cloud-based platform that brings the speed and large language model (LLM) functionality of commercial AI tools together with the human touch and data security protections that are required for a financial services company. We’ve deployed other AI tools including natural language processing, machine learning, predictive analytics and computer vision. Now, we have a secure platform, built by the talented Ally Tech team, that can house all of this, and integrate any commercially available LLM.The consensus is that generative AI has staying power. As a trusted, forward-thinking digital bank, we’re known for being on the front foot of tech exploration. But that doesn’t mean we cut corners. We want to do it right with AI, which means embedding AI seamlessly into our business and the way we work — in a responsible, collaborative and scalable manner. Our team has started with two pilot programs, one for SEO marketing and one for Customer Care and Experience, that will help us dive deep and understand how generative AI fits within our current technology landscape, security frameworks and how it might positively impact business processes.Security and customer data privacy is in the forefront of everything we do as a digital-first organization. The entire Ally.ai platform is built on our dedicated cloud infrastructure with its own private network. Ally’s data stays private, meaning we have created a fully secured Ally environment with no external access. Steps have been taken so that Ally data is not used by others to train these foundation models. We’ve also created an AI playbook that details our use of generative AI — and creates a common platform and understanding for the entire enterprise to operate on.In addition, we have an enterprise-wide cross functional AI Working Group at Ally who work with our AI experts to review and advise on generative AI use cases. Humans are actively trained and involved in the evaluation and use of generative AI technology. Any time we launch a pilot program or explore the use of generative AI, training and oversight mechanisms will be fully defined ahead of time. While having humans trained and involved in all aspects of generative AI work is a risk mitigation standard, there’s also another benefit. The more human feedback that Ally can accumulate, and the more we can optimize our AI models, the better AI offerings we can develop that will ultimately benefit our customers and employees.This evolution and active usage of generative AI also maps closely with our long-term technology strategy where the experience of our customers — not our individual products — takes center stage. Generative AI has the potential to serve our customers even better by helping us understand their financial journeys more holistically, enabling a more personalized banking experience. And that’s really the point. How can generative AI make our customers’ financial experience stronger? How can it make the work that our employees do more efficient or easier?For several weeks in June and July, more than 700 customer service associates who work with deposit customers have participated in a call summarization pilot program where the Ally.ai platform and LLM facilitates real-time summaries of customer interactions held over the phone. Feedback from our associates has been very positive around accuracy and convenience. We’re seeing that for about 82% of summaries coming back from Ally.ai, Ally associates report that they don’t require any human modification. They also report that the tool is a welcome backstop so they can focus most of their energy on meaningful customer interactions. They’ve seen increases in productivity and a lighter lift when it comes to multi-tasking — taking notes, toggling between screens, concentrating on live conversation — while taking customer calls. It’s our hope that we can shave minutes off the time it takes for an associate to document and close an interaction with a customer, which makes a better experience for all involved.While I’ve given you just one example of the work actively happening at Ally with generative AI, the opportunities are vast. Our Auto team is looking at how the technology may be able to give real-time vehicle inventory updates via the Smart Auction platform. The Security team is exploring how AI could help our teams fighting fraud and money laundering. This is a quickly evolving technology, and if you’re standing still or just figuring out where to start, you might already be behind.More than three years ago, Ally started building an infrastructure — centralized data and analytics, advanced public/private cloud, hardened security tools and processes — that could support emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, and much more. We developed in-house capabilities — a deep bench of engineers that have the expertise to build a platform like Ally.ai, combined with our best-in-class security standards — to maintain and lock down the technology. I’m proud to say that the Ally team saw around corners to what AI could do for our business, and then strategically took action to meet the moment.Generative AI has the potential to be a game-changer in financial services, especially at a pace that requires organizations to be nimble while maintaining high standards. While we continue to be prudent and cautious, we’re not standing still. Actions will speak louder than words when it comes to AI adoption and usage in banking. We’re going to continue to make moves and do it right with AI.Interested in joining Ally's team of talented technologists to make a difference for our customers and communities?

Does Generative AI Generate Jobs?

By Jacques Bughin
The evolution of AI and its quick adoption by organisations has predisposed many workers to the fear of losing their jobs to the technology. This fear might be largely unfounded.
Are you afraid of losing your job to generative AI? The debate rages since digital citizens are rushing to use generative AI software like MidJourney or ChatGPT. Yuval Noah Harari,1 famous historian and author of popular books Sapiens and Homo Deus, recently voiced his concern that while generative AI is a game changer, the technology can develop its own content and ideas, build its own social culture, and replace an entire part of our abstract production. The media has jumped on it and CNBC recently ran a catchy headline claiming that “Thirty-seven percent of workers between the ages of 18 and 24 are worried about new technology eliminating their jobs”.2 The BBC also had its own contribution with the headline “AI anxiety: The workers who fear losing their jobs to artificial intelligence”.3

Anxiety might be present, but the disturbing truth is that media is building the anxiety, rather than developing a sound perspective on the relationship between jobs and AI.
Looking backward
Looking back on how major tech innovations played out, fear around how technology can deconstruct work/knowledge has always been present. In the Middle Ages, as reported by Le Point,4 a Benedictine monk, Johannes Trithemius, defended the work of copying texts by his peers, because the slowness of the work was synonymous with a process of contemplation and profound discovery of the contents. He opined that the printing of books was not only toxic but would trivialise and weaken learning and culture. Even much later, renowned economists, from John Stuart Mill to David Ricardo, were suspicious of the idea that technology may build jobs. John Maynard Keynes5 further coined, in 1931, the term “technological unemployment” in his essay named Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, in which he predicted that due to technology diffusion, the “most pressing problem in the developed economies would be how to fill our leisure time.”

Well, we still have jobs today despite Keynes´s prediction—and the academic literature has proven with a large set of studies6 that new jobs could be created in the wake of multiple technological developments.
Looking forward

The key question is whether this time can be different.7 Technologies are becoming, no doubt, more powerful, and their economic scope getting larger by the day. But three important facts are usually not taken into account by techno-pessimists.
1. Technology is as much about augmentation than a substitute to jobs.
Let´s provide a few examples regarding generative AI. Consider first how Reuters and Associated Press have experimented with AI-generated news articles for tasks like financial reporting and sports recaps. Artists and designers also can leverage generative AI tools to enhance their creative process. For instance, Adobe’s Project Scribbler uses AI to transform rough sketches into polished artwork, providing inspiration and saving time. A few years back, musician and composer Holly Herndon8 released a music album, relying on an AI system trained on Herndon’s own voice and musical style. For the musician, AI complemented her exploration of new musical possibilities and pushed the boundaries of traditional composition for her own benefits instead of separating the tasks between production and performance.
The rise of social media platforms has led to the need for professionals who can manage and enhance a company’s online presence, engage with customers, and create targeted social media strategies. 
Another example where generative AI has built new inroads is coding. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool developed to generate code suggestions and snippets based on the context and programming language being used. While this has replaced some tasks of coders, programmers are using their freed up time to do more added-value tasks; productivity follows and more jobs, no less, are being driven to complex software tasks. Finally, AI works on data, and the critical issue for many companies is not about data processing but data generation. What generative AI is good at is building synthetic data.9 Those synthetic data modelled on real data may help provide enough data for more powerful analysis, justifying the jobs of data analysts — (while providing a layer of privacy as real user data is not being utilised to power models).
2. Technology is less often used for efficiency than for higher quality and stronger innovation — and great innovation expands output and employment.
Quality is often the result of technology, and in the long term, builds wealth. Grammarly’s users, a popular AI writing assistant tool have reported a 76% increase in writing accuracy. Google Translate has improved translation quality by 60%, making it more accessible for users globally. Among marketers using generative AI, half of them report that the most important benefit is a faster creative output cycle and better creative design.

Innovation is another by-product of AI. A case in point is BioNTech, a biotechnology company that used Generative AI and machine learning techniques during the drug discovery process and developed a COVID-19 vaccine in no time. With these innovations, BioNTech expanded its workforce not by 20%, not even by 100%. In fact, its employment went 4-fold in just three years. Adobe a leading software company has integrated generative AI capabilities into its software products, such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro, expanding customer support and training teams to assist users in leveraging these new capabilities effectively. Employment grew especially in areas of trainers and documentation specialists who focus on supporting and educating customers on using generative AI features.
3. Technology and employment are not only to be checked at the firm level but at the entire ecosystem.
The type of catchy media titles we see today about AI and jobs tend to be more about AI and one’s current job. But those articles miss the full macroeconomic effect. A new range of jobs will be created by virtue of technologies and other jobs will be created in the entire ecosystems, not the least as part of the gain in productivity out of technology being reinvested in the economy.

Regarding new jobs, let’s first look at digital. The rise of social media platforms has led to the need for professionals who can manage and enhance a company’s online presence, engage with customers, and create targeted social media strategies. The proliferation of mobile applications has created a demand for skilled app developers who can design, develop, and maintain mobile applications for various platforms. As generative AI becomes more prevalent, AI ethicists will explode as being responsible for examining the ethical implications and societal impact of AI systems.
We still have jobs today despite Keynes´s prediction—and the academic literature has proven with a large set of studies6 that new jobs were created in the wake of multiple technological developments in the recent past. 

One other much bigger impact is the fact that technology use often overspills to the entire ecosystem or the economy. In their academic research, Arntz and her colleagues studied the venue of robotics in the German automotive industry. While it killed a few jobs at the start through automation, it made the industry able to compete with the Japanese car exporters, resulting in saving and expanding the automotive industry. The effect was a positive net employment growth out of rapid robotisation. One notable corporate example of such an overspill in ecosystems is how NVIDIA’s GANs have significantly improved the visual quality and realism of computer-generated graphics in video games, creating job opportunities for artists, designers, developers, and animators specialising in creating immersive content. NVIDIA’s GANs have been used to enhance medical imaging and generate synthetic medical data for training and research purposes. The integration of generative AI in healthcare is already increasing the demand for medical imaging specialists, researchers, and professionals with expertise in AI-assisted diagnostics and medical data analysis.


One should think twice as to whether technology kills jobs- it may kill some, but technology has shown ways to build new ones or push new labour demand as a result of major productivity gains reinvested in the economy. Technology brings about creative destruction that is possibly inevitable, but by itself, it does not necessarily paint a picture of a workless future. Maybe, it is time to use generative AI for the good and stop worrying about it.

The LLM is underpinned by a scientific development known as the transformer model, made by Google researchers in 2017.“While we’ve always understood the breakthrough nature of our transformer work, several years later, we’re energised by its enduring potential across new fields, from healthcare to robotics and security, enhancing human creativity, and more,” says Slav Petrov, a senior researcher at Google, who works on building AI models, including LLMs.LLMs’ touted benefits — the ability to increase productivity by writing and analysing text — are also why it poses a threat to humans. According to Goldman Sachs, it could expose the equivalent of 300mn full-time workers across big economies to automation, leading to widespread unemployment.As the technology is rapidly woven into our lives, understanding how LLMs generate text means understanding why these models are such versatile cognitive engines — and what else they can help create.To write text, LLMs must first translate words into a language they understand.First a block of words is broken into tokens — basic units that can be encoded. Tokens often represent fractions of words, but we’ll turn each full word into a token.In order to grasp a word’s meaning, work in our example, LLMs first observe it in context using enormous sets of training data, taking note of nearby words. These datasets are based on collating text published on the internet, with new LLMs trained using billions of words.Eventually, we end up with a huge set of the words found alongside work in the training data, as well as those that weren’t found near it.As the model processes this set of words, it produces a vector — or list of values — and adjusts it based on each word’s proximity to work in the training data. This vector is known as a word embedding.A word embedding can have hundreds of values, each representing a different aspect of a word’s meaning. Just as you might describe a house by its characteristics — type, location, bedrooms, bathrooms, storeys — the values in an embedding quantify a word’s linguistic features.The way these characteristics are derived means we don’t know exactly what each value represents, but words we expect to be used in comparable ways often have similar-looking embeddings.A pair of words like sea and ocean, for example, may not be used in identical contexts (‘all at ocean’ isn't a direct substitute for ‘all at sea’), but their meanings are close to each other, and embeddings allow us to quantify that closeness.By reducing the hundreds of values each embedding represents to just two, we can see the distances between these words more clearly.We might spot clusters of pronouns, or modes of transportation, and being able to quantify words in this way is the first step in a model generating text.seaoceanfootballsoccerIwewegogototoworkworkbybytraintraintheofficetheyswimrunwalkwithoninbuildingshopcarbuscollegeschoolworkpolkapolkaworklikelikeworkyesterdayyesterdayworkwentwentworkherherworkaaworknoisynoisyworkdovedoveworkononworkmorningmorningworkininworkatmosphereatmosphereworkquantumquantumworkzebrazebraworkenvironmentenvironmentworkintointoBut this alone is not what makes LLMs so clever. What unlocked their abilities to parse and write as fluently as they do today is a tool called the transformer, which radically sped up and augmented how computers understood language.Transformers process an entire sequence at once — be that a sentence, paragraph or an entire article — analysing all its parts and not just individual words.This allows the software to capture context and patterns better, and to translate — or generate — text more accurately. This simultaneous processing also makes LLMs much faster to train, in turn improving their efficiency and ability to scale.Research outlining the transformer model was first published by a group of eight AI researchers at Google in June 2017. Their 11-page research paper marked the start of the generative AI era.A key concept of the transformer architecture is self-attention. This is what allows LLMs to understand relationships between words.Self-attention looks at each token in a body of text and decides which others are most important to understanding its meaning.Before transformers, the state of the art AI translation methods were recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which scanned each word in a sentence and processed it sequentially.With self-attention, the transformer computes all the words in a sentence at the same time. Capturing this context gives LLMs far more sophisticated capabilities to parse language.In this example, assessing the whole sentence at once means the transformer is able to understand that interest is being used as a noun to explain an individual’s take on politics.If we tweak the sentence . . .. . . the model understands interest is now being used in a financial sense.And when we combine the sentences, the model is still able to recognise the correct meaning of each word thanks to the attention it gives the accompanying text.For the first use of interest, it is no and in that are most attended.For the second, it is rate and bank.This functionality is crucial for advanced text generation. Without it, words that can be interchangeable in some contexts but not others can be used incorrectly.Effectively, self-attention means that if a summary of this sentence was produced, you wouldn’t have enthusiasm used when you were writing about interest rates.This capability goes beyond words, like interest, that have multiple meanings.In the following sentence, self-attention is able to calculate that it is most likely to be referring to dog.And if we alter the sentence, swapping hungry for delicious, the model is able to recalculate, with it now most likely to refer to bone.The benefits of self-attention for language processing increase the more you scale things up. It allows LLMs to take context from beyond sentence boundaries, giving the model a greater understanding of how and when a word is used.IIhavehavenonointerestinterestininpoliticspoliticsOne of the world’s largest and most advanced LLMs is GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest artificial intelligence model which the company says exhibits “human-level performance” on several academic and professional benchmarks such as the US bar exam, advanced placement tests and the SAT school exams.GPT-4 can generate and ingest large volumes of text: users can feed in up to 25,000 English words, which means it could handle detailed financial documentation, literary works or technical manuals.The product has reshaped the tech industry, with the world’s biggest technology companies — including Google, Meta and Microsoft, who have backed OpenAI — racing to dominate the space, alongside smaller start-ups.The LLMs they have released include Google’s PaLM model, which powers its chatbot Bard, Anthropic’s Claude model, Meta’s LLaMA and Cohere’s Command, among others.While these models are already being adopted by an array of businesses, some of the companies behind them are facing legal battles around their use of copyrighted text, images and audio scraped from the web.The reason for this is that current LLMs are trained on most of the English-language internet — a volume of information that makes them far more powerful than previous generations. From this enormous corpus of words and images, the models learn how to recognise patterns and eventually predict the next best word. After tokenising and encoding a prompt, we’re left with a block of data representing our input as the machine understands it, including meanings, positions and relationships between words.At its simplest, the model’s aim is now to predict the next word in a sequence and do this repeatedly until the output is complete.To do this, the model gives a probability score to each token, which represents the likelihood of it being the next word in the sequence.And it continues to do this until it is happy with the text it has produced.But this method of predicting the following word in isolation — known as “greedy search” — can introduce problems. Sometimes, while each individual token might be the next best fit, the full phrase can be less relevant.Not necessarily always wrong, but perhaps not what you’d expect either.Transformers use a number of approaches to address this problem and enhance the quality of their output. One example is called beam search.Rather than focusing only on the next word in a sequence, it looks at the probability of a larger set of tokens as a whole.With beam search, the model is able to consider multiple routes and find the best option.This produces better results, ultimately leading to more coherent, human-like text.Probability-+TheFinancialTimesis...abouteconomicsandpodcastsmorethanjustaprintproductanewspaperfoundedin1888basedinBritainBut things don’t always go to plan. While the text may seem plausible and coherent, it isn’t always factually correct. LLMs are not search engines looking up facts; they are pattern-spotting engines that guess the next best option in a sequence.Because of this inherent predictive nature, LLMs can also fabricate information in a process that researchers call “hallucination”. They can generate made-up numbers, names, dates, quotes — even web links or entire articles.Users of LLMs have shared examples of links to non-existent news articles on the FT and Bloomberg, made-up references to research papers, the wrong authors for published books and biographies riddled with factual mistakes.In one high-profile incident in New York, a lawyer used ChatGPT to create a brief for a case. When the defence interrogated the report, they discovered it was littered with made-up judicial opinions and legal citations. “I did not comprehend that ChatGPT could fabricate cases,” the lawyer later told a judge during his own court hearing.Although researchers say hallucinations will never be completely erased, Google, OpenAI and others are working on limiting them through a process known as “grounding”. This involves cross-checking an LLM’s outputs against web search results and providing citations to users so they can verify.Humans are also used to provide feedback and fill gaps in information — a process known as reinforcement learning by human feedback (RLHF) — which further improves the quality of the output. But it is still a big research challenge to understand which queries might trigger these hallucinations, as well as how they can be predicted and reduced.Despite these limitations, the transformer has resulted in a host of cutting-edge AI applications. Apart from powering chatbots such as Bard and ChatGPT, it drives autocomplete on our mobile keyboards and speech recognition in our smart speakers.Its real power, however, lies beyond language. Its inventors discovered that transformer models could recognise and predict any repeating motifs or patterns. From pixels in an image, using tools such as Dall-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, to computer code using generators like GitHub CoPilot. It could even predict notes in music and DNA in proteins to help design drug molecules.For decades, researchers built specialised models to summarise, translate, search and retrieve. The transformer unified all those actions into a single structure capable of performing a huge variety of tasks.“Take this simple model that predicts the next word and it . . . can do anything,” says Aidan Gomez, chief executive of AI start-up Cohere, and a co-author of the transformer paper.Now they have one type of model that is “trained on the entire internet and what falls out the other side does all of that and better than anything that came before”, he says.“That is the magical part of the story.”This story is free to read so you can share it with family and friends who don’t yet have an FT subscription.Madhumita Murgia is the FT’s artificial intelligence editor.Visual storytelling team: Dan Clark, Sam Learner, Irene de la Torre Arenas, Sam Joiner, Eade Hemingway and Oliver Hawkins.With thanks to Slav Petrov, Jakob Uszkoreit, Aidan Gomez and Ashish Vaswani.To generate the 50D word embeddings we used the GloVe 6B 50D pre-trained model and converted to Word2Vec format.

IntroductionTechnological innovation has revolutionized work across the first through fourth industrial revolutions. The fourth industrial revolution introduced disruptive technologies like big data and artificial intelligence (Zhang and Chen, 2023). The advancement of data processing and big data analytics, along with developments in artificial intelligence, has improved information processing capabilities, including problem-solving and decision-making (Raveendra et al., 2020). With the increasing normalization and timely usage of digital technologies, there is a potential for future higher-level implementation of AI systems (Beneduce, 2020).AI can provide faster and more extensive data analysis than humans, achieving remarkable accuracy and establishing itself as a reliable tool (Chen, 2022). It can collect and evaluate large amounts of data that may exceed human analytical capacities, enabling AI to provide decision recommendations (Shaw, 2019).Modern technologies, including artificial intelligence solutions, have revolutionized work and contributed to developing human resources management (HRM) for improved outcomes (Hmoud and Laszlo, 2019). One significant area where their impact is felt is in the recruitment process, where AI implementation can potentially provide a competitive advantage by enabling a better understanding of talent compared to competitors, thereby enhancing the company’s competitiveness (Johansson and Herranen, 2019).AI receives commands and data input through algorithms. While AI developers believe their algorithmic procedures simplify hiring and mitigate bias, Miasato and Silva (2019) argue that algorithms cannot eliminate discrimination alone. The decisions made by AI are shaped by the initial data it receives. If the underlying data is unfair, the resulting algorithms can perpetuate bias, incompleteness, or discrimination, creating potential for widespread inequality (Bornstein, 2018). Many professionals assert that AI and algorithms reinforce socioeconomic divisions and expose disparities. To quote Immanuel Kant, “In the bentwood of these data sets, none of them is straight” (Raub, 2018). This undermines the principle of social justice, causing moral and economic harm to those affected by discrimination and reducing overall economic efficiency, leading to decreased production of goods and services.AI recruitment tools have a concerning aspect that cannot be overlooked, highlighting the need to address these challenges through technical or managerial means (Raub, 2018). Increasing evidence suggests that AI is more impartial than commonly believed; however, algorithms and AI can result in unfair employment opportunities and the potential for discrimination without accountability. To harness the benefits of AI in recruiting, organizations should exercise careful selection of their programs, promote the adoption of accountable algorithms, and advocate for improvements in racial and gender diversity within high-tech companies.The general construct of this study is, first, an extension of statistical discrimination theory in the context of the algorithmic economy; second, a synthesis of the current literature on the benefits of algorithmic hiring, the roots and classification of algorithmic discrimination; and third, initiatives to eliminate the existence of algorithmic hiring discrimination; fourth, based on the Grounded Theory, we conduct surveys with respondents and analyze primary data to support the study.The contributions of this study are as follows:First, discuss job market discrimination theories in the digital age context. When considering statistical discrimination theories, we should consider the current circumstances. It is necessary to apply these discrimination theories to evaluate the issues that arise from the use of technology in the digital age, particularly with the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchain across various industries.Secondly, a literature review approach was employed to examine the factors contributing to discrimination in algorithmic hiring. Our goal with this analysis is to help managers and researchers better understand the limitations of AI algorithms in the hiring process. We conducted a thorough review of 49 papers published between 2007 and 2023 and found that there is currently a fragmented understanding of discrimination in algorithmic hiring. Building on this literature review, our study aims to offer a comprehensive and systematic examination of the sources, categorization, and possible solutions for discriminatory practices in algorithmic recruitment.Thirdly, we take a comprehensive approach that considers technical and managerial aspects to tackle discrimination in algorithmic hiring. This study contends that resolving algorithmic discrimination in recruitment requires technical solutions and the implementation of internal ethical governance and external regulations.The subsequent study is structured into five parts. The first section provides the theoretical background for this research. The following section outlines the research methodology employed in the literature review and identifies four key themes. The third section delves into a detailed discussion of these four themes: applications and benefits of AI-based recruitment, factors contributing to algorithmic recruitment discrimination, types of discrimination in algorithmic recruitment, and measures to mitigate algorithmic hiring discrimination. The fourth section involves conducting a survey among respondents and analyzing the primary data collected to support our study. The final section concludes by suggesting future directions for research.Theory backgroundDiscrimination theoryDiscrimination in the labor market is defined by the ILO’s Convention 111, which encompasses any unfavorable treatment based on race, ethnicity, color, and gender that undermines employment equality (Ruwanpura, 2008). Economist Samuelson (1952) offers a similar definition, indicating that discrimination involves differential treatment based on personal characteristics, such as ethnic origin, gender, skin color, and age.Various perspectives on the causes and manifestations of discrimination can be broadly categorized into four theoretical groups. The first is the competitive market theory, which explains discriminatory practices within an equilibrium of perfect competition (Lundberg and Startz, 1983). This view attributes discrimination primarily to personal prejudice. The second is the monopoly model of discrimination, which posits that monopolistic power leads to discriminatory behavior (Cain, 1986). The third is the statistical theory of discrimination, which suggests that nonobjective variables, such as inadequate information, contribute to biased outcomes (Dickinson and Oaxaca, 2009). Lastly, we have the antecedent market discrimination hypothesis as the fourth category.Statistical discrimination theoryStatistical discrimination refers to prejudice from assessment criteria that generalize group characteristics to individuals (Tilcsik, 2021). It arises due to limitations in employers’ research techniques or the cost constraint of obtaining information in the asymmetry between employers and job seekers. Even without monopolistic power, statistical discrimination can occur in the labor market due to information-gathering methods. Employers are primarily interested in assessing candidates’ competitiveness when making recruitment decisions. However, obtaining this information directly is challenging, so employers rely on various indirect techniques.Discrimination carries both individual and societal economic costs. The social cost arises from the decrease in overall economic output caused by discrimination. However, this is still deemed efficient under imperfect information and aligns with the employer’s profit maximization goal. Therefore, it is likely that statistical discrimination in employment will persist.Extension of statistical discrimination theory in the digital ageThe digital economy has witnessed the application of various artificial intelligence technologies in the job market. Consequently, the issue of algorithmic hiring discrimination has emerged, shifting the focus of statistical discrimination theory from traditional hiring to intelligent hiring. The mechanisms that give rise to hiring discrimination problems remain similar, as both rely on historical data of specific populations to predict future hiring outcomes.While AI recruiting offers numerous benefits, it is also susceptible to algorithmic bias. Algorithmic bias refers to the systematic and replicable errors in computer systems that lead to unequally and discrimination based on legally protected characteristics, such as race and gender (Jackson, 2021). When assessments consistently overestimate or underestimate a particular group’s scores, they produce “predictive bias” (Raghavan et al., 2020). Unfortunately, these discriminatory results are often overlooked or disregarded due to the misconception that AI processes are inherently “objective” and “neutral.”Despite algorithms aiming for objectivity and clarity in their procedures, they can become biased when they receive partial input data from humans. Modern algorithms may appear neutral but can disproportionately harm protected class members, posing the risk of “agentic discrimination” (Prince and Schwarcz, 2019). If mishandled, algorithms can exacerbate inequalities and perpetuate discrimination against minority groups (Lloyd, 2018).Within the recruitment process, algorithmic bias can manifest concerning gender, race, color, and personality.Research methodologyThe primary research strategy was a literature review approach. This review aimed to assess current research on recruitment supported by artificial intelligence algorithms. The systematic review process included gathering and evaluating the selected studies’ literature and topics. Driven by the direction of the research, studies focusing on algorithmic discrimination in recruitment over the past 10 years were included unless past literature was worth reviewing. This is because this is a relatively new phenomenon that has become prominent over the past 10 years. In defining the “algorithmic and hiring discrimination” literature, a fairly broad approach was taken based on article keywords rather than publication sources. Depending on the focus, keywords related to algorithms and hiring discrimination were included in the search string. The keyword search algorithm for this review is as follows. (“artificial intelligence” and “hiring discrimination”), (“algorithms” and “recruitment discrimination”), (artificial intelligence” and “recruitment discrimination”), and (“algorithms” and “hiring discrimination”). SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Web of Science are three well-known search engines frequently used by the academic community and meet the criteria for technology-related topics in this review. WOS is used as a starting point for high-quality peer-reviewed scholarly articles. The study selected these three databases, used search engines, and maintained ten years. After applying an initial screening related to titles, keywords, or abstracts, the literature was selected based on its relevance to the research topic.The obtained literature was studied in depth to reveal the surfaced themes. Several systematic research themes were identified, including AI-based recruitment applications and benefits, causes of algorithmic discrimination, which algorithmic recruitment discrimination exists, and algorithmic recruitment discrimination resolution.The process applied for the reviews depicted in Fig. 1. After excluding duplicates and less relevant and outdated literature, only 45 articles could be used as references for this study (referred to Table 1). The literature review shows that most of the research on algorithmic hiring discrimination has occurred in recent years. The research trend indicates that algorithmic hiring discrimination will be a hot research topic in the coming period.

1.
The first theme is the application of various aspects of recruitment based on artificial intelligence support and its benefits. Bogen and Rieke (2018), Ahmed (2018), Hmoud and Laszlo (2019), Albert (2019), van Esch et al. (2019), Köchling et al. (2022), and Chen (2023) consider the recruitment process as a set of tasks that may be divided into four steps sourcing, screening, interviewing, and selection. Each step includes different activities, and AI algorithms can change how each stage is executed. Some studies point out that AI-supported recruitment has benefits. Beattie et al. (2012), Newell (2015), Raub (2018), Miasato and Silva (2019), Beneduce (2020), and Johnson et al. (2020) state that it can reduce costs; Hmoud and Laszlo (2019), Johansson and Herranen (2019), Raveendra et al. (2020), Black and van Esch (2020), and Allal-Chérif et al. (2021) suggest it saves time; Upadhyay and Khandelwal (2018) and Johansson and Herranen (2019) present it reducing transactional workload.


2.
The second theme is the causes of algorithmic discrimination. McFarland and McFarland (2015), Mayson (2018), Raso et al. (2018), Raub (2018), Raghavan et al. (2020), Njoto (2020), Zixun (2020), and Jackson (2021) suggest that the reason for algorithmic discrimination is related to data selection. Data collection tends to prefer accessible, “mainstream” organizations unequally dispersed by race and gender. Inadequate data will screen out groups that have been historically underrepresented in the recruitment process. Predicting future hiring outcomes by observing historical data can amplify future hiring inequalities. Yarger et al. (2019), Miasato and Silva (2019), and Njoto (2020) propose that discrimination is due to the designer-induced selection of data features.


3.
The third theme is which algorithmic recruitment discrimination exists. According to Correll et al. (2007), Kay et al. (2015), O’neil (2016), Raso et al. (2018), Miasato and Silva (2019), Langenkamp et al. (2019), Faragher (2019), Ong (2019), Fernández and Fernández (2019), Beneduce (2020), Jackson (2021), Yarger et al. (2023), and Avery et al. (2023), when partial human data is provided to a machine, so the algorithm is biased, it will eventually lead to the risk of “agent discrimination.” In recruitment, algorithmic bias can manifest in gender, race, skin color, and personality.


4.
The fourth theme is algorithmic recruitment discrimination resolution. Kitchin and Lauriault (2015), Bornstein (2018), Raso et al. (2018), Xie et al. (2018), Raub (2018), Bornstein (2018), Grabovskyi and Martynovych (2019), Amini et al. (2019), Shin and Park (2019), Yarger et al. (2019), Gulzar et al. (2019), Kessing (2021) Jackson (2021), and Mishra (2022) argue that fair data sets need to be constructed and algorithmic transparency needs to be improved. Moreover, Smith and Shum (2018), Mitchell et al. (2019), Ong (2019), Zuiderveen Borgesius (2020), Peña et al. (2020), Kim et al. (2021), Yang et al. (2021), and Jackson (2021) propose that from a management perspective, data governance need be strengthened, including internal ethical governance and external ethical oversight.

AI-based recruitment applications and benefitsArtificial Intelligence and algorithmThe idea of machine intelligence dates back to 1950, when Turing, the father of computer science, asked, “Can machines think?” (Ong, 2019). The term “artificial intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy. Although early scientists made outstanding contributions, artificial intelligence became an industry after the 1980s with hardware development. Initial applications of artificial intelligence were seen in the automation of repeated and complicated work assignments, like industrial robot production, that displaced human work in some plants. After the mid-1990s, artificial intelligence software saw significant advances. Until today’s digital economy, AI has been commonly used in various industries (Hmoud and Laszlo, 2019).Artificial intelligence is defined as the ability of something like a machine to understand, learn, and interpret on its own in a human-like manner (Johansson and Herranen, 2019). Artificial intelligence aims “to understand and simulate human thought processes and to design machines that mimic this behavior.” It is designed to be a thinking machine with a level of human intelligence (Jackson, 2021). However, large amounts of data must be combined with fast and iterative intelligent algorithms to handle this process, allowing ML systems to learn from patterns or features in the data automatically.A set of instructions or commands used to carry out a particular operation is known as an algorithm. This digital process makes decisions automatically depending on the data entered into the program (Miasato and Silva, 2019). The algorithm analyzes massive data patterns through data mining, searching, and using ways to predict, like our point of view encoded in the code. It explores the dataset using agents representing various traits, such as race, sexual orientation, and political opinions (Njoto, 2020). The algorithms frequently contain these biases due to the lengthy history of racial and gender prejudices, both intentional and unconscious. When biases exist in algorithmic data, AI may replicate these prejudices in its decision-making, a mistake known as algorithmic bias (Jackson, 2021).AI-based recruitment stageThe recruitment procedure is a series of events that may be divided into four significant steps: searching, screening, interviewing, and selection (Bogen and Rieke, 2018). Each phase includes various activities, and artificial intelligence technology can influence the execution of each stage.The searching phase aims at a system for searching web content. It screens passive job applicants online through social media and recruitment platforms, analyzing their profiles according to predefined job descriptions. The search engine recognizes the meaning of the searched content and performs a web-based search to match candidates’ profiles based on semantic annotations of job postings and profiles (Hmoud and Laszlo, 2019).The screening phase includes evaluating and assessing the qualifications of candidates, where AI technology assists recruiters in scoring candidates and evaluating their competencies (Bogen and Rieke, 2018). The resumes are screened to match the job description better. The system can rank candidates according to the relevance of the qualification metrics.The following phase is the interview. It is probably the most individual stage of the selection process and, thus, unlikely to be fully automated by artificial intelligence. However, some AI tools enable recruiters to conduct video interviews and research candidates’ reactions, voice tones, and facial expressions (Ahmed, 2018).The final stage is the selection stage, which is the stage where the employer makes the final employment decision. In this stage, AI systems can calculate remuneration and benefits for companies and anticipate the risk that candidates would violate workplace rules. (Bogen and Rieke, 2018).AI-based recruitment benefitsRecruitment qualityBeattie et al. (2012) found that some large companies believe unconscious bias affects recruitment quality. Organizations may need to hire more qualified people to avoid financial losses (Newell, 2015). Artificial intelligence has become a part of the recruitment industry to automate the recruiting and selecting process, which can remove unconscious human bias that affects the hiring process (Raub, 2018). One of the ideas behind the development of AI in the selection of candidates is to bring higher standards to the selection process independent of the thoughts and beliefs of the interviewer (Miasato and Silva, 2019). Artificial intelligence tools can start with accurate job descriptions and targeted advertisements that match a candidate’s skills and abilities to job performance and create a profile of every candidate that indicates which candidate is best suited for the job (Johnson et al. 2020). In addition, automated resume screening systems allow recruiters to consider more candidates that would be overlooked (Beneduce, 2020). With advances in AI technology, candidate selection becomes impersonal based on data shared with the company and available on the Internet.Recruitment efficiencyHR departments may receive many candidates for every position. Traditional screening and selection that depends on human intervention to evaluate candidate information is the most expensive and discouraging hiring process (Hmoud and Laszlo, 2019). Artificial intelligence can accelerate the hiring procedure, produce an outstanding candidate experience, and reduce costs (Johansson and Herranen, 2019). It can bring job information to applicants faster, allowing them to make informed decisions about their interests early in the hiring process. Artificial intelligence can also screen out many uninterested applicants and remove them from the applicant pool, thus reducing the number of applicants recruiters need to select later. It is even possible to source reticent candidates with the help of artificial intelligence and have more time to concentrate on the best match. Artificial intelligence can not only automate the evaluation of hundreds of resumes on a large scale in a short period, but it can also automatically classify candidates based on the job description provided. Moreover, The final results after the hiring decision can be more easily fed back to the candidate (Raveendra et al., 2020).Transactional workloadThe application of AI in recruitment can be described as a “new era in human resources” because artificial intelligence replaces the routine tasks performed by human recruiters, thus changing the traditional practices of the recruitment industry (Upadhyay and Khandelwal, 2018). Most professionals believe that AI is beneficial to recruiters in terms of reducing routine and administrative tasks (Johansson and Herranen, 2019). Recruiters will hand over time-consuming administrative tasks like recruiting, screening, and interviewing to AI, allowing more scope for recruiters to concentrate on strategic affairs (Upadhyay and Khandelwal, 2018).Theme II. Why is there algorithmic recruitment discriminationAlgorithms are not inherently discriminatory, and engineers rarely intentionally introduce bias into algorithms. However, bias can still arise in algorithmic recruitment. This issue is closely linked to the fundamental technology behind AI and ML. The ML process can be simplified into several stages, each involving three key components contributing to algorithmic bias: dataset construction, the engineer’s target formulation, and feature selection (36KE, 2020). When the dataset lacks diverse representation from different companies, bias may be introduced during the development of algorithmic rules by engineers and when annotators handle unstructured data (Zixun, 2020).Datasets: bias soilDatasets serve as the foundation of machine learning (ML). If an algorithm’s data collection lacks quantity and quality, it will fail to represent reality objectively, leading to inevitable bias in algorithmic decisions. Researchers commonly use a 95% confidence level, which provides 95% certainty but still leaves a one in twenty chance of bias (Raub, 2018). Nearly every ML algorithm relies on biased databases.One issue arises when datasets are skewed towards accessible and more “mainstream” groups due to the ease of data collection. Consequently, there is an imbalance in the distribution concerning gender and race dimensions (36KE, 2020). If the collected data inadequately represent a particular race or gender, the resulting system will inevitably overlook or mistreat them in its performance. In the hiring process, insufficient data may exclude historically underrepresented groups (Jackson, 2021). Assessing the success of potential employees based on existing employees perpetuates a bias toward candidates who resemble those already employed (Raghavan et al., 2020).Without careful planning, most datasets consist of unstructured data acquired through observational measures, lacking rigorous methods in controlled environments (McFarland and McFarland, 2015). This can lead to significant issues with misreporting. When algorithms play a role in decision-making, underrepresented individuals are unequally positioned. Furthermore, as AI improves the algorithm, the model accommodates the lack of representation, reducing sensitivity to the underrepresented groups. The algorithm favors the represented group, operating less effectively for other groups (Njoto, 2020).Existing social biases are introduced into the dataset. The raw data already reflects social prejudices, and the algorithm also incorporates biased relationships, leading to the “bias in and bias out” phenomenon (36KE, 2020). This phenomenon means that discrimination and disparities exist, just like in forecasting, where historical inequalities are projected into the future and may even be amplified (Mayson, 2018).A research team at Princeton University discovered that algorithms lack access to the absolute truth. The machine corpus contains biases that closely resemble the implicit biases observed in the human brain. Artificial intelligence has the potential to perpetuate existing patterns of bias and discrimination because these systems are typically trained to replicate the outcomes achieved by human decision-makers (Raso et al. 2018). What is worse, the perception of objectivity surrounding high-tech systems obscures this fact.In summary, if an algorithmic system is trained on biased and unrepresentative data, it runs the risk of replicating that bias.Data feature selection: designer biasThe introduction of bias is sometimes not immediately apparent in model construction because computer scientists are often not trained to consider social issues in context. It is crucial to make them aware of attribute selection’s impact on the algorithm (Yarger et al., 2019).The algorithm engineer plays a crucial role in the entire system, from setting goals for machine learning to selecting the appropriate model and determining data characteristics such as labels. If inappropriate goals are set, bias may be introduced from the outset (36KE, 2020).An engineer is responsible for developing the algorithmic model. If they hold certain beliefs and preconceptions, those personal biases can be transmitted to the machine (Njoto, 2020). Although the device is responsible for selecting employee resumes, it operates based on underlying programming. The programmer guides the AI in making decisions about the best candidate, which can still result in discrimination (Miasato and Silva, 2019).Furthermore, personal biases can manifest in the selection of data characteristics. For example, engineers may prioritize specific features or variables based on how they want the machine to behave (Miasato and Silva, 2019)). The Amazon hiring case illustrates this, where engineers considered education, occupation, and gender when assigning labels to the algorithm. When gender is considered the crucial criterion, it influences how the algorithm responds to the data.Theme III. Which algorithmic recruitment discrimination existsIn the recruitment process, algorithmic bias can be manifested in terms of gender, race, color, and personality.GenderGender stereotypes have infiltrated the “lexical embedding framework” utilized in natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning (ML). Munson’s research indicates that “occupational picture search outcomes slightly exaggerate gender stereotypes, portraying minority-gender occupations as less professional” ((Avery et al., 2023; Kay et al., 2015).The impact of gender stereotypes on AI hiring poses genuine risks (Beneduce, 2020). In 2014, Amazon developed an ML-based hiring tool, but it exhibited gender bias. The system did not classify candidates neutrally for gender (Miasato and Silva, 2019). The bias stemmed from training the AI system on predominantly male employees’ CVs (Beneduce, 2020). Accordingly, the recruitment algorithm perceived this biased model as indicative of success, resulting in discrimination against female applicants (Langenkamp et al. 2019). The algorithm even downgraded applicants with keywords such as “female” (Faragher, 2019). These findings compelled Amazon to withdraw the tool and develop a new unbiased algorithm. However, this discrimination was inadvertent, revealing the flaws inherent in algorithmic bias that perpetuates existing gender inequalities and social biases (O’neil, 2016).RaceMicrosoft’s chatbot Tay learned to produce sexist and racist remarks on Twitter. By interacting with users on the platform, Tay absorbed the natural form of human language, using human tweets as its training data. Unfortunately, the innocent chatbot quickly adopted hate speech targeting women and black individuals. As a result, Microsoft shut down Tay within hours of its release. Research has indicated that when machines passively absorb human biases, they can reflect subconscious biases (Fernández and Fernández, 2019; Ong, 2019). For instance, searches for names associated with Black individuals were more likely to be accompanied by advertisements featuring arrest records, even when no actual records existed. Conversely, searches for names associated with white individuals did not prompt such advertisements (Correll et al., 2007). A study on racial discrimination revealed that candidates with white names received 50% more interview offers than those with African-American names.Skin colorIn 2015, Google’s photo application algorithm erroneously labeled a photo of two black people as gorillas (Jackson, 2021). The algorithm was insufficiently trained to recognize images with dark skin tones (Yarger et al., 2023). The company publicly apologized and committed to immediately preventing such errors. However, three years later, Google discontinued its facial identification service, citing the need to address significant technical and policy issues before resuming this service. Similarly, in 2017, an algorithm used for a contactless soap dispenser failed to correctly identify shades of skin color, resulting in the dispenser only responding to white hands and not detecting black and brown ones. These cases serve as examples of algorithmic bias (Jackson, 2021).PersonalityThe algorithm assesses word choice, tone shifts, and facial expressions (using facial recognition) to determine the candidate’s “personality” and alignment with the company culture (Raso et al., 2018). Notable examples include correlating longer tenure in a specific job with “high creativity” and linking a stronger inclination towards curiosity to a higher likelihood of seeking other opportunities (O’neil, 2016). Additionally, sentiment analysis models are employed to gauge the level of positive or negative emotions conveyed in sentences.Theme IV. How decreasing algorithmic recruitment discriminationChanges should be made at the technical and regulatory levels to ensure that AI algorithms do not replicate existing biases or introduce new ones based on the provided data (Raub, 2018).Building fair algorithms from a technical perspectiveConstructing a more unbiased datasetUnfair datasets are the root cause of bias. Therefore, a direct approach to addressing algorithmic bias is reconfiguring unbalanced datasets. Using multiple data points can yield more accurate results while carefully eliminating data points that reflect past biases. However, this approach incurs significant costs (Bornstein, 2018).Another method is to correct data imbalances by using more equitable data sources to ensure fair decision-making (36KE, 2020). Understanding the underlying structure of training data and adjusting the significance of specific data points during training based on known latent distributions makes it possible to uncover hidden biases and remove them automatically. For example, Microsoft revised their dataset for training the Face API, resulting in a 20-fold reduction in the recognition error ratio between men and women with darker skin tones and a 9-fold reduction for women by balancing factors such as skin color, age, and gender (Grabovskyi and Martynovych, 2019).Integrating “small data” and “big data” can enhance accuracy (36KE, 2020). Data should not solely rely on extensive collections but also focus on precision. While big data analysis tends to emphasize correlations, which can lead to errors when inferring causation, small data, which is more user-specific, offers detailed information and helps avoid such mistakes. Combining the vastness of big data with the precision of small data can help somewhat mitigate hiring errors (Kitchin and Lauriault, 2015).Biases in datasets can be identified through autonomous testing. The inaccuracies stemming from incomplete past data can be addressed through “oversampling” (Bornstein, 2018). Researchers from MIT demonstrated how an AI system called DB-VEA (unsupervised learning) can automatically reduce bias by re-sampling data. This approach allows the model to learn facial features such as skin color and gender while significantly reducing categorization biases related to race and gender (Amini et al., 2019).Therefore, constructing a more unbiased dataset is one of the methods that can be employed to tackle algorithmic bias.Enhancing algorithmic transparencyEngineers write algorithmic models, but they often need help understanding the processes that AI undergoes to produce a specific outcome. Many algorithmic biases are difficult to fully understand because their techniques and methods are not easily visible. This leaves many people unaware of why or how they are discriminated against and lacks public accountability (Jackson, 2021). There is an issue of “algorithmic black box” in ML. Therefore, transparency would facilitate remediation when deviant algorithms are discovered and solve the current “black box” dilemma (Shin and Park, 2019).Technological tools against biasData blending process. Blendoor is inclusive recruiting and staffing analytics software that mitigates unconscious bias. It takes candidate profiles from existing online job boards and applicant tracking systems to reduce unconscious bias. Blendoor “blends” candidate profiles by removing names, photos, and dates (Yarger et al., 2019). Thus, Blendoor promotes design fairness by assisting underrepresented job seekers and encoding equal opportunity in the algorithm.Decoupling technique. In resume screening, this technique allows the algorithm to identify the best candidates by considering variables optimized for other applicants based on specific categories like gender or race rather than the entire applicant pool (Raso et al., 2018). It means that the characteristics selected for minority or female applicants will be determined according to the trends of other minority or female applicants, which may differ from the features identified as successful representatives.Word embedding. Microsoft researchers found that words exhibit distinct associations in news and web data. For instance, words like “fashion” and “knitting” are more closely related to females, while “hero” and “genius” are more closely related to males (36KE, 2020). Microsoft suggests a simple solution by removing the gender-specific measures in word embedding to reduce “presentation bias.”Differential testing. Scientists at Columbia University developed Deep Xplore, a software that highlights vulnerabilities in algorithmic neural networks via “coaxing” the system to make mistakes (Xie et al., 2018). Deep Xplore utilizes discrepancy testing, which involves comparing several systems and observing their outputs’ differences. A model is considered vulnerable if all other models consistently predict a particular input while only one model predicts it differently (Gulzar et al., 2019).Bias detection tool. In September 2018, Google introduced the innovative What-If tool for detecting bias (Mishra, 2022). It assists designers in identifying the causes of misclassification, determining decision boundaries, and detecting algorithmic fairness through interactive visual interfaces. Additionally, Facebook has developed Fairness Flow, an emerging tool for correcting algorithmic bias. Fairness Flow automatically notifies developers if an algorithm makes unfair judgments based on race, gender, or age (Kessing, 2021).Improving the algorithm’s ethics from a management perspectiveInternal ethics governanceSeveral major technology companies have published AI principles addressing bias governance, signaling the start of self-regulation (36KE, 2020). Microsoft has formed an AI and ethical standards committee to enforce these principles, subjecting all future AI products to ethics scrutiny (Smith and Shum, 2018). Google has responded by introducing a Model Card function, similar to an algorithm manual, that explains the employed algorithm, highlights strengths and weaknesses, and even shares operational results from various datasets (Mitchell et al., 2019).Algorithmic systems undergo audits to prevent unintended discrimination and make necessary adjustments to ensure fairness (Kim et al., 2021). Regular internal audits allow companies to monitor, identify, and correct biased algorithms. Increased involvement from multiple parties in the data collection process and continuous algorithm monitoring are essential to reduce or eliminate bias (Jackson, 2021). Some companies have introduced AI-HR audits, similar to traditional HR audits, to review employee selection and assess the reliability of AI algorithms and ML data (Yang et al., 2021). Companies should also stay updated on recruitment laws and regulations and ensure compliance with legal requirements.Considering the programmers behind these algorithms, diversity in the high-tech industry is crucial. Algorithms often reflect the opinions of those who create them. The persistent underrepresentation of women, African-Americans, and Latino professionals in the IT workforce leads to biased algorithms. For instance, a study in 2019 found that only 2.5% of Google’s employees were black, while Microsoft and Facebook had only 4% representation. Another study revealed that 80% of AI professors in 2018 were male. Involving diverse individuals in data collection and training can regulate and eliminate human bias rooted in algorithms (Jackson, 2021).Although self-regulation can help reduce discrimination and influence lawmakers, it has potential drawbacks. Self-regulation lacks binding power, necessitating external oversight through third-party testing and the development of AI principles, laws, and regulations by external agencies.External supervisionTo ensure transparency and accountability in recruitment, third-party certification and testing of AI products can help mitigate the negative impacts of unreliability. At the “Ethics and Artificial Intelligence” technical conference held at Carnegie Mellon University, the director of Microsoft Research Institute proposed a solution to ensure consistent standards and transparency in AI. Microsoft’s proposal, “Allowing third-party testing and comparison,” aims to uphold the integrity of AI technology in the market (Ong, 2019).Various organizations have issued principles promoting equity, ethics, and responsibility in AI (Zuiderveen Borgesius, 2020). The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has provided recommendations on AI, while the European Commission has drafted proposals regarding the influence of algorithmic systems on human rights. In 2019, the European Commission established a high-level expert group on AI, which proposed ethical guidelines and self-regulatory measures regarding AI and ethics.Public organizations have played a role in establishing mechanisms to safeguard algorithmic fairness. The Algorithm Justice League (AJL) has outlined vital behaviors companies should follow in a signable agreement. Holding accountable those who design and deploy algorithms improves existing algorithms in practice (36KE, 2020). After evaluating IBM’s algorithm, AJL provided feedback, and IBM responded promptly, stating that they would address the identified issue. As a result, IBM significantly improved the accuracy of its algorithm in minority facial identification.Data protection and non-discrimination laws safeguard against discriminatory practices in algorithmic decision-making. In the EU region, Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) guarantees the rights and freedoms outlined in the Convention, prohibiting direct and indirect discrimination (Zuiderveen Borgesius, 2020). Non-discrimination laws, particularly those about indirect discrimination, serve as a means to prevent various forms of algorithmic discrimination. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), implemented in May 2018, addresses the impact of ML algorithms and offers a “right to explanation” (e.g., Articles 13–15) (Peña et al., 2020), enabling individuals to request explanations for algorithmic decisions and demand measures to avoid discriminatory influences when handling sensitive data. The GDPR mandates organizations to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), with each EU member state must maintain an independent data protection authority vested with investigative powers. Under the GDPR, a data protection authority can access an organization’s premises and computers using personal data (Zuiderveen Borgesius, 2020).Investigation and analysisBased on Grounded Theory, this section uses a qualitative research approach to explore AI-supported recruitment applications and discrimination.Sources and methodsResearch methodologyThe study is based on Grounded Theory and qualitative analysis of interview data. Glaser and Strauss (1965,1968) proposed this theory. The basic idea is constructing a theory based on empirical data (Charmaz and Thornberg, 2021). Researchers generally do not make any theoretical assumptions before starting scientific research but start directly from a realistic point of view and summarize several empirical concepts in primary data, which are then raised to systematic theoretical knowledge. Grounded Theory must be supported by empirical evidence, but its most significant characteristic is not its practical nature but the extraction of new ideas from existing facts.Grounded Theory is a qualitative approach to research that focuses on the importance of “primary sources” (Timmermans and Tavory, 2012). In the study of AI-driven hiring discrimination, the systematic collection and analysis of data are used to uncover intrinsic patterns, construct relevant concepts, and refine relevant theoretical models instead of adopting theoretical assumptions. The current research on the influence factors and measures of AI-driven recruitment discrimination is not intensive enough and lacks corresponding theoretical support. At the same time, Grounded Theory extracts from “primary data” and constructs a theoretical model to study AI-driven recruitment applications and discrimination.Interviewees and content
Participants in the interview
The interview period was June 2023, and the interview form was a face-to-face live/video/telephone interview. The interviewees were selected considering representativeness, authority, and operability, and ten people with experience in recruiting or interviewing with the help of intelligent tools were finally selected for the study. The basic information of the interviewees is shown in Table 2. The study was conducted with the interviewees’ consent. Each interview lasted about 30 min, and notes were taken during the interview. The number of interviewees was determined based on the principle of information saturation.Table 2 Basic information of formal interviewees.Full size table
Before conducting interviews, a large amount of data is collected to understand AI-driven hiring discrimination and propose appropriate improvement strategies. A study of AI-driven hiring discrimination was conducted using “dynamic sampling” and “information saturation” methods.
Interview outline
The interview outline was set in advance around the core objectives of this study, including the following six questions: “Do you know about AI-driven recruitment,” “How do you think about AI-driven recruitment discrimination,” “What do you think is the cause of AI-driven recruitment discrimination,” “Types of AI-driven hiring discrimination,” “Strategies to solve AI-driven hiring discrimination,” and “What other suggestions do you have.” Based on the predefined interview outline, appropriate adjustments were made as the interview progressed.
Interview ethics
The interview process is based on three main principles—the right-to-know principle. The interviewer fully understands the purpose, content, and use of the interview before being interviewed, the principle of objectivity. The researcher will guide the respondent to ask questions and answer what they cannot understand. Respondents make objective statements of their willingness that are not influenced by external factors, the principle of confidentiality. Interviews will be conducted anonymously, and the personal information of the interviewees will not be disclosed. The interviewee’s privacy is fully respected, and the original data is replaced by figures, which will be used only for the interviewer’s reference and analysis, appropriately kept by the interviewer, and used only for this study and no other purpose.
Interview tools
Nvivo 12.0 Plus qualitative analysis software was used as an auxiliary tool to clarify ideas and improve work efficiency.

Within two working days after the completion of the interview, the analysis and organization of the interview data was completed. The Nvivo 12 plus software coded the interview data in three layers from the bottom up, with the content as the center.
The first layer was open coding. The interview data of 10 interviewees were imported and, using the software, parsed word by word to clarify the meaning of words and sentences, give an interpretation of the data, and obtain free nodes. The data from each section was summarized and inferred to organize the interviewees’ perceptions of AI-driven recruitment, and each node was given a name to derive the first-level nodes.
Next, the second-level spindles were coded. The researchers unfolded the induction of interrelated classes for the nodes formed by the open coding, constructed the relationship between concepts and classes, and coded a spindle concept, which, after the spindle coding, would form a second-level node.
The third part is the three-level core coding. Another coding core class genus is selected based on the secondary spindle, and a tertiary code is developed.
Interview quality control
In order to ensure the credibility of the interview results, the method adopted in this study is to use a uniform way of asking questions to different interviewees. Each round of interviews should be kept between 20 and 30 min. Too long an interval will reduce the effectiveness of feedback on the questions. Also, interviews should not span more than one month to ensure the timeliness of the information obtained.
ResultsApplying the Nvivo12 Plus qualitative analysis method, 182 free nodes were obtained by three-level coding, 31 primary nodes were formed after analogy, and 11 secondary nodes were deduced inductively. Finally, five core genera of tertiary nodes were identified (see Table 3).Table 3 Summary of nodes and reference points at all levels after coding of interview data.Full size tableOpen level 1 codingThe interviews with 10 respondents resulted in 182 words and sentences related to AI-driven recruitment applications and discrimination, which were conceptualized and merged to form 31 open-ended Level 1 codes.Main-axis second-level codingThe spindle codes were analyzed through cluster analysis to analyze the correlation and logical order among the primary open codes, forming more generalized categories. Eleven spindle codes were extracted and summarized.Core-type tertiary codingThe Grounded Theory steps resulted in 31 open primary and 11 secondary spindle codes. Further categorization and analysis revealed that when “AI-driven recruitment applications and discrimination” is used as the core category, the five main categories are AI-driven recruitment applications, AI-driven recruitment effects, causes of AI-driven recruitment discrimination, types of AI-driven recruitment discrimination, and AI-driven recruitment discrimination measures.The coding process described above was exemplified by an interview with a researcher, F2, who had taught information science at a university for 2 years and was now employed at an intelligent technology R&D company. After the interview, F1’s information was analyzed and explored in a three-level coding process.Under the three-level node AI-driven recruitment application, F2 suggested that the AI tools currently developed could assist companies with simple recruitment tasks, including online profile retrieval, analysis, and evaluation. However, this technical engineer suggested that candidate assessment for high-level positions suits human-machine collaboration, although machines have an advantage in candidate profile searches.Supported by three-level nodes of AI-driven recruiting effectiveness, F2 suggests that machine applications in recruiting can relieve human transactional workload, and chatbot Q&A services improve recruiting efficiency.In the context of the causes of AI-driven hiring discrimination at the third level, F2 suggests that some job seekers are unfamiliar with the hiring interface and how to use it, leading to unfair interviews. She suggested the need for organizers to prepare usage guidelines or mock interview exercises. She argues that much of the data needed for intelligent machine learning comes from internal companies or external market supplies and that this data lacks fair scrutiny. It is even possible that the source data fed into the machines is compromised.Under the tertiary node AI-driven hiring discrimination, F2 is concerned that the machines may misevaluate candidates due to individual differences, such as intelligence, or external characteristics, such as skin color. Moreover, some discriminatory judgments are difficult to resolve under current technology.Under the tertiary node AI-driven hiring discrimination measures, F2 proposes utilizing technical tools, such as learning impartial historical data, or non-technical tools, such as anti-AI discrimination laws. She argues that in the future, humans use AI tools to solve more complex decisions, not just limited to hiring. Instead, humans need to embrace and accept the widespread use of machines.Synthesizing the above analysis, the final overview of the AI-driven recruitment application and discrimination framework is obtained (see Fig. 3). After the conceptual model was constructed, the remaining original information was coded and comparatively analyzed, and no new codes were generated, indicating that this study was saturated.Fig. 3: AI-driven recruitment applications and discrimination.The comprehensive analysis produces an overview of AI-driven recruitment applications and recognition frameworks.Full size imageDiscussionAn analysis of interview results conducted using Grounded Theory indicates that AI-supported hiring discrimination should be approached from five perspectives. These perspectives align with the thematic directions identified through our literature review.Firstly, AI-driven hiring applications impact various aspects, such as reviewing applicant profiles online, analyzing applicant information, scoring assessments based on hiring criteria, and generating preliminary rankings automatically.Secondly, interviewers perceive benefits in AI-driven recruitment for job seekers. It eliminates subjective human bias, facilitates automated matchmaking between individuals and positions, and provides automated response services. Moreover, AI reduces the workload on humans and enhances efficiency.Thirdly, concerns are raised regarding potential hiring discrimination perpetrated by machines. This can arise from AI tools, such as partial source data, or users unfamiliar with user interfaces and operations.Fourthly, intrinsic factors like personality and IQ, as well as extrinsic factors like gender and nationality, have been observed to influence the accurate identification and judgment of AI systems concerning hiring discrimination.Fifthly, respondents offer recommendations for combating discrimination by machines, including technical and non-technical approaches.Recommendations for future studiesThis study conducted a literature review to analyze algorithmic recruitment discrimination’s causes, types, and solutions. Future research on algorithmic recruitment discrimination could explore quantitative analysis or experimental methods across different countries and cultures. Additionally, future studies could examine the mechanics of algorithmic recruitment and the technical rules that impact the hiring process. It would be interesting to analyze the psychological effects of applying this algorithmic recruitment technique on various populations (gender, age, education level) from an organizational behavior perspective. While recent studies have primarily discussed discrimination theory in the traditional economy’s hiring market, future theoretical research should consider how advanced technology affects equity in hiring within the digital economy.ConclusionThe study concludes that the fourth industrial revolution introduced technological innovations significantly affecting the recruitment industry. It extends the analysis of statistical discrimination theory in the digital age and adopts a literature review approach to explore four themes related to AI-based recruitment. The study argues that algorithmic bias remains an issue while AI recruitment tools offer benefits such as improved recruitment quality, cost reduction, and increased efficiency. Recruitment algorithms’ bias is evident in gender, race, color, and personality. The primary source of algorithmic bias lies in partial historical data. The personal preferences of algorithm engineers also contribute to algorithmic bias. Technical measures like constructing unbiased datasets and enhancing algorithm transparency can be implemented to tackle algorithmic hiring discrimination. However, strengthening management measures, such as corporate ethics and external oversight, is equally important.

The primary research approach used is a literature review. The findings suggest that AI-enabled recruitment has the potential to enhance recruitment quality, increase efficiency, and reduce transactional work. However, algorithmic bias results in discriminatory hiring practices based on gender, race, color, and personality traits. The study indicates that algorithmic bias stems from limited raw data sets and biased algorithm designers. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to implement technical measures, such as unbiased dataset frameworks and improved algorithmic transparency, as well as management measures like internal corporate ethical governance and external oversight. Employing Grounded Theory, the study conducted survey analysis to collect firsthand data on respondents’ experiences and perceptions of AI-driven recruitment applications and discrimination.', 'datePublished': '2023-09-13T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2023-09-13T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '12', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02079-x', 'keywords': ['Business and management', 'Science, technology and society', 'Science', 'Humanities and Social Sciences', 'multidisciplinary'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-02079-x/MediaObjects/41599_2023_2079_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-02079-x/MediaObjects/41599_2023_2079_Fig2_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-02079-x/MediaObjects/41599_2023_2079_Fig3_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'Humanities and Social Sciences Communications', 'issn': ['2662-9992'], 'volumeNumber': '10', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'Palgrave Macmillan UK', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Zhisheng Chen', 'url': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0854-2547', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics', 'address': {'name': 'College of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'njuczs@nuaa.edu.cn', '@type': 'Person'}], 'isAccessibleForFree': True, '@type': 'ScholarlyArticle'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Singapore Government is moving decisively to tap on generative AI – the country currently plans to build 100 generative AI solutions in 100 days and has already developed plans to move all public sector chatbots onto large language models (LLMs).
 

LLMs are just one of many foundation models – machine learning models that are trained on large unlabelled datasets, which can then be adapted to perform more specific tasks – that promise to make AI capabilities easily available to governments and enterprises. Right now, tech companies like IBM are training foundation models on a wide array of data, including code, geospatial data and IT events data, according to a new IBM report. 
 

GovInsider speaks to Cristina Caballe Fuguet, Senior Partner & Vice President, Global Government Leader, and Florian Breger, Vice President Civilian Government, Global Industries, IBM Technology, to understand the three key ways that foundation models can put AI to work for governments.
1. Improving citizen experiences
 

First and foremost, government leaders should prioritize the consideration of AI and generative AI use cases that improve citizen experiences. When finetuned with relevant domain knowledge, agencies can use generative AI to build applications that can support agencies in providing better, faster information and services to its citizens, Caballe and Breger said.
 

Take for example conversational AI chatbots powered by generative AI. These tools have the potential to manage large volume of citizen inquiries and interactions, allowing public sector agencies, and its limited resources, to focus on more value-added tasks, says Caballe. 
 

These interactions can then be used to further train the conversational models and continuously improve customer service, bringing more relevant and personalized information to each citizen based on previous interactions.
 

How does AI and foundational models work on a public facing solution? 
 

Recently, IBM partnered with Wimbledon to develop an AI solution that could:
 


Automatically identify key moments and produce highlight reels from thousands of hours of video
Add AI-generated spoken commentary to highlight reels
Provide data-driven predictions for players’ performance to fans

 

This AI platform was built on IBM’s enterprise-grade AI platform, watsonx. First, developers tapped on watsonx.data, a data store which enabled them to pool together a wide range of data sources to inform their machine learning models, while filtering out personally identifiable information, profanity, and hate speech. 
 

Next, the team selected a large language model from watsonx.ai, IBM’s studio for building, training and deploying generative AI models. Then, they finetuned the AI model with Wimbledon’s domain expertise, including tennis-specific terms and concepts.
 

Similarly, agencies can tap on foundation models from watsonx.ai to serve their unique citizen communication needs, from chatbots to parliamentary highlight reels.
2. Raising productivity, transforming operations
 

Second, foundation models can support government organisations in improving productivity and transforming operations in the back end. This generates a tremendous opportunity to exploit the vast amount of data for public use or to improve the internal decision-making process, resulting in increased productivity. 
 

As a matter of fact, according to recent studies, governments that embed generative AI solutions within their everyday operations can expect to see up to a 40 per cent increase in productivity, Caballe points out.
 

In the United States, IBM has partnered with NASA to build an open source geospatial foundation model that can pore through petabytes of satellite data to track deforestation, predict crop yields, and monitor greenhouse gas emissions, says Breger.
 

In the public sector, similar generative AI can support agencies in sifting through and summarising vast amounts of documents, applications and files, he explains. Even civil servants with extensive experience in programming can embrace these benefits. With a simple language request watsonx.ai can point them to concrete sources within the documents, helping the AI to remain explainable and trustworthy.
 

Watsonx.governance, one of the tools available later this year in the IBM watsonx studio, is a tool that will help organisations create responsible and transparent AI workflows with security and control throughout the entire AI lifecycle.
 

“You don't want government services powered by AI to have ‘hallucinated’ responses, or to get different answers for the same question,” he notes, highlighting the importance of having trusted and explainable AI for highly regulated industries like governments. In June, the Monetary Authority of Singapore worked with IBM on a responsible AI toolkit to help financial institutions assess fairness and transparency when using AI.
 

Caballe adds that IBM offers a consulting practice that can support organisations in developing and deploying AI tools responsibly, and establishing a culture around the safe handling of AI, with full consideration of the potential risks and unintended effects. This practice can also help leaders identify the best use cases for AI within their teams.
3. Modernising applications
 

Finally, generative AI can support government agencies in modernising their technology applications, such as upgrading legacy applications to run in a cloud-native way. This is a key goal that Singapore’s GovTech has set for itself this year, as GovInsider previously reported.
 

“In government, there is currently a high priority to run large digital transformation programmes. AI can offer productivity gains of around 30 per cent when it comes to application modernisation,” says Caballe. 
 

This can range from helping organisations automatically generate code when migrating legacy applications to the cloud or building playbooks for automation code.  For example, the Watson Code Assistant can help developers generate secure and workable automation code for the Red Hat Ansible Automation platform, as GovInsider reported previously.
 

Once such code is generated, developers can review and modify the code if necessary. This can radically simplify the workload of government IT teams that oversee complex multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments.
 

This year, Australia’s Digital Transformation Agency announced a partnership with IBM to drive the modernisation of government services with IBM’s tech offerings, including generative AI.
 

But how can agencies begin to embrace the full benefits of foundation models? Caballe and Breger suggest that government leaders start leading their organizations in identifying initial use cases and pilots that can provide tangible value and go into production quickly as soon as possible.
 

Once such quick gains have been made, agencies can learn from the process to scale their AI strategy across their organisation with trusted tools like watsonx. 
 

In addition, IBM is currently conducting workshops with government agencies around the globe to help them discover next steps and potential pathways forward in implementing generative AI. It also offers pilots of its products, including watsonx.governance, for these organizations to experiment with the benefits of IBM’s open, trusted, targeted and empowering approach to generative AI.

AI is a large umbrella with various applications underneath. Two prominent branches have emerged under this umbrella: conversational AI and generative AI.







While conversational AI and generative AI may work together, they have distinct differences and capabilities. Artificial intelligence (AI) changed the way humans interact with machines by offering benefits such as automating mundane tasks and generating content. AI has ushered in a new era of human-computer collaboration as businesses embrace this technology to improve processes and efficiency.
Learn the differences between conversational AI and generative AI, and how they work together.

What is conversational AI and how does it work?
Conversational AI is a technology that helps machines interact and engage with humans in a more natural way. The interactions are like a conversation with back-and-forth communication. This technology is used in applications such as chatbots, messaging apps and virtual assistants. Examples of popular conversational AI applications include Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri.
Conversational AI models are trained on data sets with human dialogue to help understand language patterns. They use natural language processing and machine learning technology to create appropriate responses to inquiries by translating human conversations into languages machines understand.

The knowledge bases where conversational AI applications draw their responses are unique to each company. Business AI software learns from interactions and adds new information to the knowledge database as it consistently trains with each interaction. Humans also update these knowledge bases.
Conversational AI may also use predefined responses -- or rule-based systems -- for initial responses.


What is generative AI and how does it work?
Generative AI lets users create new content -- such as animation, text, images and sounds -- using machine learning algorithms and the data the technology is trained on. Generative AI uses deep learning and neural networks to create outputs. Examples of popular generative AI applications include ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Jasper AI.
Generative AI uses neural networks to identify patterns and other structures in its training data. It then generates new content based on predictions from these learned patterns. There are various learning approaches to train generative AI such as supervised learning, which uses human response and feedback to help generate more accurate content.
Organizations can create foundation models as a base for the AI systems to perform multiple tasks. Foundation models are AI neural networks or machine learning models that have been trained on large quantities of data. They can perform many tasks, such as text translation, content creation and image analysis because of their generality and adaptability. Examples of foundation models include GPT-4 and PaLM 2.





Main differences between conversational AI and generative AI functionality
Conversational AI and generative AI have different goals, applications, use cases, training and outputs. Both technologies have unique capabilities and features and play a big role in the future of AI.
Here is a breakdown of the differences between the two:

Objectives and goals. Conversational AI focuses on human conversations while generative AI focuses on creating content in various forms.
Use cases and applications. Conversational AI is used for applications such as customer service, virtual assistants and chatbots. Generative AI can be used to write works of fiction, marketing content and meta descriptions.
Learning and training data. Conversational AI is trained on large data sets with human input, conversations, user queries and responses. Generative AI is trained on different sets of data to learn patterns to create content with predictive patterns.
Input and output. Users input information in a conversation when using conversational AI. Conversational AI uses this interaction to create responses. Generative AI uses input and data to generate new content by using learned patterns.



Are conversational AI and generative AI mutually exclusive?
While each technology has its own application and function, they are not mutually exclusive. Consider an application such as ChatGPT -- it's conversational AI because it is a chatbot and also generative AI due to its content creation. While conversational AI is a specific application of generative AI, generative AI encompasses a broader set of tasks beyond conversations such as writing code, drafting articles or creating images.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Generative AI is undoubtedly redefining the future of work in all sectors and on a global scale. The technology could either cause replacements in easy-to-automate roles, or be an assistant in roles that still require a human touch.. Companies may need to plan accordingly and if they are to benefit from generative AI and not be caught unaware by its advancements.




The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, transforming every sector in which it has been applied. Having become mainstream through ChatGPT, the technology has been massively accepted and adopted, spreading like wildfire, much as the internet’s adoption in the 90s.
It took the World Wide Web seven years to reach 100m users — it took ChatGPT less than two months.
From accelerating tasks to automating others, generative AI has massively impacted both work and workers. While impressing companies and employers by how fast it operates and how diligently it can accomplish tasks, generative AI has also been a source of anxiety for employees who fear that the technology might rob them of their jobs.
In other words, “AI injects both magic and mayhem into the future of work,” according to Forrester Research in a recent report on the impact of generative AI in jobs. While generative AI will cause an evolution in work and what we know it to be, it is yet to be seen whether it will replace human workers or empower them in their roles.
The Impact of AI on Work: Replacement
According to the report, Forrester Research has monitored AI’s impact on jobs globally for nearly ten years. The company has gathered from this research that 36% of global workers employed full or part-time fear losing their jobs to automation in the next ten years.
However, the company reports that generative AI has most certainly been more disruptive than the rest of AI in this period due to how instantly it produces results. The intensity of the disruption is already causing job disruption in areas such as writing and graphic design, which have begun seeing changes.Advertisements




The rise has also been accompanied by many predictions, including one by Goldman Sachs, concluding that generative AI could expose 300 million full-time jobs to automation.
Another academic research by the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI found that “around 80% of the US workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted.”
In its research, however, Forrester predicts that automation and AI will replace 4.9% of US jobs by 2030. This means that 0.6% of workers in the US might lose their jobs annually. Of this percentage of jobs lost to automation, generative AI specifically will account for 30% of the losses.
In terms of the number of jobs, Forrester Research forecasts that generative AI will replace 90,000 jobs in 2023, growing to 2.4 million by 2030. These jobs will mainly consist of roles that are easy to automate and have high generative AI influence. These include technical writers, social science research assistants, proofreaders, and copywriters.
Source Forrester Research
The Impact of AI on Work: Influence
On the other hand, the research company found that generative AI will influence more jobs than it will replace. More precisely, Forrester predicts that by 2030, generative AI will influence more than 11 million jobs in the US, 4.5 times the number of jobs it replaces in the same period.
By influence, Forrester means that generative AI will play a part in “reshaping, retraining, and upskilling existing workers to incorporate generative AI tools into the daily workflow.” Jobs influenced by this technology will be those that are harder to automate, including editors, writers, authors, poets, lyricists, and creative writers, says Forrester.
Regarding the influence level, education is said to play a significant part. Based on the report, generative AI is predicted to influence workers with bachelor’s degrees and higher qualifications more than those with high school diplomas.
Workers with only a high school diploma, about 36 million, will see a 2.7% influence level on their jobs, whereas about 64 million workers with degrees will experience a 16% to 21% influence.
Occupations with lower educational requirements, like transportation and warehousing, construction, agriculture, and manufacturing, are expected to see very little influence on their work from generative AI.
Generative AI’s influence is predicted to increase with income, where jobs with annual salaries of less than $60,000 will see half the levels of generative AI influence than jobs paid $90,000 or more.
However, higher-earning professions, including many high-income managerial jobs, fall on the other side of the inverted U-shaped curve in that they see waning influence from generative AI. This is mainly because their jobs depend on AI-proof skills like human judgment, empathy, and leadership.
Source Forrester Research
New Opportunities
To cope with the replacements, a report by the McKinsey Global Institute shows that 12 million workers will have to transition to new roles by 2030. Many workers are expected to shift from customer service, office support, and food services to more healthcare, STEM, and managerial positions.
As a result of this shift, the economy is expected to re-weight toward higher-wage jobs. Workers in lower-wage jobs are up to 14 times more likely to need to change occupations than those in highest-wage positions, and most will need additional skills to do so successfully. Women are 1.5 times more likely to need to move into new occupations than men.
In addition to replacing automatable roles and complimenting others, AI has also been predicted to cause the rise of new roles. According to a report on the Future of Work by the World Economic Forum (WEF), AI will cause the emergence of 69 million new roles globally.
The emerging roles that the WEF has highlighted since 2014 include Data Analysts/ Scientists, AI and Machine Learning Specialists, and Digital Transformation Specialists. Aside from these, the tech industry has witnessed the rise of prompt engineers, AI auditors, human-machine interaction designers, and AI ethicists, among others.
Building a Future With AI
Given the unpredictability of generative AI, seeing as it functions almost like a black box — it provides output given an input (although explainable AI is looking to change this), in addition to how young the technology still is, it is difficult to plan for every eventuality.
However, it is possible to build a strategic plan that better prepares a company for the future landscape. This not only helps the company keep up-to-date with the technology while leveraging it for better results, but it also helps employees work with the technology to be more productive and efficient.
According to Forrester Research, to survive and thrive in the generative AI era, a company needs to:
Invest in The Robotics Quotient (RQ)
The RQ is a metric that gauges how well people and organizations can adapt to, believe in, and use automation and AI to produce commercial success. This requires training staff, establishing new standards, fostering optimistic attitudes, and being open about AI’s role in an organization’s ambitions for the future of work.
Forrester believes that high RQ organizations will most successfully integrate generative AI to drive value. This will help the companies and employees not be phased out by AI but empowered by it instead.
Build Around Augmentation
Based on the reports, generative AI is predicted to influence more jobs than it will replace over the next decade. As such, companies should structure their strategy around integrating generative AI into the daily workflow.
Instead of restricting access to generative AI tools, companies should encourage them and prioritize more human-proof tasks like interacting with clients. For instance, asking Microsoft Excel’s Copilot to create a pivot table or calculate a correlation removes an arduous task, but it doesn’t replace the employee.
Instead, it augments their skill set and reduces the time to complete a specific task, creating more room for more vital tasks.
Identify High-Influence Roles
One way of getting ahead of the curve in integrating generative AI into the company is by identifying roles predicted to be highly impacted by AI and incorporating AI early. Forrester recommends equipping workers in jobs with high generative AI influence with early pilot tools.
By doing so, the company will have an early start to the technology, possibly gaining a competitive edge. This will also give the company enough time to test the technology and determine where it best applies in its use cases.
The Bottom Line
Considering the rate of advancement of technology, hiring the right skills for generative AI will be an evolving proposition. For example, prompt engineering is currently a hot skill. It endeavors to elicit the best possible answers from a generative AI system.
However, prompt engineering might decline in importance in favor of “problem formulation” as generative AI systems become more adept at understanding human intent or even begin to create their prompts.
Therefore, companies and recruitment managers should be forward-thinking about generative AI and hire people with broader qualifications in the area to avoid being phased out by the developments.

And the in-house counsel they serve want to see law firms using technology in legal service delivery. A Thompson Hine survey found that 96% of law department leaders and legal operations staff wish their law firms would use innovation (like trusted generative AI) to save them money. So legal professionals see the potential of generative AI and other advanced technologies. How do you get from an interest in the possibilities to seeing the impact of new tools? A new report from Thomson Reuters helps legal professionals see the path forward. Here are three key takeaways from “How generative AI will help lawyers improve legal service delivery.” Improving client outcomes is more important than simple automation Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates content from scratch. This could be text, music, images, or video. Some knowledge workers have expressed fears that generative AI will eventually put them out of a job because their businesses or clients will be able to do their work without them.  On the contrary. Yes, generative AI can help professionals reduce busy work. But more importantly, it helps them deliver better client outcomes. According to the report, “Some tasks will be automated, but the fundamental transformation will be how legal work is reimagined and improved. AI presents an enormous opportunity for legal because so much of what lawyers do today can be further enhanced with AI, and client outcomes can be improved.” Rather than replacing legal professionals, generative AI will help them spend time applying their considerable wisdom to legal matters – creating even more value for clients and businesses.   ChatGPT caught our imagination – trusted sources make it real The generative AI tools we choose make a big difference. Who trained the system? What data is it drawing from?  The answers to these questions determine the likelihood the system will offer up “hallucinations”: perfectly plausible-sounding answers that aren’t based on fact. For lawyers, relying on a hallucination could mean relying on inappropriate or made-up case law, or using model contract clauses that aren’t on market. “While ChatGPT can deliver answers that sound coherent and accurate, this type of AI is really just a sentence-completion engine,” according to the Thomson Reuters report. “ChatGPT has little intelligence but is very good at drafting language that sounds like plausible responses to a user’s prompt. But it’s not always accurate.” Legal professionals can use generative AI to improve client outcomes and streamline their workload if the AI is drawn from trusted data sources and overseen by experts in the data and legal tasks. Generative AI is not technology alone. It is a combination of domain expertise, quality data, and AI expertise. The quality of these three elements determines the tools suitability and reliability for a particular field, like legal practice.  Indeed, effective, trustworthy generative AI is comprised of three key elements: the data on which AI operates, the technology that makes it work for specific applications, and the human expertise that directs the technology to practical applications and solutions and informs training and error analysis.  Making sense of the intersection between AI and legal professionalsDiscover the clear connections between generative AI and legal work.  Watch on-demand today Corporate legal departments are leading the way While the Thompson Hine report showed that 96% of corporate law departments want their outside law firms to use innovation to save them money, only 12% say their primary outside law firms have done so.  Corporate legal departments are keen to use technologies themselves to improve processes and drive efficiency. Over time, they will continue to put pressure on outside counsel to match their pace. According to Thomson Reuters, “The most significant opportunity for law firms to leverage AI [is in] using data and technology to improve the quality and efficiency of the legal services delivered to clients. Leveraging technology has the biggest impact in areas where the capacity of humans to perform legal work has not kept pace with the explosion of data.” It seems that clients see the greatest possibilities for innovation and efficiency in data-rich practice areas and legal tasks like e-discovery, document drafting, due diligence, transaction management, and legal research. The report, “How generative AI will help lawyers improve legal service delivery” explores each of these dynamics in depth and explores specific uses of generative AI in legal practice.  Generative AI promises to profoundly change the way legal professionals deliver services. But not every lawyer will benefit equally. According to the report, “The winners among lawyers will not be the ones who passively wait for generative AI tools to come their way. Successful lawyers will understand that their domain knowledge is a competitive advantage as they help deploy AI systems that embody and amplify that knowledge.” That is, the ones who find the opportunities, rely on trusted tools, and innovate early will reap the greatest benefit.   Ready to learn more about how generative AI can help you elevate the way you deliver legal services?

At a Glance




Video game industry executives believe that within 5 to 10 years, AI could manage more than half of game development.
Most believe that AI will improve the quality of games and deliver them more quickly; fewer believe that AI will reduce costs.
AI is already being used in preproduction stages, planning out game content, and industry executives expect that within a few years, it will play a larger role in production, developing characters, dialogue, and environments.
Few expect AI to solve the industry's talent shortage, and many said that although the technology may free developers from mundane work, it won't replace the creative spark.






Generative AI is just beginning to have an effect on video games, but gaming industry executives believe that over the next 5 to 10 years, it will contribute to more than half of the video game development process.
Bain spoke with gaming industry executives about the potential and the challenges of generative AI for their industry. Most have high expectations for generative AI and the machine learning it’s based on, and they expect it to have a greater effect on their business than other transformative technologies, such as virtual reality or augmented reality and cloud gaming.



Most of these executives see generative AI improving quality and bringing games to market faster. Generative AI will also help make bigger, more immersive, and more personalized experiences a reality. Interestingly, only 20% of executives believe that generative AI will reduce costs, which might be a disappointment to some, given that top-tier games may cost as much as $1 billion to develop. As with any form of automation, there may be concerns about generative AI taking jobs. But most of the executives we spoke with (60%) don’t expect generative AI to have a significant effect on their talent model or alleviate the industry’s critical talent shortage.
Of the four steps in the video game life cycle—namely, preproduction concept development and planning, building the game (production), testing and launch, and ongoing live operations (postlaunch)—executives say they are deploying generative AI mostly in preproduction. For example, Blizzard Entertainment created Blizzard Diffusion, an image generator trained on its own hit titles, including World of Warcraft, to produce concept art for new ideas.
How will the use of generative AI evolve?
Over time, most executives expect generative AI to show more potential in production and later phases, particularly in several key areas (see Figure 1).

Story generation and nonplayable characters (NPCs): Generative AI could enable limitless interactive stories personalized for each player. NetEase, a Chinese game publisher, has already announced that it will use generative AI to create an NPC chat function in the upcoming mobile version of its massively multiplayer online game Justice Online.
Game assets: As confidence in the tools grows, generative AI could be used beyond concept art—for example, to fill in or even generate drafts of whole maps.
Live ops: While executives we spoke with focused mostly on the ability to rapidly generate new in-game assets, such as personalized skins, we see a significant opportunity ahead for generative AI to improve community management and player support.
User-generated content: Giving players access to generative AI tools could allow them to play a more central role in the story, increasing engagement and inviting players to support the never-ending demand for content.

Challenges to realizing generative AI’s potential
Although many executives expect IP concerns to be resolved within a few years, the complexities around rights and ownership of created content are significant, and the video game industry will likely face the same challenges as the broader media and entertainment industry.
And there are longer-term challenges as well.

Generative AI strategy: Gaming companies don’t yet have clear, well-developed strategies for making the most of generative AI. That’s common when a new technology arrives. But those that develop a thoughtful ambition and approach will see the earliest success and mitigate potential risks from improper use of the technology. Failing to deploy a disciplined approach to generative AI in the production process could create challenges around prioritization, resource allocation, and integration with existing processes.
Navigating a complex, nascent generative AI landscape: There are many companies entering this space, from scale leaders to niche players focusing on specific applications. The landscape changes from week to week, no single player offers everything, and it’s not clear yet which company’s products are the best.
Technology implementation: Executives see technical challenges as a major hurdle, including integrating generative AI into game engines and other development tools, as well as training the model for specific applications, developer styles, and franchises (see Figure 2).
Talent implications: Generative AI is a contentious subject, and any implementation should be treated with care. Most executives we spoke with agreed that the talent model will benefit by freeing up creatives from labor-intensive tasks, such as coding content for games. Content may be created quicker, but human creativity will remain the source of what makes a video game fun (game design, mechanics). Few expect generative AI to complete tasks all on its own, and many emphasized the importance of human oversight, guidance, and iteration. Only 10% are moderately or extremely concerned about the rise of generative AI. In general, they see generative AI as another tool on the bench of their designers and developers, one that may create new roles and require new training.

What should video game developers do?
Generative AI has risen in prominence so quickly that it caught many off guard. Four key steps can help gaming companies ensure that they’re on solid ground.

Take a disciplined and proactive approach to generative AI. As the hype around generative AI grows, many companies are jumping in without a clear strategy. Executives taking the time to agree on an ambition and approach alongside appropriate guardrails and governance will improve return on investment and limit risk.
Base decisions on what will benefit the player. The core goal is still creating fun, engaging games. Generative AI can help in many ways, but overreliance could also make it a hindrance. More content and engagement in a game does not guarantee a better player experience. This was the case earlier this year when developers of Forspoken adjusted the game to reduce the chattiness of main characters after players expressed frustration at the quantity of dialogue.
Strategically assess building vs. buying vs. partnering opportunities. A huge ecosystem of applications is evolving rapidly, providing a wide range of services. Developer-publishers should carefully assess when to build in-house, when to partner with scale players within the ecosystem, and when to partner with smaller, niche players.
Recognize this is more than a technological transformation. To achieve generative AI’s full potential, companies will need to stand up a new operating model by redesigning existing work processes, creating new processes, addressing downstream implications (including the impact on talent), and developing AI enterprise architecture strategy.

It’s an exciting time for the video game industry. Games are getting bigger, development costs are ballooning, and it remains as hard as ever to retain top talent. At the same time, players’ expectations are rising, as they’re demanding more immersive experiences and a bigger role in creating those experiences. Now, generative AI enters the game. There’s plenty of hype, but there’s also incredible potential, which, if harnessed properly, can deliver massive benefits to players, creators, and publishers.

The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has the potential to alter nearly all aspects of society with large but uncertain impacts on the economy and labor market. Generative AI has progressed quickly in the last few years, in particular with the release of ChatGPT, prompting governments to grapple with ways to encourage AI development within the bounds of ethical and national security concerns. AI tools may disrupt several industries from the music industry and copywriting to manufacturing and human resources. Many questions remain around AI, including inaccurate decision-making and algorithmic bias (e.g., facial recognition doing a worse job of identifying black female faces); lack of interpretability; information provenance (e.g., privacy concerns, deep fakes, and misinformation); and supply chain issues. AI may also increase inequality as AI tools consolidate the wealth and dominance of particular companies and individuals.
To maintain American leadership in AI and ensure a just integration of technology, the federal government, including the national labs, should work with technologists and other stakeholders to establish a safe and ethical structure for AI development. While there are a range of plausible scenarios of how this new technology transforms the economy and our workforce, substantial American leadership and public investment are needed to secure our competitiveness and national security while also ensuring that all U.S. citizens are uplifted by these changes and safeguarded against risks.
AI could fundamentally alter the U.S. labor market and may affect the demand for different jobs.
AI technologies may lead to fundamental changes in the U.S. labor market through their potential to reduce labor costs and increase productivity in ways that could increase global GDP by 7% each year. In doing so, these technologies would both expand economic opportunities in some sectors and reduce employment and activity in others. For example, one issue in the current Hollywood strike is the future of generative AI in the entertainment industry and its potential to disrupt writers’ and actors’ livelihoods.
Jobs across pay, skill, and experience spectrums could be affected by AI given that references to AI skills are increasingly common in job postings across virtually every sector (Figure 1). However, the precise impacts on each sector remain uncertain given the novelty of these technologies. AI may lead to job polarization where jobs become more concentrated in high- and low-paying occupations because routine tasks that are most susceptible to AI are predominantly in jobs that pay in the middle of the income ladder. However, other recent research suggests that tools like ChatGPT can boost productivity with certain writing tasks and narrow the productivity gap between more and less experienced customer service workers, indicating that AI may provide skills to grow the middle class. Some more complex occupations are also exposed to AI tasks that involve detecting patterns, making judgments, and optimizing processes, such as clinical lab technicians, chemical engineers, optometrists, and power plant operators. Together this suggests that technological advances in AI will impact the labor market in complicated and uncertain ways.

AI job opportunities are not equally available, and AI threatens jobs held by women more.
The history of technological change, from the advent of the dishwasher to the introduction of the internet, shows that technological developments do not destroy overall employment; but they can render some roles obsolete while providing others with opportunities. A study by the International Monetary Fund done prior to the recent rapid improvements in AI technology found that 11% of jobs held by women were at risk of being automated by tools like artificial intelligence compared to 9% of jobs held by men. The most at-risk group is women with lower secondary education, 50% of whom are at risk for automation relative to less than 40% of men in this group. Broadly, less educated workers and those in small- and medium-size firms are most at risk for automation, underscoring the need for more learning and retraining. This analysis also found that accommodation and food services, retail trade, and transportation sectors are most exposed to risks of automation. The retail trade, accommodation, and food services sectors employ similar proportions of men and women, while men are overrepresented in the transportation sector. These high-level sectoral numbers cannot fully explain differences in male versus female risk to automation though because the job composition within a sector also matters. For example, women are more represented in education, and their roles within the education sector are also more at risk for automation.
Long-running disparities in the STEM training and education pipeline also mean that job opportunities in fast-growing AI occupations are not equally available. Less than 19% of all AI and computer science PhD graduates in North America over the last decade were women. Furthermore. only 2.4% and 3.2% of U.S.-resident AI PhD graduates in 2019 were African American and Hispanic, respectively. In 2020, Queer in AI showed that almost half of its survey respondents view the lack of inclusion in the field as a barrier, and more than 40% of members surveyed reported experiencing discrimination or harassment at school or work. These disparities justify the need for efforts to ensure that historically underrepresented groups in STEM are not left behind during this AI revolution.
AI tools can both overcome and, in some cases, magnify biases.
There have also been reports that AI algorithms in hiring processes are biased against women. This is because of the years of bias and discrimination that is present in the data that is perpetuated by the model. We must also account for contextual and cultural complexity because AI will impact the working lives of women differently in different cultures and labor markets. Many AI facial recognition systems demonstrate racial disparities, with early work illustrating this for black women.
Paralleling these concerns, AI tools also have the potential to address certain systematic biases. For example, they can mitigate the corporate gender gaps, particularly in leadership roles, that broadly mirror the STEM gap by removing bias in recruiting, reviews, and promotion decisions and improving retention of female employees. One study found that a machine learning algorithm could help judges make bail decisions, lowering both crime and jail rates, but many other studies have shown that AI may perpetuate racial bias in bail decisions.
AI tools can be misused to harm consumers and the American public.
Another risk is that malicious actors may use AI tools to defraud the public before adequate protections can be put in place. It is imperative that the U.S. works to ward off threats to democracy posed by data and election manipulation, including campaign deepfakes. The U.S. government should and indeed already has begun to address the important privacy concerns surrounding the use of Americans’ personal data and AI. . A recent uptick in financial scams using AI voice cloning technology to trick consumers prompted several U.S. Senators to send a letter  to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau urging action, and the Bureau has increased its focus on how AI technologies affect the financial marketplace. Recent proposed bipartisan legislation also aims to protect Americans’ data from unfriendly foreign nations. The bill would build upon federal government priorities to protect American health care records, geolocations, web browsing activity, and other information that malicious actors could use to harm American people and interests.
Public investment in American AI research and development infrastructure can improve the technology’s safety and development.
To bolster the United States’ role in the development of AI tools, the administration is making large investments in AI research and development (R&D). Because of the 2020 National AI Initiative Act championed by Senator Martin Heinrich and then Senator Rob Portman, in May 2023 the National Science Foundation (NSF) announced $140 million in funding for seven new National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes as part of a cohesive cross-government approach to address AI related opportunities and risks. The new AI Institutes will advance foundational AI research on ethical and trustworthy technologies and on innovations in cybersecurity, climate change, understanding the human brain, and enhancing education and public health – all while supporting the development of a diverse AI workforce. Public investments have continued to increase over the last several years to $3.2 billion in 2022 (see below), underscoring the continued growth in public sector involvement in AI.

The Department of Energy (DOE) has the capabilities and experience to provide leadership in developing responsible AI R&D frameworks and quantifying the risks from AI. DOE has proposed a new initiative to lead the nation and the world on trustworthy AI development: FASST, or Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence for Science, Security, and Technology for the Nation. In consultation with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), NSF has created a complementary roadmap for a National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) to enable the academic community to better utilize and expand AI within their own research. The recently introduced bipartisan CREATE AI Act of 2023 co-led by Senator Heinrich would authorize the NAIRR and help make this vital resource a reality. In addition to the academically-focused NAIRR, the federal government should explore ways to enable small and medium size firms to access, use, and interpret AI tools to prevent substantial consolidation among just a few technology firms.
The U.S. government should dramatically increase investments in AI education, reskilling, and training to prepare our workforce and shore up national security.
While the U.S. government has already made substantial investments in AI R&D and has outlined future goals, far less has been done to ensure that our workforce is ready to continue to support these efforts. For decades, the United States has been a magnet for AI talent – for example, the estimated hiring rate for AI workers in the US in 2020 was roughly double that in 2016. China’s growth rate over the same period was only 30%. However, other research points out that the United States is ahead in technology development but falling behind in people (STEM graduates and technology skill penetration), without which AI implementation will not be nearly as effective. The United States is particularly behind in the number of STEM graduates overall and in those that stay in the United States after graduating. For example, the limited number of skilled worker visas (H1B) makes it challenging both for highly educated workers to stay in the United States and for companies to focus operations here – with Canada and other countries capitalizing on this disincentive.
Educating, training, and reskilling to meet the new challenges of an AI-informed and augmented labor market will also become increasingly important to avoid job loss, especially for women and historically disadvantaged groups. Educating the future workforce to prepare people early on will be important – in particular, increased gender and racial equity efforts in STEM fields could help prevent certain groups from being left behind. Research conducted by the World Economic Forum and BCG showed that 95% of at-risk U.S. workers can be retrained for jobs that pay at or above what they make now and offer growth potential. Reskilling would be costly, but companies could profitably reskill 25% of their workforce – and 77% of workers could be retrained through government programs or incentives with a net cost benefit. Congress could aid these efforts by adopting tax policies that encourage companies to save costs by helping workers integrate technology into their jobs instead of replacing workers with technology.
Several policies options exist to propel our AI workforce forward to match our dominance on the technological side of the equation. The United States could leverage lessons learned from the space race during the Cold War. After the Soviet Union (USSR) launched the first crewed space flight, the United States government realized it needed to make substantial public investments in scientific education to close the gap with the USSR and promote national security. The National Science Foundation invested the equivalent of over $5 billion in teacher and classroom development, and Congress passed the National Defense Education Act to provide the equivalent of more than $10 billion for science education. Similarly, China’s emergence as a leader in AI should encourage the same “all hands on deck” national scale effort to maintain American leadership in AI through dramatically reinvigorated STEM education and workforce training efforts.
A multinational consortium approach could position the United States as an AI leader while providing the option to pool financial and human resources and share benefits across trusted allied countries. The United States has historically favored consortium approaches in dealing with cross-national issues like national security, such as with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The United States could lead such a group given the size of our economy, but working with others with AI expertise like Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada would complement and accelerate action.
Educating the U.S. population broadly on the future of AI in addition to growing the AI-specific workforce is essential for broader AI usage, understanding, and public support. While public awareness of AI surged with the advent of tools like ChatGPT, many misunderstandings still exist, and a public education campaign could provide a more balanced view. This educational campaign could lay the groundwork for a sense of urgency to support efforts to maintain American leadership in AI, much like what was done during the space race. On July 25, 2023, a tech trade group and lobbying network, TechNet, kicked off a $25 million education campaign to do just that and focus on the positive aspects of AI. Raising the profile of STEM work and education will help the United States maintain technical dominance in AI and provide well-paying jobs. Finally, closely evaluating possible international partners will enable the United States to build on others’ advances, quickly partner with allies for mutual benefit, and maintain our leadership in this space.
To maintain American leadership in AI, the federal government should work with technologists to establish a safe and ethical structure for AI development.
Given the immense role that AI technologies could play in the global economy, and the rapid recent developments, both the Administration and Congress have begun working through what role the federal government can and should play in this space. Technologists are also looking for structure and guidance from the government on safe and ethical AI development while maintaining their own competitiveness. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, went so far as to ask for government regulation of AI in a Senate hearing in May. A multi-stakeholder approach is thus necessary to engage with the government, private sector, technologists, and academia around key issues like data privacy, AI’s use in healthcare, and the need to foster skill-equalizing work environments for historically marginalized groups. The U.S. federal government should be at the forefront of coordinating a safe and ethical deployment of AI within the labor force and economy.
Governments themselves can leverage AI tools and their unique access to large datasets to make better policy decisions, especially during times of uncertainty. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has used AI tools to reduce taxpayer wait times, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have created AI competitions to predict health outcomes using Medicare data.
Training of AI systems and data storage needs can have substantial environmental impacts given the growing amount of energy, and resulting CO2-equivalent emissions, needed to power these tools. The U.S. government should encourage or incentivize developers and deployers to limit their climate impact. AI tools can also be used to optimize energy consumption across a range of sectors, which could prove essential to our energy and security missions. AI tools also fuel climate misinformation online, and government action to combat this is necessary.
Other vital and necessary work is also underway in the Administration and Congress to root out bias and promote equity and mitigate threats posed by AI to further solidify American leadership in safe AI deployment. On July 21, 2023, following pressure from the Biden Administration, seven leading AI companies agreed to voluntary safeguards on AI development – a first step in a regulatory and legal framework for this rapidly growing technology. These safeguards include testing products for security risks and marking products so that consumers can spot AI-generated material. In line with these efforts, the Administration has also put out a blueprint for an AI bill of rights focused on five principles: safe and effective systems, algorithmic discrimination protections, data privacy, notice and explanation, and human alternatives, consideration, and fallback. In February of this year, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies to root out bias and promote equity in the design and use of new technologies including AI.
Simultaneously, Congress has been ramping up efforts to understand AI and lay the groundwork for regulation. Senate and House bipartisan caucuses complement work done in the Administration and have taken leadership roles on organizing member and staff level briefings to increase AI literacy on Capitol Hill. Initial legislative proposals are currently underway.

How AI Is Expected to Impact Future Employment Trends

There has never been a period in history during which artificial intelligence (AI) has captured the world’s imagination as much as it has today. But with the sophistication of generative AI (GenAI) applications such as ChatGPT now expanding at a breathless pace, the fear that automated technology might soon take over large swathes of jobs has also become more palpable than ever. And while it might have been believed once upon a time that it was the lower-skilled, more repetitive work that was most at risk of being consigned to the dustbin of history by the AI revolution, the enormous advances in brainpower and human-like abilities of the latest AI applications mean that so-called “white collar” work is also looking increasingly vulnerable amidst a thorough disruption of the entire global labour market.
As this revolution gets into full swing, frequent analyses of just how impactful AI will be for the world of work are now coming to the fore. From an economic perspective, for example, Goldman Sachs expects AI to deliver 7 percent more (or almost $7 trillion) in global gross domestic product (GDP) and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period, whilst ushering in “sweeping changes” to the global economy. “Despite significant uncertainty around the potential for generative AI, its ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects,” Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani wrote in a report published on April 5.
The report also projects that this new wave of AI systems could have sizeable effects on global employment trends, with shifts in workflows triggered by these advances potentially exposing the equivalent of a staggering 300 million full-time jobs to automation. That said, not all of that automated work will translate into layoffs. “Although the impact of AI on the labor market is likely to be significant, most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI,” the authors noted. In the United States, for instance, the Goldman Sachs economists estimated that around two-thirds of occupations are exposed to at least some degree of AI automation, and that of those occupations, between one-quarter and one-half of their workloads could be replaced.
These are not concerns that can be filed away for the future. Rather, there is plenty of evidence that AI is already replacing jobs. On May 1, for example, IBM announced that it would pause its hiring for non-customer-facing roles that the tech giant believes could be replaced by AI over the coming years, which Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna said could amount to some 7,800 jobs. “There is no blanket hiring ‘pause’ in place. IBM is being deliberate and thoughtful in our hiring with a focus on revenue-generating roles, and we’re being very selective when filling jobs that don’t directly touch our clients or technology,” an IBM spokesperson told Business Insider. “We are actively hiring for thousands of positions right now.”
According to the non-partisan think tank Pew Research Center, 19 percent of American workers in 2022 were in the jobs most exposed to AI, in which the most important activities could be either replaced or assisted by AI; 23 percent of workers had jobs that were the least exposed to AI, in which the most important activities were farther from the reach of AI; and jobs with a high level of exposure to AI tended to be in higher-paying fields, in which college educations and analytical skills could be pluses. “AI is distinguished from past technologies that have come over the last 100-plus years,” Rakesh Kochhar, a senior researcher at Pew, said of the results. “It is reaching up from the factory floors into the office spaces where white-collar, higher-paid workers tend to be. Will it be a slow-moving force or a tsunami? That’s unknown.”
Ultimately, this trend may be determined by how quickly the latest generative AI applications, such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, evolve. “It is their ability to write text, compose music, and create digital art that has garnered headlines and persuaded consumers and households to experiment on their own,” noted McKinsey & Company’s latest research published in June, which estimated that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy across the 63 use cases the consulting firm analysed. “As a result, a broader set of stakeholders are grappling with generative AI’s impact on business and society but without much context to help them make sense of it.”
Such trends also raise deep philosophical questions over the nature, utility and value of human input versus machine input for delivering superior results. While this generation of generative AI has demonstrated impressive knowledge, it has also frequently delivered misleading or outright incorrect information, which underscores not only the imperfect nature of the current technology but also the vital importance of such human qualities as cognition, judgement and emotional intelligence that are required in many jobs to deliver not only the highest but also the most nuanced performances. “We have to think about these things as productivity-enhancing tools, as opposed to complete replacements,” Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, told Business Insider in June, adding that human judgement must be applied to these technologies to avoid error and bias.
Indeed, that “enhancing, not replacing” idea has significant implications for the nature of the labour market of the future, such that while millions of jobs may be lost due to AI, many millions more will be created in their places to support and complement the technologies of tomorrow. “The creation of new jobs resulting from the ability to create and deliver…new types of goods and services…ha[s] far outpaced the number of jobs displaced,” Steven Miller, professor emeritus of information systems at Singapore Management University (SMU), told CNBC in February. Dimitris Papanikolaou, a professor of finance at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, also noted that, as of now, people working alongside AI rather than being replaced by it is the likelier scenario. “There are far more opportunities for using AI for augmenting the work of human employees than for fully automating the work of humans,” Papanikolaou noted.
But such predictions are, understandably, doing little to allay ordinary workers’ fears over their future employment prospects. Perhaps most glaringly in the spotlight at present is the strike of Hollywood screenwriters and actors from the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and the Writers Guild of America (WGA). Many in the industry are concerned that stringent regulations are needed to prevent AI tools from replicating and diluting their control over their work, thus reducing their chances of earning a living.
“Artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions, and all actors and performers deserve contract language that protects them from having their identity and talent exploited without consent and pay,” SAG-AFTRA’s president, Fran Drescher, announced on July 15. Meanwhile, the WGA’s demands, issued on May 1, read: “AI can’t write or rewrite literary material; can’t be used as source material; and [works covered by union contracts] can’t be used to train AI.” In response, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP), which represents employers, said that its offers included an “AI proposal which protects performers’ digital likenesses, including a requirement for performers’ consent for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance”.
This strike provides a glimpse of what will likely come as AI makes inroads into virtually all industries. It also demonstrates workers’ anxieties over AI’s replicative nature and its possible impacts on hundreds of millions of lives in the future. Indeed, a July 28-30 survey of US consumers conducted by Canada-based polling firm Leger sought to understand their perspectives on the SAG-AFTRA strike and their broader concerns over AI related to their jobs. “63 percent of U.S. consumers think governments need to regulate AI to reduce the risk of it replacing human jobs, while 37 percent think AI will inevitably replace some human jobs, the market will adjust, and people will find new opportunities,” the survey found. “45 percent of U.S. consumers are concerned about AI replacing human workers in their line of work, while 29 percent are unconcerned. 19 percent are not looking for work/currently working, and 6 percent don’t know.” Seventy-three percent of US consumers also support including a disclaimer with all AI-generated content so that it is clearly identified.

The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Recent Customer Service Layoffs
As companies reduce their workforce with the integration of AI, we delve into the strategies that will shape the future of customer service

Suumit Shah, the founder and CEO of Indian startup Dukaan, recently announced on Twitter (now X) that the company laid off 90% of its support staff due to implementing an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer interactions. Similarly, in April, Dropbox, an industry leader in cloud-based solutions, declared a reduction in workforce by around 16%, laying off 500 employees. Co-founder and CEO Drew Houston attributed this decision to the impact of AI in a statement shared on the Dropbox blog.The new technology has prompted several businesses, from industry giants like Dropbox to startups like Dukaan, to rethink their workforce needs. But what impact will these moves have on the future of customer service talent and the adoption of AI and chatbots?The evolving landscape of customer serviceGartner analyst Uma Challa explains the dynamics of what we are witnessing in the customer service sector: “Companies are experimenting with virtual agent applications using the evolving GenAI technology in customer service and support. This is creating an incorrect perception that GenAI technology is capable of replacing all human agents,” he says.Challa argues that the impact on the human workforce might be slower than some fear. To MyCustomer, he says: “There are a lot of factors that will need to be considered for adopting the GenAI technology, such as what type of approach to take: public models, vendor products or custom models? Consider the cost, risk and complexity aspects of each approach.“What applications of GenAI technology will you prioritise? How are you going to manage the risks of using this technology, such as bias that can have a potential impact on the brand? How mature is your organisation’s data management that can be used to fine-tune the adopted GenAI models and products? What roles do you need to successfully adopt GenAI?“The organisations that have a good digital transformation strategy and can confidently answer the above questions are better suited to adopt and scale GenAI technology.”Adapting to the AI revolutionAs new technologies are integrated, there is a gradual shift in job responsibilities, and changes are introduced. “Some organisations will double down on the mantra of ‘do more with less’ where agents are augmented with GenAI technology to improve productivity,” Challa predicts. This change in strategy means that there will be fewer new agents hired while more investments will be made in technology.“Customer service agents should continue to learn how to work with the technology, as technology-driven work reconfiguration leads to agents requiring new or changed skills,” he continues.Young people fear AI will take their jobs



Strategic skills provider Corndel recently published research revealing the extent to which employees fear AI will take all or part of their jobs, with younger workers particularly worried.According to the report, 61% believe AI will take at least 25% of their role by 2033, with 38% of 18-34 year-olds fearing that AI will take at least 50% of their job in the next decade.The report highlights that workplace training and development ensures the data skills gap is closed, and organisations can make data-driven decisions to foster growth and competitiveness.Key statistics include:
92% of employees working with data think there is a skills gap in their workplace.
82% of employees have had no training in AI use.
Nearly half of senior decision-makers believe a lack of data skills is holding back their business transformation.
Younger employees are already acknowledging the risks of being left behind by technology.James Kelly, CEO and co-founder of Corndel, said: “Younger employees are already acknowledging the risks of being left behind by technology, which is shown in the large number of 18-34-year-olds who think their jobs are at risk from AI.“Only by implementing continuous skills development programs to support lifetime learning among employees, as well as investing in technology and data infrastructure, can organisations empower their employees to leverage tech and data knowledgeably, confidently and effectively, to fuel transformative change and drive successful performance.”Strategies for embracing AI in customer serviceUma Challa emphasises the need for a comprehensive strategy, advising service and support leaders to collaborate with other leaders in their organisation: “Especially with IT and control groups such as legal, compliance, risk, information security departments”.In the face of workforce reductions and the AI revolution, Challa’s advice for organisations revolves around talent management. “For successful digital transformation, talent is a critical requirement,” he says, highlighting the centrality of upskilling and reskilling. Embracing agile learning principles ensures employees remain adaptable and equipped for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. “Agile learning future-proofs employees, which, in turn, future-proofs the enterprise.”

Three in Four Americans Believe AI Will Reduce Jobs
by Stephanie Marken and Tara Nicola






Most Americans think artificial intelligence (AI) will negatively affect the U.S. job market, with 75% saying it will decrease the total number of jobs over the next 10 years. About one in five (19%) believe AI will not affect the number of jobs, while 6% say it will result in an increase in jobs.
U.S. adults with less than a bachelor’s degree are more likely than those with a bachelor’s degree or higher to say AI will decrease the number of jobs (80% vs. 68%, respectively). Younger Americans are less pessimistic than their older counterparts about AI, with two-thirds of adults aged 18 to 29 saying it will decrease the total number of jobs, compared with 72% of 30- to 44-year-olds, 79% of 45- to 59-year-olds, and 80% of those aged 60 and older.




Results for the Bentley-Gallup Business in Society study are based on web survey responses collected May 8-15, 2023, from 5,458 U.S. adults in Gallup’s nationally representative panel.

Majorities Say AI Performs Certain Tasks as Well as or Better Than Humans
While Americans are pessimistic about AI’s potential impact on the job market, they recognize the benefits AI could bring in some areas. In particular, majorities believe AI performs as well as or better than humans at customizing the content users see online (68%), recommending products or services to them (65%) and assisting students with coursework (60%).
Across all nine tasks included in the study, Americans are the least positive about AI’s ability to recommend which employees a company should hire, its self-driving capabilities and its ability to recommend medical advice. About two-thirds of Americans believe AI performs worse than humans on each of these tasks.




Most Americans Lack Trust That Businesses Will Use AI Responsibly
When asked how much they trust businesses to use AI responsibly, a majority of Americans, 79%, say “not much” or “not at all.” Another 21% report they trust businesses “a lot” or “some.”




Trust is consistently low across subgroups of the U.S. adult population, including by age, gender and race/ethnicity.
Few Think AI Does More Good Than Harm
Although many Americans think AI can perform as well as or better than humans in completing particular tasks, they are generally negative about the amount of harm it can cause. Forty percent of U.S. adults think AI does more harm than good, and half say it does equal amounts of harm and good. Just 10% of U.S. adults believe it contributes more good than harm.
Notably, Black and Asian Americans have a more positive view of AI's impact on society: 71% of Asian and 67% of Black adults say AI does more good than harm or equal amounts of harm and good, compared with 60% of Hispanic and 59% of White adults.




Implications
AI represents an unprecedented opportunity for businesses as they seek to evolve, become more efficient, and innovate in the products and services they offer customers. And yet, most Americans are wary about the overall impact of AI on the job market. Still, there are select tasks that U.S. adults believe AI can do as well as, if not better than, humans who have traditionally performed these tasks, suggesting consumers see a place for AI. This optimism is higher among younger people, who are more likely than their peers to believe in the future of AI.
Still, businesses have work to do to affirm their commitment to using this tool as a force for good in their internal processes and in connecting with their customers. It is important to keep in mind that artificial intelligence is still unknown to or misunderstood by many Americans. This knowledge deficit may explain the lack of confidence people have in using it for certain tasks and their lack of trust in businesses to use it responsibly.

Survey Methods


The Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Report is based on a Gallup Panel web survey completed by 5,458 U.S. adults, aged 18 and older, conducted May 8-15, 2023. The Gallup Panel is a probability-based longitudinal panel of U.S. adults whom Gallup selects using random-digit-dial phone interviews that cover landlines and cellphones. Gallup also uses address-based sampling methods to recruit Panel members. The Gallup Panel is not an opt-in panel. The sample for this study was weighted to be demographically representative of the U.S. adult population, using the most recent Current Population Survey figures. 
For results based on this sample, one can say that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1.8 percentage points at the 95% confidence level for response percentages around 50% and ±1.1 percentage points for response percentages around 10% or 90%, design effect included. Margins of error are higher for subsamples. 
In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.

How CrowdStrike Will Put Generative AI To Work In Cybersecurity

Long before any investors ever heard of OpenAI and ChatGPT, CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) made a name for itself in cybersecurity as an artificial intelligence trailblazer. Just the same, CRWD stock is getting a boost as the company integrates ""generative"" AI into its cybersecurity platform.

Joe Fahmy: Riding The Wave Of AI Stocks




At its Fal.Con customer conference, which runs Sept. 18-21, analysts expect CrowdStrike to unveil its ""Charlotte"" generative AI upgrade to its security operations center (SOC) services. Among the changes, customers will use a conversational user interface rather than a computer dashboard.
Also, CrowdStrike is expected to disclose its pricing strategy for the Charlotte tools.
At a Goldman Sachs conference on Sept. 5, CrowdStrike Chief Executive George Kurtz said generative AI will shake up the security industry.
""So I think when that's applied to security, people are going to be really excited and hooked on it and use it in ways that we hadn't even thought about,"" he said.
""When we think about Charlotte and why we're so excited about it — it's not like a side chatbot feature. It's actually a foundational platform service. What I mean by that is everything on the platform is consumed as a service, the way it runs technologically.""
He added: ""Where we see this going is to create what we call generative workflows, which is more of a conversation with Charlotte. So, in the morning you would come in and you'd say, OK, well, Charlotte, what are the latest threats that CrowdStrike knows about in the last 24 hours? What are the adversaries doing in my particular industry?""
Cybersecurity firms have used AI's pattern recognition capabilities for real-time analysis of data for over a decade. Founded by two former McAfee executives in 2011, CrowdStrike started out monitoring laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.
CRWD Stock: Predictive AI
In the endpoint market, older antivirus software looks for ""signatures"" of known malicious software. However, CrowdStrike's more advanced tools learn to identify malware traits rather than specific signatures. That enables them to detect new types of malware.
CrowdStrike utilizes a specialized database to analyze and correlate billions of events collected from customers in real time. CrowdStrike uses machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, in its products.
Just like machine learning can detect new types of malware using predictive models that classify data, ML algorithms have been used for making recommendations, pricing ads and services, detecting spam and fraud and many other applications.
Generative AI models, on the other hand, process ""prompts,"" such as internet search queries, that describe what a user wants to get. Generative AI technologies create text, images, video and computer programming code on their own. Industry-specific versions of generative AI are expected to use company data to train AI models.
In cybersecurity, companies expect generative AI tools to help reduce the time to detect and respond to many forms of computer hacking. Also, they see generative AI automating more functions in security operations centers to help companies deal with a shortage of software engineers.
Expanding From Endpoint Market
For CrowdStrike, serendipity may be at work. The arrival of generative AI comes as the company expands from roots in endpoint into cloud-based network monitoring tools and security vulnerability management services.
Further, CrowdStrike is building a broad, threat-detection cybersecurity platform. It's called XDR, or extended detection and response. It monitors endpoints as well as web/email gateways, web application firewalls and cloud business workloads.
CrowdStrike has been a share gainer in the identity security market. But it faces intensified competition from Microsoft (MSFT). Meanwhile, Microsoft sells multiple cybersecurity products to companies in discounted deals.
Also, Microsoft is leveraging generative AI with the launch of the Microsoft Security Copilot. Analysts say a marketing alliance with Dell Technologies (DELL) could help CrowdStrike compete versus Microsoft.
In addition, CrowdStrike competes with SentinelOne (S)and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). CrowdStrike is among many AI stocks to watch.
Sunnyvale, Calif.-based CrowdStrike's IPO in June 2019 raised $659 million.
CRWD Stock: July Quarter Results Beat
CrowdStrike earnings for its July quarter jumped 105% to 74 cents a share on an adjusted basis. Revenue, including acquisitions, climbed 37% to $731.6 million.
Analysts polled by FactSet had projected earnings of 56 cents a share on revenue of $724 million for the fiscal Q2 2024 period ended July 31.
A year earlier, the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based firm earned 36 cents a share on revenue of $535 million.
With CrowdStrike, Wall Street focuses on annual recurring revenue, or ARR, a key financial metric tied to subscription services growth. During the July quarter, ARR increased 37% to $2.93 billion. Analysts had predicted ARR of $2.92 billion.
For the current quarter ending in October, CrowdStrike predicted revenue of just under $777 million at the midpoint of its outlook. That edged by estimates of $774 million.
CRWD stock broke out of a consolidation in the wake of its Q2 earnings report. Shares are trading at 11-month highs.

A Bot Isn’t Going to Take Your Place, But AI Will Make Your Job Harder

by Jennifer L. Gaskin March 8, 2023

OpenAI’s splashy ChatGPT rollout has generated untold amounts of text, both directly and indirectly. While much of what’s been written so far has been about creative work, which some fear will be completely upended by ChatGPT, CCI’s copy chief, Jennifer L. Gaskin, looks at how generative AI tools will change the corporate integrity landscape.

<em>More than half of American employees are using generative <strong><a href=""https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AI</a></strong> tools at least occasionally to accomplish work-related tasks, according to a new survey by The Conference Board that found while a majority of workers are using these tools, few of their employers have mature organizational AI policies.</em>

</div>
The Conference Board <strong><a href=""https://www.conference-board.org/press/us-workers-and-generative-ai"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">survey</a></strong> of nearly 1,100 U.S. workers, predominantly office workers, found that while 56% of people are using these tools, only 26% say their employer has a policy related to the use of generative AI. Another 23% said such policy-making is in the works, though.

Here’s a closer look at the survey’s findings:
<h2>AI adoption &amp; supervision</h2>
In all, 56% of respondents are using generative <strong><a href=""https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/ai-revolution-fraud-investigations/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AI tools</a></strong> for work tasks.
<ul>
 	<li>31% report using generative AI on a frequent, regular basis — including daily (9%), weekly (17%) or monthly (5%).</li>
 	<li>25% say they are using generative AI occasionally.</li>
 	<li>44% have never used generative AI.</li>
</ul>
Among workers who’ve adopted generative AI, a large majority (71%) say their managers or organizations are aware of their usage.
<div class=""cci-promo""><center>[jnews_block_12 number_post=""1"" include_post=""44168"" included_only=""true"" excerpt_length=""54"" excerpt_ellipsis=""""]</center></div>
<h2>Use cases &amp; work quality</h2>
Workers are primarily using generative AI tools for basic, foundational <strong><a href=""https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/business-using-ai-2023/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tasks</a></strong> involving text.
<ul>
 	<li>Drafting written content (68%), brainstorming ideas (60%) and conducting background research (50%) are the most common use cases.</li>
 	<li>Far fewer respondents are using generative AI for quantitative and technical tasks, such as analyzing data and making forecasts (19%), generating/checking computer code (11%) or image recognition and generation (7%).</li>
</ul>
Most respondents believe the quality of AI output matches that of a seasoned human worker:
<ul>
 	<li>45% say quality is equal to an experienced worker.</li>
 	<li>31% say quality is equal to a novice worker.</li>
 	<li>10% say quality is equal to an expert worker.</li>
</ul>
“Generative Al is already delivering work product that meets or exceeds the quality of employees with years of experience — at least on specific tasks,” said Diana Scott, leader of The Conference Board’s human capital center. “At the same time, few people we surveyed foresee AI technology as a threat to replace their jobs entirely. Rather, they appear to be embracing AI as a solution for repetitive or tedious parts of their work, freeing up bandwidth for more productive and valuable uses of their time.”
<h2>Productivity &amp; job impact</h2>
Most respondents (63%) say generative AI tools have positively affected their productivity, but only a small fraction say AI has significantly improved their productivity.
<ul>
 	<li>7% report a significant increase in productivity.</li>
 	<li>56% report an increase.</li>
 	<li>36% report no impact.</li>
</ul>
Many workers foresee generative AI replacing elements of their job functions, but they largely see the impact as positive.
<ul>
 	<li>33% say AI will replace elements of their job in a positive way, such as by freeing up time for more valuable or creative tasks.</li>
 	<li>Just 4% foresee AI replacing parts of their work in a negative way, such as by threatening their job altogether.</li>
 	<li>24% do not expect AI to replace any element of their job.</li>
</ul>
<h2>AI policies</h2>
Most workers report that their organizations either don’t have a general policy related to the use of generative AI at work or are still developing one.
<ul>
 	<li>34% say their organization does not have an AI policy.</li>
 	<li>26% say their organization does have an AI policy.</li>
 	<li>23% say a policy is under development.</li>
 	<li>17% don’t know.</li>
</ul>

Will AI take my job? Will it slash my earnings potential? Will AI affect my future career prospects as a lawyer? Will it reduce advancement opportunities for junior lawyers? What will my industry even look like a decade from now? The latter question was posed in a survey to participants in a new Thomson Reuters report, Future of Professionals Report: How AI is the Catalyst for Transforming Every Aspect of Work. Respondents were asked how they would feel if a time traveler from 2033 appeared to tell them that AI had become ubiquitous within their profession. Naturally, there was concern: one in ten compared the scenario to a “zombie apocalypse.” But interestingly, more respondents said that the scenario was akin to winning the lottery. The most common position was “cautiously positive.” Being cautiously positive is a good attitude for lawyers to take when assessing AI’s future impact. More than two-thirds of professionals surveyed (67%) by Thomson Reuters predicted that the emergence of generative AI will either be a transformational or a high-impact change to their industries over the next five years. With such transformation comes opportunity—potentially great opportunity. Consider AI as a means to better employ your skills and talents as a lawyer, and to improve your prospects at your law firm. If AI eliminates much time-consuming work that’s been an inescapable part of the legal industry, lawyers can shine brighter than ever before.  Future of Professionals Report1,200 professionals were surveyed across North America, South America and the UK. Read what they predict will be the biggest impacts on their businesses in the next five years.Read report What does the growth or job outlook for lawyers look like?There are many positive scenarios following the mass adoption of AI in the legal industry, including: Honing your skills Instead of regarding AI as a threat, lawyers should consider its potential as a liberator. With AI able to quickly conduct large-scale data analysis, perform legal administrative duties, and analyze and summarize documents used in due diligence, a lawyer is freed from time-consuming and nonremunerative (indeed, often non-billable) work. Lawyers instead can turn their focus to expanding their billable workload. Many law firms lose revenue in write-offs due to inefficiencies within their practice. A savvy lawyer could use AI to recapture revenue for their firm, helping to reduce a firm’s cost centers, and finding ways to add value to existing client relationships. The latter could be as simple as upgrading client/lawyer communications, for example. After all, many lawyers find it much easier to revise a document than to write one from scratch. Now they don’t have to. Using AI to generate a host of templates and standardized documents, a lawyer quickly chooses one (selecting a level of readability, whether layman or professional), then revises and personalizes it. This eliminates the “first draft” phase and quickly gets the document into a client’s hands.   New paths for legal careers AI will open up new career horizons in the legal industry and alter current career trajectories. The implications for junior lawyers are immense. Mass AI usage may shift the bulk of more remedial tasks from professionals who have education/professional credentials (JDs, CPAs, etc.) to employees who don’t have professional licensure.  As the Thomson Reuters report notes, “As automation and AI solutions make completing traditional legal tasks easier, it could become more appropriate for such tasks to be completed by a paralegal or more junior professional. Using this tactic at scale could potentially increase the profit margin, enabling alternative and cheaper ways of becoming a fee-generator in the firm.” This opens opportunities for entry-level legal professionals to find niches within their law firm, whether as a legal tech consultant or a junior lawyer charged with supervising AI systems conducting billing, for example. It also means that advancing within a law firm may be less of a step-by-step trudge upward, with many repetitive workloads. Instead, advancement may become a flexible, client-centered process, one that better rewards initiative by junior lawyers.  The birth of new jobs AI is likely to create a host of new legal jobs, as firms will need lawyers to specialize in AI in numerous ways. These include training, consultation, and keeping AI in compliance with state, federal, and global regulations, all of which may be in flux for years to come. AI intermediaries: One area with growth potential is a freelance model in which professionals with specialized expertise (such as in fintech) advise both in-house and private practice clients on AI issues.  Cross-border regulatory advisors: Many new roles will be needed at the multinational or international organizational level. Firms will need lawyers responsible for harmonizing the AI regulatory landscape across various jurisdictions.Next-generation staff managers: As AI evolves within law firms, the nature of management will change. There could be even more remote employees and the growth of subgroups within a law firm (the “firm within a firm” model) that specialize in particular client types. Having skilled, flexible supervisors who are able to keep track of all these moving parts will be essential.  Training and development advisory: A large area of consensus in the Thomson Reuters report is the importance of AI training. Almost 90% of professionals surveyed said they expected to see mandatory AI training for all employees over the next five years. And over two-thirds surveyed said they expect changes in how junior professionals are trained to incorporate AI, starting at the university level. Such transformation will require a large pool of advisors and instructors. AI: Changing the outlook So, how will AI affect your prospects as a lawyer? You will need to come up with your own action plans for the next few years. Look to capitalize on growth opportunities and try to minimize any professional limitations. Let’s safely predict that the 2030s won’t be a zombie apocalypse. But the world will be different. If you believe that legal work won’t be greatly transformed, your prospects in the industry will dim. As the report notes, “generative AI will not replace highly trained lawyers and accountants, but a lawyer or accountant using generative AI will certainly replace one who isn’t using the technology.” It’s simple enough advice: don’t be among the latter. Read the full report, “Future of Professionals: How AI is the catalyst for transforming every aspect of work.”  Chris O’Leary is a freelance writer and editor based in western Massachusetts.

BOSTON -- Generative AI may be the buzzword of 2023, but the excitement about the technology may also have some fearing that their jobs are in jeopardy.







Tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Dalle-E 2 can write code, take exams, write essays and create dramatic images. Their existence seems to some like a science fiction movie portraying a future that is doomed for employees in certain industries, especially creatives.

AI anxiety
This form of dread is problematic for some enterprises that find it challenging to convince their employees to use generative AI tools and large language models.
Some AI users raised this question on Wednesday at the Generative AI World conference here.
During a presentation about a new generative AI tool called Writable -- based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 generative AI system -- that helps teachers grade essays, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt executive Steven Chambers said that while the tool helps teachers save time, there's still a lot of anxiety about it.
Some teachers may worry that the tool will reduce the need for their input and eliminate some parts of their jobs.
""There's a very specific AI anxiety,"" said Chambers, who is the strategic advisor to the publishing company's CEO. ""It's a real state of confusion. We have encountered a lot of fear.""
The fear teachers encounter is akin to the anxiety some in customer service and marketing may also experience. They may feel the technology could push them out of their jobs.
""People are a little paralyzed in terms of how to educate themselves around it,"" said Katrina Klier, senior strategy manager at Sage Strategy Group, a business consultancy, in an interview.
Stories in the media about workforce disruptions due to generative AI also contribute to employees' wariness about the technology, she added.

A presentation on an AI essay grading tool shows the fear that some may have around generative AI.







Calming the fear
Therefore, it is up to senior managers and others in charge to combat the fears.
""Managers have a responsibility to give their employees kind of some space and grace,"" Klier said, adding that managers might have to coach or guide their employees so they want to use the tools.

For Chambers' team, fear about generative AI tools such as Writable led to professional development training for teachers.
""That's not new to teachers -- getting professional development on how to work with a new pedagogy, a new set of curricular resources,"" Chambers said in an interview.
""You lead with the specific relevance of the product,"" he continued. ""It all boils down to making it relevant to solve a problem they have and demystify AI as a result.""
Sometimes, the key to countering skepticism is for members of senior management to immerse themselves in the technology.
""It starts with leadership,"" said Paul Baier, CEO of AI analyst and advisory firm GAI Insights, in an interview with TechTarget Editorial. ""This is not a side project. It's got to come from top down. ""
Also, employees must be given a clear policy on how to use the technology. Finally, he added that organizations should listen to employees' ideas.
For Klier, employees skeptical about generative AI tools should know the technology is aimed at being successful, not eliminating jobs.
""Success will favor the curious, success favors the open-minded and success favor the prudent risk takers,"" she said.

A variety of generative AI training courses have been fueled by the success of ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and Google Gemini. They run the gamut from understanding technologies such as large language models and generative adversarial networks to prompt engineering and solving business problems. Many of these generative AI (GenAI) courses are aimed at helping developers create AI applications. Others focus more on business users looking to apply the new technology across the enterprise.







""The best training resources drive adoption and understanding,"" said Dwarak Sri, global head of AI at BlueCloud, an AI and cloud consultancy. One option is to look for generative AI training resources that provide concrete examples, including practical situations where AI has made a real impact in solving business problems. These resources might also showcase success stories directly related to different industries, as real-world scenarios can help drive home the benefits of adopting AI.
It's also helpful to investigate resources with a problem-solving angle. These might present AI as a solution to specific challenges that business users often face. Sri finds that visuals are critical, and the best programs use diagrams and interactive demos to help business professionals see how AI operates and its value.
Enterprises might also want to provide training and support to employees through workshops that help them get the hang of using AI tools and platforms. ""Interactive lectures presented by industry experts can lead to insightful group discussions and learning materials that users can explore at their own pace,"" Sri said.

Various methods of generative AI training
It's important to consider the various modalities of generative AI training resources. Sri said the most common training methods include in-person workshops and seminars, which are highly interactive and provide immediate feedback and networking opportunities. Online courses let users choose when and where to study, but they require self-discipline and might lack personal interaction.
In addition, video tutorials and webinars let users pause, rewind and review material as often as needed. ""However, video tutorials are only sometimes up to date and lack real-time feedback,"" Sri said. He recommends a blended learning approach that combines various techniques to achieve a well-rounded experience, such as an online course paired with an in-person workshop.
AArete, a global management and technology consulting firm, uses the acronym FOCUS to balance all aspects of learning about generative AI, according to Priya Iragavarapu, vice president of data science and analytics. The FOCUS acronym stands for the following:

Fundamentals. Users need to understand basic AI concepts, terminologies and types, and where those technologies can be used.
Operational integration. Business users must learn how to incorporate AI into existing workflows, processes and decision-making structures within the business.
Compliance and ethics. Business users don't need to be AI experts, but they do need enough information on data privacy, ethical considerations and responsible AI use to operate within best practice guidelines.
User-centric applications. Business users must consider how AI can improve customer experience, enhance employee productivity and solve specific business challenges. They need to have enough context to pursue AI opportunities while keeping users in mind.
Sustained development. AI training is a continuous need. Look for bite-sized training snippets to learn the same concept in multiple ways to boost understanding.



GenAI course recommendations from AI leaders
While it's helpful to learn what the new technology can do, it's equally important to learn about AI's challenges and limitations, such as bias, AI hallucinations, data leakage and new security vulnerabilities. ""The key is helping business users understand what AI can and cannot do so they can avoid being oversold or starting projects with a low likelihood of success,"" said Josh Koenig, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Pantheon.
Here are 10 of the top generative AI courses and training resources recommended by AI leaders.
1. Class Central
Class Central is a learning content aggregation directory with courses from numerous universities and institutions, as well as more than 80 providers. It currently includes more than 2,700 free courses on generative AI and another 1,900 paid courses that come with a certificate upon completion. It's a good place to start when seeking guidance on tools such as ChatGPT, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. There are also longer programs that let users develop a broader understanding of GenAI capabilities, opportunities, use cases and responsible use within the enterprise.
2. Coursera
The Coursera platform provides hundreds of generative AI training courses for free or a small fee. Some courses even provide a shareable certificate that can be added to a LinkedIn profile.

There are also thousands of deeper dives into select topics, including the practical aspects of using generative AI for data science, mastering new tools and discovering new business use cases.





The future of training resources
The technologies and uses of generative AI are rapidly evolving. Sri expects that different training modes, interactivity and content will evolve as the technology becomes more accessible. Tutorials will become more interactive and provide step-by-step guidance and feedback in real time. Businesses will increasingly create virtual environments, known as sandboxes, where users can experiment with generative AI models without the risk of affecting real-world systems. This will provide a safe space where users can refine their skills and test various scenarios.
Sri believes that training content will incorporate more real-world use cases relevant to various industries as GenAI evolves. Ethics and bias education will also be more significant. Businesses will need to focus on educating users about responsible AI usage, data privacy and ways to mitigate unintended consequences. Generative AI will also lead to more dynamic content generation of personalized examples, exercises and scenarios that align with users' learning objectives and skill levels.

As we move further into the age of disruption, the advancing field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing industries across the world. Many discussions are centered around the widespread fear of job loss; but, as seen with previous revolutions, some of these concerns may be exaggerated. To keep pace with the changing landscape, the responsibility falls on the government and companies to aid the workforce with skill training that can better prepare them for the coming advancements. According to McKinsey, robots could potentially replace 800 million jobs by 2020. However, with the right training, the workforce can embrace this advancement rather than fear it.
Currently, most companies have already integrated a digital component to various roles and, if they have not, they are preparing to. Therefore, the future of work has changed dramatically over the past 50 years.  Automation and AI are the key components of change as they begin to permeate diverse industries from healthcare to transportation. Rather than just affecting one type of position, both traditional blue and white-collar jobs are affected by this transition and thus, the need for a systemic shift in education and regulatory policies are required to continue to support the workforce.
Indian Initiatives Driving Change
In India, due to the unique nature of the tech-dominated workforce, the issue of upskilling workers for an AI-driven world is of paramount importance. The United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) India Skills Report 2018 demonstrates that 46 percent of college graduates place AI as a crucial next-generation technology where they should have considerable focus. In line with these findings, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has also revised the curriculum for four-year undergraduate programs. AICTE is now recommending mandatory inductions for AI, robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) for the 2018-19 academic year to make future engineers more employable.
The National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) has also launched a comprehensive platform called Futureskills to draw attention to eight key technologies poised for tremendous growth in the coming decade. These technologies are primed to deliver 55 different job roles and corresponding skills including AI, Virtual Reality, RPA, IoT, Big Data Analytics, 3D Printing, Cloud Computing and Social and Mobile.

To contend with the advancements in technology, the new key objective must be to revamp institutions and prepare the workforce for the AI revolution. As seen throughout history, several inventions have transformed the workforce and AI is just another building block in our continued path to enlightenment. The workforce is still determining how to respond to the contemporary skill upgrade that AI is driving. Instead of the common fear that AI will replace jobs, it is clear that this advancement will not only transform the workforce but, in turn, create new job opportunities. This survey by Capgemini states that four out of five companies have created new positions in relation to deploying AI-based systems.
Obtaining the right kind of training is critical for those in and preparing to enter the workforce. Companies who currently employ AI have transitioned from traditional hiring methods to skill-based recruitment techniques, and as more organizations adopt AI, this expansion will only continue. Traditional qualifiers such as experience may take a secondary role to the skills possessed by potential candidates as organizations hire for these new fields. Preparing the workforce with relevant skills is no longer an optional endeavor but the standard.
To stay ahead of AI in an automated world, the workforce needs to focus on some core skills that machines may never replicate. While AI can run through databanks and generate new insights, humanity is innately driven to explore, find new ways to solve problems and imagine new opportunities. Abilities like creativity, imagination, empathy, critical thinking, ethics and more are the qualities we should be increasingly attentive to. Commonly known as “soft skills,” these skills are now more essential than ever and are only dubbed such because they cannot be quantitatively measured. In a machine-driven world, these qualities will become even more important because any activity that AI undertakes must somehow fit inside the value systems driven by humans. We cannot and should not prevent AI from becoming more powerful, but at the same time, we must focus further on the skills that separate us from it.
This report by MIT Review says that five key skills will become increasingly important:  

Judgment and decision-making
Fluency of ideas
Active learning
Learning strategies
Originality

It is now more obvious than ever that organizations must look at AI and similar technologies to stay competitive and generate additional value. Mapping this goal with specific scenarios of skills and workers is a journey that every organization needs to invest in and continually advance. Identifying skills and adaptations of skills-forecasting models are essential for this process and will greatly help maintain the supply and demand of the 21st century workforce.
Drawing Inspiration From the Brightest
There is much that India can learn from the insights of other countries by drawing upon that inspiration and making it our own. We must realize that preparing future generations for the jobs of the future is essential and deserves all the resources and attention we can afford. Driving collaborative problem solving should be a key focus area at all education levels. According to the World Economic Forum, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea are currently the most advanced in this area and we should be learning all we can from their successful models. As AI turns to more cognitive tasks, workers with the best non-cognitive skills will have increasingly important roles to play and we should encourage and invest in those qualities.
This World Economic Forum Future of Jobs report 2016 argues that by 2020, “Creativity will become one of the top three skills workers will need. With the avalanche of new products, new technologies and new ways of working, employees are going to have to become more creative in order to benefit from these changes.” In addition, the report goes on to state that 35 percent of core skills will change between 2015 and 2020: We should be doing all we can to prepare our workforce in these changing times. We have a challenge ahead of us with the advancement of AI and we can either skill up and advance alongside it or scramble to keep up afterward - the choice is in our hands.

Best Practices to Guide Employee Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools

Artificial intelligence (AI) has captured our imaginations for decades. Blockbuster hits like The Terminator and The Matrix series have driven home fears of computers becoming sentient and seeking to eradicate or enslave the human race.




Beyond Science Fiction: AI Impacts Become Reality
More recently, however, concerns over AI have been more mundane and practical, and those concerns are typically focused on AI’s impact on human labor. There have long been concerns over whether and to what extent AI will render humans obsolete in different industries, for example.



But AI has the potential not only to replace human labor but also to complement human labor, resulting in significant productivity boosts. AI, including tools like generative AI chatbots, has the ability to answer a wide range of employee questions, create high-quality written and visual content, and even engage with customers.

	



This has many employees asking themselves: “If my employer can benefit from replacing me with AI, why shouldn’t I use AI to perform my work myself?” In other words, what’s wrong with employees using AI to perform their work for them?



In many, if not most, cases, there shouldn’t be any ethical concern with such an approach. However, it’s important to put certain ground rules in place to protect business interests and ensure appropriate use of these rapidly emerging tools.



Transparency
One of the most prominent concerns over the use of AI is transparency around the authenticity and source of AI-generated content. Was this content created by a human employee over several hours, or was it created by an AI chatbot in 15 seconds? How should that impact how that work is paid for and how much?



Similarly, businesses also need to be transparent with their employees when it comes to how the use of AI may impact their work and, ultimately, their careers.



“HR should strive for transparency and create a culture of openness in how AI algorithms and decision-making processes work,” advises Young Pham, the Cofounder and Senior HR Manager at BizReport. “Employees should be informed as early as possible about the decision to use AI in HR and given a clear explanation of how it affects their current employment and future decisions about their work.”



Protection of IP and Confidentiality
Many AI chatbots involve creating prompts. This might mean a user entering a one-sentence question or entering a lengthy report and asking the chatbot to summarize its content.



But what happens to the information entered into the prompt?



It’s important that users understand the implications of entering customer data, company financial information, or other sensitive material into a third-party AI chatbot.



Certain laws, regulations, or contractual obligations with customers may have rules around how that information is used and whether and how it can be shared with third parties, including providers of AI chatbots.



Ownership
Another key issue in the use of AI chatbots at work has to do with the concept of ownership. We’re not talking about ownership in the sense of legal ownership of intellectual property created by or entered into an AI tool; we’re talking about the concept of taking responsibility for the product of AI-assisted work.



This means that even if AI is a key contributor to a given work product (or even the sole creator), the employee or team using that work product is still responsible for it.



A great example to illustrate this point comes in the legal context. A New York attorney recently found himself in hot water for submitting court filings that cited bogus legal authorities. The source of this infraction was apparently the lawyer’s use of an AI chatbot to create the filing.



When AI is used to help create work products for human employees, those human employees are still responsible for ensuring the end result is accurate and doesn’t plagiarize work from others. The lawyer in the example above could have easily looked up the case references created by his AI tool and discover they didn’t exist. Similarly, there are a number of free plagiarism tools available online.



Those who choose to leverage AI in their work have no excuse for bad output.



The Role of HR
AI and AI chatbots are obviously very tech-focused tools, but it’s not just the IT team that needs to be well-versed in their operation and use. The HR function also has a critical role when it comes to the use of AI by employees and by the employer.



“When new AI technology is introduced, it is important for HR to communicate guidelines around its use in a timely, clear, and consistent manner—managing the people side of the implementation,” says Amani Gharib, PhD, Director of HR Research and Advisory Services at McLean & Company.



“HR can also support through feedback and output review, as well as ensure that policies are relevant and in compliance with local and global laws and regulations,” Gharib adds. “By conducting risk assessments and creating policies around AI technology, HR will be able to manage ethical risks and considerations accordingly. It is also just as important for organizations to build resilience and manage the disruption of AI through effective change management and transformational leadership.”



Early concerns over AI in the workplace focused on AI taking jobs from human workers. While AI can replace a human worker entirely, in practice, there are perhaps more situations in which AI—in its various forms—will augment the work human employees are doing. While this collaboration can create tremendous productivity gains, it also raises a variety of ethical concerns for both employers and employees.



It’s therefore essential for the HR team to have a central role in managing the rules and processes around the use of AI in the workplace and for HR leaders to stay on top of rapidly changing trends related to the use of generative AI and other tools.

Generative AI is changing how people work, complete assignments, date, and create.
But the massive computer systems powering AI consume vast amounts of water and emit tons of carbon.
Even with green initiatives by big companies, the scale of the impact is expected to increase.

We're beginning to see how generative AI, like ChatGPT and Bard, are taking the workforce by storm — but a more significant impact is brewing as we adapt to more widespread adoption of the technology, environmentalists warn.Insider previously reported AI is like a tidal wave prepared to crash over the economy, eliminating more jobs than we yet realize. And while the tech has far-reaching implications in academia, our dating lives, and how we create art, the massive computer systems and server farms needed to power AI contribute to the climate crisis through massive emissions and vast amounts of water consumption.

The information and communication technology industry, once lauded as a green example compared to significant sectors like agriculture and construction, uses up to 10% of the world's electricity and emits between 2 and 5% of the world's global carbon, according to statistics shared by the European Parliament.That amount is expected to rise to 14% of global emissions by 2040, according to research published in the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society.

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts have calculated that the amount of energy used to train large AI models equates to roughly 626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide — the equivalent of approximately 300 round-trip flights between San Francisco and New York and almost five times the total emissions of the average car in its lifetime.Though AI has been lauded as a possible solution to climate concerns, with the UN's 2023 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change claiming the tech will ""increase energy efficiency"" and ""promote the adoption"" of renewable energy, the industry has yet to contend with its actual impact to the environment.

Insider previously reported ChatGPT consumes a water bottle's worth of fresh water for every 20 to 50 prompts it is given because cooling water is flushed over hard-working servers to keep them at temperatures low enough to function.When Insider asked ChatGPT about its own carbon footprint, the chatbot was indirect, replying that its impact ""would be limited to the energy consumption of the computers and servers used to run me and process requests. The exact carbon footprint would depend on factors such as the energy sources used to power the computers and the efficiency of the data centers.""

Though some major tech companies have rolled out green initiatives to combat their impact on the environment – such as Google's goal to replenish 120% of the water it consumes and Microsoft's aim to be carbon neutral by 2030 – critics argue their actions amount to creative marketing and aren't enough to combat the real impact on the climate and environment.""There has been this long and concerted effort by the tech industry to make digital innovation seem compatible with sustainability,"" Adrienne Russell, co-director of the Center for Journalism, Media, and Democracy at the University of Washington, previously told Insider. ""And it's just not.""

Companies in all these sectors harness AI/ML for critical functions such as fraud detection, risk evaluation, algorithmic trading, and for deployment of AI-powered customer service chatbots, Garisa said.As per data provided by foundit, roles in demand include machine learning engineer, data scientist, AI/ML infrastructure engineer, network optimisation specialist, cybersecurity expert, and AI/ML solution architect.“From predictive analytics and maintenance to RPA, automated customer service, network optimisation and fraud detection, AI/ML professionals fulfil a host of business needs in the evolving telecommunication segment,” said Sachin Alug, chief executive of staffing firm NLB Services.Some estimates said recruitment in AI/ML across telcos has witnessed a quarter-on-quarter growth of nearly 12-15%.Telcos led by Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have ramped up focus on AI/ML, especially with the rollout of next generation 5G services since last October.“Roles comprising skills such as Java, cloud and security have seen an upward growth trajectory in Airtel while Jio on the other hand has more openings in data engineering and machine learning,” foundit’s Garisa said.At this year’s annual general meeting, Jio’s parent Reliance Industries said it is augmenting its workforce in AI/ML profiles to build India-specific solutions in the area. Jio Platforms, holding company of Jio, already has AI/ML departments across different functions like edtech, healthcare, entertainment, and internet of things (IoT).Vodafone Idea has mapped AI/ML skills with the specific roles and is enabling employees to learn through online courses, massive open online courses certifications and immersive learning opportunities, it said in response to ET queries.

Companies in all these sectors harness AI/ML for critical functions such as fraud detection, risk evaluation, algorithmic trading, and for deployment of AI-powered customer service chatbots, Garisa said.As per data provided by foundit, roles in demand include machine learning engineer, data scientist, AI/ML infrastructure engineer, network optimisation specialist, cybersecurity expert, and AI/ML solution architect.“From predictive analytics and maintenance to RPA, automated customer service, network optimisation and fraud detection, AI/ML professionals fulfil a host of business needs in the evolving telecommunication segment,” said Sachin Alug, chief executive of staffing firm NLB Services.Some estimates said recruitment in AI/ML across telcos has witnessed a quarter-on-quarter growth of nearly 12-15%.Telcos led by Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have ramped up focus on AI/ML, especially with the rollout of next generation 5G services since last October.“Roles comprising skills such as Java, cloud and security have seen an upward growth trajectory in Airtel while Jio on the other hand has more openings in data engineering and machine learning,” foundit’s Garisa said.At this year’s annual general meeting, Jio’s parent Reliance Industries said it is augmenting its workforce in AI/ML profiles to build India-specific solutions in the area. Jio Platforms, holding company of Jio, already has AI/ML departments across different functions like edtech, healthcare, entertainment, and internet of things (IoT).Vodafone Idea has mapped AI/ML skills with the specific roles and is enabling employees to learn through online courses, massive open online courses certifications and immersive learning opportunities, it said in response to ET queries.

This group, consisting of 65% Millennials and Gen Z members, with 72% currently employed, stands out for their confidence and trust in the technology.Nearly 60% of these users believe they are well on their way to mastering generative AI, and a significant 70% of Gen Z users have embraced the technology, with 52% expressing trust in its capacity to support informed decision-making. Notably, 52% of users have reported an increase in their usage of generative AI since their initial exposure, showcasing their commitment to its integration into their daily lives. OpenAI and ChatGPT logos are seen in this illustration taken, February 3, 2023 (credit: REUTERS/DADO RUVIC/ILLUSTRATION)In stark contrast, non-users displayed a distinct lack of engagement and skepticism towards generative AI. The majority of non-users, comprising 68%, belong to the Gen X or Baby Boomer generations. A striking 88% of non-users admitted to being unclear about how generative AI would impact their lives. Furthermore, 40% of non-users cited a lack of familiarity with the technology, while 32% deemed it as not useful for their needs, reflecting their hesitancy to embrace this emerging technology.It&amp;rsquo;s like ketchup, use it on anythingLooking ahead, generative AI users are actively exploring various use cases, with a strong emphasis on integrating the technology into their work environments. An impressive 75% of users expressed their desire to automate tasks at work and use generative AI for work-related communications.Additionally, 38% of users utilize generative AI for leisure purposes, while 34% employ it for self-guided learning on topics of personal interest. The importance of enhanced safety and security in generative AI technology was emphasized by 62% of users, highlighting a growing concern in this aspect.Conversely, non-users are seeking improvements and education before fully embracing generative AI. A substantial 70% of non-users expressed their willingness to engage more with generative AI if they had a better understanding of the technology. Safety and security remain paramount, with 64% of non-users stressing the need for enhanced measures in generative AI. AdvertisementMoreover, 45% of non-users would consider increased adoption if generative AI seamlessly integrated with the technology they already use, underlining the importance of a smooth transition into this technology-driven future.Blazing fast adoptionThe outcome of Salesforce&amp;rsquo;s survey underscores the remarkable growth in generative AI adoption while highlighting the clear divide that still exists among potential users. As generative AI continues to evolve, the key to widespread adoption lies in addressing concerns related to safety, security, and education, enabling more individuals to harness the full potential of this transformative technology.&amp;ldquo;This data shows just how quickly generative AI usage has taken off in less than a year,&amp;rdquo; remarked Clara Shih, the CEO of Salesforce AI. &amp;ldquo;In my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen a technology get adopted this fast. Now, for AI to truly transform how people live and work, organizations must develop AI that is rooted in trust and easily accessible for everyone to do more enjoyable, productive work.&amp;rdquo;",,,JPOST,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2017, the UAE launched its National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2031, which aims to put the nation at the forefront of AI innovation in different sectors, an initiative considered the first of its kind regionally and globally.We see this enthusiasm about AI reflected in the UAE&rsquo;s workforce as a little over half (54%) are already using AI in their job, with 41% trying out AI tools like ChatGPT. The possibilities of AI at work are endlessThe lack of knowledge about AI is not stopping UAE professionals from wanting to experiment with it. Although 30% of them say they have not been provided with any formal AI training from their employer, over half (59%) want to learn more, even if they don&rsquo;t know where to start. It is clear that UAE professionals are optimistic about the potential AI can bring to their careers, with an overwhelming majority (98%) saying they are excited to use AI in their work, and a similar percentage (97%) who believe it will help their career progression in some way. Most are already thinking of ways AI can help them be more productive with 82% envisioning AI to improve their work-life balance. Over a third (67%) plan to use AI to say goodbye to boring work tasks and assist in answering questions they&rsquo;re too embarrassed to ask their colleagues, and 63% have progression on their mind as they plan to use it for career advice. We also know that more needs to be done to educate professionals on how to use AI as 45% of them feel their colleagues know more about AI than they do, 48% have even admitted to pretending they know more about AI to look &lsquo;in the know&rsquo; in front of teammates.Pairing soft skills with AI skills essential for the future Overall, the mood of the nation is one of embracing AI and people are focusing on the skills they believe will complement AI the most, which comes as no surprise as the UAE was one of the first countries to adopt AI.Professionals in the UAE believe interpersonal skills such as problem-solving (66%), time-management (69%), resilience and strategic thinking (67%) will become even more important as AI grows in prominence.With LinkedIn's data showing a significant 21-fold increase in global, English-language job listings mentioning AI technologies, including Chat GPT, since November 2022, embracing AI could be a pivotal move for those seeking career development.Ali Matar, EMEA Growth Markets Leader and Head of LinkedIn MENA, says: &ldquo;Just as we&rsquo;ve moved past the pandemic, once again professionals are adapting to another wave of change as generative AI becomes more prominent in the workplace. In a country as technologically progressive as the UAE, where a move towards innovation and integrating new technologies has long been apparent, it is encouraging to see that also its people are embracing the shift. Even more so, our data clearly shows that workers in the UAE are focusing on the many benefits AI can bring to their working lives, including more time to focus on the work they care about and helping with career progression.It&rsquo;s also clear that people are eager to learn more about AI and we&rsquo;re seeing a significant increase in conversations on LinkedIn with members already adding AI skills to their profiles, but our data also highlights the enormous value of soft skills as humans learn to partner with AI&ndash; and this is what is now shaping the future of work.&rdquo;Top tipsWhether you&rsquo;re AI-advanced or eager to learn, taking the plunge can help you in your career and job, and LinkedIn&rsquo;s Career Expert Najat Abdelhadi shares some advice to get you started: Learn the lingo: Having the language to talk about and understand AI will put you ahead of the curve. Study up on popular AI skills with resources like LinkedIn Learning where you can find the most popular AI courses unlocked for free until the end of the year. A good place to start is with How to Research and Write using generative AI, and What is generative AI and you can find the full list here.Embrace the experts and tap into your network: Reach out to your network to share learnings and stay up to speed on AI by following thought leaders and subject matter experts on LinkedIn, including Allie Miller and Greg Coquillo.Sharpen up your soft skills: Don&rsquo;t underestimate the value of highlighting your soft skills in a world being reshaped by AI. LinkedIn&rsquo;s AI at Work report shows a staggering 25% shift in the skills demanded by various global jobs since 2015. And with AI accelerating these shifts, people can expect a swifter transformation, with the skills required for many jobs to evolve by at least 65% by 2030. The top skills anticipated to be most in demand: problem solving, strategic thinking and time management.Take advantage of existing tools: Use AI tools already available to you on LinkedIn including collaborative articles &mdash; knowledge topics published by LinkedIn with insights and perspectives added by the LinkedIn community. These articles begin as AI-powered conversation starters, developed with our editorial team. Next, with the help of LinkedIn's Skills Graph, the team connects each article with subject experts who contribute with their advice and insights. Microsoft&rsquo;s WorkLab Guides also give helpful tips from how to use AI to dominate your task list to how to make in-person time count for your team.Acknowledge your AI worries: It&rsquo;s okay to feel a little nervous or overwhelmed with new technology! People felt similarly when the internet was introduced and it&rsquo;s important to remember that these changes don&rsquo;t happen overnight. These are long-term changes and you can do the work to be part of the change, not just be impacted by the change of AI.Source: Zawya(Press Release) ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,emea@ethrworld.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",,,,,,

Hearing Wrap Up: Federal Government Use of Artificial Intelligence Poses Promise, Peril









Share via Email



WASHINGTON—The Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation held a hearing titled, “How are Federal Agencies Harnessing Artificial Intelligence?” Members asked witnesses about the federal government’s current and planned use of artificial intelligence (AI), and discussed risks associated with the widespread integration of AI into various operations of the federal government. Members inquired as to how the government is preparing to safeguard against those risks, including potential violations of the civil liberties and privacy rights of citizens.
Key Takeaways:
Artificial Intelligence, if harnessed correctly, creates an opportunity for federal agencies to better achieve their mission.

Dr. Arati Prabhakar—Director of White House Office of Science and Technology Policy—spoke on the importance of the work being done within federal agencies to harness the capabilities of AI: “Our work is only becoming more important as AI’s capabilities advance, especially as AI is increasingly integrated into society. This is the moment for our government to take bold and decisive action, so that America can continue to lead the world in harnessing AI to do big things in ways that strengthen our values. I look forward to working with you to realize this tremendous opportunity.”

The federal government must responsibly govern its use of AI systems, and it must do so with appropriate oversight and accountability.

Dr. Craig Martell— Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer at the Department of Defense— discussed the need for proper oversight tools to be in place to safeguard national security interests from AI and to use AI to our nation’s advantage over adversaries: “AI-based technologies can help take advantage of opportunities and improve our capabilities and effectiveness. However, they also pose significant challenges and risks that require careful oversight, management, governance, and accountability. DoD is committed to developing and deploying AI technologies in a manner that upholds our Constitution, laws, policies, and values. We will lead in the global AI field thanks to our democratic principles, not in spite of them.”

The Biden Administration is delinquent in complying with laws and regulations intended to facilitate the appropriate use of AI by federal agencies. The Subcommittee has and will continue to lead and press for action on this issue.

Eric Hysen—Chief Information Officer at the Department of Homeland Security—emphasized the role of Congress – including this Committee — in establishing the authorities and responsibilities under which federal agencies will incorporate AI into their operations: “As the Chief Information Officer for DHS, I understand that this technological transformation requires growth and adaption within my role and the DHS IT community, as I apply authorities often authored or shaped from this Subcommittee and full Committee, such as the Clinger-Cohen Act, the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act. DHS looks to become a leader in the interagency as we confront this opportunity, but that will only be possible with continued support and leadership from Congress, especially this Subcommittee.

Member Highlights: Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation Chairwoman Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) pressed for answers why the Office of Management and Budget is two years late in issuing AI guidance to agencies after a White House witness insisted the guidance is an urgent priority.

Rep. Mace: “OMB is more than two years late in complying with a Congressional mandate to give federal agencies guidance on the acquisition and use of AI, the law requires OMB to coordinate with your office in drafting that guidance. Why is the process stalled? When can we expect to see some guidance?”
Dr. Prabhakar: “The Office of Management and Budget is working in a very focused manner on what they clearly understand is an important priority.”  
Rep. Mace: “Two years late?” 
Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-N.C.) spoke on the need for transparency as the federal government implements AI across federal agencies and concerns that criminals will be able to harness AI for nefarious purposes.

Rep. Langworthy: “Do you agree that the public has right to know for what purposes AI is being used by the federal agencies and that it’s important that these inventories are done consistently, completely and accurately, and will you pledge to work to continue to work to ensure that is the case?”
Dr. Prabhakar: “I share your focus on the value of those use cases for all the reasons that you mentioned, it’s important for the public to know, across government, for people to understand how AI is being used. There’s important progress that we are making and we will continue to make as a federal government on those AI use cases.”
Rep. Langworthy: “Mr. Hysen, are you concerned that as AI systems become more mature and complicated that criminals will have greater opportunity to commit heinous crimes…”
Mr. Hysen: “We absolutely are concerned there, however we are also looking to harness AI to combat those crimes.” Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.) discussed the national security application of AI and how our national security apparatus perceives AI’s monolithic nature.
Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.) discussed the national security application of AI and how our national security apparatus perceives AI’s monolithic nature. 

Rep. Timmons: “Can we talk about possible uses of AI within either DOD or our adversaries’ military capabilities?”
Mr. Martell: “AI is not monolithic, when we say AI what we really mean is a specific AI based technology, or a specific statistically based technology. It’s important to differentiate that because we may be doing really well for one use case and very poorly in another and that may be so for our adversaries as well. If we focus mostly on AI as a monolithic thing, if we have it we win, if they have it we lose, then we are actually missing where we should be aiming our attention at. Particular activities that we want to deliver and particular capabilities that we want to defend against.”

And, most recently, that includes reaping the benefits of step changes in generative AI. Take London-based VC firm Moonfire. Late last year, the early-stage firm was trying to improve one of the machine-learning-based tools it uses to identify promising companies. One engineer made the model 5% better after three months of work — a result partner Mike Arpaia called “awesome”. Then large language model (LLM) GPT-4 was released in March this year. In a single afternoon, the same engineer improved the model by a further 20%. Advertisement“GPT-4 was really the step change in model performance…we’re entering an industrial revolution,” says Arpaia. A number of investors tell Sifted that they’re beginning to explore sourcing and classifying deals using generative AI models, as more powerful models have become widely available and easily accessible.How VCs are using generative AIInvestors say that there’s a key difference between the rise of generative AI and previous developments in data-driven deal sourcing. Generative AI refers to a class of deep learning models that are exceptionally good at generating and understanding content such as text and images. “There’s been a shift in VCs engaging with AI, as access has been democratised,” says Arpaia. “Before you needed to be a linear algebra expert to do deep learning at that scale reliably, but now all you need is an OpenAI key.” New models like GPT-4 are helping VCs cut down on hours of laborious work classifying startups in their internal databases. Episode 1 has a proprietary data platform that sources 300-400 potential investments — from a number of places like Companies House, LinkedIn and GitHub — each week and has begun to use generative AI models to quickly classify them. “We invest in B2B software companies, so we can ask a generative pre-trained transformer model [ChatGPT-like software] to filter out the ones that are in our scope,” Adam Shuaib, principal at Episode 1 tells Sifted. “Without that tech, I would have to spend five or six hours manually going through 400 descriptions…this wouldn’t have been possible a year ago.”Blossom Capital has built a model that generates a one-pager about a company with details such as founder background and employee growth. It‘s planning on adding more generative AI features over the next 12 months, such as factoring in details like who owns shares, company job posts, customers and competitors.  Classifying startups using generative AI models “is definitely going to be a core part of how we source deals,” says Imran Ghory, partner at Blossom Capital and backer of Checkout.com and Pigment— and it’s hiring data scientists as it looks to double down on the tech.Making analysts 10x fasterPan-European investor Speedinvest, too, has recently onboarded an engineer  — the first it’s hired specifically to work on the tech — to build generative AI tools for its investment team. The VC is working on a tool that can assess founders based on attributes like previous experience and education.AdvertisementThis is more challenging because of how much more nuanced the question of a founders’ experience is than the sector of a startup, says Florian Obst, principal at Speedinvest. Hallucinations can happen even when asking generative models simple things, let alone the complex matter of what makes a top founder. “It’s a less forgiving exercise because we don’t want to miss out on good deals or focus on bad ones,” he adds.Speedinvest hopes to roll out more advanced models to its investment teams towards the end of this year. “The idea is to make every analyst 10 times faster than before,” Obst tells Sifted.While Obst says that extra efficiency will mean analysts can spend more time focusing on the “people side” of investing, others think automation means jobs could take a hit.“You might find that the bigger funds at Series B and C might not need as many analysts or associates because a lot of that manual work can be done very easily and effectively by generative AI models,” says Episode 1’s Shuaib.The future generative AI in VCVCs using generative AI are careful about positioning the tech as something that will change the fundamentals of the business.“VC is an industry where you can make good money in a number of ways, and it’s not absolutely necessary for VCs to have AI-driven company and founder evaluation,” says Arpaia. While Moonfire has “pinned its efficiencies” to emerging tech like generative AI, a number of bigger funds might not be so quick to buy into it, he adds. “You don’t need to see all of the world to make 12 good investments each year.”And some VCs will continue to focus on getting dealflow through their network, says Obst. While VCs like Speedinvest that cover multiple geographies will need to use tech like generative AI to source deals, “a lot of deals are still done between people where they don’t even hit the market”, he adds.Even some of the most sophisticated data-driven, deal-sourcing VCs aren’t convinced by the power of generative AI models just yet.Swedish VC EQT Ventures’ internal data and machine learning platform, Motherbrain, is run by a team of 25 people. It scrapes huge amounts of data online and suggests companies that investors should investigate.“We’re not actually using generative AI — if you define generative AI as generating new content based on existing content,” says partner Lars Jörnow. While he doesn’t rule out integrating LLMs like GPT-4 into EQT’s models in the future, they aren’t as good at burrowing down into granular data as Motherbrain’s machine-learning models at the moment, Jörnow adds. And there are worries that filtering startups based on AI models could further entrench the wildly uneven fundraising landscape in VC. “A dumb AI model might look at the European unicorns, see that founders are typically white and went to Cambridge University and try to find more with those attributes,” says Blossom’s Ghory. There are a number of cases where generative AI tools have been found to double down on biases. But, on the flip side, well-trained models could help to identify founders who normally wouldn’t be on a VC’s radar, he adds. “But you can also train AI models to focus on the things that really matter, like if a company is winning great customers or making great hires. It could mean that companies who might not be on your radar have an easier time finding funding.”",https://schema.org,Organization,https://sifted.eu,"['https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/07174520/moonfire-2023-team-53.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1367&amp;q=75&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=compress,format']","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kai Nicol-Schwarz', 'url': 'https://sifted.eu/author/kai-nicol-schwarz'}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Sifted', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/25141406/Sifted-1A.png?w=2000&amp;h=443&amp;q=75&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=compress,format'}}",Will generative AI revolutionise the way VCs find deals? | Sifted,,2023-09-11T09:00:42+00:00,,Sifted,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://sifted.eu/articles/will-generative-ai-revolutionise-the-way-vcs-find-deals'}",,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/siftedeu/', 'https://twitter.com/siftedeu', 'https://uk.linkedin.com/company/siftedeu', 'https://www.instagram.com/siftedeu/']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, we have seen artificial intelligence (AI) developing rapidly. The profound implications for areas such as art, politics, work and education are now becoming apparent, leading to a heated public debate about the best ways to harness the benefits of this new technology while mitigating the risks. In this Q&A with Maayan Arad, Giulia Gentile discusses how AI is transforming our judicial system and the impact this may have on public perceptions of justice.

Which aspects of AI development have you focused on? 
My research explores the tensions between the advancement of AI in the management of the State and public values. I have been focusing on two areas in particular. First, I am investigating the impact of AI on the legal field and in particular on judicial systems. I’m currently leading a project on the challenges related to, on the one hand, the introduction of AI tools in courts systems, and, on the other hand, compliance with the rule of law in the EU.
Second, I am coordinating a collaborative research project funded by the EU Commission together with Orla Lynskey on the protection of public values in privately digitised public services. In recent years, several public services, such as justice or education, have been digitised through forms of public-private collaborations. Could these partnerships be liable to deprive public services of their “publicness”, by subtly subjecting them to private interests? How can we ensure that this cooperation does not undermine public values, such as transparency and accountability? Our research ultimately aims to identify the safeguards that should exist to ensure that public-private cooperation in the digitisation of the State respects public values.
What have been your key findings?
A first finding is that, due to the bias that is intrinsic in data, and, by reflection, in AI systems, there’s no guarantee that AI-assisted courts, or other aspects of the administration of the State, will be compliant with fundamental values such as judicial independence, non-discrimination and ultimately the rule of law.
A second finding is that the increasing use of AI in the public administration, and particularly in court systems, is inevitably transforming the role and the public perception of State authority in society. If judges are no longer purely human but AI-enhanced, for example, their function and social standing will inevitably change. These technological transformations are likely to affect public trust in the State, especially in courts. The introduction of AI in the courtroom could undermine some of the foundations of the administration of justice.
In what ways is AI currently being used in the legal profession and in the courts?
Law firms are increasingly using algorithms to draft contracts or skeleton arguments for litigation. AI also helps speed up due diligence and e-discovery exercises (an automated process that classifies the relevance of evidence in the context of litigation).
When it comes to courts, AI has been employed at different stages of judicial proceedings. In the pre-trial phase, AI can be used, for instance, to guide the parties of a litigation in submitting their claim, or to automatically distribute workload to judges. AI could be further applied in the deliberative phase for research support or to produce a skeleton judgment.
Who is responsible at the moment for creating these tools? 
That’s a very good question: because of the far-reaching effects of AI on the delivery of public services and, more generally, on our democracies, the “who”, “how”, and “why” questions become topical. However, currently, the media and the public at large are not particularly concerned with the creators of AI tools used in the public field.
In the UK, the development of technologies for courts has occurred through public-private partnerships. Public procurement rules were used to identify the partners of the UK government in delivering these technological innovations. An example is the Money Claim Online system that was developed in cooperation with a private company, Kainos. Yet the public procurement framework focuses essentially on value for money. The provider that better matches the requirements of the tender at the lowest price will be selected. The same rules are likely to be used for the introduction of AI tools in UK courts. Should we radically transform our public services and interactions with the state in areas so crucial for our democracy, such as the administration of justice, by merely assessing value for money? Certainly, keeping the costs of digitisation and AI tools low is important to avoid excessive spending. But giving absolute prevalence to the value of the transaction over public values, such as fairness, non-discrimination, transparency and accessibility, ultimately undermines the pedigree of our democratic system.
Should we radically transform our public services and interactions with the state in areas so crucial for our democracy, such as the administration of justice, by merely assessing value for money?
Even more problematic from the angle of compliance with public values are the more informal kinds of cooperation between the state and private entities. For instance, during the pandemic, Google for Education provided its products to several schools in the UK. As a result of this cooperation, pupils’ data is processed by Google software, which now shapes the learning experience of thousands of children across the UK. Google’s offer of these services was not subject to any specific procedures or safeguards and, accordingly, public accountability appears reduced.
Under both scenarios, there was no careful assessment by the government or other public bodies on the implications of these technological developments on public services and values. Accordingly, the recent examples of public-private cooperation used to digitise public services in the UK appear to hinder foundational principles such as non-discrimination, fairness and accessibility. Undermining the public nature of these services has adverse effects for UK democracy: it risks worsening poverty and inequality in UK society, while consolidating the market power of digital services providers, and threatens fundamental rights. To counteract this, I aim to devise a legal framework that can better embed public values in public-private collaborations in the digitisation of the State.
As this technology becomes more advanced, how do you expect it will change the nature of courts and how they function?
Any transformation brings novelties but also losses. Similarly, introducing algorithms in judicial systems will reshape courts in the sense that they may become more efficient. But inevitably “something” else will be lost. We need to assess the new dynamics and implications that AI technology will introduce in the justice system.
To begin with, we can observe a loss of “humanness”. Traditionally, parties of a litigation are confronted with a human judge, an individual who can empathise with the parties’ problems while interpreting legal rules to solve the pending matter. When the adjudicator becomes a robot, an AI entity, the shared “humanness” among the actors of the litigation goes missing. The absence of humanness could influence the authority and the constitutional standing that courts have in society. An algorithm might be seen as less or more authoritative or empathetic than a human depending on the context. One might imagine that systems affected by a backlog of cases of minor importance might benefit from a speedier resolution of disputes through algorithms. But where algorithms are used to solve cases that directly impact fundamental rights, this may cause more concern.
In China, for example, relatively simple claims are already being decided through algorithms. But in the case of criminal or constitutional cases, knowing that the ultimate authority on the litigation will be a robot inevitably makes a difference. How would you feel knowing that your liberty may be limited by an AI entity?

How might these changes redefine the role that emotions and other innately human characteristics play in judicial processes and decision-making in court? Could removing this element reduce biases and discrimination or might it have more negative effects? 
This question goes to the heart of the conundrum of courts’ digitisation. AI could be a potential panacea for the psychological factors and especially the bias problem that shape litigation. If a judge, for example, has a certain preference, whether political or simply personal, towards certain parties, certain arguments, or certain interpretations of the law, he or she may be unconsciously biased, and in extreme cases judicial impartiality would be affected. The question of how to manage the psychology of judges is very complex. There are several rules already in place designed to measure and assess whether judges are independent and impartial, and the law provides safeguards to ensure diversity and inclusivity among the judicial benches. AI could be seen as a solution to the potential judicial biases by providing more reliable, mathematical input in the courtroom.
AI could exacerbate biases and potential inequalities in the interpretation of the law because of its exponential nature.
But that’s where the conundrum comes in. The reality is that AI systems are in themselves biased. This is because AI relies on data produced by humans, which is imbued with human preferences and inclinations. Data reflects pre-existing biases. So the alleged solution to potential biases in the mind of a judge may not be effective after all. On the contrary, AI could exacerbate biases and potential inequalities in the interpretation of the law because of its exponential nature. So using AI to make judicial decision-making more neutral may not be the right way forward.
How can we make sure that AI isn’t used in a destructive way now that it’s becoming more sophisticated and powerful?
The answer to this question is regulation. We need to regulate as soon as possible before AI reaches a level of advancement that could seriously undermine not only the job market, but also some very essential aspects of our society, such as a free press, access to the internet and the right to be informed. If AI is used to manipulate public information and create fake news, good, reasonable governance may become virtually impossible.
Additionally, we should reflect on which values should guide the use of AI, and which usages of this technology should be permitted because they benefit society at large.
Prohibition of certain uses of AI could be a possible way forward, for instance, by singling out in which fields AI should be prohibited because of the potential excessive risks to human and democratic values.
I am pleased that the UK government recently acknowledged, for the first time, that AI bears very serious risks. And I very much hope that this will lead to rules that have regulatory bite in the UK.

AI to replace 2.4 million jobs in the US by 2030, many fewer than other forms of automation

It's not all bad news. Poets are safe. And machines will take some jobs no human wants




Katyanna Quach                                



Wed 6 Sep 2023                                     // 
23:59 UTC                                



































Generative AI will replace 2.4 million US jobs by 2030, and influence another eleven million, but other forms of automation will cost more jobs, according to a report from analyst firm Forrester.
The firm’s 2023 Generative AI Jobs Impact Forecast [paywall] predicts that the tech will reshape more jobs than it replaces, but also includes a section titled “Let’s Be Clear: Generative AI Is Coming After White Collar Jobs”.
White collar workers most at risk of being left behind will be technical writers, social science research assistants, proofreaders, copywriters, and those in administrative positions.







The biggest disruptions will be felt by workers that have college degrees, perform white-collar jobs, and are middle class. People with annual salaries less than $60,000, for example, will be impacted less by generative AI than those that earn $90,000 or more. Here's a chart below showing how much different types of jobs can expect to be influenced by technology:














Such workers have a couple of years in which to prepare, Forrester’s analysts suggest, because its modelling assumes it will take time for “questions on intellectual property rights, copyright, plagiarism, model refresh rates, model bias, ethics, and model response reliability” to be resolved.







The report also predicts that while generative AI will cost jobs, other forms of automation will have a greater impact. In 2023, the report predicts, generative AI will cause 9.3 percent of jobs lost to automation, rising to 30.4 percent by 2030.
Not every job replaced by automation is a job lost to humans, the report asserts, because humans don’t want certain jobs.
“In some cases, automation will stand in for jobs that have been hard to fill,” the report states. “For instance, physical robotics and automation are only beginning to fill the workforce gaps that have plagued frontline work in the 2020s.”


But other jobs will impact humans and Forrester’s analysts warn of “deep social challenges like those faced in the post-industrial Rust Belt.”

Creative types: meet your robot assistant
Forrester’s analysts reckon that workers in more creative industries, like editors, writers, authors and poets, and lyricists, are more likely to incorporate generative AI tools in their jobs and are less likely to be replaced.
Forrester urged leaders to figure out how to use generative AI in a way that will boost worker productivity and improve customer outcomes, and outlined a few roadblocks that might stand in the way.
Despite the technology's potential, it may actually lead to poor performance. Analysts highlighted that tools like ChatGPT can generate ""coherent nonsense"" that could lead to inconsistent customer service or lead to workers having to fix issues.
There will also be a gap in people's skills. ""[Companies will] need to hire new, potentially scarce, and expensive talent — developers, business analysts, prompt engineers, even ethicists. The market for this talent will be tight. On the other side, you might lose valuable legacy talent if the pace of change is too fast,"" they warned.
In some cases, automating some tasks could lead to substandard outcomes but companies might be pressured to stick with AI anyway. To incorporate generative AI in operations smoothly, companies should analyze which jobs would benefit the most from automation and train employees to learn new skills like prompt engineering, a technique that involves refining input prompts to software with the goal of obtaining specific outcomes.
""[Enterprises] won't be able to plan for every contingency, but [they] can build a workforce generative AI strategy that better prepares [them] for the Wild West of generative AI at work. [Their] strategy should include investments, guardrails, and checkpoints,"" the report concluded.
The Register has asked Forrester for more comment. ® Sponsored: Why sustainability matters more than ever to telcos

The rise of artificial intelligence has created growing excitement and much debate about its potential to revolutionize entire industries. At its best, AI could improve medical diagnosis, identify potential national security threats more quickly, and solve crimes. But there are also significant concerns—in areas including education, intellectual property, and privacy.
Today’s WatchBlog post looks at our recent work on how Generative AI systems (for example, ChatGPT and Bard) and other forms of AI have the potential to provide new capabilities, but require responsible oversight.

The promise and perils of current AI use
Our recent work has looked at three major areas of AI advancement.
Generative AI systems can create text (apps like ChatGPT and Bard, for example), images, audio, video, and other content when prompted by a user. These growing capabilities could be used in a variety of fields such as education, government, law, and entertainment. As of early 2023, some emerging generative AI systems had reached more than 100 million users. Advanced chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation tools are examples of generative AI systems in widespread use. As news headlines indicate, this technology continues to gain global attention for its benefits. But there are concerns too, such as how it could be used to replicate work from authors and artists, generate code for more effective cyberattacks, and even help produce new chemical warfare compounds, among other things. Our recent Spotlight on Generative AI takes a deeper look at how this technology works.
Machine learning is a second application of AI growing in use. This technology is being used in fields that require advanced imagery analysis, from medical diagnostics to military intelligence. In a report last year, we looked at how machine learning was used to assist the medical diagnostic process. It can be used to identify hidden or complex patterns in data, detect diseases earlier and improve treatments. We found that benefits include more consistent analysis of medical data, and increased access to care, particularly for underserved populations.  However, our work looked at limitations and bias in data used to develop AI tools that can reduce their safety and effectiveness and contribute to inequalities for certain patient populations.
Facial recognition is another type of AI technology that has shown both promises and perils in its use. Law enforcement—federal, as well as state and local—have used facial recognition technology to support criminal investigations and video surveillance. It is also used at ports of entry to match travelers to their passports. While this technology can be used to identify potential criminals more quickly, or those who may not have been identified without it, our work has also found some concerns with its use. Despite improvements, inaccuracies and bias in some facial recognition systems could result in more frequent misidentification for certain demographics. There are also concerns about whether the technology violates individuals’ personal privacy.

Ensuring accountability and mitigating the risks of AI use 
As AI use continues its rapid expansion, how can we mitigate the risks and ensure these systems are working appropriately for all?
Appropriate oversight will be critical to ensuring AI technologies remain effective, and keep our data safeguarded. We developed an AI Accountability Framework to help Congress address the complexities, risks, and societal consequences of emerging AI technologies. Our framework lays out key practices to help ensure accountability and responsible AI use by federal agencies and other entities involved in the design, development, deployment, and continuous monitoring of AI systems. It is built around four principles—governance, data, performance, and monitoring—which provide structures and processes to manage, operate, and oversee the implementation of AI systems.
AI technologies have enormous potential for good, but much of their power comes from their ability to outperform human abilities and comprehension. From commercial products to strategic competition among world powers, AI is poised to have a dramatic influence on both daily life and global events. This makes accountability critical to its application, and the framework can be employed to ensure that humans run the system—not the other way around.

How the education sector can safeguard students using generative AI

 September 6, 2023   



Image: @Vertigo3d | iStock
The emergence of free-to-access generative AI programmes has the potential to transform the classroom in ways we’re only beginning to understand, how can we protect students from the dangers of AI
The internet, perhaps the last major technological innovation that’s comparable to AI, changed the way that students communicate, work, and access information. But tools like ChatGPT appear to be doing much more than that. They’re changing the way that students live, work, and interact with technology every day.
Just as with the internet, it’s difficult to predict now what this technology may lead to in a decade’s time. What is clear is students have been very quick to utilise these tools to support their school work. Recently commissioned research from RM Technology reveals that over two thirds of school students are using the technology frequently, with some using it to solve mathematics problems, write English essays, translate texts in foreign languages, and more.
Despite the huge opportunities AI tools offer, many students are also struggling with its rapid introduction into their education.This is an aspect of the technology that too few are talking about. And we’ll need to do exactly that if we’re to guide children towards using the technology efficiently and safely, and protect them from the dangers which come from others misusing AI.
Ultimately, anyone with a stable internet connection and a computer is now able to produce harmful multimedia content, which could have a severe impact on a student’s wellbeing.
Providing ‘safety rails’ is key  
While the majority of school children are using AI to help with their school work, its popularisation has also increased their anxiety about education. Seventy per cent are now worrying that they’ll struggle in exams without the support of AI tools. Although 68% of students say they are now achieving better grades since they started using it, at least half of those children are experiencing guilt about doing so.
It’s clear that there’s a significant lack of guidelines for the use of AI in schools. Definite ‘safety rails’ that describe effective practice could help to dispel anxiety and reduce guilt. They would ensure that, in whatever way students use AI, it will not hamper their potential in exams.
Introducing effective safety rails, though, is going to present a considerable challenge to the sector. The technology is advancing at a pace that regulators struggle to match. The Online Safety Bill now passing through the House of Lords may soon be outdated.
Legislation and guidance take time and experience to draft. With AI, we have little of either.
The public and private sectors need to come together to ensure that schoolchildren in the UK are protected from the potential harms of this new technology.
Parents and teachers must be equipped so they can work together to safeguard students 
Government regulation will, without a doubt, prove crucial in guiding students’ use of AI in schools. Nevertheless, other stakeholders will need to play their part, since effective regulation remains a faint reality at some point in the distant future.
That’s where teachers come in. Yet, it can be difficult without any guidance or training for teachers to effectively guide students’ use of AI. Indeed, just over a third of teachers believe that students have a better understanding of AI than they do.
Schools must work with their technology partners to implement comprehensive training plans that cover every aspect of the use of AI, both in the classroom and outside it. Teachers must be equipped with the knowledge to decide how and where it is appropriate and beneficial, and how to spot when a student is misusing AI.
Safeguarding outside the classroom
Outside the classroom, it becomes difficult for teachers to guide and protect their students while they use AI. But parents will play an important role, since teachers can only do so much once a child has left the classroom.
Communication between parents and teachers is therefore vital if students are to be safeguarded outside the classroom. Informative material around the schools policy on the use of AI and how parents can safeguard their children is a great example of how schools can work with parents to ensure students continue to have a safe experience with AI outside the classroom.
It is clear that the education sector needs to introduce guidelines for students’ use of AI – and quickly. What we must also recognise is that government regulation may take a long time before it can offer that guidance and protection. Teachers, parents, and the private all have an important role to play. And through effective training and collaboration, they can ensure children can continue to learn in a safe and productive environment.

75% of people who use generative AI use it for work and 70% of Gen Z uses new generative AI technologies, according to a new 4,000-person survey by Salesforce, which has been integrating AI into its products for years. Also found: 68% of those who haven’t tried generative AI are Gen X or boomers.


“There’s a generative AI divide,” says Salesforce senior director of product marketing Kelly Eliyahu. “49% of the population has used it, and 51% has never used it.”

Generative AI has been around for a long time, with generative models dating back as far as 1972, according to Intel AI expert Ilke Demir. But it has burst onto the popular consciousness with the emergence of OpenAI with ChatGPT and visual creations from technologies like Creative Diffusion, MidJourney, and Adobe Firefly.

Apparently, more for some people than others.

For those who use the new technology, a third use it every day, Eliyahu says, while the rest use it weekly or more. Most are looking to automate work tasks, while about a third use it for fun, and a third use generative AI for learning about topics that interest them.
PROMOTED
The generative AI divide is largely a generational divide. Non-believers tend to be older and more cautious around new technology. 68% of non-users are Gen X or baby boomers, and almost nine out of 10 non-users don’t see how generative AI will impact their life, and 40% says they aren’t familiar with the technology. That’s unfortunate, because that means that the oldest people in the population—who are most vulnerable to non-online shopping scams—don’t understand existing uses of deepfakes created with generative AI for financial and political scams. Another third of non-users say the technology is not useful for them
Those who use generative AI, however, see plenty of benefits:


46%: saves time
42%: easy to use
37%: fun to use
35%: teaches new things
32%: helps with complex concepts
29%: help make decisions quicker
28%: helps make more informed decisions
28%: keeps me more organized
26%: provides inspiration
22%: helps me succeed at work

According to the survey, people would use generative AI more if it was more secure and safe, if they understood it better and knew more about how to use it, and if it was integrated into the technology they already use. People who do use generative AI mostly say it’s improved even as they’ve been using it and almost 90% say the results of generative AI models have met or exceeded their expectations.

White Collar Workers: AI is Coming For Your Job The AI takeover may not be as bad as once feared — unless you’re working a white-collar job — according to a new report by IT research company Forrester.The company’s 2023 Generative AI Impact Forecast predicts that 2.4 million US jobs will be replaced by 2030, a dwarfed figure in comparison to the 300 million full-time jobs that Goldman Sachs forecasted would be lost to automation in April of this year.However, those on salaries of $90,000 or more will be bearing the brunt of AI much more than those on lower incomes due to the high automation potential of professional tasks.🔎 Want to browse the web privately? 🌎 Or appear as if you're in another country?Get a huge 86% off Surfshark with this special tech.co offer.

Source: forrester.comForrester’s latest findings don’t come as a major surprise, with mounds of previous research highlighting the impact AI will have on many white-collar workers. Yet, with the research company likening the deep social challenges that may result to those experienced in the postindustrial Rust Belt, the report is still likely to raise alarm bells for many US high-salaried workers.But fortunately, not all job replacements will come at a loss. The research firm also predicts that the technology will be able to fill many workplace gaps that have existed in frontline industries since the 2020 pandemic. Creative Industries Are Safe for NowForrester’s research also found that generative AI is likely to influence a grand total of 11 million jobs by 2023, making the tech 4.5 more likely to reshape a role than stamp it out altogether.Generative AI is expected to transform jobs in a number of ways, including by giving workers opportunities to upskill and retrain, as well as simplifying business workflows through automation.According to the report, creative professionals like poets, writers, and editors are less likely than white-collar workers to have their jobs replaced altogether as their skill sets are harder to replicate. Instead, Forester predicts that the nature of these jobs will evolve as AI tools become further embedded in our daily practices. How to Get AI Implementation RightAI is already uprooting the business landscape in major ways, with our own research revealing that 47% of business leaders are currently considering using AI over new hires.But while failing to embrace AI fast enough is a valid concern, doing so without adequate guardrails could open your business up to numerous risks including poor AI performance, negative employee experiences, and security issues.While it’s impossible to account for every contingency, to sidestep major pitfalls Forrester outlines the importance of building an informed generative strategy. According to the research firm, here are some major factors businesses should consider:Invest in the robot quotient (RQ) – RQ is a measure that evaluates your company’s readiness for robotic process automation. Self-assessing your team under this criteria will help you focus on which areas will benefit the most from AI automation.Prioritize augmentation – Enhancing roles with AI tools instead of replacing roles with technology will have a much more beneficial outcome on your business.Identify which jobs will benefit from AI the most – AI doesn’t assist all roles evenly. Analyzing which jobs will benefit the most will ensure that experience and precision don’t get lost in your transformation efforts.Hire or upskill to fill AI gaps – Most companies currently lack adequate AI know-how, so hiring or upskilling workers with relevant skills like prompt generation will be a solid return on investment.To learn more about how to get AI implementation right, read our guide on important AI principles, guidelines, and frameworks to consider in 2023.

Many employees worldwide are concerned about artificial intelligence (AI) replacing them.
However, a recent study by the UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO) has indicated that AI, especially generative AI, will more likely augment jobs than destroy them.
Here are a few findings from the recent study.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been looked upon with suspicion by a significant number of employees worldwide for a few years, as most fear that the technology will render them jobless. However, a recent United Nations (UN) study has indicated that AI will more likely augment jobs rather than destroy them.
The studyOpens a new window  by the UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO) examined the potential effects of ChatGPT and a few other platforms on job quality and quantity. The research suggested that most industries and jobs are only partly exposed to automation.
The organization said that most jobs are “more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by the latest wave of Generative AI, such as ChatGPT.” It further said, “Therefore, the greatest impact of this technology is likely not to be job destruction but rather the potential changes to the quality of jobs, notably work intensity and autonomy.”
AI’s Effects May Vary Across Professions and Regions
While the study suggested that AI, especially generative AI, will more likely augment jobs, it also suggested that the effects will vary significantly between regions and professions.
According to the study, clerical work is the category of jobs having the most significant technological exposure. While about 24% of tasks are considered highly exposed, 58% of tasks have medium-level exposure. In other occupational groups, including technicians and managers, a small percentage of tasks was found to be highly exposed, while about 25% had medium-level exposure.
Meanwhile, the study suggested that higher-income nations would experience the biggest impact from automation due to a significant share of para-professional and clerical jobs in the job distribution. It found that 5.5% of the total employment in high-income nations was potentially exposed to generative AI’s automation properties. On the other hand, only 0.4% of employment in low-income countries was exposed to generative AI’s automation properties.

Women Are More Likely To See Their Job Impacted
When comparing generative AI’s impact on men and women, the study highlighted that women were more likely than men to see their job affected. It indicated that the share of employment possibly affected was more than twice as high for women as for men. This was primarily due to the overrepresentation of women in clerical work, especially in middle- and high-income countries.
The Right Policies Offer Important Benefits
While the above stats look a little discouraging, the research suggested that the potential for augmentation was almost equal across countries. ILO said, “With the right policies in place, this new wave of technological transformation could offer important benefits for developing countries.”
However, it cautioned that while augmentation may indicate positive developments like freeing up time for innovative tasks, it may also be implemented to accelerate work intensity or limit workers’ agency. Hence, according to the study’s authors, countries should design policies that support a fair, orderly, and consultative shift.

The Balance Between Using Artificial Intelligence and Authentic Intelligence to Find Talent 
Artificial intelligence and its impending impact on the workforce are dominating news and social media these days. But what exactly are the implications for finding talent? A recent report from LHH Knightsbridge Search breaks it down.

 September 6, 2023 – We live in a day and age when artificial AI continues to gain steam. Consider how it has already changed our everyday lives. It’s omnipresent and it’s no surprise that technology leaders such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI lead the way. All three recently released groundbreaking AI-powered chatbots that can code, converse, debate, plan, write; you name it. But as exciting as this advancement is, it can also be equally worrying for America’s workforce, according to a recent report from LHH Knightsbridge Search.
“The pros and cons can vary based on context, so first, let’s identify ours, the labor market—the blue- and white-collar workers and the companies which employ them,” the study said. “In this context, the list of pros and cons could be painfully long, so LHH Knightsbridge Search sticks to the three most pressing for each.”
The Pros
1. Accuracy – AI is programmed, and constantly learning, to be accurate. “While it’s not perfect—there have been notable errors—it’s close,” the LHH Knightsbridge Search report said. “This applies across the workplace spectrum, from robots welding automobiles in plants to analytics programs providing data in offices.”

2. Availability – LHH Knightsbridge Search also notes that it’s available 24/7/365, barring any unexpected downtime or major outages. The firm says that perhaps the most illustrative example of this is chatbots and while they may not resolve every customer service issue, they are available at every moment to at least help.
3. Creativity – “It complements humans by offering new ideas or enhancing existing ideas. Take the shiny new ChatGPT,” the LHH Knightsbridge Search said. “Provided with basic information, it can ideate and even create relevant, albeit robotic content, taking some of the legwork out of a difficult process.”
The Cons
1. Cost – AI can be expensive to not only develop, but also to use, according to the LHH Knightsbridge Search report. “Despite the current low cost of the aforementioned ChatGPT (ChatGPT Plus is currently $20 per month), other forms of AI can be expensive when factoring in costs associated with purchase, implementation, and use,” the firm said.

2. Disconnect – AI also lacks a human-to-human connection and it cannot build camaraderie with employees or develop genuine relationships with customers. Nor will it ever be an authentic and empathetic voice to represent a brand.
3. Unemployment – While AI will eliminate some jobs, a recent Forbes article said  it may create enough jobs to offset the loss. Regardless, the LHH Knightsbridge Search notes that it has—and will—take over some jobs and the jobs it creates could require new skill-sets that don’t even exist today.
What it Could Mean for Workforce Management
As much as AI is being entrenched in work, LHH Knightsbridge Search says that it’s difficult to measure its future impact on a macro level. “Estimated AI-influenced job gains and losses in America range from hundreds of thousands to millions over the next decade,” the firm said. “Wherever we end up, it’s clear that the world of work will change to some degree. What exactly could that mean for employers?”
Recruitment
As AI plays a larger role in many jobs and requires new hard and soft skills from humans, recruiters say that finding the right talent could become increasingly difficult. For example, if AI can elevate a complex customer service complaint to a certain point in a process, “it may be beneficial to have a customer service representative with a high degree of emotional intelligence take over at said point to resolve the complaint in a personal, empathetic manner,” the LHH Knightsbridge Search report said. “On the B2B client services side, the client relationship management data that some AI programs produce may need to be interpreted by an analytical human. Why did the program identify this data? How can this data be leveraged to help the client? How can we present it with the right context? On a positive note, AI is already helping companies to source and upskill the right talent. Here at LHH, it’s likely that an increasing reliance on AI, paired with a human touch, will help us solve any recruitment-related challenges.”


Leveraging AI for Executive Search Success
In today’s fast-paced business landscape, the role of executive search firms has never been more critical in helping organizations identify and recruit top-tier leadership talent. The demand for exceptional leaders who possess a unique blend of skills, experience, and cultural fit has intensified, prompting recruiters to explore innovative solutions to stay ahead of the competition. One game-changing tool that has emerged as a strategic imperative is artificial intelligence.

“What is really interesting to me about AI is that if we look at it from an information perspective, the talent space can benefit tremendously,” said Laurie Chamberlin, head of LHH Recruitment Solutions, North America. “The last several years, everyone has been talking about talent—scarcity, upskilling, wage inflation, right-sizing workforces, productivity, hybrid/remote workers, purpose, culture, and the list goes on. If we can harness the data we have and predict for companies how to best tackle their talent challenges, we all benefit.”
Layoffs
The LHH Knightsbridge Search report notes that AI will inevitably lead to some layoffs. “We’ve already seen this in automotive manufacturing, food production, and supply chain and logistics when robots were ushered in,” the firm said. “In the future, it could potentially happen with more professional services positions. To what degree and at what time remains an educated guessing game. Regardless, this puts employers in a difficult position. For any company, layoffs are difficult to navigate. They can damage reputation, drain resources, and trigger unrelenting worry about the people whose lives changed at the drop of a hat. If AI increases productivity at a lower cost, making certain jobs redundant and a layoff possible, ask these questions, first. Is there a way these employees can complement the AI? Can we move them to different roles? Is a layoff necessary? If so, how can we help them with their careers? Which type of outplacement services and upskilling can we offer them during their transitions?”

In regard to skills, AI will continue to demand more, according to the LHH Knightsbridge Search report. “Whether they know it or not, almost every worker has a first or second-degree connection to automation or predictive analytics or robotics,” the report said. “They may have already developed skills because of this connection. They may have even lost their job because of this connection. Either way, there’s been a paradigm shift. It’s becoming insufficient to have a single razor-sharp skill; It’s now necessary to have that skill and develop new ones. Employers should play a part in this. They can nudge an employee down the path of advancement, creating a win-win for both parties. Companies invest in employees, which is often less costly than replacing them with someone with the right skills, and employees are more likely to reciprocate in the form of loyalty and productivity.”

The good news is this is happening partly based on the demand from workers. Per LHH’s “Global Workforce of the Future” report, 31 percent of workers state that the primary reason to quit is a lack of progression and re-skilling and upskilling opportunities, while 44 percent of those who want to stay at their current company want to progress/upskill for a new job. Today, employers have a range of upskilling options, from internal training programs, to third-party courses, to leadership coaching and development.
“We can use AI to predict skills that our candidates need to acquire in our service to make them more marketable given the supply and demand of the job market,” said John Morgan, president of LHH. “We are currently working on an algorithm to help candidates understand skills needed, jobs that are likely to be automated, new adjacent jobs that will emerge within their career track, and how their personal brand matches available jobs they are targeting.”
The Responsibilities of HR Leaders
Recruiters say that AI is having a profound effect on the world of work, and in turn, workforce management. As a leader—particularly those in HR—it’s imperative that you’re a part of this evolution, familiar with the latest AI developments that could affect your business, according to the LHH Knightsbridge Search report. The firms asks: Are you listening to your colleagues in finance, marketing, operations, production, and other departments? Better yet, are you proactively asking them about automation, robotization, and other technology that could enhance and/or replace jobs?
“You need to know what’s on the horizon so you can plan accordingly,” the report said. “More importantly, remember your people. Over the past few years, there’s been talk about work-life balance, and work and life being one, more than ever. Not being equipped to capitalize on AI-induced changes can literally be life altering. Consider the efforts your company is taking to upskill employees and offer them career mobility, especially when new technologies are being integrated into their roles, even if there’s a chance their newfound mobility could take them elsewhere. And consider what you would do for them in the event AI does replace their role, whether it’s reskilling and moving or laying off with the support of a severance and outplacement.”
“You’ve probably already been faced with these challenges, and if you haven’t, it’s not a matter of if, but a matter of when,” LHH Knightsbridge Search said. “The more you prepare today the better off you’ll be tomorrow to strike the right balance between artificial intelligence and authentic intelligence.”

Since ChatGPT’s release in November of 2022, there have been countless conversations on the impact of similar large language models. Generative AI has forced organizations to rethink how they work and what can and should be adjusted. Specifically, organizations are contemplating Generative AI’s impact on software development. While the potential of Generative AI in software development is exciting, there are still risks and guardrails that need to be considered.
Members of VMware’s Tanzu Vanguard community, who are expert practitioners at companies across different industries, provided their perspectives on how technologies such as Generative AI are impacting software development and technology decisions. Their insights help answer questions and pose new questions for companies to consider when evaluating their AI investments.
AI won’t replace developers
Generative AI has introduced a level of software development speed that didn’t exist before. It helps increase developer productivity and efficiency by helping developers shortcut building code. Solutions, like the ChatGPT chatbot, along with tools such as Github Co-Pilot, can help developers focus on generating value instead of writing boilerplate code. By acting as a multiplier effect of developer productivity, it opens up new possibilities in what developers can do with the time they save. However, despite its intelligence and benefits to automating pipelines, the technology is still far from completely replacing human developers.
Generative AI should not be seen as being able to work independently and still needs to be supervised – both when it comes to ensuring the code is correct and when it comes to security. Developers still need to be able to understand the context and meaning of AI’s answers, as sometimes they are not entirely correct, says Thomas Rudrof, DevOps Engineer at DATEV eG. Rudrof believes that AI is better for assisting with simple, repetitive tasks and acts as an assistant rather than replacing the developer role.
Risks of AI in software development
Despite Generative AI’s ability to make developers more efficient, it is not error free. Finding bugs and fixing them may be more challenging using AI as developers still need to carefully review any code AI produces. There is also more risk related to the software development itself as it follows the logic defined by someone as well as the available dataset, says Lukasz Piotrowski, developer at Atos Global Services. Therefore, the technology will only be as good as the data provided.
On an individual level, AI creates security issues as attackers will try to exploit the capabilities of AI tools while security professionals also employ the same technology to defend against such attacks. Developers need to be extremely careful to follow best practices and not include credential and tokens in their code directly. Anything secure or containing IP that can be revealed to other users should not be uploaded. Even with safeguards in place, AI might be capable of breaking security.  If care is not taken in the intake process, there could be huge risks if that security scheme or other info are inadvertently pushed to generative AI, says Jim Kohl, Devops Consultant at GAIG.
Best practices and educationCurrently, there are no established best practices for leveraging AI in software development. The use of AI-generated code is still in an experimental phase for many organizations due to numerous uncertainties such as its impact on security, data privacy, copyright, and more.
However, organizations already using AI need to use it wisely and should not trust the technology freely.  Juergen Sussner, Lead Cloud Platform Engineer at DATEV eG, advises organizations to try to implement small use cases and test them well, if they work, scale them, if not, try another use case. Through small experiments, organizations can determine for themselves the technology’s risks and limitations.
Guardrails are necessary when it comes to the use of AI and can help individuals effectively use the technology safely. Leaving AI usage unaddressed in your organization can lead to security, ethical, and legal issues. Some companies have already seen severe penalties around AI tools being used for research and code, therefore acting quickly is necessary.  For example, litigation has surfaced against companies for training AI tools using data lakes with thousands of unlicensed works.
Getting an AI to understand context is one of the larger problems with leveraging AI in software development, says Scot Kreienkamp, Senior Systems Engineer at La-Z-Boy. Engineers need to understand how to phrase prompts for AIs. Educational programs and training courses can help teach this skill set. Organizations serious about AI technologies should upskill appropriate personnel to make them capable of prompt engineering.
As organizations grapple with the implications of Generative AI, a paradigm shift is underway in software development. AI is going to change the way developers work. At the minimum, developers leveraging the technology will become more efficient at coding and building software platform foundations. However, AI will need an operator to work with it and should not be trusted independently. The insights shared by VMware’s Vanguards underscore the need for cautious integration and the need to maintain guardrails to mitigate risk in software development.

How should education change to address, incorporate, or challenge today’s AI systems, especially powerful large language models? What role should educators and scholars play in shaping the future of generative AI? The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 triggered an explosion of news, opinion pieces, and social media posts addressing these questions. Yet many are not aware of the current and historical body of academic work that offers clarity, substance, and nuance to enrich the discourse.
Linking the terms “AI” and “education” invites a constellation of discussions. This selection of articles is hardly comprehensive, but it includes explanations of AI concepts and provides historical context for today’s systems. It describes a range of possible educational applications as well as adverse impacts, such as learning loss and increased inequity. Some articles touch on philosophical questions about AI in relation to learning, thinking, and human communication. Others will help educators prepare students for civic participation around concerns including information integrity, impacts on jobs, and energy consumption. Yet others outline educator and student rights in relation to AI and exhort educators to share their expertise in societal and industry discussions on the future of AI.
Nabeel Gillani, Rebecca Eynon, Catherine Chiabaut, and Kelsey Finkel, “Unpacking the ‘Black Box’ of AI in Education,” Educational Technology & Society 26, no. 1 (2023): 99–111.
Whether we’re aware of it or not, AI was already widespread in education before ChatGPT. Nabeel Gillani et al. describe AI applications such as learning analytics and adaptive learning systems, automated communications with students, early warning systems, and automated writing assessment. They seek to help educators develop literacy around the capacities and risks of these systems by providing an accessible introduction to machine learning and deep learning as well as rule-based AI. They present a cautious view, calling for scrutiny of bias in such systems and inequitable distribution of risks and benefits. They hope that engineers will collaborate deeply with educators on the development of such systems.
Jürgen Rudolph, Samson Tan, and Shannon Tan, “ChatGPT: Bullshit Spewer or the End of Traditional Assessments in Higher Education?” The Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching 6, no. 1 (January 24, 2023).
Jürgen Rudolph et al. give a practically oriented overview of ChatGPT’s implications for higher education. They explain the statistical nature of large language models as they tell the history of OpenAI and its attempts to mitigate bias and risk in the development of ChatGPT. They illustrate ways ChatGPT can be used with examples and screenshots. Their literature review shows the state of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) as of January 2023. An extensive list of challenges and opportunities culminates in a set of recommendations that emphasizes explicit policy as well as expanding digital literacy education to include AI.
Emily M. Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angela McMillan-Major, and Shmargaret Shmitchell, “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? 🦜,” FAccT ’21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (March 2021): 610–623.
Student and faculty understanding of the risks and impacts of large language models is central to AI literacy and civic participation around AI policy. This hugely influential paper details documented and likely adverse impacts of the current data-and-resource-intensive, non-transparent mode of development of these models. Bender et al. emphasize the ways in which these costs will likely be borne disproportionately by marginalized groups. They call for transparency around the energy use and cost of these models as well as transparency around the data used to train them. They warn that models perpetuate and even amplify human biases and that the seeming coherence of these systems’ outputs can be used for malicious purposes even though it doesn’t reflect real understanding.
The authors argue that inclusive participation in development can encourage alternate development paths that are less resource intensive. They further argue that beneficial applications for marginalized groups, such as improved automatic speech recognition systems, must be accompanied by plans to mitigate harm.
Erik Brynjolfsson, “The Turing Trap: The Promise & Peril of Human-Like Artificial Intelligence,” Daedalus 151, no. 2 (2022): 272–87.
Erik Brynjolfsson argues that when we think of artificial intelligence as aiming to substitute for human intelligence, we miss the opportunity to focus on how it can complement and extend human capabilities. Brynjolfsson calls for policy that shifts AI development incentives away from automation toward augmentation. Automation is more likely to result in the elimination of lower-level jobs and in growing inequality. He points educators toward augmentation as a framework for thinking about AI applications that assist learning and teaching. How can we create incentives for AI to support and extend what teachers do rather than substituting for teachers? And how can we encourage students to use AI to extend their thinking and learning rather than using AI to skip learning?
Kevin Scott, “I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means: Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Work & Scale,” Daedalus 151, no. 2 (2022): 75–84.
Brynjolfsson’s focus on AI as “augmentation” converges with Microsoft computer scientist Kevin Scott’s focus on “cognitive assistance.” Steering discussion of AI away from visions of autonomous systems with their own goals, Scott argues that near-term AI will serve to help humans with cognitive work. Scott situates this assistance in relation to evolving historical definitions of work and the way in which tools for work embody generalized knowledge about specific domains. He’s intrigued by the way deep neural networks can represent domain knowledge in new ways, as seen in the unexpected coding capabilities offered by OpenAI’s GPT-3 language model, which have enabled people with less technical knowledge to code. His article can help educators frame discussions of how students should build knowledge and what knowledge is still relevant in contexts where AI assistance is nearly ubiquitous.
Laura D. Tyson and John Zysman, “Automation, AI & Work,” Daedalus 151, no. 2 (2022): 256–71.
How can educators prepare students for future work environments integrated with AI and advise students on how majors and career paths may be affected by AI automation? And how can educators prepare students to participate in discussions of government policy around AI and work? Laura Tyson and John Zysman emphasize the importance of policy in determining how economic gains due to AI are distributed and how well workers weather disruptions due to AI. They observe that recent trends in automation and gig work have exacerbated inequality and reduced the supply of “good” jobs for low- and middle-income workers. They predict that AI will intensify these effects, but they point to the way collective bargaining, social insurance, and protections for gig workers have mitigated such impacts in countries like Germany. They argue that such interventions can serve as models to help frame discussions of intelligent labor policies for “an inclusive AI era.”
Todd C. Helmus, Artificial Intelligence, Deepfakes, and Disinformation: A Primer (RAND Corporation, 2022). 
Educators’ considerations of academic integrity and AI text can draw on parallel discussions of authenticity and labeling of AI content in other societal contexts. Artificial intelligence has made deepfake audio, video, and images as well as generated text much more difficult to detect as such. Here, Todd Helmus considers the consequences to political systems and individuals as he offers a review of the ways in which these can and have been used to promote disinformation. He considers ways to identify deepfakes and ways to authenticate provenance of videos and images. Helmus advocates for regulatory action, tools for journalistic scrutiny, and widespread efforts to promote media literacy. As well as informing discussions of authenticity in educational contexts, this report might help us shape curricula to teach students about the risks of deepfakes and unlabeled AI.
William Hasselberger, “Can Machines Have Common Sense?” The New Atlantis 65 (2021): 94–109.
Students, by definition, are engaged in developing their cognitive capacities; their understanding of their own intelligence is in flux and may be influenced by their interactions with AI systems and by AI hype. In his review of The Myth of Artificial Intelligence: Why Computers Can’t Think the Way We Do by Erik J. Larson, William Hasselberger warns that in overestimating AI’s ability to mimic human intelligence we devalue the human and overlook human capacities that are integral to everyday life decision making, understanding, and reasoning. Hasselberger provides examples of both academic and everyday common-sense reasoning that continue to be out of reach for AI. He provides a historical overview of debates around the limits of artificial intelligence and its implications for our understanding of human intelligence, citing the likes of Alan Turing and Marvin Minsky as well as contemporary discussions of data-driven language models.
Gwo-Jen Hwang and Nian-Shing Chen, “Exploring the Potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Education: Applications, Challenges, and Future Research Directions,” Educational Technology & Society 26, no. 2 (2023).
Gwo-Jen Hwang and Nian-Shing Chen are enthusiastic about the potential benefits of incorporating generative AI into education. They outline a variety of roles a large language model like ChatGPT might play, from student to tutor to peer to domain expert to administrator. For example, educators might assign students to “teach” ChatGPT on a subject. Hwang and Chen provide sample ChatGPT session transcripts to illustrate their suggestions. They share prompting techniques to help educators better design AI-based teaching strategies. At the same time, they are concerned about student overreliance on generative AI. They urge educators to guide students to use it critically and to reflect on their interactions with AI. Hwang and Chen don’t touch on concerns about bias, inaccuracy, or fabrication, but they call for further research into the impact of integrating generative AI on learning outcomes.

Lauren Goodlad and Samuel Baker, “Now the Humanities Can Disrupt ‘AI’,” Public Books (February 20, 2023).
Lauren Goodlad and Samuel Baker situate both academic integrity concerns and the pressures on educators to “embrace” AI in the context of market forces. They ground their discussion of AI risks in a deep technical understanding of the limits of predictive models at mimicking human intelligence. Goodlad and Baker urge educators to communicate the purpose and value of teaching with writing to help students engage with the plurality of the world and communicate with others. Beyond the classroom, they argue, educators should question tech industry narratives and participate in public discussion on regulation and the future of AI. They see higher education as resilient: academic skepticism about former waves of hype around MOOCs, for example, suggests that educators will not likely be dazzled or terrified into submission to AI. Goodlad and Baker hope we will instead take up our place as experts who should help shape the future of the role of machines in human thought and communication.
Kathryn Conrad, “Sneak Preview: A Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights for Education,” Critical AI 2.1 (July 17, 2023).
How can the field of education put the needs of students and scholars first as we shape our response to AI, the way we teach about it, and the way we might incorporate it into pedagogy? Kathryn Conrad’s manifesto builds on and extends the Biden administration’s Office of Science and Technology Policy 2022 “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.” Conrad argues that educators should have input into institutional policies on AI and access to professional development around AI. Instructors should be able to decide whether and how to incorporate AI into pedagogy, basing their decisions on expert recommendations and peer-reviewed research. Conrad outlines student rights around AI systems, including the right to know when AI is being used to evaluate them and the right to request alternate human evaluation. They deserve detailed instructor guidance on policies around AI use without fear of reprisals. Conrad maintains that students should be able to appeal any charges of academic misconduct involving AI, and they should be offered alternatives to any AI-based assignments that might put their creative work at risk of exposure or use without compensation. Both students’ and educators’ legal rights must be respected in any educational application of automated generative systems.

Published: Sep 07, 2023 03:33 PM ESTShubhangi Duaa year ago0ShareGenerative AI to replace jobs as soon as 2030Moor Studio / iStock A new report published by Forrester forecasted the future impact of generative artificial intelligence and how the technology will mainly impact white-collar jobs. 
The report description of generative AI stated:
“A set of technologies and techniques that leverage massive corpuses of data, including large language models, to generate new content (e.g., text, video, images, audio, code). Inputs may be natural language prompts or other non-code and nontraditional inputs.” Coating wine bottle with wax and honey extraction, the best of IE this week

Forrester alluded to the finding, noting that the technology will replace approximately 2.4 million jobs in the United States by 2030, implying that humans will not be necessary for these tasks and that automated technology will take over. 
Impacting white-collar jobs
Additionally, generative AI may influence another 11 million jobs in the US. The report emphasized that white-collar jobs will be mainly affected. The roles that could be at risk include technical writers, social science research assistants, proofreaders, copywriters, and those in administrative positions.
“Let’s be clear: Generative AI is coming after white-collar jobs,” the report added. “Automation and AI overall will replace 4.9 percent of US jobs by 2030.”
They predicted a loss of 0.6 percent loss owing to automation through 2030. Emphasizing that automation will supersede jobs that are harder to fill, such as in the case of physical robotics being employed to aid frontline workers in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Furthermore, Generative AI intends to make up nearly 30 percent of the jobs lost to automation by 2030. “Generative AI will make up a growing percentage of all US jobs lost to automation and AI, climbing from 9.3 percent of jobs lost to automation and AI overall in 2023 to 30.4 percent by 2030,” the report noted.
However, job losses in the next two years will most likely remain subtle until questions on intellectual property rights, copyright, plagiarism, model refresh rates, model bias, ethics, and model response reliability are resolved. 
Human-based roles are still necessary
Although, Forrester highlighted that the technology’s potential could also lead to poor performance. For instance, models like ChatGPT often generate “coherent nonsense,” which brings issues of inconsistent customer service to light and as a result, they need to be fixed manually.
The Register cautioned: “Companies will need to hire new, potentially scarce, and expensive talent — developers, business analysts, prompt engineers, even ethicists. The market for this talent will be tight. On the other side, you might lose valuable legacy talent if the pace of change is too fast.”RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

It’s also possible in some scenarios that automating tasks may yield subpar results but companies may still feel compelled to embrace AI. Firms will have to identify jobs that benefit most from automation to integrate generative AI smoothly. 
Employees will have to be trained in skills like prompt engineering and refining input to achieve specific outcomes.
The report stated: “[Enterprises] won’t be able to plan for every contingency, but [they] can build a workforce generative AI strategy that better prepares [them] for the Wild West of generative AI at work. [Their] strategy should include investments, guardrails, and checkpoints.”

      Key Takeaways    



        Product teams can let AI do the legwork for them.
      


        AI helps customer teams create responsive, tailored experiences.
      









    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

The parabolic growth of accessible AI tools has intriguing implications for businesses. Analysts imagine that generative AI, for example, will have a massive impact on productivity across multiple business functions. Many organizations are scanning the horizon for a long-term AI-fueled transformation, eager to make the most of bullish CAGR projections. And while leaders mustn't lose sight of long-term goals, staring out too far into the future may be overwhelming — distracting, even.Rather than redesign their business' entire approach just to meet AI somewhere along the horizon, leaders can instead take a more practical route and ask how AI can improve their current strategy. Can AI accelerate current tactics? Can it help teams do things better? Can it help organizations reach their goals with less overhead? The answer, especially regarding product, customer success and internal processes, is overwhelmingly ""yes.""Related: The Robots Are Coming — But They Can't Outsmart Us When It Comes To This Particular Skill.



Product teams can let AI do the legwork for themAI's impact on product development begins with the nitty gritty. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT can help teams with everything from documentation to marketing briefs and website content. My team has leveraged AI for these very purposes, letting AI rewrite code into additional languages once we create the initial sample code. Humans are still an essential part of the process, but AI helps provide a kickstart.Tech companies have taken AI a step further, embedding it into their products. AI represents both a tremendous opportunity and a threat for security solutions providers. Bad actors have new tool sets that enable them to create more sophisticated attacks faster and more intelligently. Cyber product teams use the same tools to defend against emerging threats and offer in-product help to ensure their customers are more productive, better informed and ultimately satisfied with the experience.


Non-tech companies should be thinking about the experience around their products, and, indeed, many are. Car manufacturers use AI to enhance their collision-detection systems. Healthcare solutions providers embed AI in their diagnostics and imaging products. Nike uses AI to power its product personalization efforts.AI helps customer teams create responsive, tailored experiencesCustomer-experience chatbots have been around for a long time, but concerns about data privacy, unnatural language and unhelpful results have kept them from becoming ubiquitous. Recent advancements have helped fine-tune chatbots such that they can answer questions more efficiently and accurately than a support desk person. AI-enhanced chatbots have helped transform these experiences from feeling like an impersonal human replacement to a better and more responsible customer experience, yet some consumers are still wary. Most will use chatbots, provided there is always an option to transfer to a live agent.Chatbots aren't the only way organizations can infuse their customer experience with AI. Many companies effectively employ powerful data analytics, feeding valuable purchase and customer data into algorithms that help create ever-evolving seamless, personalized omnichannel experiences – think about how Spotify recommends new songs based on listeners' history and allows them to switch from one device to the next easily.AI allows everyone to escape process mundanityFor both product and customer experience teams, much of the AI magic happens behind the scenes. Chances are those teams are also using intelligent tools to automate workflows and speed up processes so that people can do their jobs more effectively. Teams for nearly any business function can use AI to do everything from creating images for a slide presentation to drafting website content and writing documentation.


Leaders interested in process-focused AI can begin by asking, ""How can AI help deliver a product or service more effectively?"" and ""What are we spending time on that AI could/should be doing?"" By leaning into existing tools, such as those that Microsoft, Google and OpenAI provide, organizations can simplify mundane tasks involved in creating documents, spreadsheets and slide decks to free up their workforce for more creative and mission-critical work.Related: Automation Is Becoming a Business Imperative: Don't Wait Until It's Too LateAI: the ultimate means to achieving business goalsOn my product management team, we're exploring all facets of our roles and asking ourselves how AI can help us spend more time analyzing information instead of gathering and summarizing it. This approach has been a tremendous shortcut for some components of our research and is a helpful way to think about AI as it relates to our company's trajectory. When we ask how AI can help us fulfill our goals, we stay focused rather than become distracted navigating to some nebulous AI-enabled future along the horizon.Making AI work for us — not the other way around — is also a useful reminder that modern intelligent tools aren't here to replace employees. In fact, a human in the loop is critical, regardless of AI's application. Product teams must validate AI's documentation; customer experience teams need to review modeling output for errors and continue to interact with customers when the time comes.


The next time you make a decision about AI, remember that it is just a practical means to achieving business goals and not the end goal in and of itself.

Forward-looking: Another study on the effect generative AI will have on jobs has been carried out, and it's a familiar story for white-collar workers: the technology will replace 2.4 million jobs in the US by 2030 and influence 11 million more. The (slightly) good news is that those job losses represent a lower figure than what many others have predicted. 
Analyst firm Forrester's 2023 Generative AI Jobs Impact Forecast offers a similar conclusion to IBM's recent study: that while generative AI is going to cost many people their jobs, it will augment more roles than replace them. Forrester notes that 4.5 times more jobs will be ""influenced"" by the tech, which it defines as reshaping, retraining, and upskilling existing workers to incorporate generative AI tools into the daily workflow.
In the part of the report titled 'Let's Be Clear: Generative AI is Coming After White Collar Jobs,' it's stated that automation and AI overall will replace 4.9% of US jobs by 2030, with generative AI making up 30% (2.4 million) of those lost jobs. The likes of ChatGPT are predicted to replace 90,000 jobs in 2023, representing 9.3% of all jobs lost to automation and AI this year.

As we've heard before, the jobs most at risk of being impacted by generative AI include technical writers, social science researchers, research assistants, proofreaders, and copywriters. Harder-to-automate jobs with high generative AI influence, such as editors, writers, authors and poets, lyricists, and creative writers, are more likely to influence how jobs are conducted (via augmentation) rather than replace them.
Another finding is that the more education a worker has, the higher the influence generative AI will have on their job. Occupations with lower educational requirements like transportation and warehousing, construction, agriculture, and manufacturing will see less job influence, while those requiring bachelor's degrees or higher are going to see the biggest disruption.

It's a similar trend with wages: workers who earn under $60,000 are going to be less impacted than those earning $90,000 or more.
Job losses from generative AI are expected to be modest over the next couple of years as issues surrounding the tools are addressed, such as intellectual property rights, copyright claims, and plagiarism.

Forrester warns of potential AI roadblocks such as the prospect of generative AI producing ""coherent nonsense"" and the massive backlash against these systems from the public, as was seen with the Secret Invasion TV show's opening credits and the D&D book illustrations.
One of the earliest studies claimed generative AI could affect 300 million jobs globally. Forrester's conclusion is more optimistic, but it does warn that some workers will lose jobs they need, creating deep social challenges like those faced in the postindustrial Rust Belt. It's no wonder many tech execs are turning to drink and drugs to cope with the stress.

Greg Meyers has run tech and digital for three multi-billion-dollar revenue companies, including Motorola Solutions and at Syngenta Group. He is as deeply curious as he is deeply technical. For the past year and a half, Meyers has been the Executive Vice President and Chief Digital & Technology Officer of Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). During the December holidays of 2022, he jumped into the deep end with a technology that he had only dipped his toe in the water to explore in the few weeks prior: ChatGPT 3.5. At the end of last year, few had delved deeply into OpenAI’s product, as the tool that would kick off a revolution was only released on November 30. The major uptick in adoption would occur early in 2023. The holiday break provided Meyers just the right amount of time to explore this more thoroughly, aiding him in getting better acquainted with the solution and, by extension, the opportunity it might present. “I would say after maybe an hour or two of using it, I knew this was probably the biggest breakthrough we've seen since at least the iPhone,” he underscored.


Meyers has long believed that tech and digital leads must model the curiosity and experimentation that are the basic ingredients of innovation. Rather than rely on consultancies or the start-up community to define these opportunities, he is inclined to get his hands dirty, figuratively speaking, to draw his own conclusions. Given how long he and his team have been immersed in generative artificial intelligence solutions, they have had time to draw conclusions about their relative merits and risks.

The first opportunity he identified was document review. “Our industry is a very document-intensive industry,” he said. “Think about clinical trials and studies and essays and publications. Being able to get a relatively simple answer to a complicated question that may exists in a document somewhere or in someone's head could take days to find the right person who knows where the right document is, to know where to look to get the answer to the question.” Meyers’ team has put tens of thousands of documents in the large language model to be queried. The results are fast and remarkably accurate.

The second opportunity has been to take data that is in tabular form, perhaps related to a clinical trial, and have generative AI convert it into a narrative that can be stored and leveraged more easily. There is still a “human in the loop,” as members of Meyers’ team remain involved to ensure that the data is accurate. A primary value of this, however, is speed, as the standard processes would often take days, and that has been reduced to less than a minute in many cases.

The third area of value that has Meyers excited has been in research. “If you think of computational pharmacology, which is creating medicines, large language models are directly translated in protein expression. Protein sequences are a lot like a human language. They're represented by a string of letters. In our industry parlance, we have protein motifs and domains. These are the functional building blocks of how proteins come together to be able to do some mechanical action in the body. In many ways, these two things are akin to words or phrases in a human language. We're doing quite a bit of work in trying to see how useful they can be in helping us understand how proteins might fold or interact with other proteins as part of our ongoing work to do new drug design and drug discovery.”

Meyers has also been impressed with how generative AI can make human programmers more productive. “A human being that knows coding well can go through and debug and paste code together,” he said. “[Generative AI] does a nice job in helping you debug human errors, pasting in code. For sure, this is something that I think is going to take an average developer and make them 10 times more productive eventually.” In many ways, generative AI will act as a junior member of the team. The AI can do more menial and repeatable tasks, and it is learning more sophisticated methods, as well, but the human remains essential for purposes of context and nuance that the AI cannot yet grasp.

Meyers understands the necessity of incorporating guardrails for the team to ensure that generative AI is used both responsibly and effectively. He has taken a three-pronged approach to mitigating the risk associated with it. First, his team has developed a responsible AI policy, which is a set of guidelines that help practitioners figure out how to practice AI in a responsible way. Meyers believes that by keeping a human in the loop, by regularly cross-checking work for bias, and by monitoring compliance, risks can be reduced to an appropriate level.
Second, his team has created an internal version of ChatGPT to avoid issues of sensitive data residing in public large language models. “We built our own ChatGPT inside Microsoft Azure using ChatGPT's APIs, which offers us the ability for every employee in the company to experiment in terms of how these tools can help make them be more productive, but they don't need to be nervous about where the data goes,” Meyers highlighted. “Building this internal tool gives people the flexibility to be able to do that without worrying about where the data goes because of the agreements we have in place with Microsoft.”
Third, Meyers has created what he refers to as a “community of practice,” which he calls the AI Collective. “It's a group of practitioners from across the company,” he said. “This includes research development, product supply and manufacturing, commercial, business insights and analytics. All these different groups, including IT, they all work together to do two things. First, to be an internal advisory board answering questions like, ‘Should we either be contributing to or taking from the open-source world?’ These are very important questions we'll have to face over the next couple of years, but then also acting as a voluntary group of people who can work on projects that may pop up somewhere in the organization, like finance where maybe they don't have a lot of AI practitioners, but other people in the organization would be willing to work on projects that are important to them.”
Meyers is crowdsourcing ideas from across the company to determine if there are existing processes that have the potential to improve by ten times through the use of artificial intelligence either through productivity, speed, or efficiency improvements. The solution may not always be generative AI, and it need not be incumbent on the non-technologists to know the solution to be used. “Put forward those ideas and then leave it to the experts to figure out whether it's a Bayesian classifier or it's machine learning or it's a deep learning or it's a neural network, for example,” he offered. The practitioners outside of the digital and tech organization need not focus on the solution. He advises his colleagues to focus on the job that needs to be done, and let the experts help guide which is the right tool for the right job.
To further separate hype from reality, Meyers advises staying close with one’s peers to understand use cases that are emerging. Their ideas may not directly apply, but by understanding what other chief information officers are doing to take advantage of generative AI, more ideas will bubble up.
Meyers closed the conversation by noting that he believes that he is seeing history repeat itself a bit with generative artificial intelligence, again returning to the analogy of the iPhone and its release in 2007. At the time, it was banned by many companies as a security risk to the enterprise. “Then we [CIOs] stood in front of that freight train,” he said. “There was a history of CIOs standing in front of these freight trains. I think that when you're able to experiment, the first thing you try to do is control it. We tend to worry about cost, control, security. There's a handful of things that we always traditionally work around. I think that the two lessons are you just have to go and see. Is it really going to be useful? Is the benefit worth the risk? There's a risk-benefit equation. Then you have to try to quickly find a way to channel the enthusiasm. Because if you just try to block it and a lot of IT companies blocked the iPhone just like they're blocking ChatGPT, it's sort of like sticking your head in the sand. It's not like employees aren't going to use it on their own. What you want to do is lean in and say, ‘Okay, this genie's not going back in the bottle.’ You just have to create a framework where people can experiment in a way that's both safe and effective.”

Forrester: AI will influence way more jobs than it replaces



By Jill Barth

September 8, 2023 

According to a new report from Forrester Research, “AI injects both magic and mayhem into the future of work.” That’s a poetic way of saying that AI is creating both disruption and solutions in the same space right now, and for HR leaders, that space is the workplace.

Forrester’s paper, 2023 Generative AI Jobs Impact Forecast, U.S., emphasizes that while generative AI is expected to eliminate some jobs, exponentially more will be advantageously influenced by this technology. From robot bartenders in Las Vegas to chatbots that give faulty advice to the “Iron Man suit for recruiters,” the news cycle is full of anecdotes and data about generative AI taking over. 
However, the Forrester report supports the viewpoint that most jobs will still need people, but that—for many—their work will be augmented by AI. This methodology is based on public financial documents and executive interviews, as well as Forrester’s proprietary primary research and surveys. 
Investments in genAI
Forrester analysts predict that “generative AI will influence 4.5 times more jobs than it replaces” and that by 2030, the tech will augment more than 11 million U.S. jobs. Often, influence will manifest as enhancements to vendor offerings, they say. This was clearly demonstrated by the Top HR Tech products submissions the HRE team tested this summer. It’s been less than a year since the introduction of ChatGPT and investment in generative AI tools has soared and is expected to continue. Data from CBInsights reveals there are now 13 genAI unicorns ($1 billion-plus valuations), and that they reached this status about twice as fast as other unicorn companies.
According to Forrester, 55% of the AI software market will be centered on generative tools by 2030. Already, HR tech vendors are proposing embedded generative AI functions to chat with employees in a conversational tone, generate job descriptions to target needed skills, transcribe interviews, create emails to candidates, develop collaborative insights and offers answers and suggestions based on complex documents. It’s all work that can augment HR professionals’ current jobs.
There have been stark predictions about genAI. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs suggested that 300 million full-time jobs could be automated. However, as noted by the Forrester report, concrete evidence for these predictions in real-world job data has yet to be proven. “Exaggerated forecasts, heart-wrenching anecdotes, general panic—it can be hard to see the scope of the fire amid all this smoke,” write report authors. “Only through analysis grounded in the most robust data can we understand the impact generative AI will have on jobs.”
Tech and skills management
According to Forrester’s predictions, individuals in roles requiring “judgment, insight and moral reasoning” are less likely to see their jobs replaced by generative AI. This aligns with the skillset typically possessed by HR leaders and executives, many of whom are now at the forefront of devising strategies to implement generative AI for their teams, colleagues and organizations. In fact, HR is largely the function tasked with evaluating vendor offerings, recruiting individuals with the necessary skills to work with AI and distributing its benefits throughout the organization.
HR leaders have been advised to hire and upskill workers with generative AI expertise. This summer, a report issued by the McKinsey Global Institute indicated that workforce development would necessitate that HR professionals expand their hiring approach. The report suggests that “employers will need to hire for skills and competencies rather than credentials, recruit from overlooked populations (such as rural workers and people with disabilities) and provide training that keeps pace with their evolving needs.”

Forrester analysts also predict that vendor offerings will impact employees: “It’ll change how users in a majority of roles in most industries do everyday things like write emails, build spreadsheets and put together presentations.” Forward-thinking HR tech vendors anticipated this shift and continue to enhance their products accordingly. Steve Boese, program chair of the HR Technology Conference and co-founder of H3 HR Advisors, notes, “The skills conversations have led to more development and innovation in many of the core areas of talent management like learning, succession planning, career pathing and more.”
Currently, researchers say, it is premature for many organizations to cut jobs with the expectation that generative AI can serve as a substitute. While the technology may seem ready, there is still a need to identify individuals with the right skills to drive employee success, business sustainability and end-user satisfaction.

Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

Artificial Intelligence Likely To Augment, Not Destroy Jobs – OpEd

The growing new global phenomenon—Artificial Intelligence (AI)—has sparked both positive and negative reactions, including a perceived threat that it will eventually replace humans in most workplaces.





But a new study, Generative AI and Jobs: A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality, points out that most jobs and industries are only partly exposed to automation and are more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by the latest wave of Generative AI, such as ChatGPT.
The study, released on August 21 by the Geneva-based International Labour Organization (ILO), says the greatest impact of this technology is likely to be “not job destruction but rather the potential changes to the quality of jobs, notably work intensity, and autonomy”.
Clerical work had the most significant technological exposure, with nearly a quarter of tasks considered highly exposed and more than half of tasks having medium-level exposure.
In other occupational groups—including managers, professionals, and technicians—only a tiny share of tasks were highly exposed, while about a quarter had medium exposure levels.
The study, which is global in scope, documents notable differences in the effects on countries at different levels of development linked to current economic structures and existing technological gaps.





Among its findings: about 5.5 per cent of total employment in high-income countries is potentially exposed to the automating effects of the technology, whereas in low-income countries, the risk of automation concerns only some 0.4 per cent of employment.
On the other hand, the potential for augmentation is nearly equal across countries, suggesting that with the right policies in place, this new wave of technological transformation could offer important benefits for developing countries, according to the study.
Robert Whitfield, Chair of the Transnational Working Group on AI of the World Federalist Movement / Institute for Global Policy, told IDN it a serious study, indicating a shift in jobs under threat from repetitive, low-skilled jobs to knowledge jobs.
“Whilst it might appear to be good news for developing countries, the study assumes that the tasks being assessed would be executed in high-income countries—and therefore with the economic gap between developed and developing countries widening,” said Whitfield, who is also Chair of the One World Trust.
The study also points out that the potential effects of Generative AI are likely to differ significantly for men and women, with more than twice the share of female employment potentially affected by automation.
This is due to women’s over-representation in clerical work, especially in high and middle-income countries. Since clerical jobs have traditionally been an important source of female employment as countries develop economically, one result of Generative AI could be that certain clerical jobs may never emerge in lower-income countries.
Socioeconomic impacts 
The study concludes that the socioeconomic impacts of Generative AI will largely depend on how its diffusion is managed, and it argues the need to design policies that support an orderly, fair, and consultative transition.
“Workers’ voice, skills training, and adequate social protection will be key to managing the transition. Otherwise, there is a risk that only a few well-prepared countries and market participants will benefit from the new technology.
The authors also note that the “outcomes of the technological transition are not pre-determined. It is humans behind the decision to incorporate such technologies, and humans need to guide the transition process”.
Meanwhile, the United Nations is developing “a Code of Conduct for Information Integrity on Digital Platforms”—ahead of the UN Summit of the Future scheduled to take place in September 2024.
“The Code of Conduct will be a set of principles that we hope governments, digital platforms and other stakeholders will implement voluntarily,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres told reporters on June 12.
The proposals in this policy brief, in preparation for the Code, include:
– A commitment by Governments, tech companies and other stakeholders to refrain from using, supporting, or amplifying disinformation and hate speech for any purpose.
– A pledge by Governments to guarantee a free, viable, independent, and plural media landscape with strong protections for journalists.
– The consistent application of policies and resources by digital platforms worldwide to eliminate double standards that allow hate speech and disinformation to flourish in some languages and countries while they are prevented more effectively in others.
– And agreed protocols for a rapid response by governments and digital platforms when the stakes are highest—in times of conflict and high social tensions.
– Plus, a commitment from digital platforms to ensure all products account for safety, privacy, and transparency.
Citing a report from the Center for AI Safety, the New York Times reported on May 31 that a group of over 350 AI industry leaders warned that artificial intelligence poses a growing new danger to humanity and should be considered a “societal risk on a par with pandemics and nuclear wars”.
“We must take those warnings seriously. Our proposed Global Digital Compact, New Agenda for Peace, and Accord on the global governance of AI will offer multilateral solutions based on human rights,” Guterres said.
“But the advent of generative AI must not distract us from the damage digital technology already does to our world. The proliferation of hate and lies in the digital space is causing grave global harm—now. It is fueling conflict, death, and destruction—now. It is threatening democracy and human rights—now. It is undermining public health and climate action—now,” he warned.
Meanwhile, the Paris-based UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) calls on governments to implement appropriate regulations and teacher training to ensure a human-centered approach to using Generative AI in education.
To this end, the agency has published its first global Guidance on Generative AI in Education and Research, designed to address the disruptions caused by Generative AI technologies.
UNESCO said that generative AI can be an opportunity for human development but can also cause harm and prejudice. It adds that it cannot be integrated into education without public engagement and the necessary safeguards and regulations from governments.

Cognitive technologies are already at the forefront of a significant change in the conception and execution of work processes in organizations. Organizations are using these technologies more frequently as they radically reinvent their work architectures. In the post-COVID world, defining work would depend heavily on leveraging these technologies. Cloud-based solutions now serve as the foundation of every IT toolkit. From the standpoint of the employee experience, businesses are seeking to improve workplace security while simultaneously changing how they provide services to their customers through more surveillance and expedited processes. The world therefore will be about finding the right balance between human intervention and technology. Automation cannot replace humansThere is a widespread misconception that automation and artificial intelligence (AI) is aiming to replace the workforce. However, this is untrue. Businesses must consider how to incorporate AI into current procedures since it offers enormous potential for expansion. A successful human-automation strategy takes into account how AI and automation can improve the customer experience while also empowering employees. The need to realign the current talent acquisition and management procedures in multiple ways is a result of companies looking for new tactics for acquiring and retaining people.Reallocation: As expectations and skill sets evolve, it will be necessary to reallocate the workforce. Employers can remap their current workforce to meet changing demands in new technological fields by using individuals with higher levels of ability. People with finer skills and relatively more work experience, working in professions that don't harness these attributes will have to reposition themselves, while those with more creative ability may move to suitable departments. Or, a given job's tasks can be divided and reorganized in various ways, either by redesigning company procedures or lateral shifting the staff to match the skill and demand better.Reskilling: The ability of employees to reskill will determine the success of the future workforce, and businesses must make significant investments in educating and training their staff in cutting-edge technologies and specialized digital fields so that they can take on difficult tasks. For individuals aiming to maximize automation and AI, advanced IT skills, coding knowledge, critical thinking, and problem-solving talents are crucial.Recruiting: The need for competent workers may outpace their supply in many areas. By introducing intelligent matching criteria, AI can be utilized to speed up the process of employing workers who have received the necessary training. Matching staffing needs with skills outside of the current portfolio will also be possible. Freelancers and gig workers can provide pre-made skills right now, but this is only useful for non-core or temporary needs.Drawing the line between automation and workforceThe widespread use of automation and AI has resulted in the creation of around 97 million new employees. In contrast, the division of labor between people and machines will result in the displacement of 85 million job roles by 2025. This puts forth a huge opportunity for businesses to clear the line between automation and workforce. They must use workplace data to make wise decisions and prevent automation-related job losses. They must use AI tools in areas where employees are wasting time and contributing little to the bottom line. It is also crucial to establish a new hybrid workforce culture in which data and technology are regarded as tools that help people and not enslave them or make them obsolete. This will grow more challenging as AI becomes smarter and more thoroughly integrated into every element of a business. Balancing technology and workforceAlthough automation can increase production while requiring less labor, technology is not always the ideal solution. Humans may not be as quick or efficient at some things, but their skill set is considerably more varied and dynamic. Robots, on the other hand, excel at executing a single task. Technology can help us with work-related duties, but it can also make some tasks more difficult, such as managing a remote workforce that is dispersed around the globe. Just as technology can raise friction and distance between employees and employers, it can also exacerbate issues between companies and their customers. Paradoxically, achieving the ideal balance of technology and human interaction in the future will need careful use of technology, not just to reduce transaction costs but also to provide long-term value for businesses and worthwhile employment for people. Technology is bound to render certain tasks obsolete. However, we don't need to be alarmed by this reality. Instead of attempting to thwart progress, we should concentrate on wisely utilizing technology.The removal of people from the process is not possible through automation. Instead, technology gives us various opportunities to work ""smarter."" By having computers do the manual labor while humans take on more intellectually demanding tasks in the process, we have the opportunity to increase human productivity. We can all benefit from a more productive society that is also better educated and happier if we let technology operate in this way. This is the reason why this isn't just a post-pandemic phenomenon; it's the tale of the workplace of the future, one that will be propelled by employee empowerment.(Views expressed are personal)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,contactus@ettelecom.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",,,,,,

In fact, according to the most re&shy;cent research and market surveys, by 2025, AI will increase annual&shy;ly at a rate of 52%, meaning that businesses all over the world will adopt it swiftly. National securi&shy;ty, healthcare, logistics, and ed&shy;ucation are just a handful of the sectors using AI right now. The World Economic Forum estimates that automation in the developing world might result in the loss of two-thirds of jobs. The population of Pakistan and the stability of its government may be significantly impacted by this. Another factor that may in&shy;crease the negative impacts of job loss due to AI automation is Paki&shy;stan&rsquo;s lack of access to education and technology. It is crucial to re&shy;member that the influence of gen&shy;erative AI on the labour market in Pakistan is likely to be complicat&shy;ed and multidimensional and will depend on a range of factors, in&shy;cluding the particular industries and job categories in question as well as governmental policies and regulations. Inter Miami stars Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez to miss MLS All-Star Game Positively, generative AI can boost production and efficiency, which will benefit the Pakistani economy. It can boost productiv&shy;ity in manufacturing and agricul&shy;ture by automating specialised op&shy;erations like data processing and decision-making. Increased pro&shy;ductivity and economic expansion may result from this. Additional&shy;ly, the application of generative AI in developing nations can open up new job prospects in AI-relat&shy;ed industries like data analysis, software development, and ma&shy;chine learning in Pakistan, where unemployment is already high. It can also aid in enhancing school&shy;ing. For students, it can be uti&shy;lised to design tailored learning experiences. This could result in better educational achievements and more people having access to school in developing nations. It&rsquo;s crucial to keep in mind that the beneficial effects of generative AI in Pakistan will be influenced by the availability of resources like ener&shy;gy, internet connectivity, and a com&shy;petent workforce, as well as by gov&shy;ernmental rules and regulations. A few countries are making signifi&shy;cant investments in AI. Developed nations are gaining an advantage by moving first. Pakistan should, there&shy;fore, work to provide a better set&shy;ting for the application of AI. Assailant kills 6 people and wounds 6 others at a care home in central Croatia, officials say ENGR.
