Cognitive scientist and Dartmouth professor John McCarthy coined the term artificial intelligence (AI) in 1955 when he began his exploration of whether machines could learn and develop formal reasoning like humans. More than 60 years later, AI is the hottest tech topic of the day, from the boardroom to the breakroom.
The vast majority of technology executives (91 percent) and 84 percent of the general public believe that AI constitutes the next technology revolution, according to Edelman’s 2019 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Survey. PwC has predicted that AI could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Of course, it’s already having an impact all around us. AI powers voice-based devices, filters our email, and guides our search results. One in five respondents said their organizations plan to implement AI enterprise-wide this year, according to the PwC 2019 AI Predictions Survey.
While AI has fueled more than a little bit of hype, enterprises are indeed trying to get down to business - before rivals do. As noted in our Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report, An Executive’s Guide to Real-World AI, “Hype in tech is nothing new. What’s different this time is the degree to which reasonable and knowledgeable people believe that there is, indeed, a real urgency to get going with AI now.”
Dan Vesset, group vice president, analytics and information management, at market research firm IDC, warns, “If you’re not starting to invest, there’s the real possibility of being left behind forever.”
That’s because companies need foundational pieces in place to be successful with AI, as the report notes. These include talent, which is in short supply; having the right data infrastructure as well as sufficient quantity and quality of data to train your models; deciding how AI will be governed; and managing change in the organization.

 Just because everyone is talking about AI does not mean they understand it.
However, just because everyone is talking about AI does not mean they understand it. As Red Hat technologist Gordon Haff recently wrote, AI projects in the past have often tried to boil the ocean - to solve multi-faceted problems like self-driving cars. Today’s enterprise AI projects are more practical, often focusing on customer experience pain points. “What’s happening with AI today is exciting in part because it involves practical solutions that address complexity, the need to handle more and more data, and demanding customers,” Haff noted. “McKinsey says, 75 percent of online customers expect help now.”
As demand for AI-enabled initiatives continues to increase, CIOs and IT leaders will need to clarify for non-technical constituents what AI is – and what it isn’t.
AI definitions
While AI and machine learning (ML) and deep learning may often be used interchangeably, the latter two are subsets of the broader category of artificial intelligence.
[ Read also: How to explain machine learning in plain English. ]
Here are a few basic AI definitions that may prove useful when discussing the topic:
“AI is the use of intricate logic or advanced analytical methods to perform simple tasks at greater scale in ways that mean we can do more at large scale with the workers we have, allowing them to focus on what humans are best at, like handling complex exceptions or demonstrating sympathy.” –Whit Andrews, vice president and distinguished analyst with Gartner Research
“Put simply, AI is a technology solution that helps the enterprise get more done with fewer resources by automating mundane, data-heavy tasks. More specifically, AI is a computerized simulation of human intelligence that can be programmed to make decisions, carry out specific tasks, and learn from the results.” –Zachary Jarvinen, head of technology strategy, AI and analytics at OpenText
“AI is a mathematical and algorithmic model that allows computers to learn to do tasks without being explicitly programmed to do those tasks.” –Timothy Havens, the William and Gloria Jackson Associate Professor of Computer Systems in the College of Computing at Michigan Technological University and director of the Institute of Computing and Cybersystems
Bonus: The bicycle analogy
The child learning to ride falls a few times, honing their skills each time they fail. That’s AI in a nutshell.
For those who prefer analogies, Havens likens the way AI works to learning to ride a bike: “You don’t tell a child to move their left foot in a circle on the left pedal in the forward direction while moving your right foot in a circle… You give them a push and tell them to keep the bike upright and pointed forward: the overall objective. They fall a few times, honing their skills each time they fail,” Havens says. “That’s AI in a nutshell.”
[ Is RPA a kind of AI? See our related post: Robotic Process Automation (RPA) vs. AI, explained. ]
AI 101: How AI works
So how does it work? “AI matches the data about circumstances in a business or technical process to its outcomes so that developers can make desirable outcomes more common using the people you have,” says Gartner’s Andrews.
The AI on your phone, in your car, or on the Internet ingests those massive volumes of data and produces an implicit model that best optimizes some predetermined objective or reward function, Havens says.
“Usually that objective is represented by some calculated measure of how often the AI is correct in its outputs,"" Havens says. ""AI learns very much the way humans do – except AI can ride, fall off the bike, a readjust millions and millions of times a second.”
Typically, AI analyzes historical data to make predictions about the future.
Typically, AI analyzes historical data to make predictions about the future. Let’s take a real estate app as an example: “By using algorithms, the computer can analyze massive amounts of data on past home sales, school districts, transportation and traffic patterns, and more to make an estimate on a homes’ value, cost per square foot, and more,” Jarvinen says. “As the application collects more data from users and public information on sales, it learns, and the predictions become more accurate.”
AI vs. jobs
For some time, there has been fear and uncertainty about the impact of AI on human employment. Will these machines rise up and take all of our jobs?
Unlikely. For one thing, AI isn’t that advanced yet. “The robots aren’t coming to get us. And to go beyond that, AI is not even intelligent in the way humans are yet,” says Havens. “AI can precisely do calculations and perform inferences using billions of data points, but AI systems currently are not generalized intelligence.”
40 percent of respondents from Global 2000 organizations plan to add more jobs as a result of AI adoption. Source: 2019 Dun & Bradstreet report.
In fact, 40 percent of respondents from Global 2000 organizations say that they are adding more jobs as a result of AI adoption, according to a 2019 Dun & Bradstreet report, while only 8 percent are eliminating jobs as a result of implementing AI capabilities. Around one-third (34 percent) reported that there was no change in HR needs as a result of AI.
In any case, say AI experts, outright automation is the wrong focus for applied AI in the enterprise. AI adds the most value as an augmentation of human decision-making and interactions, complementing human skills for exponentially better outcomes. “The greatest misconception by far is that AI is a replacement of the workforce when it is, in fact, aimed at enhancing the workforce through augmentation,” says Jarvinen. “AI is about helping employees deal with mundane tasks (such as data entry or alert validation) so they can focus on the things that matter (such a speaking with customers or dealing with security threats).”
Gartner predicts that 80 percent of project management tasks that would typically be handled by a person today will be eliminated by AI by 2030, spanning traditional project management functions such as data collection, tracking, and reporting. Within IT and other business functions, such as finance, salaries for AI roles continue to rise. 
What about enterprise use cases for AI? Let’s explore:

    AI 101: What is artificial intelligence and where is it going?

Algorithms, the building blocks of artificial intelligence, are detailed, step-by-step instructions for completing a task.  (James Abundis / Seattle Times)

Seattle Times staff reporter 


The phrase “artificial intelligence” in pop culture often conjures up dystopian images such as the sentient computer Hal 9000 from the 1968 film “2001: A Space Odyssey” that killed people for its self preservation; or the cyborg assassin with a metal endoskeleton in director James Cameron’s “The Terminator.” In recent years, our fascination with the potential of AI has taken a more starry-eyed turn, as shown in the 2013 sci-fi drama “Her,” where the main character falls in love with a virtual assistant.In reality, artificial intelligence (AI) technology is quickly permeating every aspect of our lives. From Amazon’s voice-activated Alexa to writing technology that helps managers craft job postings, AI is in our hearts, homes and workplaces. And it’s only going to become a bigger part of our lives: Experts call the rise of AI the driving force behind the fourth industrial revolution.The A.I. Age | This 12-month series of stories explores the social and economic questions arising from the fast-spreading uses of artificial intelligence. The series is funded with the help of the Harvard-MIT Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative. Seattle Times editors and reporters operate independently of our funders and maintain editorial control over the coverage.On a recent afternoon at the NVIDIA robotics research lab in Seattle’s University District, researchers use a simulated kitchen to test robots’ ability to perform simple tasks such as grabbing objects. A 5-feet 7-inch tall white robot, basically a spindly arm affixed with a claw of the sort customarily found in an arcade vending machine, glided around the kitchen on its two Segway wheels.Following the command of a research scientist sitting at a nearby computer, the robot grabbed a Cheez-It box on the counter and extended its limb to gently place the snacks inside a cabinet.“What’s deceptive is that what’s simple to us in the kitchen is challenging for a robot,” said University of Washington Computer Science and Engineering Professor Dieter Fox, who also serves as the lab’s senior director of robotics research. The Silicon Valley-based technology company opened the robotics lab last fall to harness the UW’s talent in a sector where Seattle plays a central role.Still, paranoia around the capabilities of AI technology persist. When we recently asked readers what they want to know about AI, many focused on the negative. We received questions such as, “How will we know when we aren’t in control?” and “When will it be against the law to make, produce and distribute since it is a patent danger to humans?” Others voiced concerns about the potential that AI will displace workers. Such worry was reflected in a recent Northeastern University and Gallup survey that found 71 percent of Americans feared the surge in AI would cause more job loss than gain.

We’re here to clear up confusion, and highlight the pros and cons of AI technology. Over the coming months, The Seattle Times will explore the social and economic effects of AI by examining regulation of the technology, privacy concerns and the changing landscape of labor in the AI Age. This piece will explain some of the terms you’ll hear, and look at examples of AI around us.But first, let’s go over the basics.Robots entered the cultural imagination about 100 years ago in the Czech play R.U.R., in which artificial people wipe out humans. A seminal moment for AI came a few decades later, when the British mathematician Alan Turing proposed the first test to measure a computer’s intelligence in his 1950 paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence.The Turing test analyzed whether a machine has developed a humanlike level of awareness through a test that involved one human and one machine respondent, and a human judge placed in another room who would ask the two contestants questions for five minutes. If the judge mistook the machine for a human more than 30% of the time, the computer was determined to have artificial intelligence — a test that many researchers believe has yet to be passed.Computer scientist John McCarthy coined the phrase “artificial intelligence” in 1956, later describing it as the “science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.” In the decades since, AI has continually reached new milestones.In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue computer for the first time defeated a professional player in a six-game chess match, demonstrating the calculating abilities of computers. This July, Facebook and Carnegie Mellon University announced they’d created an AI program called Pluribus that defeated five top players in the popular poker game Texas Hold’em, suggesting AI has reached a level of strategic reasoning that surpasses humans, the researchers said. Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor Tuomas Sandholm said the research behind Pluribus could be applied to real-world scenarios including optimizing strategies in investment banking.Common termsAs AI becomes more widespread, you’ll hear a lot of new terms, such as deep learning, deepfakes, algorithms and natural language processing. Here’s a guide to some of those concepts and how you may unknowingly cross paths with them.

AlgorithmsAlgorithms are mathematical formulas that amount to a set of processing instructions — akin to a recipe — that aim to solve a specific problem. In some AI systems, algorithms are designed to allow the program to learn on its own. For instance, if a robot followed a recipe to mix together flour, eggs and milk, then placed the ingredients in a preheated oven to bake a cake, it might learn over several attempts — a data set — that too much flour would make the cake dry.Machine learningEver wonder how Netflix, out of thousands of titles, recommends a few TV shows that match your tastes? Or how an ad for the Wayfair rug you’ve been eyeing popped up on your Facebook feed? It’s not magic, it’s an analytics system called machine learning that finds patterns in a large amount of data. Platforms such as Facebook make recommendations by collecting information about users, including their browsing history, age and online purchasing habits, to make inferences about future choices or preferences.Machine learning comes in three forms: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Most practical applications of AI are found in supervised learning, which is used when workers annotate images that are fed into software. For instance, autonomous vacuums are taught how to clean without running into objects through the use of algorithms and the labeling of images of rooms that serve as training data for the technology.When people purchase mattresses online, customers’ information is pooled into a large database and unsupervised learning finds patterns to predict future purchasing habits. Based on the actions of other customers who purchase mattresses, for example, the algorithm could determine that the person is likely to buy a bed frame next. Unsupervised learning is when a system goes on a fishing expedition to find underlying patterns in information without a specific goal in mind.The AI bot Pluribus beat five top poker players in Texas Hold ‘em through reinforcement learning — it improved its results by learning which bets were likely to win more money, and analyzed its hands afterward to determine whether alternatives would have yielded better results. In reinforcement learning, a system teaches itself through trial and error.Deep learningJust as human brains learn to recognize various people through knowledge and experience, self-driving cars can be trained to recognize pedestrians and objects on roads through an AI subset called deep learning. Relying on numerous layers of algorithms to sift through and process large amounts of data, deep learning utilizes a web of computation models called “neural networks” that are designed to mimic human brains. The more driving experience the car has, the more likely it is to recognize humans in their various colors, shapes and sizes. This type of deep learning is also at work when Facebook suggests name tags on images that are uploaded to its platform. The technology called facial recognition analyzes a person’s face by measuring the distance between facial features and uses algorithms to find a match.Natural language processingHave you wondered how Siri understands that you need the directions to Sammy’s house and not the sandwich store? Or how a transcript of a voice mail is sent to your email inbox when you’ve missed a call? Thank natural language processing (NLP). NLP technology uses machine-learning algorithms that tag parts of speech and the relationships between words to analyze the meaning in text and audio. Gmail’s Smart Compose feature, unveiled last year, takes NLP a step further by offering users suggestions to complete a sentence in the body of an email.Deepfake technologyAnother new application of AI, deepfake technology, uses deep learning models to manipulate photos and videos to create realistic images of people doing or saying something they never did, sometimes for nefarious reasons. Watch out for deepfake videos that depict fabricated political speech in the upcoming election cycle!

Region is an AI hubThe presence of the two tech giants Amazon and Microsoft has made the Puget Sound area a veritable hub for artificial intelligence. Combine those with the University of Washington, and “we have a strong flow of really talented scientists and engineers who’ve grown to call Seattle home,” said Eric Boyd, who oversees development of Microsoft’s AI tools.

Microsoft’s cloud-computing service for artificial intelligence, Azure AI, allows developers and data scientists to easily add capabilities such as translation and image recognition to their projects. For office workers, AI tools in Microsoft 365 offers suggestions to complete projects in Word, PowerPoint and Excel. AI-powered speech recognition tools in the translation and transcription service Translator are also used in lectures to provide captions on a screen for students who are deaf or hard of hearing.One way Amazon is transforming the retail sector is through its checkout-free shopping at Amazon Go. Amazon Go uses computer vision, multiple sensors and deep learning — the same technologies found in autonomous cars — to automatically detect when a customer takes items from shelves and walks out of the store. An AI-powered feature on the Amazon app called StyleSnap allows shoppers to customize their wardrobes by uploading a photo or screenshot of a style they admire. The StyleSnap option uses computer vision and deep learning to classify the clothes and offer recommendations for similar items found on the site that match the shopper’s desired look.Meanwhile, the Amazon virtual assistant Alexa uses natural language processing and machine-learning algorithms to enable more than 90,000 tasks, such as listening to music on command, calling friends and family, booking hotel rooms and controlling light switches.

“We have been working with advanced technologies like machine learning for decades, but we are only in the beginning stages of understanding the possibilities and how invention can improve lives for good by helping solve the big (and small) problems we all face every day,” Amazon’s Vice President of the Core AI team, Pat Bajari, said in an email.Still scared?Meanwhile, AI technology is transforming the retail, automotive and hospitality industry worldwide. Automated check-ins and robots are becoming more commonplace in hotels, and retail stores such as Walmart have rolled out autonomous floor cleaners and smart conveyor belts to keep up with competitors such as Kroger and Whole Foods.Concerned about job security, hotel workers around the nation have created contract language that grants employees some say in the deployment of technology. In recent months, dockworkers have protested and launched petitions to thwart projected job losses after the Port of Los Angeles’ decision to deploy automated vehicles. Some AI experts argue it is unrealistic to expect all manual laborers to become data analysts. Society should redirect people who lack higher education to jobs that draw on the uniquely human trait of empathy, said Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Seattle-based Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. As a step to finding new careers for people displaced by advancements in artificial intelligence and automation, Etzioni has suggested wage increases for caregivers and the creation of government programs to train a new generation of caretakers.“You don’t want a robot taking care of your baby; an ailing elder needs to be loved, to be listened to, fed, and sung to. This is one job category that people are — and will continue to be — best at,” Etzioni wrote in a Wired article.

On a more positive note, a 2018 report from World Economic Forum — a nonprofit composed of the world’s 1,000 top companies — predicts that while 75 million jobs will be displaced by automation, it will generate 133 million new roles across all industries within the next three years if workers receive continuous retraining.

What’s the future of AI?There’s already a backlash against the application of some forms of AI technology. In recent months, several cities and states have banned or considered a moratorium on facial-recognition technology after reports of its potential for misuse. A recent Washington Post investigation, for instance, showed Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents used the software to scan millions of Americans’ driver’s licenses without their consent in order to track down undocumented immigrants and identify suspects.A growing number of AI experts and politicians agree that the advancements in AI have outpaced government regulation. Technology companies such as Microsoft, followed by Amazon, have urged Congress to issue federal guidelines on the use of facial-recognition technology.Meanwhile, some politicians seek to expand government support of AI. U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) introduced legislation in May to fund AI developments over the next 10 years. Backers say the bipartisan Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act seeks to prepare an AI workforce and deploy ethically responsible AI tools for private, government and academic use.Although the next stop remains unknown, the AI train isn’t stopping anytime soon. As World Economic Forum Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab aptly summarized the Fourth Industrial Revolution, “There has never been a time of greater promise or greater peril.”

  Professor’s perceptron paved the way for AI – 60 years too soon

In July 1958, the U.S. Office of Naval Research unveiled a remarkable invention.
An IBM 704 – a 5-ton computer the size of a room – was fed a series of punch cards. After 50 trials, the computer taught itself to distinguish cards marked on the left from cards marked on the right.
It was a demonstration of the “perceptron” – “the first machine which is capable of having an original idea,” according to its creator, Frank Rosenblatt ’50, Ph.D. ’56.
At the time, Rosenblatt – who later became an associate professor of neurobiology and behavior in Cornell’s Division of Biological Sciences – was a research psychologist and project engineer at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in Buffalo, New York.
“Stories about the creation of machines having human qualities have long been a fascinating province in the realm of science fiction,” Rosenblatt wrote in 1958. “Yet we are about to witness the birth of such a machine – a machine capable of perceiving, recognizing and identifying its surroundings without any human training or control.”
He was right – but it took half a century to prove it.

“The foundations for all of this artificial intelligence were laid at Cornell.”

Thorsten Joachims, professor in CIS



The first serious rival
Rosenblatt’s claims drew keen interest from reporters and the nascent computing community. “NEW NAVY DEVICE LEARNS BY DOING: Psychologist Shows Embryo of Computer Designed to Read and Grow Wiser,” a New York Times headline read. The New Yorker wrote: “Indeed, it strikes us as the first serious rival to the human brain ever devised.”

But skeptics insisted the perceptron was incapable of reshaping the relationship between human and machine. Enthusiasm waned. The perceptron’s rise and fall helped usher in an era known as the “AI winter” – decades in which federal funding for artificial intelligence research dried up. When Rosenblatt died in 1971, his research centered on injecting material from trained rats’ brains into the brains of untrained rats.
Today, many believe Rosenblatt has been vindicated. The principles underlying the perceptron helped spark the modern artificial intelligence revolution. Deep learning and neural networks – which can classify online images, for example, or enable language translation – are transforming society.
As the Faculty of Computing and Information Science (CIS) celebrates its 20th year, Rosenblatt’s prescient research underscores Cornell’s pivotal role in computing history.
“The perceptron was the first neural network,” said Thorsten Joachims, professor in CIS, who teaches about Rosenblatt and the perceptron in his Introduction to Machine Learning course. “The foundations for all of this artificial intelligence were laid at Cornell.”

Frank Rosenblatt



Born in 1928, Rosenblatt grew up in New Rochelle, New York, a suburb of New York City, and attended the Bronx High School of Science. At Cornell, he majored in social psychology and earned his Ph.D. in psychology.
This research led him to computing. As a doctoral student, he built an “Electronic Profile Analyzing Computer” to analyze personality data for his dissertation. When he later developed the perceptron, his goal was to solve the mysteries of the brain.
“He wanted to ask himself what are the minimum number of things that a brain has to have physically in order to perform the amazing things it does,” said Richard O’Brien, former director of Cornell’s Division of Biological Sciences, at Rosenblatt’s memorial service.
Inspired by the way neurons work together in the brain, the perceptron is a single-layer neural network – an algorithm that classifies input into two possible categories. The neural network makes a prediction – say, right or left; or dog or cat – and if it’s wrong, tweaks itself to make a more informed prediction next time. It becomes more accurate over thousands or millions of iterations.

In 1959, when Rosenblatt brought the perceptron to the Ithaca campus and became director of Cornell’s Cognitive Systems Research Program and a lecturer in psychology, he was optimistic that breakthroughs lay just ahead.
“We really thought we were on to something,” said Bill Eisner ’62, who worked for Rosenblatt as a programmer. “We had the idea that we were doing some new kind of computing. … It was a kick to be a part of it.”
Eisner was part of a team of mostly graduate students working on a different type of perceptron, the Tobermory. Named after the talking cat in an H.H. Munro story, the Tobermory was designed to recognize speech. It was Rosenblatt’s follow-up to his Mark I perceptron, a visual pattern classifier.

Rosenblatt and the perceptron.



“Frank was the thinker, and we were the worker bees,” said Terrell Koken, recruited by Rosenblatt as a 16-year-old Cornell freshman. Koken, who never graduated, met Rosenblatt over a conversation about Fermat’s Last Theorem in the music lounge – a frequent haunt for “techies, nut cases and nerds,” he said.
Koken was interested in astronomy, and Rosenblatt became interested, too. Rosenblatt bought a $3,000 telescope so large he had no place to put it. So he bought a sprawling house in nearby Brooktondale, New York, and invited several of his graduate students to live there. By day, the team worked on the Tobermory. By night, they built an observatory in Rosenblatt’s yard.
“We were all pretty gung-ho about it,” Koken said. “We went out into the pasture and dug foundations. Frank did most of the masonry.”
Rosenblatt’s interests ranged from astronomy to music, mountaineering and politics. He helped campaign for Sen. Eugene McCarthy (who spoke at Rosenblatt’s memorial service); and after the 1969 student occupation of Willard Straight Hall he was heavily involved in improving the campus climate.
But the perceptron was his passion.
“On a scale of 1 to 10, he would have rated its significance 10,” said George Nagy, Ph.D. ‘62, a retired professor of computer engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Rosenblatt’s advisee. “During my career I got to know some very bright persons. Knowing Frank made me appreciate the difference between ‘very bright’ and ‘genius.’”
Minsky vs. Rosenblatt
Rosenblatt called him “the loyal opposition.”
Marvin Minsky, who was a grade behind Rosenblatt at the Bronx High School of Science, was an MIT professor whose research into neural networks left him deeply skeptical of Rosenblatt’s claims.
At conferences, Rosenblatt and Minsky publicly debated the perceptron’s viability, as their colleagues and students looked on in amazement.

Frank Rosenblatt, left, and Charles W. Wightman work on part of the unit that became the first perceptron in December 1958.



“I was a graduate student at the time, and it was mind-boggling to me to listen,” said Charles Tappert, M.S. ’62, Ph.D. ’67, a professor of computer science at Pace University who has organized two conferences in honor of his former adviser.
“Rosenblatt had a vision that he could make computers see and understand language,” Joachims said. “And Marvin Minsky pointed out that that’s not going to happen, because the functions are just too simple.”
The problem was, Rosenblatt’s perceptron had only one layer, while modern neural networks have millions.
“What Rosenblatt wanted was to show the machine objects and have it recognize those objects. And 60 years later, that’s what we’re finally able to do,” Joachims said. “So he was heading on the right track, he just needed to do it a million times over. At the time, he didn’t know how to train networks with multiple layers. But in hindsight, his algorithm is still fundamental to how we’re training deep networks today.”
In 1969, Minsky and Seymour Papert published “Perceptrons,” a book that assailed Rosenblatt’s work and, essentially, sealed its fate. The following year, Minsky won the A.M. Turing Award – computing’s highest honor.
Rosenblatt didn’t outlive the AI winter. In 1971, he drowned while sailing a sloop called the Shearwater in Chesapeake Bay on his 43rd birthday.

“…He would reach out and grasp the biggest problems that he could see…”

Richard O’Brien, former director of Cornell’s Division of Biological Sciences



Within human grasp
But Rosenblatt knew he was playing a long game.
“He would never, as prudent professors do, pick out some small aspect of the physical universe which could be studied and could reasonably be expected to produce solutions in a year or two,” O’Brien said at his memorial service.

“Instead, he would reach out and grasp the biggest problems that he could see, and apply himself, throw himself into the study of them, without any recognition of the fact that if he made bad choices, or if he chose, as he usually did, problems which were not likely to yield a solution within 10 or 20 years, that this would redound to his disadvantage. He never worked that way.”
Rosenblatt’s Mark I perceptron now resides at the Smithsonian Institution, and in 2004, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers established the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award.
Former students said Rosenblatt never seemed bitter, even after losing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in government funds. “He was sorry for his colleagues and for his students, but somehow it didn’t impinge on him emotionally, as it would for many people,” O’Brien said.
“He lifted the veil and enabled us to examine all these possibilities, and see that ideas like this were within human grasp.”

Over the next decade, automation and artificial intelligence could throw 54 million Americans out of work. Here's everything you need to know:Why is automation a threat?Rapid technological advances are enabling machines to perform a growing number of tasks traditionally done by humans. Law firms now use artificial intelligence (AI) — ­sophisticated computer programs that can learn from ­experience — to conduct contract analysis, hunt for client conflicts, and even craft litigation strategy. McDon­ald's is replacing drive-thru workers with order-taking AI, and cashiers with self-checkout kiosks. Walmart is automating truck unloading, while Cal­i­for­nia farms are employing robots to harvest lettuce. From 1990 to 2007, robots replaced about 670,000 U.S. jobs, mostly in manufacturing; every robot introduced into a local economy claimed 6.2 jobs. That trend will accelerate over the next decade, as advances in mobile technology, AI, data transfer, and computing speeds allow robots to act with greater independence. Oxford Uni­ver­sity researchers concluded in a major 2013 study that 47 percent of Amer­i­can jobs are at ""high risk"" of automation within two decades. McKin­sey Global In­sti­tute came to a similar conclusion in 2017, warning that by 2030 robots will have forced 16 million to 54 million ­Americans — as many as a third of U.S. ­workers — to retrain for a new job.

What jobs are most at risk?LATEST VIDEOS FROM theweekTheWeekGenerally speaking, those involving repetitive physical tasks in predictable environments. For instance, some restaurants in China have already begun replacing servers with robots. The Palm Beach County Court recently began using four robots — Wally Bishop, Rosie Tobor, Kitt Robbie, and Speedy — to read court filings, fill out docket sheets, and input data into its case management system. In theory, at least 91 percent of a short-order cook's tasks can be automated using existing technology. It's 100 percent for a dredge operator, plasterer, stucco mason, motion picture projectionist, and logging equipment operator. Conversely, jobs that involve managing people, creative thinking, and social interaction will see less automation. But even the jobs you'd think are safe aren't. The Guardian Australia newspaper published its first article this year written entirely by a computer. The Indian e-­commerce site Myntra recently created one of its best-selling T-shirts by delegating the design to two algorithms that analyzed previous designs and invented new ones. Sales of AI-designed shirts are ""growing at 100 percent,"" said Ananth Narayanan, Myntra's CEO. ""It's working.""How will this affect the workforce?History has shown that previous apocalyptic warnings about technology wiping out the need for human labor have proved untrue — although there is often a difficult transition period to new jobs requiring new skills. In the 19th century, farmers rendered obsolete by mechanized agriculture found their way to new, better-paying jobs in factories. When industrial automation in the 20th century threatened factory workers, many of the displaced transitioned to service work (often with lower salaries, however). ""If history is any guide,"" McKinsey said in its study, ""we could also expect that 8 to 9 percent of 2030 labor demand will be in new types of occupations that have not existed before.""So will the impact be modest?Not necessarily. The futurist Martin Ford acknowledges the ""long record of false alarms,"" but argues that this time is different. The pace of automation, he says, is no longer linear, but exponential, like the growth in computing capacity predicted by Moore's Law. The economy, Ford says, will not have time to create new professions to absorb the tens of millions of workers displaced by automation. By some estimates, Amer­i­ca is less than a decade away from autonomous ­vehicles — and yet 3.5 million Amer­i­cans still work as truck drivers. White-collar jobs are also at risk for the first time, Ford says. On Wall Street, the number of financial workers has already plunged by 50,000 since 2000, as computers can process 100,000 transactions in a tenth of a second. Radiologists may lose their job analyzing medical images. Displaced workers might find new jobs, but at much lower salaries.How will this affect society?Predictions vary, but there is a lot of grim prognostication about a ""robot apocalypse."" The Demo­cratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang warns of an automation ""buzz saw"" that will eliminate millions of jobs and lead to political polarization, ""suicides, drug overdoses, anxiety, depression,"" as well as ""derelict buildings,"" ""jobless zones,"" and ""a hyper­strat­i­fied society like something out of The Hunger Games."" He, like tech titans Elon Musk and Mark Zuck­er­berg, believes it will be necessary for government to provide a universal basic income to each citizen. Meanwhile, there is some comfort to be had in the claim made late last year by a Forrester Research team that while 10 percent of American workers would lose their jobs to automation in 2019, artificial intelligence was ""still at least 100 years away from sending all of humanity on a permanent vacation.""The last 'robot apocalypse'Fear that automation would replace human workers has come in several waves in U.S. history. The most recent came during the 1950s, when World War II technologies were integrated into private industry and the computer chip was invented. Gen­eral Elec­tric ran an ad reminding people that robots replace ­""drudgery — not people,"" while IBM found office managers often too frightened to buy its computers out of fear the clever machines would eventually replace them too. ""Computers,"" IBM assured them, ""can only do what they are programmed to do."" The Nation called automation ""a ghost which frightens every worker in every plant,"" and the nonprofit Science Ser­vice complained, ""With the advent of the thinking machine, people are beginning to understand how horses felt when Ford invented the Model T."" In the end, Uni­ver­sity of Chi­ca­go economist Yale Brozen found that technology destroyed some 13 million jobs during the 1950s, but also created more than 20 million, as vast productivity growth led to the demand for more workers in aggregate — office personnel, engineers, maintenance staff — to keep pace with rising demand. ""The catastrophe that doom criers constantly threaten us with,"" Brozen wrote, ""has retreated into such a dim future that we simply cannot take their pronouncements seriously.""

Art Project Shows Racial Biases in Artificial Intelligence System
ImageNet Roulette reveals how little-explored classification methods are yielding ‘racist, misogynistic and cruel results’

Some of the labels proposed by ImageNet Roulette—an artificial intelligence classification tool created by artist Trevor Paglen and A.I. researcher Kate Crawford—are logical. A photograph of John F. Kennedy, for example, yields a suggestion of “politician,” while a snapshot of broadcast journalist Diane Sawyer is identified as “newsreader.” But not all tags are equal. After Tabong Kima, 24, uploaded a photograph of himself and a friend to the portal, he noted that ImageNet Roulette labeled him as “wrongdoer, offender.” 
“I might have a bad sense of humor,” Kima, who is African-American, wrote on Twitter, “but I don’t think this [is] particularly funny.”

Such “racist, misogynistic and cruel results” were exactly what Paglen and Crawford wanted to reveal with their tool.
“We want to show how layers of bias and racism and misogyny move from one system to the next,” Paglen tells the New York Times’ Cade Metz. “The point is to let people see the work that is being done behind the scenes, to see how we are being processed and categorized all the time.”


The duo’s project spotlighting artificial intelligence’s little-explored classification methods draws on more than 14 million photographs included in ImageNet, a database widely used to train artificial intelligence systems. Launched by researchers at Stanford University in 2009, the data set teaches A.I. to analyze and classify objects, from dogs to flowers and cars, as well as people. According to artnet News’ Naomi Rea, the labels used to teach A.I. were, in turn, supplied by lab staff and crowdsourced workers; by categorizing presented images in terms of race, gender, age and character, these individuals introduced “their own conscious and unconscious opinions and biases” into the algorithm.
Certain subsets outlined by ImageNet are relatively innocuous: for example, scuba diver, welder, Boy Scout, flower girl and hairdresser. Others—think bad person, adulteress, convict, pervert, spinster, jezebel and loser—are more charged. Many feature explicitly racist or misogynistic terms.
As Alex Johnson reports for NBC News, social media users noticed a recurring theme among ImageNet Roulette’s classifications: While the program identified white individuals largely in terms of occupation or other functional descriptors, it often classified those with darker skin solely by race. A man who uploaded multiple snapshots of himself in varying attire and settings was consistently labeled “black.” Another Twitter user who inputted a photograph of Democratic presidential candidates Andrew Yang and Joe Biden found that the former was erroneously identified as “Buddhist,” while the latter was simply deemed “grinner.”
“ImageNet is an object lesson, if you will, in what happens when people are categorized like objects,” Paglen and Crawford write in an essay accompanying the project.

Shortly after ImageNet Roulette went viral, the team behind the original database announced plans to remove 600,000 images featured in its “people” category. Per a statement, these pictures, representing more than half of all “people” photographs in the dataset, include those classified as “unsafe” (offensive regardless of context) or “sensitive” (potentially offensive depending on context).
Following ImageNet’s reversal, Paglen and Crawford said they welcomed the database’s “recognition of the problem” despite disagreeing on how to approach the issue moving forward.
“ImageNet Roulette has made its point,” they wrote, “... and so as of Friday, September 27th, 2019, we’re taking it off the internet.”
The tool will remain accessible as a physical art installation at Milan’s Fondazione Prada Osservertario through February 2020.

A new lab at The Ohio State University will tap into the power of artificial intelligence to transform the future of manufacturing.
Ohio State’s Center for Design and Manufacturing Excellence (CDME) opened the new Artificially Intelligent Manufacturing Systems Lab (AIMS) with the help of Lt. Gov. Jon Husted today.
At the heart of the 1,500-square-foot lab space on the university’s west campus are three Yaskawa robot arms that stretch from floor to ceiling. Husted used the programmed robots to cut a ceremonial red ribbon to open the new lab.
The AIMS lab was developed with input from industry, national defense and energy laboratories and university experts. It’s a first-of-its-kind test site for industry and academia to study and develop manufacturing systems that work with, and are controlled by, different types of artificial intelligence.
“The AIMS lab aims, pun intended, to be the bridge to these two communities and provide each of them an environment that would be difficult to create on their own,” said Michael Groeber, associate professor in the Department of Integrated Systems Engineering.
Groeber and Walt Hansen, senior lead engineer for student programs within CDME, jointly manage the lab. The two have developed a testbed to engage engineering, business and social science departments from across Ohio State’s campus.
“What is happening here with Ohio State and the College of Engineering is exactly what needs to happen here in Ohio – collaborating with industry partners, working to build the talent of the future, innovating and trying to find ways to be competitive and serve their customers,” Husted said.
Senior Vice President for Research Morley Stone said the lab will help bring industry and research together to make sure Ohio State is educating the next generation of students the right way.
“As an educational institution, that is just an amazing call we have. How do we begin to change and think about the workforce of the future?” he said. “I think this [lab] has the great benefit of showing that we can adapt and drive that future for the state.”
The new lab fits into CDME’s core mission of working with industry partners in applied research and supporting undergraduate student development during that research. The center helps industry partners work with university labs and equipment, in turn helping students become familiar with their products.
Ismael Shalash, a fourth-year aerospace engineering major, said working in the new lab is preparing him well for his career path.
“The engineering and manufacturing industry is all moving towards robotics, and implementing artificial intelligence with robotics is definitely the next step in the industry,” he said.

The Nittany AI Alliance awarded three Penn State student teams a combined total of $25,000 on Tuesday, September 10 at the Nittany AI Challenge Celebration event.
Students Christina Warren and Mathew Mancini developed Revu, a product designed to keep students engaged during reading assignments. Revu works by generating multiple-choice quizzes and other tests to measure comprehension of key concepts in order to keep students focused.
Warren and Mancini won $15,000 for their product. In the future, they hope to add features that will generate flashcards, save quizzes and notes, and design a mode specifically for instructors.
Students Amie Croteau, Ian Morrissey, Ethan Adams, Bryan Cruz Ulloa, and Austin Tucker came together to develop Resilient Resumes. They were awarded $5,000 for their work.




Resilient Resumes is a web application where students can organize their personal information and receive real-time, efficient feedback on how to improve their resume. The app works in association with Penn State Career Services and acts as an excellent resource for students on the search for internships or jobs after graduation.



Schreyer Honors College students Jack Mentch, Neil Ashtekar, Ishan Muzumdar, and Nikhil Nayyar, developed LionPad and won $5,000. The product’s purpose is to make the process of finding a student living situation effortless and uncomplicated.
Out of seven finalists, these three teams secured funding from members of an award committee to further their work in artificial intelligence. 
Students interested in participating in the 2020 Nittany AI Challenge are encouraged to attend upcoming workshops throughout the fall and spring semesters. The deadline to submit ideas for the 2020 Nittany AI Challenge is January 31, 2020.

Hear experts tackle some of the most important questions of our time in an interactive symposium that explores whether artificial intelligence (AI) will make the work of tomorrow better or worse. Attendees from a wide range of industries will brainstorm solutions that could ease the transition into a working world with a greater reliance on AI.Earlier post about the event:Are you worried artificial intelligence (AI) technology is coming for your job? Do you work in tech and wonder why people fear AI?On Nov. 6, The A.I. Age, a reporting project of The Seattle Times, will host a discussion that explores whether AI will make the working world better or worse. This is your chance to share those existential quandaries that Amazon’s Alexa couldn’t answer.We want workers, middle management, AI developers, policy makers and readers to walk away with a greater understanding of the emerging role of AI in the world of work, to address misconceptions and hear from experts with various perspectives on the topic.What resources, if any, are available for retail and transportation workers at risk of losing their jobs? In which sectors has AI adoption improved jobs by minimizing workloads? How can managers deploy AI technology in a way that empowers their workforce? What can policy makers do now to reduce economic inequality that may result from the spread of AI?Join us at the Impact Hub from 6:30-8:15 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 6 to explore these questions and more.

PricewaterhouseCoopers, the large accounting and management consulting firm, released a startling report indicating that workers will be highly impacted by the fast-growing rise of artificial intelligence, robots and related technologies.


Banking and financial services employees, factory workers and office staff will seemingly face the loss of their jobs—or need to find a way to reinvent themselves in this brave new world. 

 The term “artificial intelligence” is loosely used to describe the ability of a machine to mimic human behavior. AI includes well-known applications, such as Siri, GPS, Spotify, self-driving vehicles and the larger-than-life robots made by Boston Robotics that perform incredible feats.

While many reports tout the benefits of AI, there are many risks and unintended consequences, including the likelihood of replacing millions of human workers and unethical uses of the technology. For instance, China is using facial recognition to closely scrutinize its citizens who could be punished for certain transgressions. The country has been accused of using facial recognition to profile Muslims in its Xinjiang region. Recently, there were privacy concerns raised about FaceApp, the Russian-backed, face-ageing application.

Bloomberg reports that “more than 120 million workers globally will need retraining in the next three years due to artificial intelligence’s impact on jobs, according to an IBM survey.” The amount of individuals who will be impacted is immense. The world’s most advanced cities aren’t ready for the disruptions of artificial intelligence claims Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm. It is believed that over 50 million Chinese workers may require retraining as a result of AI-related deployment. The U.S. will be required to retool 11.5 million people in America with skills needed to survive in the workforce. Millions of workers in Brazil, Japan and Germany will need assistance with the changes wrought by AI, robotics and related technology.

While the study claims that employees can learn new skills, its logic is suspect to the realities. In an effort to save billions of dollars in labor costs, Amazon warehouses have thousands of little, cute, orange robots made by Kiva, a robotics company acquired by Amazon for $775 million. The Kiva robots needs only 15 minutes to find, pick and package an order, whereas a human needs about 60-75 minutes to accomplish the same tasks. I’ve spoken with workers at Amazon fulfillment centers and they claim that the pace and toll it takes on the human body is too much too handle. Humans simply can’t compete against robots due to our inherent limitations.

Mark Cuban, who became a billionaire with his tech company and is now the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said in a CNBC interview, “President Donald Trump should be more aware of tech advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence and how that will impact America’s future.” Cuban said, “I’m willing to bet that these companies building new plants...this will lead to fewer people being employed.”
“Computers, intelligent machine, and robots seem like the workforce of the future. And as more and more jobs are replaced by technology, people will have less work to do and ultimately will be sustained by payments from the government,” predicts Elon Musk, the cofounder and CEO of Tesla.
AI, robotics and technology will displace millions of workers. It's already happening. AI is used by investment banks, law and accounting firms, hospitals and corporations to displace people involved with rote activities and lower-end, white-collar jobs. If your job can be replaced by AI, it will—and you’ll need a new career.
This has already adversely impacted highly-paid Wall Street professionals including stock and bond traders. These are the people who used to work on the trading floors at investment bank and trade securities for their banks, clients and themselves. It was a very lucrative profession until algorithms, quant-trading software and programs disrupted the business and rendered their skills unnecessary—compared to the fast-acting technology. 
There is no hiding from the robots. Well-trained and experienced doctors will be pushed aside by sophisticated robots that can perform delicate surgeries better and read x-rays more efficiently and accurately to detect cancerous cells that can’t be readily seen by the human eye. Shoppers use self checkout machines at a Kroger Co. supermarket in Louisville, Kentucky, ...

Truck and cab drivers, cashiers, retail sales associates and people who work in manufacturing plants and factories have and will continue to be replaced by robotics and technology. Driverless vehicles, kiosks in fast food restaurants and self-help, quick-phone scans at stores will soon eliminate most minimum-wage and low-skilled jobs.
This trend will benefit coders and computer engineers. They will be the great beneficiaries of this emergence—that is until AI can learn to code as well as—or better— than the humans. To be fair, there are and will be new jobs created along with the disruption. Run a search on Google for Jobs and you’ll see thousands of listings for AI, robotics, coding, data analytics, coding, tech and related postings. The studies are somewhat optimistic and claim that the rise of the machines aren’t taking away all the jobs. Rather, they will change the descriptions of jobs and add more roles.
Andrew Yang, Democratic presidential hopeful, is one of the few candidates vocalizing concerns about the ascendancy of AI.  Yang’s official website offers the following:
“Advances in automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) hold the potential to bring about new levels of prosperity humans have never seen. They also hold the potential to disrupt our economies, ruin lives throughout several generations, and, if experts such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk are to be believed, destroy humanity.
Billionaire founder of Microsoft and outspoken philanthropist, Bill Gates, has called for a tax on robots due to the disruption that will occur, resulting in the loss of jobs and tax revenue. “Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things. If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you’d think that we’d tax the robot at a similar level,” Gates said in an interview with Quartz. ""You cross the threshold of job replacement of certain activities of all sorts at once,"" Gates added. ""So, you know, warehouse work, driving, room cleanup, there's quite a few things that are meaningful job categories that, certainly in the next 20 years [will go away].""
Technology is advancing at a pace never before seen in human history. Even those developing it, don’t fully understand how it works or what direction it’s taking. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that a computer—given certain directives—can learn tasks much faster than humans thought possible even a year ago. We’re heading into this new world with no idea on how to regulate it, and a regulatory system that’s designed for technology that’s much less sophisticated than what we’re facing in the near future.
Technological innovation shouldn’t be stopped, but it should be monitored and analyzed to make sure we don’t move past a point of no return. This will require cooperation between the government and private industry to ensure that developing technologies can continue to improve our lives without destroying them.”

Published: Sep 28, 2019 10:06 AM ESTSusan Fourtané5 years ago0ShareHuman+Machine Collaboration AndreyPopov/iStock In this age of Artificial Intelligence (AI), we are witnessing a transformation in the way we live, work, and do business. From robots that share our environment and smart homes to supply chains that think and act in real-time, forward-thinking companies are using AI to innovate and expand their business more rapidly than ever. 
Indeed, this is a time of change and change happens fast. Those able to understand that the future includes living, working, co-existing, and collaborating with AI are set to succeed in the coming years. On the other hand, those who neglect the fact that business transformation in the digital age depends on human and machine collaboration will inevitably be left behind.   Bionic hands and laser rust removal, the best of IE this week

Humans and machines can complement each other resulting in increasing productivity. This collaboration could increase revenue by 38 percent by 2022, according to Accenture Research. At least 61 percent of business leaders agree that the intersection of human and machine collaboration is going to help them achieve their strategic priorities faster and more efficiently. 
Human and machine collaboration is paramount for organizations. Having the right mindset for AI means being at ease with the concept of human+machine, leaving the mindset of human Vs. machine behind. Thanks to AI, factories are now requiring a little more humanity; and AI is boosting the value of engineers and manufacturers. 
Business transformation in the era of AI 
The emergence of AI is creating brand new roles and opportunities for humans up and down the value chain. From workers in the assembly line and maintenance specialists to robot engineers and operations managers, AI is regenerating the concept and meaning of work in an industrial setting. 
According to Accenture‘s Paul Daugherty, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, and H. James Wilson, Managing Director of Information Technology and Business Research, AI is transforming business processes in five ways: 


Flexibility: A change from rigid manufacturing processes with automation done in the past by dumb robots to smart individualized production following real-time customer choices brings flexibility to businesses. This is particularly visible in the automotive manufacturing industry where customers can customize their vehicle at the dealership. They can choose everything from dashboard components to the seat leather –or vegan leather– to tire valve caps. For instance, at Stuttgart’s Mercedes-Benz assembly line there are no two vehicles that are the same. 


Speed: Speed is super important in many industries, including finance. The detection of credit card fraud on the spot can guarantee a card holder that a transaction will not be approved if fraud was involved, saving time and headaches if this is detected too late. According to Daugherty and Wilson, HSBC Holdings developed an AI-based solution that uses improved speed and accuracy in fraud detection. The solution can monitor millions of transactions on a daily basis seeking subtle pattern that can possibly signal fraud. This type of solution is great for financial institutions. Yet, they need the human collaboration to be continually updated. Without the updates required, soon the algorithms would become useless for combating fraud. Data analysts and financial fraud experts must keep an eye on the software at all times to assure the AI solution is at least one step ahead of criminals. 

Scale: In order to accelerate its recruiting evaluation to improve diversity, Unilever adopted an AI-based hiring system that assesses candidate’s body language and personality traits. Using this solution, Unilever was able to broaden its recruiting scale; job applicants doubled to 30,000, and the average time for arriving to a hiring decision decreased to four weeks. The process used to take up to four months before the adoption of the AI system. 


Decision Making: There is no secret to the fact that the best decision that people make are based on specific, tailored information received in vast amounts. Using machine learning and AI a huge amount of data can be quickly available at the fingertips of workers on the factory floor, or to service technicians solving problems out in the field. All data previously collected and analyzed brings invaluable information that helps humans solve problems much faster or even prevent such problems before they happen. Take the case of GE and its Predix application. The solution uses machine-learning algorithms to predict when a specific part in a specific machine might fail. Predix alerts workers to potential problems before they become serious. In many cases, GE could save millions of dollars thanks to this technology collaborating with fast human action.

Personalization: AI makes possible individual tailoring, on-demand brand experiences at great scale. Music streaming service Pandora, for instance, applies AI algorithms to generate personalized playlists based on preferences in songs, artists, and genres. AI can use data to personalize anything and everything delivering a more enjoyable user experience. AI brings marketing to a new level. 

AI will create new roles and opportunities 
Of course, some roles will come to an end as it has happened in the history of humanity every time there has been a technological revolution. However, the changes toward human and machine collaboration require the creation of new roles and the recruiting of new talent; it is not just a matter of implementing AI technology. We also need to remember that there is no evolution without change. 
Robotics and AI will replace some jobs liberating humans for other kinds of tasks, many that do not yet exist as many of today’s positions and jobs did not exist a few decades ago. Since 2000, the United States has lost five million manufacturing jobs. However, Daugherty and Wilson think that things are not as clear cut as they might seem.
In the United States alone, there are going to be needed around 3.4 million more job openings covered in the manufacturing sector. One reason for this is the need to cover the Baby Boomers’ retirement plans.
Re-skilling: Developing fusion skills
Re-skilling is now paramount and applies to everyone who wishes to remain relevant. Paul Daugherty recommends enterprises to help existing employees develop what he calls fusion skills. 
In their book Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI, a must-read for business leaders looking for a practical guide on adopting AI into their organization, Paul Daugherty and H. James Wilson identify eight fusion skills for the workplace:
Rehumanizing time: People will have more time to dedicate toward more human activities, such as increasing interpersonal interactions and creativity.
Responsible normalizing: It is time to normalize the purpose and perception of human and machine interaction as it relates to individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. 
Judgment integration: A machine may be uncertain about something or lack the necessary business or ethical context to make decisions. In such case, humans must be prepared to sense where, how, and when to step in and provide input. 
Intelligent interrogation: Humans simply can’t probe massively complex systems or predict interactions between complex layers of data on their own. It is imperative to have the ability to ask machines the right smart questions across multiple levels. 
Bot-based empowerment: A variety of bots are available to help people be more productive and become better at their jobs. Using the power of AI agents can extend human’s capabilities, reinvent business processes, and even boost a human’s professional career. 
Holistic (physical and mental) melding: In the age of human and machine fusion, holistic melding will become increasingly important. The full reimagination of business processes only becomes possible when humans create working mental models of how machines work and learn, and when machines capture user-behavior data to update their interactions.
Reciprocal apprenticing: In the past, technological education has gone in one direction: People have learned how to use machines. But with AI, machines are learning from humans, and humans, in turn, learn again from machines. In the future, humans will perform tasks alongside AI agents to learn new skills, and will receive on-the-job training to work well within AI-enhanced processes. 
Relentless reimagining: This hybrid skill is the ability to reimagine how things currently are—and to keep reimagining how AI can transform and improve work, organizational processes, business models, and even entire industries.
In Human + Machine, the authors propose a continuous circle of learning, an exchange of knowledge between humans and machines. Humans can work better and more efficiently with the help of AI. According to the authors, in the long term, companies will start rethinking their business processes, and as they do they will cover the needs for new humans in the new ways of doing business. 
They believe that “before we rewrite the business processes, job descriptions, and business models, we need to answer these questions: What tasks do humans do best? And, what do machines do best?” The transfer of jobs is not simply one way. In many cases, AI is freeing up to creativity and human capital, letting people work more like humans and less like robots. 
Giving these paramount questions and the concepts proposed by Daugherty and Wilson, giving them some thought might be crucial at the time of deciding what is the best strategy you should take as a business leader in your organization in order to change and adapt in the age of AI. 
The authors highlight how embracing the new rules of AI can be beneficial at the time businesses are reimagining processes with a focus on an exchange of knowledge between humans and machines.  RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

Prolific science and science fiction writer Isaac Asimov (1920–1992) developed the Three Laws of Robotics, in the hope of guarding against potentially dangerous artificial intelligence. They first appeared in his 1942 short story Runaround:
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
Asimov fans tell us that the laws were implicit in his earlier stories. 
A 0th law was added in Robots and Empire (1985): “A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”
Here’s Asimov discussing his Laws:



Chris Stokes, a philosopher at Wuhan University in China, says, “Many computer engineers use the three laws as a tool for how they think about programming.” But the trouble is, they don’t work. 
He explains in an open-access paper: 
The First Law fails because of ambiguity in language, and because of complicated ethical problems that are too complex to have a simple yes or no answer.    The Second Law fails because of the unethical nature of having a law that requires sentient beings to remain as slaves.   The Third Law fails because it results in a permanent social stratification, with the vast amount of potential exploitation built into this system of laws.    The ‘Zeroth’ Law, like the first, fails because of ambiguous ideology. All of the Laws also fail because of how easy it is to circumvent the spirit of the law but still remaining bound by the letter of the law.  Chris Stokes, “Why the three laws of robotics do not work” at International Journal of Research in Engineering and Innovation (IJREI) 
Maybe we’d better hope it never gets tested in real life?  At any rate, here at Mind Matters News, it’s Sci-Fi Saturday so we asked some of our contributors for reactions to the laws and to Stokes’s doubts about them: 
Jonathan Bartlett: The laws of robotics utilize ordinary and purposive language.  That works for ordinary and purposive human beings.  But robots are not human.  Therefore, those rules should be adapted to be the rules of the robot-makers, not those of the robots themselves.  These can be translated into rules for robot-makers as follows:
Bartlett offers rules for robot makers instead: 
1) Robots should only be built with human safety in mind.  Designers should recognize that humans can make mistakes and safeguards against preventable mistakes should be built-in.
2A) Robotic behavior should be predictable so that human operators can appropriately understand how the robot’s input will direct its actions.  The goal should be to make the behavior understandable/predictable by the human so that the human can work with it in a seamless manner.
2B) There should be clarity regarding which user(s) is in control of the robot, both for the robot itself and for those around it.  That is, if a robot is following a task that will lead to danger, it should be clear to others nearby who has the ability and responsibility to cancel the request.  
2C) The robot should be built such that the person in control should remain in control unless privilege is explicitly transferred by the original party or is taken by someone with greater privilege (i.e., a foreman, a policeman, etc.)
2D) An exception is that a robot’s actions should be cancellable by anyone nearer to the situation than the operator
2E) Any sequence of robot coordination should not be endangered if any robot’s actions in the sequence are canceled (i.e., canceling the actions of a robot endangering a human should not inadvertently cause danger to other parts of the process)
3) Robots should have internal sensors, controls, and reporting so that they can report to humans any detectable or predictable malfunction before it causes a hazard.
He adds: The laws of robots, as they were envisioned by Asimov, assumed that you could program a computer just as if you were speaking to a human.  If we treat robotics as an engineering discipline instead, we can develop rules for robot development that do indeed prevent danger to humans.  Imagining the future is fun, and even necessary.  However, trying to find appropriate rules for future robots that may never exist should not interfere with developing good ethical ground rules for developing robots in the near future.
Brendan Dixon pops in to say: It’s even worse than he says! The “laws” are ambiguous, even for a human. For example, what does it mean to not “harm”? Actually quite sticky to work out.
The flaw with the laws is this: They assume that morality and moral decisions can be made by means of an algorithm, that discrete yes/no answers suffice to “solve” moral quandaries. They are not sufficient. (Or, to be sufficient would require many, many, many more “laws” than those specified to cover the vast array of “what if” and “but he” qualifications that always arise.)
Law of Hammurabi chiseled in stone
Here is an interesting data point: I recently learned that the Law of Hammurabi (approximately 1750 BC, chiseled into a stele now in the Louvre) was the most frequently copied ancient law code. And yet, in all the law cases we’ve discovered, it is never referenced or used. Why? Because ancient law codes sought to teach users how to think about making wise decisions vs. encoding specific rules about the decisions you should make. This highlights the challenge of robotics: Robots would require that we can code into rules the decisions they should make, but moral decisions require wisdom, a mind trained how to think so that it can handle each case properly.
Eric Holloway offered: I find it ironic that while there are supposedly objective moral laws for robots, humans themselves do not have objective moral laws
I wonder if a logical consequence of the 3 robot laws that the robots must teach humans objective moral laws, e.g. in order to avoid “through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.”  So, for instance, the robots would bring a halt to all war, abortions, and euthanasia throughout the world, and embark on a massive evangelization effort to prevent humans causing themselves infinite harm by going to hell.
Brendan Dixon responded by identifying the underlying conflict between the 0th law and the others: Nice thought, but it assumes a definition of harm with an individualized focus. What if harm instead (and I don’t agree with this) is measured in utilitarian terms at the level of a population? Whole other ball game. That’s the problem.
Eric Holloway suggested how the robot might think that out: In which case, the best way to minimize harm to the population is to wipe out everyone.  Of course, there is a lot of short term harm in wiping out everyone, but it is much less in aggregate than the accumulation of harm throughout many thousands of future generations. Or, a bit less extreme, sterilize everyone.  That way minimize harm to currently existing humans, and there will be no future humans to be harmed.
Well! Perhaps it’s a good thing that artificial general intelligence of the sort Asimov was trying to make laws for is doubtful for a variety of reasons anyway. 
Here’s Computerphile’s view: The Laws never worked even in fiction. Asimov’s robot books “are all about the way these laws go wrong, with various consequences.” 




Just for fun, Eric Holloway explains why “friendly” artificial intelligence will kill you: 
Is that a shocking idea? Let’s follow the logic: We don’t want to invent a stupid god who accidentally turns the universe into grey goo or paperclips, But any god we create in our image will be just as incompetent and evil as we are, if not more so. A dilemma!

AUTONOMOUS MOBILE ROBOTS (AMRs) work collaboratively with people to create highly productive work environments by automating repetitive and injury-prone material transportation. While the robots use sensors and algorithms to safely navigate even dynamic environments, they aren’t able to apply this sensory input for advanced decision-making. The next step in the evolution of AMRs is the addition of artificial intelligence (AI) to increase the capabilities of smart mobile robots. AI will make these robots even more efficient, increase the range of tasks the robots can perform, and reduce the need for work-environment adaptations to accommodate them.
 
The Transition to Artificial Intelligence
Today, mobile robots use sensors and software for control (to define where and how the robot should move) and perception (to allow the robot to understand and react to its surroundings). Data comes from integrated laser scanners, 3D cameras, accelerometers, gyroscopes, wheel encoders, and more to produce the most efficient decisions for each situation. These technologies give AMRs many of the capabilities that have become familiar and desirable in today’s automobiles. The robots are able to dynamically navigate using the most efficient routes, have environmental awareness so they can avoid obstacles or people in their path, and can automatically charge when needed. Without AI, however, the robots react the same way to all obstacles, slowing and attempting to navigate around the person or object if possible, or stopping or backing up if there is no safe way to maneuver around it. The AMR’s standard approach is appropriate in nearly every situation, but in the same way that AI is powering new capabilities for self-driving cars and intelligent drones, it is also poised to dramatically change robotics.

Artificial Intelligence includes several branches. The AI that is used in autonomous mobile robots at this stage is focused on machine learning and vision systems.

The strategically placed MiR AI Camera static cameras enable the MiR robots to foresee obstacles on their routes, so they are able to re-route beforehand for optimized navigation.
AI for collaborative robots is focused primarily on machine learning (ML) and vision systems today, which are dramatically extending earlier sensor-based capabilities. Technology advances and market maturity in several key areas are enabling these innovations:


A wide array of small, low-cost, and power-efficient sensors allow mobile and remote devices to capture and transmit huge amounts of data about the robot’s immediate, extended, and anticipated environment as well as internal conditions.


Cloud computing and broadband wireless communications allow the data to be stored, processed, and accessed almost instantly, from any access point. Secure virtual networks can adapt to dynamic requirements and nearly eliminate downtime and bottlenecks.


Powerful new AI-focused processor architectures are widely available from both traditional semiconductor companies such as AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm as well as new players in the field, including Google and Microsoft. While traditional broad-use semiconductors are facing the limits of Moore’s Law, these new chips are purpose-designed for AI calculations, which is driving up capabilities while driving down costs. Low-power, cost-effective AI processors can be incorporated into even small mobile or remote devices, allowing onsite computation for fast, efficient decisions.


Sophisticated software algorithms analyze and process data in the most productive locations—in the robot, in the cloud, or even in remote, extended sensors that provide additional intelligence data for the robot to anticipate needs and proactively adapt its behavior.


Using these capabilities, fleets of robots behave like a group of students taking online classes. They learn while they are online, and then are able to perform without constant access to online content. Low-power, AI-capable devices and efficientAI techniques support new robotic systems with low latency and fast reaction times, high autonomy, and low power consumption—all key elements for success.

Artificial Intelligence in AMRs Improves Path Planning and Environmental Interaction
Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR) is driving advances in AI in mobile robots and establishing new industry expectations. Innovative AI capabilities maintain the robots’ safety protocols and drive improved efficiency in path planning and environmental interaction.
AI is implemented in advanced learning algorithms in the robot’s software as well as in remote, connected cameras that can be mounted in high-traffic areas or in the paths of fork trucks or other automated vehicles. The cameras are equipped with small, efficient embedded computers that can process anonymized data and run sophisticated analysis software to identify whether objects in the area are humans, fixed obstacles, or other types of mobile devices, such as AGVs. The cameras then feed this information to the robot, extending the robot’s understanding of its surroundings so it can adapt its behavior appropriately, even before it enters an area. The AI-capable network helps the robot avoid high-traffic areas during specific times, such as when goods are regularly delivered and transferred by fork truck, or when large crowds of workers are present, such as during breaks or shift changes.
With AI, MiR robots can efficiently and appropriately react to different types of obstacles to improve navigation and efficiency. As an example, if they face an AMR from another manufacturer, they can predict that vehicle’s motion and adjust appropriately. When encountering a new, unknown object, the robot can be cautious and observant, collecting data so that it can calculate the best possible behavior for future interactions.
Similarly, in complex, highly dynamic environments—such as those with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) that can’t deviate from their fixed path or with human-driven fork trucks or other unpredictable vehicles—the robot’s ability to maneuver may be limited. AGVs’ safety mechanisms are typically limited to forced stops when encountering obstacles, for instance, which can block the AMR. AI-powered MiR AMRs can identify the AGV and be aware of its limitations, so that instead of stopping and requiring operator intervention to reroute it, they can automatically wait in a safe position until the AGV has passed, resuming their mission when it is safe to do so.
While the robots’ built-in safety mechanisms will always stop the robot from colliding with an object, person, or vehicle in its path, other vehicles, such as human-driven fork trucks, may not have those capabilities, leaving the risk of one of them running into the robot. A MiR robot system can detect high-traffic areas before it arrives and can identify other vehicles and behave appropriately to decrease the risk of collision.In this way, not only are AMRs improving their own behavior with AI, but are also adapting to other vehicles’ limitations.

Left: MiR AI Camera detects an object it was configured to react to, which prevents MiR robots from crossing the zone marked in red.Right: MiR camera detects a person and is configured not to react in this case, since the person is capable of efficiently avoiding the robot. The zone marked in green can be crossed by MiR robots in this case.
 
Addressing AI Concerns
AI is still new enough to raise concerns around security and privacy of the data being captured and used, as well as ensuring safety if AI systems fail or are interfered with. Key questions for customers as they consider AI-powered systems include:


Where and how is data stored, secured, and processed?


How long is data stored?


What personally identifiable information is captured?


What back-up safety mechanisms are in place?


To protect security and privacy, MiR robots and AI cameras only send decisions, not images. Since all the required computational power exists inside each device, data captured by vision sensors is processed right away into shapes, sizes, and colors, then classified into specific categories and used for decision-making. Therefore, the only kind of data that can be sent are commands that AMRs can understand, such as stop or resume; information on changes to the environment, such as a blocked path or a crowded area; or new actions to be taken, such as the choice of an alternative route.
While safety in robotic AI systems is sometimes raised as a concern, MiR’s primary safety mechanisms are core to the robot and cannot be overridden by AI decisions. For instance, while laser scanners on the robot provide data for AI systems, they also make fundamental safety decisions to mechanically stop MiR robots from proceeding under any circumstances if there are people or obstacles in the robot’s path.
 
The Future of Robotic AI
Mobile robots will continue to be collaborative entities, and with AI, the technological barrier between them and humans will continue to shrink, increasing collaboration and efficiency.
As AI advances, we will gain the ability to interact with robots more naturally using speech or gestures. That might include holding up a hand to make the robot stop, pointing it to a preferred direction, or waving it on to pass or follow—or simply telling it, “This hallway will be blocked for the next two hours, take another route until then.”
While mobile robots will still be a controllable tool with emergency stop buttons, they will gain autonomy that will make them even more valuable. They will be able to understand where their routine can be improved and suggest better paths to their destination, more productive times of the day to execute tasks, other robots that could be deployed for more efficient workflows, and the most appropriate time to recharge.
AI-powered AMRS will help turn workplaces into organic, data-driven environments, in which robots share relevant data from their own or remote sensors to help fleets of robots make informed decisions. With this data-sharing model, each robot essentially has access to every sensor in every other robot or camera, providing it with a much more detailed view of its entire environment, thus enabling much more efficient path-planning performance.
 
AI: Powering the Next Industrial Revolution
As in previous industrial revolutions, AI and robotics will make many laborious and undesirable tasks obsolete. With AI, MiR robots can manage repetitive, low-value material-transport tasks even more efficiently and cost-effectively, freeing humans for more meaningful activities. And with severe labor shortages holding back companies around the world, smarter mobile robots will allow companies to offer rewarding roles that help them attract and retain valued employees.

AI can help us fight climate change. But it has an energy problem, too



          Artificial intelligence (AI) technology can help us fight climate change – but it also comes at a cost to the planet. To truly benefit from the technology’s climate solutions, we also need a better understanding of AI’s growing carbon footprint, say researchers. &nbsp;

AI is changing the way we work, live and solve challenges. It can improve healthcare, protect elephants from poachers, and work out how broadband should be distributed.But it could be most valuable as a range of applications helping humanity fight our biggest threat - climate change. AI can strengthen climate predictions, enable smarter decision-making for decarbonising industries from building to transport, and work out how to allocate renewable energy.AI’s relevance as a climate change fighting tool comes at a time when there are increasing ethical concerns linked largely to a data-hungry form of the technology called machine learning, where computer systems analyse patterns in existing data to make predictions and decisions. Machine learning applications have raised concerns about creeping public surveillance, intentional misuse, privacy, transparency and data bias that can lead to discrimination and inequality.It is part of a wider ethics debate in the EU about how to use AI for the benefit of human beings, the challenges that the technology poses and how best to tackle them.‘We have to realise that AI is, in fact, a piece of software that we people design,’ said Virginia Dignum, a professor in social and ethical artificial intelligence at Umeå University in Sweden. We must be responsible for how we use AI, she says. ‘(It is) not some kind of magic that comes from outer space and happens to us. No. We make AI happen.’Perhaps surprisingly, one issue that is only beginning to be discussed is the environmental footprint of AI.Image credit - HorizonNetflixThe algorithms that tells us, for example, what to watch on Netflix tonight have an environmental impact, according to Prof. Dignum. ‘AI uses a lot of energy,’ said the computer scientist, who is part of a 52-person expert group advising the European Commission on trustworthy and ‘human-centric’ AI.The storage, and particularly the processing, of data to train algorithms – the ‘recipes’ computers use to make calculations – in data centres or in the cloud across different centres with rows of machines doing computations consume energy, she says.For one algorithm to train itself on whether an image shows a cat, for instance, it needs to process millions of cat images. The ecosystem for information and communications technology, of which data centres are a part, are comparable to aviation in terms of fuel emissions.  ‘It’s a use of energy that we don’t really think about,’ said Prof. Dignum. ‘We have data farms, especially in the northern countries of Europe and in Canada, which are huge. Some of those things use as much energy as a small city.’She draws on a University of Massachusetts, US, study which found that training a large AI model to handle human language can lead to emissions of nearly 300,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent, about five times the emissions of the average car in the US, including its manufacture.Swedish researcher Anders Andrae has forecast that data centres could account for 10% of total electricity use by 2025.Although AI has been around for about half a century, the question of environmental impact – and other ethical issues - is only arising now because the techniques developed over decades can now be used in combination with an explosion in data and strong computational power, Prof. Dignum explains. ‘It’s time to start thinking about doing AI in a more environmentally friendly way,’ she said.AI might be part of the problem, but it also has the potential to help us find solutions for climate change.Professor Felix Creutzig, who leads a working group called Land Use, Infrastructures and Transport at Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin, Germany, investigates ways to tackle climate change using data science. He is part of a group of international researchers advocating for more collaborative climate change solutions using machine learning.“It’s time to start thinking about doing AI in a more environmentally friendly way.Prof. Virginia Dignum, Umeå University, SwedenVast opportunitiesProf. Creutzig sees vast AI opportunities to ramp up the applications for targeted climate change solutions at the street scale, or even building level, that can be applied in cities. Urban spaces are of particular concern, as they’ll be home to more than two-thirds of the world’s population by 2050 and are incredibly resource-intensive.‘It’s cool to work with technologies and to invest in low-carbon technologies, but to achieve anything close to the 2 degree or 1.5 degree target (for limiting global warming) we must reduce energy demands drastically and can achieve that by improved spatial configurations,’ he said.Improving spatial use can help address issues such as urban heat islands, a phenomenon where urban environs built of steel and cement store heat and warm cities. ‘That’s a key problem of our future,’ he said.Greening cities or using wind channel architecture to create ventilation are ways to help cities deal with extreme heat that can be guided by AI.Prof. Creutzig is employing a method called stacked architecture, which uses machine learning with traditional mechanical modelling to, for instance, obtain insights into how buildings behave when it comes to temperature or energy demand, to find the best design for low energy use and high quality of life. These can then inform urban planning and policymakers.Precisely because AI has so much potential, he also thinks its use should be combined with regulation, such as on not storing unnecessary data or constraining its use, so that it is targeted, efficient and doesn’t cause a new problem. However, he says that there’s currently not enough research into machine learning’s environmental impact. ‘There’s a lot to explore,’ he said.‘Basically it (AI) is a fuel of application … it can lead to a new energy use,’ said Prof. Creutzig. ‘And this would be the opposite of what we want to have. The main example I'm thinking about is smart mobility and autonomous driving because these are really driven by AI or will be modelled by AI.’For Andrea Renda, head of global governance and digital economy expert at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, Belgium, and also a member of the expert group advising the European Commission, AI needs to be developed and deployed so it can meet society’s needs and protect the environment by saving more energy than it expends.‘All of these (data-intensive techniques) are extremely dangerous for the environment unless you can use those techniques in a way that, while using a lot more energy, save a lot more energy because they provide for more efficient solutions,’ said Prof. Renda.Both Prof. Renda and Prof. Dignum agree that basic research into AI forms that are less data hungry than machine learning, such as automated reasoning, should be an EU priority. This would mean less use of personal data and energy consumption.Prof. Dignum has been working with ‘synthetic data’, which is not based on real examples. It could be used to generate, for example, images of broken bones not based on sensitive patient data in order to train an algorithm on what to spot in an X-ray. This data can then be discarded so that it’s not stored.Some researchers in the US have also proposed that AI research should include reporting on computational costs of training algorithms to enhance transparency.To make sure AI is used to help, and not hinder, our society, Prof. Renda says it’s time to merge the two big debates of today. ‘One is on digital technology and the other one is on sustainable development, and in particular the environment. If we use the former to save the latter, I think we will have made the best possible use of the resources that we have,’ he said. ‘Otherwise we're just wasting time.’On 25 September, Prof. Dignum will be participating in a session called Human-centered Artificial Intelligence at the EU’s Research & Innovation days to help shape the scope of EU research and policy on AI from 2021-2027.European Research & Innovation DaysThe European Research & Innovation Days, which will take place in Brussels, Belgium, from 24 to 26 September, are designed to bring together policymakers, academics, industry, civil society and entrepreneurs to discuss how research and innovation can help tackle the major issues facing the EU over the next decade.The idea is to seek a wide range of opinions from experts and interested parties about priorities for the first four years of the EU’s upcoming €100 billion research funding programme, Horizon Europe. In addition to conference sessions, policymakers from the EU and national administrations will be available throughout the event in a space called Horizon Village to gather further input from participants.The event, which is set to be an annual affair, consists of a policy conference to shape the Horizon Europe work programme, an innovation hub for innovators and investors to network, and a public exhibition called Science is Wonderful!.

  Do industries shed or create jobs when they adopt new labour-saving technologies? This column shows that manufacturing employment grew along with productivity for a century or more, and only later decreased. It argues that the changing nature of demand was behind this pattern, which led to market saturation. This implies that the main impact of automation in the near future may be a major reallocation of jobs, not necessarily massive job losses.

Last month a UN panel of government experts debated autonomous weapons and found Google to be eschewing AI for use in weapons systems and engaging in best practice.View image in fullscreenLaura Nolan resigned from Google last year in protest. Photograph: Johnny Savage/The GuardianNolan, who has joined the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and has briefed UN diplomats in New York and Geneva over the dangers posed by autonomous weapons, said: “The likelihood of a disaster is in proportion to how many of these machines will be in a particular area at once. What you are looking at are possible atrocities and unlawful killings even under laws of warfare, especially if hundreds or thousands of these machines are deployed.“There could be large-scale accidents because these things will start to behave in unexpected ways. Which is why any advanced weapons systems should be subject to meaningful human control, otherwise they have to be banned because they are far too unpredictable and dangerous.”Google recruited Nolan, a computer science graduate from Trinity College Dublin, to work on Project Maven in 2017 after she had been employed by the tech giant for four years, becoming one of its top software engineers in Ireland.She said she became “increasingly ethically concerned” over her role in the Maven programme, which was devised to help the US Department of Defense drastically speed up drone video recognition technology.Instead of using large numbers of military operatives to spool through hours and hours of drone video footage of potential enemy targets, Nolan and others were asked to build a system where AI machines could differentiate people and objects at an infinitely faster rate.Google allowed the Project Maven contract to lapse in March this year after more than 3,000 of its employees signed a petition in protest against the company’s involvement.“As a site reliability engineer my expertise at Google was to ensure that our systems and infrastructures were kept running, and this is what I was supposed to help Maven with. Although I was not directly involved in speeding up the video footage recognition I realised that I was still part of the kill chain; that this would ultimately lead to more people being targeted and killed by the US military in places like Afghanistan.”Although she resigned over Project Maven, Nolan has predicted that autonomous weapons being developed pose a far greater risk to the human race than remote-controlled drones.She outlined how external forces ranging from changing weather systems to machines being unable to work out complex human behaviour might throw killer robots off course, with possibly fatal consequences.“You could have a scenario where autonomous weapons that have been sent out to do a job confront unexpected radar signals in an area they are searching; there could be weather that was not factored into its software or they come across a group of armed men who appear to be insurgent enemies but in fact are out with guns hunting for food. The machine doesn’t have the discernment or common sense that the human touch has.“The other scary thing about these autonomous war systems is that you can only really test them by deploying them in a real combat zone. Maybe that’s happening with the Russians at present in Syria, who knows? What we do know is that at the UN Russia has opposed any treaty let alone ban on these weapons by the way.“If you are testing a machine that is making its own decisions about the world around it then it has to be in real time. Besides, how do you train a system that runs solely on software how to detect subtle human behaviour or discern the difference between hunters and insurgents? How does the killing machine out there on its own flying about distinguish between the 18-year-old combatant and the 18-year-old who is hunting for rabbits?”The ability to convert military drones, for instance into autonomous non-human guided weapons, “is just a software problem these days and one that can be relatively easily solved”, said Nolan.She said she wanted the Irish government to take a more robust line in supporting a ban on such weapons.“I am not saying that missile-guided systems or anti-missile defence systems should be banned. They are after all under full human control and someone is ultimately accountable. These autonomous weapons however are an ethical as well as a technological step change in warfare. Very few people are talking about this but if we are not careful one or more of these weapons, these killer robots, could accidentally start a flash war, destroy a nuclear power station and cause mass atrocities.”Autonomous threat?Some of the autonomous weapons being developed by military powers around the world include:

The US navy’s AN-2 Anaconda gunboat, which is being developed as a “completely autonomous watercraft equipped with artificial intelligence capabilities” and can “loiter in an area for long periods of time without human intervention”.


Russia’s T-14 Armata tank, which is being worked on to make it completely unmanned and autonomous. It is being designed to respond to incoming fire independent of any tank crew inside.


The US Pentagon has hailed the Sea Hunter autonomous warship as a major advance in robotic warfare. An unarmed 40 metre-long prototype has been launched that can cruise the ocean’s surface without any crew for two to three months at a time.

Most recently, Hong Kong-based Insilico Medicine developed GENTRL, an AI system for drug discovery. In order to speed up drug development and accelerate target identification, biopharma is increasingly turning to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Most recently, Hong Kong-based Insilico Medicine developed GENTRL, an AI system for drug discovery. In its tests, GENTRL was able to “ideate and generate” a new molecule from beginning to end in 21 days—six molecules, in fact. In a more surprising move, Insilico has made GENTRL’s source code available as open source. GENTRL stands for general tensorial reinforcement learning. It has a two-step algorithm that maps and explores new compound structures within the scaffolding of chemical parameters. It then uses a machine learning model to “learn” DDR1 and common kinase inhibitors. “The development of these first six molecules as an experimental validation is just the start,” stated Alex Zhavoronkov, chief executive officer of Insilico Medicine. “By enabling the rapid discovery of novel molecules and by making GENTRL’s source code open source, we are ushering in new possibilities for the creation and discovery of new life-saving medicine for incurable diseases—and making such powerful technology more broadly accessible for the first time to the public.” Insilico developed GENTRL with WuXI AppTec, a contract research organization (CRO) and drug discovery company, and Alan Aspuru-Guzik, professor of chemistry and computer science at the University of Toronto and founder and chief scientific officer of quantum computing startup Zapata Computing. Of the six molecules GENTRL developed, four inhibit DDR1 at nanomolar concentration. DDR1 is a protein target associated with a variety of diseases, including fibrosis. Details of the research were published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. In May, AstraZeneca announced a long-term collaboration deal with BenevolentAI, a UK-based company focused on combining computational medicine and advanced artificial intelligence. The two companies will focus on using AI and machine learning to discover and develop new drugs for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). “The vast amount of data available to research scientists is growing exponentially each year,” stated Mene Pangalo, AstraZeneca’s executive vice president and president BioPharmaceuticals R&D. “By combining AstraZeneca’s disease area expertise and large, diverse datasets with BenevolentAI’s leading AI and machine learning capabilities, we can unlock the potential of this wealth of data to improve our understanding of complex disease biology and identify new targets that could treat debilitating diseases.” In early April, only a few weeks after Concerto HealthAI inked a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb, it signed a similar deal with Pfizer. The commonality was Concerto focuses on oncology-specific Real-World Data (RWD) and advanced AI for Real-World Evidence (RWE) generation, an area of increasing interest for biopharma companies. Concerto HealthAI will collaborate with Pfizer on Precision Oncology using Concerto’s eurekaHealth platform, artificial intelligence (AI) models and Real World Clinical Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and healthcare claims. They will use data from clinical medical practices that participate in the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s CancerLinQ initiative and others throughout the U.S. In March 2019, Oxford Biomedica announced it had inked a two-year R&D collaboration with Microsoft Research. The goal is to improve the yield and quality of next-generation gene therapy vectors—typically viruses—using AI and machine learning. Oxford Biomedica will focus on its expertise in vector development and large-scale manufacturing. The team in Microsoft’s Station B initiative will use AI and machine learning to increase the yield and improve the purity of Oxford Biomedica’s lentiviral vectors while cutting costs. Station B will use the Microsoft Azure intelligent cloud platform to analyze large data sets created by Oxford Biomedical and develop in silico models and novel algorithms to advance cell and gene delivery technology. And other companies are focusing on AI and machine learning. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a clinical-stage biotech company that combines AI, experimental biology and automation to discover and develop drugs at scale. On Jan. 7, 2019, Recursion announced progress in its collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company on identifying novel preclinical candidates for rare diseases. In 18 months, the partnership had led to the evaluation of Takeda preclinical and clinical compounds in more than 60 unique indications, with new therapeutic candidates identified in more than half-a-dozen diseases. As a result, Takeda exercised its option for drug candidates in two rare diseases and the two companies have extended the partnership. Also in January, Recursion signed a licensing deal with the Ohio State Innovation Foundation (OSIF), acquiring rights to OSU-HDAC42, a clinical stage compound that will be developed by Recursion for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a rare tumor syndrome. And a year ago, in August 2018, the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Insilico Medicine, and Juvenescence, a human longevity company, founded Napa Therapeutics to develop drugs against a novel aging-related target. Napa Therapeutics is built on research in NAD metabolism conducted by Eric Verdin, president and chief executive officer of the Buck Institute. His laboratory will collaborate with Napa, using Insilico’s drug development platform to accelerate compound discovery. “This is a unique opportunity to use cutting-edge AI to accelerate drug discovery,” Verdin said in a statement at the time. “The Buck is excited to join forces with Insilico and Juvenescence as we work to eliminate the threat of age-related disease for this and future generations.” In the most recent news, Insilico’s GENTRL conceptualized and created 30,000 novel small molecules that had the potential to work against fibrosis. Then, it screened those and synthesized the six most promising molecules and then tested them in vitro for both selectivity and metabolic stability. They then tested it in mouse models, where it showed favorable activity.', 'author': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry/#person', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry/'}, 'name': 'Mark Terry', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry'}], 'copyrightYear': '2024', 'datePublished': '2019-09-11T15:46:13.000Z', 'dateModified': '2021-04-15T18:09:47.000Z', 'headline': 'Insilico Medicine’s GENTRL: Artificial Intelligence Continues to be Priority for Biopharma', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#article', 'image': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 350, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/5642428/2147483647/strip/false/crop/625x350+0+0/resize/625x350!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F5199F126-13F3-4BE5-8289-F17B201FF2F3.jpg', 'height': 625}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/24e0068/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F5199F126-13F3-4BE5-8289-F17B201FF2F3.jpg', 'height': 1200}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#webpage'}, 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#webpage'}}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Website', 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'WebPage', 'potentialAction': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma'}], '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#webpage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#primaryimage'}, 'name': 'Insilico Medicine’s GENTRL: Artificial Intelligence Continues to be Priority for Biopharma', 'datePublished': '2019-09-11T15:46:13.000Z', 'dateModified': '2021-04-15T18:09:47.000Z', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#primaryimage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/24e0068/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F5199F126-13F3-4BE5-8289-F17B201FF2F3.jpg', 'height': 1200}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mimicking the brain
Schölkopf is a physicist, mathematician and computer programmer who heads the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in the southern German city of Tübingen. His research specifically deals with better enabling machines' abilities to react in unfamiliar situations, for example in the development of self-driving cars and with the processing of medical images.
Schölkopf and his team's so-called support-vector machines attempt to mimic the human brain in how it makes decisions and responds to circumstances. This also means that the machines can easily classify and categorize objects.
The Körber Foundation's prize, which was presented at a ceremony in Hamburg's town hall, has the highest cash value of any in Germany and also is one of the most renowned in Europe.
The prize has been awarded since 1985 and awards those who shape and affect the future within the sphere of life and physical sciences. The fact that they chose to honor the relatively ""young"" branch of AI shows that its importance is likely to increase in the coming years.

Peggy Valcke (CiTiP) elected vice-chair of the Council of Europe’s new Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI)









On 11 September 2019, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (the continent’s leading human rights organization founded in the aftermath of the Second World War and consisting of 47 Member States) set up an Ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI). The mandate of the CAHAI is to examine the feasibility and potential elements of a horizontal legal framework for the development, design and application of artificial intelligence, based on the Council of Europe’s standards on human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Peggy participated in CAHAI’s first meeting from 18-20 November in Strasbourg as the Belgian representative for Flanders (with Mrs. Laureline Nootens for Wallonia-Brussels). She was elected by the Council of Europe’s Member States to co-chair the committee in the coming year (mandate renewable for 1 year). Chair of CAHAI is Gregor Strojin, State Secretary at the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Slovenia. 
At the first meeting, delegates were provided with a comprehensive overview of existing non-binding texts (ethical documents, guidelines, recommendations, declarations) relating to artificial intelligence, binding international legal frameworks already applicable to artificial intelligence, as well as artificial intelligence strategies, policies and legal frameworks at the national level. First ideas were exchanged about the feasibility of an overarching “Oviedo Convention” for the area of artificial intelligence, in which (by now) well-established ethical principles for AI (such as transparency, explicability, fairness, accountability, ‘human in the loop’ and termination obligation…) would be enshrined in a Framework Convention (which could then be further specified by existing or new instruments that would apply in specific contexts, like criminal investigations, judicial lawmaking, processing of personal data, etc.).

(Anna Quinn/Patch.)FORT GREENE, BROOKLYN — A new high-tech factory opening in one of the Brooklyn Navy Yard's oldest buildings is perhaps the best symbol for how the borough's history as a manufacturing powerhouse is taking on a new life, Navy Yard CEO David Ehrenberg said Thursday. The 25,000-square-foot space, known as Building 20, was once a bustling indoor factory that outfitted U.S. Navy battleships with armored plating when it was built more than 150 years ago. And while that type of manufacturing dwindled decades ago — turning the building into a rarely used storage space — a new face of the industry is moving in, Ehrenberg said. Find out what's happening in Fort Greene-Clinton Hillwith free, real-time updates from Patch.SubscribeNanotronics, which has been working out of the Navy Yard's New Lab, officially broke ground in Building 20 Thursday on what will become the city's first ""smart factory,"" or a factory that uses largely digital production rather than a traditional assembly line. The company manufactures a line of tools armed with cutting-edge artificial intelligence used to make manufacturing more efficient. ""Nanotronics represent to us the new breed of manufacturers that are beginning to grow and expand here at the yard,"" Ehrenberg said. ""Growth of companies like Nanotronics proves that manufacturing continues to be an important part of New York City's economy even if it is changing and what it really needs is an enabling environment.""Find out what's happening in Fort Greene-Clinton Hillwith free, real-time updates from Patch.Subscribe (Anna Quinn/Patch)Thursday's groundbreaking was joined by Nanotronics' leaders, Navy Yard staff and New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who was at the event to represent Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who announced Thursday that the state would invest $2.25 million into the new factory through a grant. Hochul, who called Nanotronics' new space the start of a ""new industrial revolution,"" said the company and others at the Yard are bringing back the sort of high-paying, quality jobs that Brooklynites were once used to at the manufacturing industry's peak.""I see a rebirth in this complex,"" she said. ""Every single business that comes here gives a new opportunity for people to come and work and regain that industrial legacy — that heritage — we are proud to call our own here in Brooklyn."" The smart factory will be up and running as early as next spring, Nanotronics Chief of Staff James J. Williams III said. The company plans to build out the first half of the space by the end of the year and will likely finish by March.  When it's done, the space will more than double Nanotronics Brooklyn staff of 65 people to up to 190, Williams said.  The build-out will include creating mezzanine-level spaces and lower-level ""pods"" to house both the company's manufacturers and the research, development and administrative staff, architects said. (Anna Quinn/Patch)The design is based on Nanotronics' emphasis on bringing together its engineers with those who produce its high-tech machines so they can continue to evolve. The machines, like the nSpec microscope, are used for inspections in Nanotronics customers, which range from medical companies to autonomous vehicles manufacturers.  The ""smart technology"" in the machines means that it uses less energy, produces more and makes it so staff is spending time more efficiently, co-founder Matthew Putman said.  ""The way a regular factory worked was that you would have a lot of people doing a lot of manual tasks or working with what I would call crude robotics ... a smart factory uses a lot of incredibly new technology ... so not only are people speaking with people about how to build something, they're telling a machine how to do it,"" Putman said.

Among them is a solid conceptual framework to help underline the benefits for armed forces. Second, AI solutions need to be integrated into a complex web of legacy systems, which puts a premium on interoperability. Third, defense AI solutions must comply with legal requirements. Finally, Europe lacks a common, trusted defense data pool.European leaders should take a lesson from the military mobility project, which simplifies and standardizes cross-border military transport procedures to ease the movement of personnel and equipment. Europe needs to match physical mobility with digital mobility. Data needs to travel, too.To stimulate defense AI solutions, the continent needs a platform economy that emerges around a portfolio of relevant infrastructure elements and services that a new “Center for Defense AI” could build.For the platform to become attractive, the data acquisition strategy must focus on the need to share. Readiness to share must be incentivized by a data pool that offers true, added value. Therefore, the center would offer access to data on anything from missile defense to combat aircraft maintenance under strict, government-controlled regulation, enabling users to build novel use cases for military scenarios.RELATEDWho should manage the Pentagon’s AI data? DARPA’s director has a suggestion.Artificial intelligence can't be ""owned"" by any one entity at the Defense Department, said the head of DARPA. But there does need to be one central hub to manage all of the data supporting AI across the military, he added.By Jill AitoroMission-critical systems cannot rely on a single machine-learning technology but require a combined approach to data fusion that increases reliability and reflects the specific requirements of the different domains like land, sea, air, space and cyberspace. In addition, data must be validated to avoid manipulation.This data pool would become enormously attractive if the center managed to establish arrangements with the European Union and NATO to share data collected in international operations. This would provide an unprecedented opportunity to develop future concepts, models and algorithms based on real-life data reflecting mission requirements, environmental conditions in different theaters of operation and adversarial behavior.In addition, the European Defence Agency and NATO’s Science and Technology Organization should make use of the joint data pool for their defense AI projects, thus expanding the data pool as well as the concepts and models used for data curation and solutions development.With the help of the European Defence Fund, the center could establish the first European defense data pool spanning across military services, missions and domains. This will drastically reduce data-handling costs, as data curation activities required for every single defense AI project can be pooled.While hugely important, data is only a means to develop capabilities-based AI solutions. That’s why the center would offer complementary services addressing two current shortfalls: First, commonly available computing capacity required for large-scale learning is somewhat novel to the defense industry. A new defense AI cloud would significantly enhance data mobility by offering elastic computing capacity up to supercomputer levels, and dedicated data fusion capabilities currently unavailable to train very large-scale, AI-based data fusion models.Second, the center could provide a sophisticated simulation environment to run AI operations in a realistic battlefield environment. Based on its trusted data sources, the center and defense AI developers could join forces to build a defense AI app store. Apps could capture different sensor and effector characteristics or emulate particular patterns of adversarial behavior.Defense contractors and defense procurement agencies could use these apps to verify and validate new AI systems as if they had access to the respective algorithms, but without exposing the original vendor to the risk of being reverse engineered.In addition, the simulation environment would be instrumental to assess the ethical, legal and societal impact of AI solutions, thus providing a sound basis to decide on the use of AI systems and to enhance live, virtual, constructive training solutions.Europe should take bold steps toward channeling its collaborative defense AI activities, building on the strengths of each partner: The center would offer joint services; defense AI developers could concentrate on designing and producing intelligent sensors, effectors and decision-making solutions, while military end-users would contribute capabilities-based thinking and operational experience.Heiko Borchert runs Borchert Consulting & Research, a strategic affairs consultancy based in Lucerne, Switzerland.

Rewards and risks in humanitarian AI: an example

6 September 2019, Data and digitalization / New technologies / Restoring family links 




 
4 min
New technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, can make humanitarian work better, faster and more effective, but there are dangers too, which is why the ICRC is proceeding with caution. Various departments across the ICRC – among them Digital Transformation & Data, Protection, Information and Communication Technology, Law and Policy – are grappling with these innovations and their implications in different ways. Here we look at one example.
When the ICRC recently began testing artificial intelligence (AI) to help reunite lost loved-ones in the wake of the European migration crisis, it represented a breakthrough technological opportunity. The ICRC’s pioneering Trace the Face website was already helping people who were looking for their missing relatives to post their own photo online in hopes of being recognized and reconnected. Recently, the application of artificial intelligence for facial recognition to automate searching and matching is revealing further potential of new technology to accelerate one of the ICRC’s core activities.
“This was the starting point of our exploration,” says the ICRC’s Strategic Technology Advisor Vincent Graf Narbel. “What if we could improve the work of our field colleagues and provide a way to assist them by matching people’s faces using AI facial recognition techniques?”
Not long ago, separated family members had to sift through pages of photographs in physical books but that is changing, fast. The ICRC’s current database of people separated in the escape from war and hardship, part of which is accessible through Trace the Face website and touchscreen kiosks known as Trace the Face Corners, is helping to speed up this process and reunite more families than ever before.
“Trace the Face was the starting point,” says Graf Narbel. “The objective has shifted now to something much broader.”
Reuniting victims of war all over the world is among the ICRC’s most important functions, and remains even more so as the number of lost, disappeared, and missing continues to grow.
Informing these continued efforts is the evolution of projects such as AI for facial recognition that is revealing a range of new questions and challenges coexisting with the potential benefits of this brave new world.
Power and pitfalls
As seen in the trial for Trace the Face, AI-based facial recognition and name processing and matching technologies have obvious applications in filtering the database for duplicates and connections, so what’s the problem?
“Just because you can do something, it doesn’t mean you should,” says Graf Narbel. “There are data protection issues that are very specific to the ICRC.”
With Trace the Face, no photo can be published without the individual’s consent. But there is much personal data in the world that does not have consent, is not protected, and can be open to use – including abuse – by third parties.
This is a grave concern. “We have to be very cautious with our metadata and database security,” says Graf Narbel. “The question is how we can leverage these technologies while safeguarding the personal data of individuals – a critical aspect of protecting their rights – and adhering to International Humanitarian Law. We are exploring the power and pitfalls of technology.”
That exploration is simultaneously underway across other parts of the ICRC, including in relation to humanitarian law and policy, and armed conflict.
Do no digital harm
Working solely within its own database is one way the ICRC can ensure that protection standards are upheld, but this also means ignoring a plethora of other potential sources – such as Facebook or similar social media platforms – that could make finding the missing more successful.
The ICRC has always been concerned with protecting the people it serves from the physical dangers implicit in surviving conflicts, crises and disasters, but nowadays there is the new threat of virtual risk leading to actual physical harm.
In June, the ICRC published ‘Artificial intelligence and machine learning in armed conflict: A human-centered approach’, a report seeking to identify the potential risks as new technologies are applied in conflict scenarios.
“At a time of increasing conflict and rapid technological change, the ICRC needs both to understand the impact of new technologies on people affected by armed conflict and to design humanitarian solutions that address the needs of the most vulnerable,” the report states.
It is in this context of caution, thoughtfulness and a willingness to go slowly to get it right that the ICRC is seeking to situate its own application of artificial intelligence and machine learning. “There is a growing recognition of the power of technology to improve the work, but also a recognition of the dangers of technology to the people we’re serving,” says Graf Narbel.

About five years ago, I was the vice president of data for Kickstarter. People would come to the crowdfunding platform with wild ideas—before I got hired there, I used Kickstarter to raise funds for a translation of Moby-Dick into emoji—and company staff got to decide which projects could solicit money from the public. For those working on the Kickstarter projects team, being able to see an obviously worthy idea, and approve it five seconds later, was a total blast. In the early days, it felt like everyone at the company was competing to see what kind of fun and interesting projects we could recruit to our platform.But as the number of inventors and artists seeking money on Kickstarter exploded, the projects team needed an automated solution to help process the influx of new ideas during surge periods. Holiday weekends were especially difficult, as the projects team’s queue would back up with hundreds of worthy projects. Those delays began frustrating creators who were waiting for the team to approve their proposals. So I oversaw the development of an automated system that would consider each product’s stated purpose, its creator’s past record of success, and other factors, and fast-track the most promising ones.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

In fact, since 2012, L’Oréal operates its own technology incubator, a group that operates like a start-up but focused on where beauty and technology meet. Here’s an overview of the company’s incubator and some other ways they are using artificial intelligence such as with its AI-powered digital skin diagnostic.
The Amazing Ways How L’Oréal Uses Artificial Intelligence To Drive Business PerformanceAdobe Stock

L’Oréal’s Technology Incubator

L’Oréal’s first incubator lab was located in New Jersey, but it now also operates additional labs in San Francisco, Paris, and Tokyo that are focused on a small number of products—a mix of apps and wearables and objects to help cosmetics be connected and customized to meet the specific needs of each customer. The incubator partners with entrepreneurs and academia to develop the latest and greatest products by using technology.

Makeup Genius

In 2015, the incubator launched the Makeup Genius, a mobile app that allows customers to see hair color and makeup on their own face before they buy with the help of augmented reality. All customers need to do is upload an image of themselves or use their computer’s camera to try on cosmetics or different hair color. A live before and after comparison is available through the apps' sliding feature.

Smart Hairbrush
Another product the incubator created through a partnership with smart technology maker Withings and Kérastase (L’Oréal’s luxury hair-care brand) is aimed at responding to those who want to reduce their bad-hair days. The brush uses a conductivity sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections to gather technical insights, upload them to an algorithm that will be able to use the information to provide personalized product recommendations about the best way to care for the user’s hair.
Technology in L’Oréal’s Production Facilities
Along with sensors, cameras, and lasers, IBM's Watson IoT platform helps L’Oréal provide production facilities that are ready for the challenges and opportunities presented by Industry 4.0. Customers are demanding—they want the right formulations to address their specific concerns and accommodate personal preferences. Technology helps L’Oréal production facilities respond to these demands by being more responsive and agile.

Facebook Messenger Bot
As evidence of L’Oréal’s belief in conversational marketing, it partnered with Automat Technologies to launch a Facebook Messenger Bot to enable more personalized conversations with customers (that will ultimately drive sales). Artificial intelligence powers this bot, and by communicating with its customers in a conversational way, individuals will be more likely to open up about their personal preferences. Lubomira Rochet, the company’s chief digital officer, told Marketing Week that “I believe AI is as big a revolution as the internet itself.”

Streamline Recruiting and Hiring
Another way the cosmetics giant uses artificial intelligence is in recruiting and the hiring process. For about 15,000 openings a year, L’Oréal must process nearly a million applications and now uses AI in a variety of ways to free up their human employee’s time. So, Mya is a chatbot that saves significant time in the early stages of the recruiting process by handling questions from candidates and can check off important details such as availability and visa status. Then candidates encounter Seedlink, AI software that assesses their responses to open-ended interview questions. This tool has found candidates that might have been overlooked when just reviewing resumes. In one instance, the company’s recruiters believe they saved 200 hours of time to hire 80 interns out of a pool of 12,000 candidates.

AI-Powered Skin Diagnostic
After acquiring ModiFace, an AI/AR company that offers try-on simulations of beauty products with live video, L’Oréal had a new technology tool to offer customers—a skin diagnostic tool. Of the acquisition, Rochet said in a statement, “With the acquisition of ModiFace, we have started a second phase of L’Oréal’s digital transformation, focused on reinventing the beauty experience through technologies such as voice, AR and AI.”
Using deep learning, the tool uses ModiFace’s AR capabilities with L’Oréal's photo database, skin aging expertise, and Skin Aging Atlases to provide women with a personalized product routine after they upload a selfie to the company’s website. After launching in Canada as Vichy SkinConsultAI at the beginning of 2019, it should be available worldwide later in the year.
It’s expected that L’Oréal will continue to leverage artificial intelligence and technology to its competitive advantage and hopes to remain on the cutting-edge of product personalization and how best to use technology to enhance the beauty industry.

It’s much like the internet has emerged into everyone’s life as a game changer. Artificial intelligence and Data Science are ready to transform our unimaginable lives years ago.Let’s dig deeper into what they have to offer in near future.But before we jump into future, it’s ideal to understand these terms.So let’s get started.What is Data Science and Artificial Intelligence?A streamlined solution process for beings is Artificial Intelligence. It allows software to do duties without being programmed explicitly. Neural networks and profound learning are included. It is the larger notion that machines can execute duties as we consider them.And, the field of studying science that incorporates domain experience, programming abilities and mathematical and statistical knowledge to gain significant insights from data is defined as Data Science. In addition to other experimental types, data science needs observations, questions, assumptions, tests, results analysis and practical suggestions.Why are AI and Data Science Important?In view of the increasing amounts and variants of accessible information, the need for computer processing becomes essential to provide in-depth, inexpensive and readily accessible information. With the assistance of A.I. and Data Science, models that can analyze larger, more complicated information can be automatically automated to return more quick and precise outcomes.Data Science is important because company issues are resolved. When you–and the administration –recognize this, you are on the correct track. Too often companies want to learn the machines, big data projects without thinking about what they really do. If you want to succeed your information researchers, introduce the issues to them–let them develop the alternatives. Simply building a machine learning project will not want to be told. Knowing what the end goal is is crucial.AI is important because they are sufficiently effective to decrease human effort in different fields. Many of them use artificial intelligence to conduct multiple operations in the sector, creating machinery slaves that regularly conduct multiple operations. The application of artificial intelligence helps to make the job quicker and with precise outcomes. The primary reasons behind artificial intelligence are error-free and effective worlds. Even while creating today’s mobile applications, AI has a major role to play. Also many industries have begun using AI technology in recent years to decrease human effort and to achieve more effective and quicker outcomes.Who Is Using These Technologies?BankingThere is always a danger of fraudulence in the banking industry. Monitoring financial market and helps to detect and reduce abuses or malpractices. Data Science has been helping the banks to effectively focus on their resources, take smarter decisions and enhance efficiency. Whereas AI has been helping them overcome traditional obstacles to customer service by providing support lending and regulatory compliance choices.2. E-CommerceData Science helps E-commerce businesses gain a more complete understanding of customers through capturing and integrating web-behavior of customers and their life events, which led to the purchase of a product or service, following the interaction of customers with various channels and more. Whereas AI allows businesses to collect and research information in real time, thereby enabling greater effectiveness and company competence.3. FinanceArtificial intelligence leads to the next economic revolution, from client service to risk management. In finance, AI has automated procedures and decreased customer service costs dramatically. Although the price of financial services has been lowered by AI, on the one side, funding has become highly easy to use. Whereas finance is the data hub. Early consumers and pioneers of data science were used in financial institutions. In the area of developing innovative software development solutions for risk analysis, customer management, the detection of fraud and algorithm trading, data science is commonly used.4. Healthcare & FitnessMedicine and health is a revolutionary sector that offers promising alternatives to data science. Data analysis moves medical science to a whole new level, from computerisation to drug discovery and the exploration of genetic diseases. Healthcare and data science are often connected by finances, since the sector is using a big amount of information to decrease its costs. Whereas The transformative strength of artificial intelligence (IA) is repercussive throughout many sectors, but it has an effect on one — health care — that genuinely changes life. AI apps are revolutionizing how the health industry operates to decrease expenditure and enhance patient results, ranging from hospital care to clinical studies, drug development and insurance.5. InsuranceFrom fraud detection to increased client experience, specialists predict that any significant insurance choice in the next century could be backed by artificial intelligence. And, with the automation of tedious and labor-intensive company procedures, insurers will be able to boost sales and free up time to deal with clients using AI. Whereas Big Data analysis enables the insurers improve their price precision, build tailored goods and services, identify fraud, process for claims, create value for end clients and helps to improve company efficiency and profitability automatically.6. Transportation and ConveyanceWhen customers collect more connected equipment or devices, businesses concentrate on using the information produced by those devices to improve real-time consumer analysis with the help of Data Science. Whereas from independent cars to intelligent roads AI is becoming an important factor to consider in transportation.7. Sales and MarketingAI allows to scale growth for marketers by driving income, and customizing client experiences. Savvy marketers find that AI is an extremely strong approach. It empowers them to excel in their positions through personalized, focused messaging — all at scale — to engage with their audiences. Whereas using data science marketing professionals understand the needed to determine which marketing strategies are most efficient for particular customer.Future of Data SciencePredictions for a science that comprises so many distinct disciplines are very hard to create. This implies you must reflect on the present trends and outlook for each discipline. However, the previous and present state of data science should serve as a useful base for forecasting the future of data science. Data science is therefore mainly concentrated on descriptive analysis in both the past and the present. In other words, the future of Data Science depends on information collection and on what has occurred in the past.However, specialists expect more advanced analytics, including real-time and predictive analysis, to be developed in the future, thanks to fast advances in technology. The industries will once again have a major effect on the look and objectives of data science.Machine learning is also anticipated to change considerably as one of the fundamental components of data science. The data scientists will have to unleash their creativity and make use of distinct modes rather than put their main attention at this teaching mechanics. Although the data scientists have a high degree of efficiency, they will need to improve their efficiency if they want to stay competitive in future and change the way they practice in machine learning.As stated before, the futures and trends that we can expect are not easy to predict, but some researchers believe that there is little to be done in the future simply on the basis of our experience in future trends of data science so far.First of all, we will see fresh information sources emerge. The Internet of Things is not new, but the link between machines supported by this idea in the future will lead to links across electronic devices. Data scientists today use clickstream data, purchase data and sales data, but they will have to include data collected from distinct retail settings, manufacturing streams, offices, cars, staff, etc. in near future.Moreover, the tools used by today’s data scientists are very likely to become more advanced, making complicated tasks much simpler. In fact, we are already witnessing this with so-called BI tools as well as open-source libraries. Many of the algorithms had to be created from zero. There are ready-made codes today that can make this job easier. With the advancement of technology, even new analysts are anticipated to conduct cross-validation and machine learning alone.The increasing level of collaboration between data scientist and system engineers is another thing that will most probably occur in the near future. The first instance of such collaboration has proved very useful to the company’s general efficiency.Finally, two fundamental tasks is required to be focused by data scientist. The first is the preparation of input data using their domain and business understanding. Secondly, the results produced by the tools needs to be analysed and interpreted.Data science is not a fresh idea, but it is becoming more important now and will become much more important in the future according to many professionals.Future of Artificial IntelligenceScience-fiction has always fascinated man, trying to recreate some of the wildest technological imaginations. The fascination was born of robots, smart machines, sophisticated software, artificial intelligence and neural networks, which are now all a thing of the past. We have come a long way from a vision to real progress. The intriguing science and technology that is slowly molding the future of Artificial Intelligence.We think, however, that when artificial intelligence takes complete shape, the future will become more epic. We foresee the future of artificial understanding as nothing short of the best science fiction films. Here is the future of artificial intelligence to paint a better image in your mind.On self-driving cars we’ve heard, read, and seen enough. We have already experienced the first step towards automated transport with technological mammoths like Tesla, Google, Uber and others with self-driving cars. Although certain tests failed, it was successful to take the self-driving cars. We will see replicas on our highways from Back to Future, where cars such as government buses, cabins and even personal cars go driverless and autopilot. Smart cars can take the highways more precisely and pave the way for safer, quicker and more economical transport systems.Today, people are doing some of the most hazardous employment. We go down, get our hands dirty and risk our life, from the cleaning of the waste to fighting fire and disseminating bombs. The amount of life that we lose in these procedures is also very big. Machines or robots can be expected to look after in the near future. With more artificial intelligence evolving and intelligent robots rolling out, people can replace them on some of the world’s most risky employment. This is the only moment that we expect employment from automation.Some of us would have used virtual assistants already. However, we can expect the technology to become private helpers and emotional people as the technology develops. It is extremely feasible that we can emoticize robots and provide them with assistance with artificial intelligence, deep learning and neural networks. They can be used for tons of reasons, such as hospitality, day-care, elderly, clerical employment and many other things. Nowadays many businesses are looking to hire mobile app developers who have expertise in AI as they want to incorporate virtual assistants in their mobile apps.Data is presently one of the strongest stuff. As humans, the absence of knowledge of the present conditions and their implications is one reason we can do nothing about climate change. We also have limited knowledge about the impact of little change and actions on climate change in our day-to-day lives. This is not the situation with computers. With IoT evolving and towns becoming intelligent, we can considerably cut back on the harm that we cause daily with automated utilities, homes and more.Ending upAll these might sound far away, but you’d never believe if we said people have already started working intensively on artificial intelligence. We’re nowhere near seeing the first prototype of super intelligent robots. Machines can make the world a better place with their access to data and accuracy. Therefore, AI development company should do more research and strive hard to bring forward more cutting edge AI technologies to make our lives better and easier. What do you think?

Right now they don’t.Sept. 6, 2019Credit...Claire MerchlinskyShare full articleRead in appBy Gary Marcus and Ernest DavisDr. Marcus is cognitive psychologist and robotics entrepreneur. Dr. Davis is a computer scientist.Artificial intelligence has a trust problem. We are relying on A.I. more and more, but it hasn’t yet earned our confidence.Tesla cars driving in Autopilot mode, for example, have a troubling history of crashing into stopped vehicles. Amazon’s facial recognition system works great much of the time, but when asked to compare the faces of all 535 members of Congress with 25,000 public arrest photos, it found 28 matches, when in reality there were none. A computer program designed to vet job applicants for Amazon was discovered to systematically discriminate against women. Every month new weaknesses in A.I. are uncovered.The problem is not that today’s A.I. needs to get better at what it does. The problem is that today’s A.I. needs to try to do something completely different.In particular, we need to stop building computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical patterns in data sets — often using an approach known as deep learning — and start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately grasp three basic concepts: time, space and causality.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTToday’s A.I. systems know surprisingly little about any of these concepts. Take the idea of time. We recently searched on Google for “Did George Washington own a computer?” — a query whose answer requires relating two basic facts (when Washington lived, when the computer was invented) in a single temporal framework. None of Google’s first 10 search results gave the correct answer. The results didn’t even really address the question. The highest-ranked link was to a news story in The Guardian about a computerized portrait of Martha Washington as she might have looked as a young woman.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.Google’s Talk to Books, an A.I. venture that aims to answer your questions by providing relevant passages from a huge database of texts, did no better. It served up 20 passages with a wide array of facts, some about George Washington, others about the invention of computers, but with no meaningful connection between the two.The situation is even worse when it comes to A.I. and the concepts of space and causality. Even a young child, encountering a cheese grater for the first time, can figure out why it has holes with sharp edges, which parts allow cheese to drop through, which parts you grasp with your fingers and so on. But no existing A.I. can properly understand how the shape of an object is related to its function. Machines can identify what things are, but not how something’s physical features correspond to its potential causal effects.For certain A.I. tasks, the dominant data-correlation approach works fine. You can easily train a deep-learning machine to, say, identify pictures of Siamese cats and pictures of Derek Jeter, and to discriminate between the two. This is why such programs are good for automatic photo tagging. But they don’t have the conceptual depth to realize, for instance, that there are lots of different Siamese cats but only one Derek Jeter and that therefore a picture that shows two Siamese cats is unremarkable, whereas a picture that shows two Derek Jeters has been doctored.In no small part, this failure of comprehension is why general-purpose robots like the housekeeper Rosie in “The Jetsons” remain a fantasy. If Rosie can’t understand the basics of how the world works, we can’t trust her in our home.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWithout the concepts of time, space and causality, much of common sense is impossible. We all know, for example, that any given animal’s life begins with its birth and ends with its death; that at every moment during its life it occupies some particular region in space; that two animals can’t ordinarily be in the same space at the same time; that two animals can be in the same space at different times; and so on.We don’t have to be taught this kind of knowledge explicitly. It is the set of background assumptions, the conceptual framework, that makes possible all our other thinking about the world.Yet few people working in A.I. are even trying to build such background assumptions into their machines. We’re not saying that doing so is easy — on the contrary, it’s a significant theoretical and practical challenge — but we’re not going to get sophisticated computer intelligence without it.If we build machines equipped with rich conceptual understanding, some other worries will go away. The philosopher Nick Bostrom, for example, has imagined a scenario in which a powerful A.I. machine instructed to make paper clips doesn’t know when to stop and eventually turns the whole world — people included — into paper clips.In our view, this kind of dystopian speculation arises in large part from thinking about today’s mindless A.I. systems and extrapolating from them. If all you can calculate is statistical correlation, you can’t conceptualize harm. But A.I. systems that know about time, space and causality are the kinds of things that can be programmed to follow more general instructions, such as “A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm” (the first of Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics).We face a choice. We can stick with today’s approach to A.I. and greatly restrict what the machines are allowed to do (lest we end up with autonomous-vehicle crashes and machines that perpetuate bias rather than reduce it). Or we can shift our approach to A.I. in the hope of developing machines that have a rich enough conceptual understanding of the world that we need not fear their operation. Anything else would be too risky.Gary Marcus (@GaryMarcus), the founder and chief executive of Robust AI, and Ernest Davis, a professor of computer science at New York University, are the authors of the forthcoming book “Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust,” from which this essay is adapted.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

WASHINGTON, D.C.-Today, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry announced the establishment of the DOE Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office (AITO). The Secretary has established the office to serve as the coordinating hub for the work being done across the DOE enterprise in Artificial Intelligence. This action has been taken as part of the President’s call for a national AI strategy to ensure AI technologies are developed to positively impact the lives of Americans.DOE-fueled AI is already being used to strengthen our national security and cybersecurity, improve grid resilience, increase environmental sustainability, enable smarter cities, improve water resource management, as well as speed the discovery of new materials and compounds, and further the understanding, prediction, and treatment of disease. DOE’s National Labs are home to four of the top ten fastest supercomputers in the world, and we’re currently building three next-generation, exascale machines, which will be even faster and more AI-capable computers.     













“The world is in the midst of the Golden Age of AI, and DOE’s world class scientific and computing capabilities will be critical to securing America’s dominance in this field,” said Secretary Perry.  “This new office housed within the Department of Energy will concentrate our existing efforts while also facilitating partnerships and access to federal data, models and high performance computing resources for America’s AI researchers. Its mission will be to elevate, accelerate and expand DOE’s transformative work to accelerate America’s progress in AI for years to come.”    For more information about the Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office, CLICK HERE.###News Media Contact: (202) 586-4940

Although we don't see the motivation or reasoning behind the algorithms we spend so much time with, they are doing great things for us, and so we love them. Unfortunately, we don't necessarily understand them or how they will change us. By we, I don't just mean the general public. I mean software developers, their managers, and even machine learning engineers. AI does some things well and some things poorly, but on balance, the benefits exceed the costs of having an algorithm making decisions.

Just like any relationship, it’s about accepting your partner’s flaws just as much as their charms, and understanding how both can shape your future together. Thought leaders are having a pretty public debate about where this technology is going, and where the relationship may sour. In one specific recent example, Jack Ma and Elon Musk recently discussed the future of humanity in a world run on artificial intelligence. The general viewpoint from Ma was upbeat, while Musk urged caution. These two points of view both have merit. AI is delivering a lot of value, and could also cause a lot of problems. On the positive side, automation with AI is already changing the way we work and play. However, on the cautionary side, imperfect AI systems will not only annoy us, they could bring s to question the technology itself. Simplifying artificial intelligence as Musk and Ma have, casting “AI = good” vs “AI = bad” misses the point that “AI = now”. AI is already here and it will keep getting better. Just so you understand, regular non-AI software does what you tell it to do, whereas AI looks at a set of data to figure out what to do based on the data.

AI algorithms have their flaws but so do things we like, such as driving, and we still accept them. As we embrace the bots (AI algorithms), we shouldn’t hide from the flaws in how things work today. Driving cars causes car crashes, but we love driving. It’s worth the risk. There are many problems in the AI field that need work, including the interpretability of AI models, better tools for dataset handling, more automated machine learning, and avoiding bias. And yet the benefits massively outweigh the risks. We use artificial intelligence in many aspects of our lives, from spam filters to movie recommendations. 

PROMOTED
What are the signs the evolution of artificial intelligence will follow a positive path of widely adopted technology, rather than concentrating within a few large companies? The artificial intelligence community is making a concerted effort to supply tools and education to regular software developers so that more and more business processes can integrate artificial intelligence. For example, there is probably code on GitHub for achieving common artificial intelligence tasks, licensed for free commercial use. I’m not suggesting that these models are production ready, but it’s good to have this development out in the open. The major cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM have made machine learning resources easy to access, and they also support integration partner networks for custom AI development. This is a really good situation, but there is room for improvement. 

AI is a complicated set of technologies, and the way these technologies are used to build products is still evolving. It is well known in the AI industry that there are flaws in the way machine learning models are shared between researchers and eventually used to deliver projects in industry. Specifically, AI models can be fooled with carefully designed adversarial examples (the model sees something when it should see nothing or vice versa), backdoors (the model does the main task but also some other hidden task), and privacy leaks (the model can be reversed to reveal the private training data, or simply bypasses encryption). These problems can apply to everything from self-driving cars to doorbells.

I feel that today the world is using many artificial intelligence capabilities by following a strategy known in the software security world as ""security through obscurity"". It is a bad idea to assume that tinkerers won't eventually figure out how to ""hack"" flawed machine learning models, especially those that they can buy and take apart. And so it makes sense to assume that academics, hackers, and regular Joe will try breaking into places that developers did not want them to go, including analyzing AI models with randomly generated data to see what happens. Trying random data is called fuzzing, and in computer hardware, it has revealed a series of CPU instructions that were not meant to be in the public domain. Similar hacks are going to spring up against AI systems, and like regular software, I predict that AI bugs and data breaches are going to be in the news.

Reverse engineering a doorbell does not seem problematic, but reverse engineering stock trading algorithms would be bad. Simply knowing that someone else uses a particular AI model gives you an advantage in how you operate. Even knowing that a certain signal triggers most AI models to make a mistake is an opening to do naughty things.

[+] cuts a Margherita Pizza for a customer on June 26, 2019. (Photo by Nathan Klima for The Boston Globe via Getty Images)Boston Globe via Getty Images
For example, Alice and Bob are sitting in Eve's pizza shop. Bob uses a free and widely available AI model called ""wants pizza"", to predict that Alice is hungry and wants to buy the last slice of pizza for $1 in 2 minutes. Bob also has a crush on Alice and so he doesn't want to buy the last slice of pizza. Bob is faced with a hunger for pizza, and a fear of rejection, and so he pulls out some cash and is ready to pay $10 for a new pie of Eve's pizza. Eve knows all about the poor quality ""wants pizza"" AI model that Bob is using, and she has studied it well. Eve has a copy of the ""wants pizza"" AI model, and so she knows what it predicted for Bob. Eve also has a better AI model and predicts that Alice will instead get up to use the bathroom, costing Eve $9 in lost revenue when Bob decides to simply buy the last slice for himself. Eve now has an excellent picture of what Alice and Bob think and can take advantage of the pizza market by quickly taking Bob's $10 pizza order before Alice gets up to ask for the key to the restroom. Obviously, this example of information asymmetry applies to more than the pizza market. Trading outfits can take advantage of dark pools to mask their intentions from an order book, and there are many other strategies to avoid telegraphing in advance what orders will be placed. However, regardless of the cat and mouse games to try and hide information from other parties, the main idea I'm trying to convey with this story about Alice, Bob, and Eve is that our software ecosystem today is good at detecting bugs in regular software, when we care about it, but not as good at detecting machine learning bugs, or even knowing about them. Our complicated relationship with models that make predictions will be an important issue even in the very short term. This is an area for improvement.
The general rule in artificial intelligence is that data is power, especially proprietary data. However, keep in mind that AI models are trained on data, and common practice of using pre-trained models means that, even if the source data is not disclosed, the behavior of a disclosed model could be extracted and turned inside out. The most vulnerable AI models are the pre-trained off-the-shelf kind that is widely used but not necessarily widely audited.
Identifying unintentional flaws (bugs) is how Eve keeps one step ahead in the pizza game. There are many ways that these bugs can find their way into AI models. For example, squishing a model down to a smaller size so that it fits onto a phone can cause errors (quantization error), but careful testing can avoid this sort of problem. As with regular software, artificial intelligence can be designed to be really robust, but it takes extra effort that most developers and companies will not invest. 
When you tell an AI-based assistant to set a meeting and it uses the wrong timezone, the two common reactions are “the software is broken” or “I used the software wrong”. Interacting with a human personal assistant, you develop a relationship and develop expectations for how certain tasks will be carried out. As we increasingly rely on AI-based assistants, how do our expectations, and our sense of self, begin to change?
And so it seems that problems abound. Why don't software developers at companies simply fix the problems? Well, many of these problems are not solved yet, and often the issues with machine learning models are introduced by a programmer who has never spoken with the person who wrote the code for the task they are running, who also never met the person who collected the raw data, and so on. As soon as you unwrap the gift basket of machine learning, you will find that complicated math is running under the hood. AI developers need to check that their assumptions are consistent with the mathematics of the software library developers. 
Artificial intelligence, as imperfect as it is, has huge potential to continue to improve our lives, and with any disruptive technology, there will be issues. I want to give you a realistic view of where artificial intelligence has been adding serious economic productivity gains, and where it's just not ready for primetime. I don't want to set off the alarm bells that everything is terrible. It isn't. But in this same vein, we need to acknowledge that as a society we are always playing with stuff while it is still being invented, and eating raw cookie dough because we don't want to wait for the cookies to bake. 
Given that there are these open problems in artificial intelligence that people are working on right now, I foresee artificial intelligence adoption following a similar model to WiFi technology. We upgraded the technology for WiFi several times since the 1990s - remember WEP, WPA, and WPA2 - and even though it was annoying, we all just rolled with the punches because WiFi did (and continues to do) great things for us. 
Moving forward, let's assume these problems get ironed out over time. As artificial intelligence grows up and integrates ever more deeply into our everyday lives, how will AI affect the modern workforce? Let's take a look in the rearview mirror to think about what the past can tell us about where artificial intelligence may take us, and where it really will take a wrecking ball to jobs held by humans today.
Anxiety is a strong motivator, and office workers I talk with feel that automation is coming for their jobs. They don't realize that all the problems mentioned in the first half of this article are limiting the broad adoption of AI. Until that last traffic light comes down in America, we can't have autonomous cars whizzing through intersections without stopping, unlocking the greater efficiency you see when a crowd of humans walks past each other in a courtyard. It's that locked in legacy process of having a system in place that makes radical change slow and costly. And so I'm not worried about, for example, all programmers losing their jobs to AI, as we have been trying to put ourselves out of a job for many years with automated tools, and the sector just keeps growing. But what about office workers, accountants, marketers, and all the rest of the citizens of the cubicle maze? 
The talent economy, in my view, is still strong on the supply and demand sides of the global high-tech economy. There are reasons to be optimistic about the near future. There is a talent shortage among artificial intelligence developers, and even among the broader economy employment is historically quite good, even with underemployment factored in.
So, if the optimistic Jack Ma picture is right in the short term, when will the ""artificial intelligence is good"" party be over? Should humans be looking down in fear at their computerized replacements? I don't think so. The warnings from Musk should encourage us as a society to have a lively debate, not to hide under our desks in the fetal position.SHANGHAI, CHINA - AUGUST 29: Alibaba Group Chairman Jack Ma (L) and Tesla Co-founder/CEO Elon Musk ...

There is a secular trend toward the adoption of AI. It is in a growth mode, driven in part by technology and in part by the general economy. The growth rate of adoption may be fast or slow, but it won’t be negative. Although AI, a term coined in 1956, was based on research in the 1930s and 1940s on neural networks, the majority of techniques in practical applications of AI are still quite new. The end of the last artificial intelligence winter coincided with the beginning of the longest period of stable economic growth in US history. Therefore, the resurgent field of AI has not been battle-tested by a recession as older fields have, such as the dotcom bubble and real-estate crises. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence field, like many emerging technologies in their time, has been plagued by hype, overpromise, and misinformation. Problems with AI are still easy to point out. Problems like AI interpretability, dataset handling tools, automated machine learning, bias, adversarial examples, backdoors, privacy leaks, legacy systems, and so many other factors are holding back AI adoption like a wall of inertia. And so I don't see AI racing to empty office buildings of their human workers. Does that mean the AI field is cooling off? In the short term, I don't see a new AI winter as likely. Recession is a scary word, and the average person still has a visceral reaction to the pain of the 2008 recession and the economic reset that followed. But no two recessions are alike. A recession in the overall economy does not necessarily mean a recession in the artificial intelligence field or even in the high-tech field. 
Even if several signs point to an impending recession (e.g. yield curve inversion), it is important to view corrections in the economy as a controlled burn to keep the core economy healthy, rather than an uncontrolled burn to level the economic neighborhood. In a recession, which hopefully doesn't materialize, people and corporations look for efficiency, and artificial intelligence is all about efficiency. Have a look at a long term chart for a broad index like the Russell 3000 (represents about 98% of all public US equity), which moved from around 200 in the early 1990s to the 1700 level in 2019. Even adjusted for inflation, that's really broad-based growth. The story behind this rise in the US economy has a lot more to do with automation in general than it has to do with something specific like artificial intelligence. Spreadsheets changed the way business is conducted by humans in offices, and that story started way before artificial intelligence shot to prominence over the past decade. I do feel that artificial intelligence is moving into the driver's seat of the automation school bus. Literally. If you drive a truck, automation is coming after your job, plain and simple. It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you.

Other jobs in the economy will not be automated in my lifetime, simply because we don't want robots watching our babies or cutting our hair. And AI, in my view, is more likely to improve human productivity like the spreadsheet did for office workers, rather than replace the humans with complete automation.
And so I take a middle of the road view on how seriously to take the problems with AI and how the technology is being adopted. There are plenty of technical challenges to address right in the here and now. We have not solved cancer yet. We don't have fusion reactors yet. There is a lot of work to do as we humans finish inventing artificial intelligence as a field, and the hope - my hope - is that progress in artificial intelligence will propel us forward in many key areas where humanity could really use a helping hand.
Key Points:


Is AI good or bad? On the whole, artificial intelligence can be a force for good, although it still needs work, because we already have such a complicated relationship with our tech
Is the AI field cooling off? Progress probably won't slow down
Is AI a huge job killer? No more than the humble spreadsheet was. In the same way that spreadsheets provided a jolt of productivity to a wide range of jobs, today's artificial intelligence advances will have a broad impact on many job categories, but will only apply deep damage to a few select areas where humans can be fully replaced, like driving
Should you be integrating AI into your plans and processes? Yes

But today, the 29-year-old does data labelling and makes up to Rs 15,000 a month. The money isn't much but it's more than she made as a teacher, and enough to pay her kids' school fees and her own expenses.She chanced on data labelling work through a You-Tube video in 2017. Today, she scans videos and marks and labels objects encountered by self-driving cars. Her output is used to train artificial intelligence algorithms powering such cars. All Mathi knows is that it makes her life easier. ""I can work from home and don't have to choose between work and family,"" she says. 71049251 Experts say there are about a lakh data labelling jobs posted on various portals currently (Pic: Indranil Das)Mathi is one of the faceless workers helping companies in the US and Europe perfect their machine learning models. For instance, if you're trying to get a driverless car to correctly identify a stop sign, you need to feed that algorithm thousands of images correctly labelled as stop signs. Sharmila Gupta of Gurgaon-based AI Touch likens data labelling to training a newborn. ""Any AI model requires labelled data to get trained. This is like teaching a small child multiple times till they understand."" It's a job that only humans can do and since it is quite labour intensive, it is being outsourced to countries with cheap labour like India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Kenya. 71046795 There is a new AI workforce, says Ajay Shah of HR company TeamLease Services. From an opportunity point of view, there are about a lakh jobs posted on various portals currently.Mary Gray, a researcher and author of the book 'Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass', says there are two main reasons why companies are turning to India for data-labelling and annotation. ""It has a workforce trained in English as a first language and an internet infrastructure created during the first outsourcing boom that relied heavily on India as an offshore labour market,"" says Gray. There is also a growing demand for data-labelling services that are ""localised""- both linguistically and culturally relevant to India - and this work can't be done by workers in the United States. 71046495 Data labelling workers in KolkataPlayment, a crowd-sourced marketplace that trains annotators from scratch, where Hyderabad's Mathi works, has 25,000 annotators between the age of 18 and 30 years working remotely across India, and its co-founder Siddharth Mall claims that anyone with a laptop and basic English skills can start working. ""Everybody talks about how AI will make people lose their jobs, but there are also new kinds of jobs being created,"" he says. These youngsters earn anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000 a month.It's not a fortune but it's helping many annotators - most of them stay-at-home moms, fresh graduates and even students, such as 21-year-old Shiekha Mahara from Nalgonda, Telangana - get by. Mahara, who recently completed a BTech degree, began looking for online work opportunities to help out with her family's finances. She has earned Rs 1.3 lakh so far while doing occasional projects for Playment over the last year and a half. 71046796 Unlike Playment which pays people on a contractual basis, iMerit, a data annotation company with offices in India and the US and data labelling centres in Ranchi, Shillong, Vizag and Kolkata, has 2,500 people on their rolls. What they have in common is an overwhelmingly young workforce. At iMerit, the average age of employees is just 24. Jai Natarajan, VP, marketing and strategic business development, says that nearly 80% of their employees come from underprivileged backgrounds, while 50% are women. ""Our employees are positioned for the future because they understand that they have to learn new things, that nothing stays still,"" says Natarajan. iMerit's employees do data labelling for drones in the agriculture sector, medical imagery such as MRI scans, e-commerce, and sports analytics.Mujeeb Kolasseri, a high school dropout from Mannarkkad in Kerala, founded his own data labelling company Infolks in 2015 after learning the work online. Today, the company employs nearly 250 people, nearly half of them from poor families in Kolasseri's village. New employees get trained on image annotation tools for two months. ""Nearly 80% are freshers. With proper training, anyone can work on image annotation without any technical knowledge - you just need to be a quick learner,"" says Kolasseri, who was forced to quit his studies because of his family's financial problems. 71046535 Data labelling workers in KeralaJitendra Kumar, 27, would agree. Six months ago, Kumar, who used to drive a four-wheeler for weddings and parties in his hometown Etawah, Uttar Pradesh, found a data labelling job with Gurgaon-based firm AI Touch. ""Now, I get a salary on time, work in an office and can spend some time with my family as well,"" says Kumar.Kumar's colleague Satyam Barthwal, a Chinese interpreter, was hired after the company got work from a Chinese AI company. ""I hadn't even heard of data labelling before I got the call,"" says Barthwal, who sees the job as a way to earn money till he fulfils his dream of becoming a singer. ""The work is easy - we just need to read labels.""But as machine learning evolves, will it make the work of data labelling redundant in the future? ""Since we started in 2013, the precision, nuance and sophistication required has gone up. Sometimes we need domain experts. But even then, you need humans to review, audit and keep track of results. There is going to be a role in AI for humans for a long time,"" adds Natarajan of iMerit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/71030863'}",,,,,,,,

From daily lives to corporate cultures, everything is being impacted by the novel technology. Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategically improves business processes by giving managers the power to analyze a vast amount of valuable data derived from customers as well as employees.When it comes to human resources, AI is particularly solving one of the greatest issues managers have been facing for many years- to improve employee engagement and retention rates.Trending AI Articles:1. Deep Learning Book Notes, Chapter 12. Deep Learning Book Notes, Chapter 23. Machines Demonstrate Self-Awareness4. Visual Music & Machine Learning Workshop for KidsThe Looming Engagement Crisis across IndustriesAI has the potential to give managers the power to make a better workplace, where employees don’t feel distracted or dissatisfied with their job roles.Source: https://www.thepeoplespace.com/practice/articles/were-more-machine-now-man-hr-and-digital-journeyAt present, organizations are increasingly moving towards AI technology to enhance employee engagement within the workplaces. From onboarding to collaboration, training to information sharing, AI is changing the way human resource department functions to keep employees satisfied.And in a way, AI is helping organizations deal with several critical crises through innovative use cases and applications.Impact of AI on Boosting EngagementCorporate organizations have been dealing with the problem of dissatisfaction and non-engaged workers for a long time. Often, corporate appraisal and feedback process are long, asking managers for feedback on employee’s performance, annually.In a dynamic work environment where every employee is seeking purpose and growth opportunities, such obsolete practices lead to a feeling of discontent among the workforce. Non-satisfied work is often not engaged and committed to their jobs, like they should, leading to a dip in productivity and efficiency.Artificial Intelligence can be used to identify instances of dissatisfaction among the workforce through a unique sentiment analysis solution. With the help of artificial intelligence, organizations can understand how an employee is feeling about developments within the office- the way his/her boss behaves, the work environment, relationship with his/her colleagues and lot more.Artificial Intelligence-powered sentiment analysis can analyze vast amounts of unstructured employee data to derive meaningful insights about overall employee engagement.Sentiment Analysis in Modern Corporate EnvironmentSentiment analysis is a unique concept that derives useful insights about employee’s mindset and thoughts by analyzing how he/she is communicating within the office environment. By keeping a close eye on his/her language, tone, and interests in communication via email and other channels, sentiment analysis can understand if he/she is happy or dissatisfied with what he is doing in a company.Language is how a person expresses his/her thoughts to others. Using sentiment analysis, companies can mine the underlying data in every sentence, interaction and correspondence for own benefit.Sentiment analysis allows companies to analyze large amounts of textual data and categorize the same based on the sentiment or attitude in which it has been created. By using the structured data, organizations can gauge the mood of the employees within a department, office or location and create meaningful solutions that boost employee engagement.Discover how AI can boost employee engagement through sentiment analysisHow Sentiment Analysis works?Sentiment Analysis blends natural language processing with machine learning and AI to offer meaningful insights from how an employee is responding to conversations. Making use of machine learning algorithms, a system is train to identify words that might be negative or problematic.Vast amount of data is then analyzed to see if employees are concerned about a specific aspect of their work environment or job. Using a mix of survey responses and emails, sentiment analysis discovers areas that might need intervention by a human HR manager.Real-world Applications of AI-powered Sentiment Analysis ModelsSentiment analysis has a variety of applications and implications in the modern corporate environment. In fact, there are more than a few ways to employ sentiment analysis techniques to gauge how employees feel about their jobs and workplace. Here are a few real-life use cases to leverage the power of sentiment analysis for building a better workplace:Using sentiment analysis for analyzing emailsThis is one of the most common ways of implementing sentiment analysis within office cultures. Sentiment analysis tools can be programmed to determine how engaged employees remain throughout the day. By identifying exact words and phrases, email-based sentiment analysis tool can help infer insights based on departmental level or individual level. Such insightful data can then be used to address specific issues or introduce organization-wide changes to improve the culture.Gauging Intent from Comments on Public PlatformsA great way to utilize sentiment analysis technology is to take insights from the feedback and comments posted by employees on the company’s public platforms, inter* net or performance review platforms. The data related to social commentary can be analyzed by machine learning tools to understand the basic sentiment and mood of the employees.Sentiment analysis can categorize comments by identifying negative issues or positive ones to create a general idea about how engaged and satisfied employees are on the job.Analyzing Employee FeedbackIt is a common practice among companies to gather employee feedback on various aspects like work culture, office environment, colleague relationships and what they feel while working. This system of listening to the employees is often not backed by meaningful decision making as companies lack the technologies to analyze the vast amount of unstructured data.With the help of sentiment analysis tools, companies can actually derive useful insights from the survey data and feedback received by the employees. The text analysis platforms powered by natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence gives useful information about the employee sentiment and engagement.What Difference does Artificial Intelligence Make in Corporate Organizations?Artificial intelligence-powered sentiment analysis tools can serve as a potent solution to the problem of deteriorating employee engagement metrics. Here are a few ways how sentiment analysis powered by AI is helping corporate organizations improve employee engagementIdentifying Smart TrendsSentiment analysis algorithms analyze vast amounts of employee survey data and qualitative feedback to offer actionable insights on how to engage employees. Not only this provides a holistic picture of engagement levels, it helps the management in evaluating and rolling out changes based on the employee aspirations.Such deep analytics capabilities help organizations understand large scale trends that can enable organizations to make concrete changes to the overall employee engagement, learning and development and other HR policies.Employee EmpowermentSentiment analysis can empower employees like never before. When an organization takes advantage of artificial intelligence to listen and understand how employees feel about everything inside the office, it leads to the development of positive work culture. Management teams and HR desks make an effort to change the things that create dissatisfaction, which in turn make employees feel that their opinion, however subtle, is heard, appreciated and worked upon. This gives employees more confidence to speak out and be a part of the change, giving them a sense of empowerment.The data-based analytics powered by sentiment analysis is paving way for a better work environment where employees can make a real difference by voicing their opinions, which in turn gets heard by the management team.Wrapping UpArtificial Intelligence is a truly revolutionizing force that can change the way everyone works. While for the organizations, this means a better understanding of their workforce, for the employees it means higher satisfaction levels and a feeling of fulfillment. Just like a mutually dependent relationship, this synergy created by sentiment analysis is beneficial for all the stakeholders, employees, management as well as the end clients- as satisfied employees lead to better services.If you are eager to explore the advantages of sentiment analysis tools for your organization, you should get in touch with an artificial intelligence development company, today. A professional AI development company can help you deploy sentiment analysis tools that will help you analyze data and derive meaningful insights for higher engagement.Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://becominghuman.ai/sentiment-analysis-and-employee-engagement-how-companies-can-leverage-ai-3aa7d2e0dd4b,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",https://becominghuman.ai/sentiment-analysis-and-employee-engagement-how-companies-can-leverage-ai-3aa7d2e0dd4b,2019-09-06T13:13:40.821Z,2019-09-06T13:13:40.821Z,2021-12-11T14:57:46.269Z,,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*-ucgUkZf_pe9la3KLlnkCg.jpeg'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Namee Jani', 'url': 'https://becominghuman.ai/@namee.jani'}",,,Sentiment Analysis and Employee Engagement: How Companies can Leverage AI?,,,,,,Sentiment Analysis and Employee Engagement: How Companies can Leverage AI?,,,,,['Namee Jani'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3aa7d2e0dd4b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new system is composed of three components:1. Domain logic service —”artificial intelligence”2. Storage & retrieval service3. Backing data-store (Redis)Domain logic service processes input data and produces a 1024-dimensional normalized vector that represents the data. Which is then passed onto the Storage & retrieval service to be persisted.At retrieval time, Domain logic service produces another vector from the input that is transformed using same processing logic and Storage & retrieval service is tasked with producing a set of vectors that are already persisted in the system that are most similar to the given input.The reason the system is decomposed this way is because storage and retrieval is a challenging problem in itself. To isolate the problem, I placed it in a self-contained service. And following text is intended to explain why.Vector SimilarityBecause we work with vectors, let’s define “similarity” of two vectors as follows: Vector a is similar to input vector b if a) a is identical to b or b) distance between vectors a and b is smaller than distance between vector b and any other vector in the dataset and this distance is lower than given threshold.There are different methods for calculating distance between vectors:1. Euclidean distance2. Cosine distance3. CartesianVisual representation of euclidean distance (d) and cosine similarity (θ)This is a visual representation of euclidean distance (d) and cosine similarity (θ). While cosine looks at the angle between vectors (thus not taking into regard their weight or magnitude), euclidean distance is similar to using a ruler to actually measure the distance.Cosine similarity is generally used as a metric for measuring distance when the magnitude of the vectors does not matter. Which is exactly what we are going to use here. Our vectors come to Storage & retrieval service normalized (all vectors are unit vectors with length 1).Now that we established what it means to find “similar” vectors, let’s look at the real challenge — retrieving the set of similar vectors.The ChallengeA brute force approach for finding similar vectors would be to take the input and calculate cosine similarity to every other vector in the data set. Comparing vector to “all other vectors” does not scale well (it’s linear — O(n)) and considering the dimensionality of the vectors, you can see this becomes very ineffective when the data set grows. Not very practical if you need a realtime system that will process high number of these queries per second…Locality-Sensitive HashingInstead, we are going to use Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH).In computer science, LSH is an algorithmic technique that hashes similar input items into same “buckets” with high probability (the number of buckets are much smaller than the universe of possible input items).LSH primarily differs from conventional hashing (aka cryptographic) in the sense that cryptographic hashing tries to avoid collisions but LSH aims to maximize collisions for similar inputs.With LSH, vectors that are close to each other (“similar”) have same hash value, and vectors that are far apart have different hash value (“dis-similar”).This offers a potential solution to us— if we hash our vectors using LSH, we can reduce the number of vector comparisons required for a match retrieval.We can limit our search to a bucket (or set of buckets) to dramatically reduce the number of vectors for which we calculate cosine distance. But number of vectors to search can still be significant even within a bucket, if we consider datasets with millions of vectors. More on that later.However, this comes at a cost. The keyword you should focus on in the previous LSH definition is “probability”. LSH is not an exact algorithm, it uses approximation. There is no guarantee that similar vectors in the dataset will end up in the same bucket. It depends on the parameters that we provide to our algorithm how “probable” it will be for similar vectors to have the same hash.An important thing to note here is that for my use case, similarity cut off (threshold) is the cosine distance of 0.36, which is very wide and that makes the use of LSH more difficult because you need to consider much wider set of vectors. And LSH works best on vectors that are very close together.Luckily, we have one advantage working in our favor. We don’t need the single most similar vector. We can approximate. We can terminate the search within a bucket as soon as we find the first vector with distance smaller than our threshold. Let’s take an example of facial recognition. There, each vector in the system represents a face. But every person has multiple faces (multiple photos of his or her face) associated. And let’s say we are searching for a person using another face as an input. We don’t need to retrieve the single closest vector — the most similar face. We just need a face that is “close” enough (below specified threshold). By definition, that threshold should guarantee that every such vector below the threshold represents same person.While gathering notes for this article, I decided to put my current implementation to a test to understand performance of my system, and to see if I can improve upon it. And boy, did I learn a lot of things!BaselineBecause my objective was to observe (and hopefully improve) my current implementation, I first had to establish a way to measure the system under observation and then establish a baseline upon which we are trying to improve.I am lucky because I have been developing and testing my system for a while now, and I have “real-world” data from test users to play with.To setup my experiments, I hand picked a dataset of ~250 vectors to seed my system and nearly 3000 vectors to be used for similarity retrieval (i.e. “is any of the 250 seeded vectors similar to each one of the 3000 test vectors?”). This is not a huge dataset if you were to talk about production scale, but remember that we want to use this to observe accuracy of our algorithms, not hardware performance. And for that purpose it should be sufficient. Also worth noting, this dataset mustn’t be confused with dataset for training the artificial intelligence sub-system. That is already pre-trained on millions of data points and it’s out of scope of what we are discussing here today.To establish accuracy baseline, I used simple “brute-force” approach. That way, I am always guaranteed the most accurate result, at the cost of comparing my input with every single vector in the “database”. That’s the dreaded O(n) linear performance.Total number of “matches” was 673, with following similarity distribution:Similarity distribution histogram for baseline scenario (no approximation)To state the obvious, probability of finding the “right” match in this case is always 1. That is, if a similar vector exists, it will be retrieved. Looking at the probability graph for different algorithms will be the key to understanding their accuracy.Probability of retrieving correct match in brute-force approachApproximationNext, I decided to measure my currently implemented algorithm. Enter the world of problem approximation with LSH. Ideally, what we would like to see with LSH is reduced complexity (better than linear) of our search but keep accuracy at — or close to- 100%. To achieve this holy grail we would need to come up with a step function that hashes all vectors below threshold to same bucket and all other vectors to a different bucket. If we then search vectors within that particular bucket, we greatly reduce the search space and yet we are guaranteed to find similar vectors (provided they exist in our data set).Ideal case — step functionFirst we need calculate binary hash from our input vector. To do that, we partition the space by n random planes. For each plane, vector ends up in one of the two regions which the plane separates. We assign value of 1 if vector is on the positive side, or 0 if vector is on the negative side. Intuitively, the closest two documents are, the more likely they will be on the same region for a random plane. For example, if two documents are almost on top of each other, then they will end up on the same region for most of the planes that you can come up with.For planes drawn at random, it can be mathematically proven that two documents x and y hash to the same value with probability:The expression encapsulates our intuition: The closer two documents are (small θ) the greater the chances they end up in the same region.If we use just one plane to split our space in half, probability of two vectors having the same hash would be:Probability of two vectors having same single-bit binary hashYou can interpret this as probability of two vectors with cosine similarity 0.36 (threshold) to be hashed into same bucket to be roughly 0.72 (72%). Which may sound ok at first, but it also means that in 0.38 (38%) of cases, similar vectors will hash to different buckets (and thus we won’t find our match). And we only reduced our search space by 50%. That is not a good optimization, considering we are loosing a fair bit of accuracy.Let’s add more more random planes to end up with a hash which will look something like this:01110011(8-bit hash constructed by dividing space by 8 random hyperplanes)Now our probability decreases. It becomes very unlikely for vectors to hash into the same bucket unless they are nearly identical. Which, if you recall, is exactly what we established early on about LSH — the algorithm works best for very close matches (very small cosine distance between vectors).Probability of two vectors having same 8bit binary hashBut there are different techniques we can employ to improve our situation.Explore nearby bucketsConsider partial hash matchesNearby bucketsTo explore nearby buckets, I added Hamming distance hash variations.The idea is simple: once we obtain LSH hash, we calculate variations of that hash up to n distance. This allows for error correction for vectors that are similar according to our criteria, but end up in different buckets.If we take the hash from previous example, variations with Hamming distance 1 would be:1111001100110011010100110110001101111011011101110111000101110010For Hamming distance 2, we get:101100111101001111100011111110111111011111110001111100100001001100110011001110110011011100110001001100100100001101011011010101110101000101010010etc.In my case I chose a Hamming distance of 3, which produces total of 1+8+ 7*8/2 + 6*7/2 + 5*6/2 + 4*5/2 + 3*4/2 + 2*3/2 + 1*2/2 =93 variations. This gives us following probability of finding the correct match:8bit hash with Hamming distance 3Which is much better than the previous case, and shape of the curve starts to resemble the ideal step function. But it’s a clear tradeoffs between accuracy (approximation) and performance (time/resources it takes to get the result).This configuration gives satisfactory 93% accuracy compared to the baseline, and the sub-linear complexity provides average 63.7% reduction in the search space. Let me explain: in a hypothetical scenario with 1 million uniformly distributed vectors in our database, we keep ~3906 vectors in each one of the 256 buckets (8 bit hash = 256 different buckets). We need to search 93 buckets per query, which gives us ~363281 vectors to search (36.3% of 1 million stored vectors). But I could not stress enough that these calculations are average results in idealized scenario (uniformly distributed vectors), in reality, vectors will be more clustered in some buckets producing widely different results for different queries.That is a modest improvement, but it also cost us 7% of accuracy. In other words, in 7% of cases, there was a similar vector in the database but we did not find it.For completeness sake, let me explain how the actual data persistence is implemented. I use Redis and every hash simply translates to a key in the data store. Value is a Redis list of vectors to be searched along with metadata (for example, in music recommendation service that could be name of a song, an artist, …) that is returned in the query response.Partial hash matchesAs a last experiment, I tried a slightly different algorithm that I found while doing my research on LSH.For this experiment, we generate longer hash, but split it in multiple groups and search every bucket where at least one hash group matches a group in our query.input: 01110011 11001001 11001100(24 bit hash split in 3 groups)And if we have two different vectors stored in the system, hashed asa: 00110010 11001001 10001100b: 11000011 11001001 11001000Our input vector will be considered similar to vector b because the second group (11001001) matches the second group of the input.It was not until later - when I started analyzing my results - that I realized mistake I made only using 24bit hash split in 3 groups. This third experiment had no chance of outperforming my current implementation. The reason was staring me right in the face:24bit hash split in 3 groupsOnce I calculated the probability graph, I understood why I only saw 71% accuracy compared to the baseline. The probability of hashing two vectors with cosine distance of 0.36 falls down to ~22%. While the performance was better — in our idealized scenario with 1 million vectors, using this algorithm we only need to compare (on average)~12k vectors, a.k.a we reduce the search space by 98.8%.Because we split the hash to groups and we need to consider each group separately, we need a different mechanism to query Redis backend.For a sample hash 01110011 11001001 11001100, we break it down to 3 Redis keys:01110011xxx11001001xxx11001100and we store the vector under each of the three keys. This creates duplication of data, but allows us to find vectors when only some of the groups that make up the hash match. We also need to introduce an additional step before returning our results to filter out duplicates.Can we do better?That is something I have been thinking about a lot. And it’s not just me — this is fairly cutting edge stuff and lot of people far more clever than me are spending a lot of time coming up with new algorithms to query large volumes of high-dimensional data.I have been playing with different configurations to fine tune precision vs. performance of the system. But at the end of the day, it’s just that — marginal improvements that, while important, don’t drastically change the observed behavior and the (at best) sub-linear performance.I try to look at the problem from a different angle, too. My system stores a large number of vectors that might be used shortly after being stored but more often than not aren’t used at all. It’s only a small subset of vectors that end up being returned in majority of cases as most similar.What if we were more aggressive about reducing the overall size of the dataset?My plan is to implement of time-to-live (TTL), concept well known in caching, to only keep vectors “used” (retrieved) in certain window of time (and re-new TTL every time the vector is used, perhaps even with a sliding window — first TTL to be 1 hour, after the vector is “used”, next TTL will be 1 day, then 1 week, and so on…). That, combined with the ability to disable TTL for some vectors, should allow me to purge large number of vectors from the data set and worry little less about performance of the algorithm.Another thing to consider in future is parallel processing. We could partition our data set to be stored and queried on different nodes and then combine partial results into a final result (map-reduce). Perhaps, that will be another interesting topic to write about soon?",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-backend-system-for-artificial-intelligence-c404efade360,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Towards Data Science', 'url': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 192, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:384/1*cFFKn8rFH4ZndmaYeAs6iQ.png'}}",https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-backend-system-for-artificial-intelligence-c404efade360,2019-09-06T16:16:07.912Z,2019-09-06T16:16:07.912Z,2021-12-11T14:55:39.698Z,,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*nTFLnEOWDfGjaY8zSWSjxw.jpeg'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ondrej Stastny', 'url': 'https://towardsdatascience.com/@mail_50938'}",,,Building a Backend System for Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,Building a Backend System for Artificial Intelligence,,,,,['Ondrej Stastny'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,c404efade360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modern ANNs, often also called Deep Learning (DL), have increased tremendously in complexity such that machines can train themselves to process and learn from data that has been supplied to them as input, and almost match human performance in many tasks. However, how they arrive at decisions is unknown, making them less useful when the reason for decisions is necessary.This work has been performed by Dr Vineeth N Balasubramanian, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Hyderabad, and his students Aditya Chattopadhyay, Piyushi Manupriya, and Anirban Sarkar. Their work has recently been published in the Proceedings of 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, considered worldwide to be one of the highest-rated conferences in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Speaking about this research, Dr. Vineeth Balasubramanian said, “The simplest applications that we know of Deep Learning (DL) is in machine translation, speech recognition or face detection. It enables voice-based control in consumer devices such as phones, tablets, television sets and hands-free speakers. New algorithms are being used in a variety of disciplines including engineering, finance, artificial perception and control and simulation. Much as the achievements have wowed everyone, there are challenges to be met.”A key bottleneck in accepting such Deep Learning models in real-life applications, especially risk-sensitive ones, is the ‘interpretability problem.’ The DL models, because of their complexity and multiple layers, become virtual black boxes that cannot be deciphered easily. Thus, when a problem arises in the running of the DL algorithm, troubleshooting becomes difficult, if not impossible, said Dr Vineeth Balasubramanian. The DL algorithms are trained on a limited amount of data that are most often different from real-world data. Furthermore, human error during training, and unnecessary correlations in data can result in errors that must be corrected, which becomes hard. “If treated as blackboxes, there is no way of knowing whether the model actually learned a concept or a high accuracy was just fortuitous,” added Dr Vineeth Balasubramanian.The practical implications of the lack of transparency in DL models are that end-users can lose their trust over the system. There is thus a need for methods that can access the underbelly of the AI programs and unravel their structure and functions. The IIT Hyderabad team approached this problem with ANN architectures using causal inference with what is known in the field as a ‘Structural Causal Model.’ Explaining this area of work, Dr Balasubramanian said, “Thanks to our students’ efforts and hard work, we have proposed a new method to compute the Average Causal Effect of an input neuron on an output neuron. It is important to understand which input parameter is ‘causally’ responsible for a given output; for example in the field of medicine, how does one know which patient attribute was causally responsible for the heart attack? Our (IIT Hyderabad researchers’) method provides a tool to analyze such causal effects.”Transparency and understandability of the workings of DL models are gaining importance as discussions around the ethics of Artificial intelligence grows, added Dr Balasubramanian on the importance of his team’s work on ‘explainable machine learning.’ This makes sense given that the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulation requires that an explanation must be provided if a machine learning model is used for any decisions made on its citizens, on any domain, be it banking, security or health.The code developed by the IIT Hyderabad researchers to understand the workings of DL models, is available for free at https://piyushi-0.github.io/ACE/.

But for all the authentic and exciting ways it’s transforming the tasks computers can perform, there’s a lot of hype, too. 

As Jeremy Achin, CEO of newly minted unicorn DataRobot, puts it: “Everyone knows you have to have machine learning in your story or you’re not sexy.”


The inherently broad term gets bandied about so often that it can start to feel meaningless and gets trotted out by companies to gussy up even simple data analysis. To help cut through the noise, Forbes and data partner Meritech Capital put together a list of private, U.S.-based companies that are wielding some subset of artificial intelligence in a meaningful way and demonstrating real business potential from doing so. One makes robots that can whir around shoppers to help workers restock shelves. Another scans recruiting pitches for unconscious bias. A third analyzes massive data sets to make street-by-street weather predictions.

To be included on the list, companies needed to show that techniques like machine learning (where systems learn from data to improve on tasks), natural language processing (which enables programs to “understand” written or spoken language), or computer vision (which relates to how machines “see”) are a core part of their business model and future success. Find all the details on our methodology here.

The honorees span categories like human resources, security, insurance, and finance, with healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure startups best represented on the list. While most of the 50 hail from traditional tech centers like Silicon Valley, New York City and Boston, there’s representation from smaller hubs such as Detroit and Austin, too. Cumulatively, the startups are flush with cash–unsurprising, given that startups touting AI received a record $7.4 billion in funding in just the second quarter of 2019, according to CBInsights. Only eight startups were founded or cofounded by women, reflecting trends in venture funding, where software startups run by men have received the lion’s share of investment dollars. That’s a possible cause for concern: Studies have shown that artificial intelligence can compound existing biases in data, which may be more likely to happen if there are fewer women and underrepresented minorities in the room.
The winners below are listed in order of ascending valuation, and in each case we’ve tried to focus on the problem the company is trying to solve instead of the tool solving it. In instances where companies submitted valuation information on the condition of confidentially, Forbes used estimates from data provider Pitchbook.

AI 50 founders reflect on the biggest misconceptions they hear about artificial intelligence and Meritech Capital principal Konstantine Buhler explains how he evaluates startups.

Headquarters: Seattle 
Founders: Ali Farhadi,  Mohammad Rastegari (CEO: Jon Gelsey)
Funding: $14.6 million, via Pitchbook
Valuation: $62.05 million, via Pitchbook
While researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Ali Farhadi and Mohammad Rastegari identified a problem: “Most of the time, AI researchers (including ourselves) tend to make better, newer algorithms with more demand for compute, memory and power,” Farhadi says. “However, the real-world use cases tend to move in the opposite direction—demanding solutions with less compute, memory and power.” They set about trying to create a system where complex algorithms could run on simple hardware and spun out of the Allen Institute, which was cofounded by the late Paul Allen of Microsoft, in 2016. Earlier this year, the company hit a technology breakthrough when it managed to run a simple computer vision system on a solar-powered computer chip.

41 | Rulai 
Headquarters: Campbell, CA 
Founders: Marc Vanlerberghe (CEO), Yi Zhang
Funding: $14.5 million
Valuation: $80 million
While chat bots burst onto the scene with a lot of promise (remember how they were going to take over Facebook Messenger?), they never quite reached mainstream adoption, due in part to disenchantment with their limited scope and conversational rigidity. Rulai says its virtual assistants are different. While most bots run into trouble when users switch context or add tasks, cofounder Yi Zhang says that Rulai’s dialog manager models don’t get tripped up. “Virtual assistants need to handle the variation of natural language and the variation of conversation flows,” she says. Rulai has won over the likes of Lyft, Sanofi and Fidelity with its customer support, sales and employee productivity bots.

33 | Tamr
Headquarters: Cambridge, MA
Founders: Andy Palmer (CEO), Ihab Ilyas, Mike Stonebraker 
Funding: $73.5 million
Valuation: $155 million, via Pitchbook
Data management company Tamr was born out of an MIT research project to apply machine learning to clean and organize so-called dirty data that’s incomplete or inconsistent. Andy Palmer was running data engineering at pharmaceutical company Novartis when MIT’s system was brought in to organize a decade’s worth of biological assay information spread across more than 15,000 tables. The technology worked so well that he and two of the researchers decided to start a company around it. “The only way to curate thousands of tabular data sources that are constantly changing is using an artful combination of machine learning and human expertise,” says Palmer, who is now CEO. In practice, that means that Tamr’s system automatically identifies sources of data across a company that could be useful together and then tags in an employee to instruct the software how to integrate it. The company sells its service to customers like Toyota, GSK and GE, which it says saved over $80 million using Tamr.

Valuation: $200 million, via Pitchbook
K Health doesn’t think that everyday health concerns need to warrant a trip to the doctor’s office. “K was built by technologists and doctors because we felt frustrated with the ability to access relevant, personalized and affordable healthcare,” says cofounder and CEO Allon Bloch. The company’s consumer app draws on a data set of more than 2 billion anonymized medical records, finding subtle patterns in the data to give users personalized health advice. In July, K announced a partnership with insurance provider Anthem to let members see how doctors diagnose and treat similar people with similar symptoms for free (though they’ll be charged to chat with an actual doctor).

28 | Moveworks
Headquarters: Mountain View, CA
Founders: Bhavin Shah (CEO), Vaibhav Nivargi, Varun Singh, Jiang Chen
Funding: $30 million 
Valuation: $200 million+
Moveworks wants to end the frustration of waiting around for corporate IT help–its natural language understanding engine can solve 25% to 35% of all employee IT issues autonomously. For example, if a worker sends a frantic message like,  “Sorry, I was biking to work and dropped my laptop accidentally, and it won’t turn on now. What should I do?? Please help!” the system can both understand the problem and send the right form for a loaner laptop. Moveworks has a “deep, semantic understanding of the kinds of problems employees experience and how they express them,” CEO Bhavin Shah says. Big customers like Autodesk, Western Digital and Nutanix are on board.

Founder: Jason Chicola (CEO), David Abrameto, Mark Chen, Paul Huck, Dan Kokotov. 
Funding: $31 million
Valuation: $206 million
In June, transcription service Rev.com said that its tests show that its word error rate on podcast transcriptions was lower than what Google, Amazon or Microsoft’s tools produced. While developers can buy access to that completely automated speech recognition engine, its network of freelance transcribers also use it to make their client work easier and faster. CEO Jason Chicola says this hybrid approach leads to higher- quality, cheaper transcriptions. “Language is incredibly complex—think accents, mumbling, arcane terminology, bad microphones, background noise,” says Chicola. “Humans are far, far better at making judgment calls for these real-world factors.”

Funding: $51 million, via Pitchbook
Valuation: $210 million, via Pitchbook 
Stephen Pratt first saw machine learning in action while working as a consultant on a Department of Defense project in the early 1990s. Computers were too slow and data too expensive to make AI practical at the time, but roughly three decades later, Pratt teamed up with investment firm TPG to help it identify a data analytics company to buy or invest in. After a yearlong search he couldn’t find the right fit and joined IBM Watson, but only stayed for eight months before deciding to build something new with TPG’s backing. Pratt gathered a handful of industry vets as his cofounders and Noodle.ai launched on Pi Day 2016 (3.14.16). The startup charges a one-time fee to create AI software for industrial and transportation companies, with a monthly hosting fee on top. It’s booked $50 million in total contract value from the likes of XoJet and Big River Steel.

Valuation: $210 million, via Pitchbook
The red-hot autonomous trucking space is full of well-funded competition, but that inherent risk isn’t deterring Kodiak Robotics cofounders Don Burnette and Paz Eshel (the two met on a sky-diving trip, after all). The idea is that autonomously driving cargo-laden trucks down a highway could be a nearer-term and even more attractive commercial opportunity than passenger vehicles. Kodiak recently started shipping household goods in between Dallas and Houston, Texas, but said that it can’t name clients just yet. Ultimately, it plans to build its own comprehensive logistics business instead of selling its technology to other carriers.

People.ai CEO Oleg Rogynskyy says he’ll never forget the moment he realized how much time salespeople spend doing nonsales things. At the time, he was an early employee at a company called Nstein Technologies. “The COO of Nstein grounded the whole sales team for a week in a sweaty, windowless conference room to go and clean up our Salesforce,” Rogynskyy recalls. That week inspired him to address “bad” customer relationship management data head-on, he says. In 2016, Rogynskyy founded People.ai, which integrates into CRM systems like Salesforce and automatically inputs relevant data from email, calendars, Slack chats and more, and advises salespeople on the “best” tasks to focus on. VMware, Zoom, New Relic and Lyft are all customers.

Valuation: $750 million, via Pitchbook
Upstart CEO Dave Girouard admits that most of the early team of former Google employees had no history in financial services when they came up with the idea to apply advanced data science to the credit process in 2012: Only the belief that the current system was antiquated and exclusionary. By using data not typically found in a person’s credit history to find more nuanced risk patterns, Girouard says Upstart’s lending model has higher approval rates and lower interest rates than traditional methods, with loss rates that are “less than half” of those of peer platforms. To-date, more than 300,000 individual borrowers have used Upstart to get a loan.

Founders: Eyal Shinar (CEO), Tomer Michaeli, Yuval Ariav
Funding: $140 million 
Valuation: $750 million
Fundbox has a data-driven take on lending that facilitates loans to small businesses rather than regular people. Founder Eyal Shinar says that seeing his mother, who ran a staffing agency, struggle with cash flow inspired the idea of advancing customers for outstanding invoices. A company that wants a loan through Fundbox connects their existing finance tools to its platform, which then uses these data streams to assess risk and either approve the loan or not. Shinar says that process can take as little as three minutes.

10 | Anduril Industries 
Headquarters: Irvine, CA
Founders: Palmer Luckey, Brian Schimpf (CEO), Trae Stephens, Matt Grimm, Joe Chen
Funding: $180 million
Valuation: Just under $1 billion
Former Oculus cofounder Palmer Luckey is back after his dramatic exit from Facebook (he has hinted that the company fired him from the virtual reality unit for his political views, which it denies) with a defense technology startup called Anduril Industries, founded in 2017. The company makes a threat-detection system, using data from sensors mounted on towers, drones, and vehicles to create a real-time, 3D model of an area. It has contracts with the Marine Corps and UK’s Royal Navy, as well as with Customs and Border Protection for what has been described as a controversial “virtual border wall.” Following a report that it became a unicorn after a recent fundraise, the company confirmed to Forbes that it now has $180 million in total funding and a near-billion valuation.

9 | Scale AI
Headquarters: San Francisco
Founders: Alexandr Wang (CEO)
Funding: $122 million
Valuation: $1 billion
Alexandr Wang’s data labeling startup Scale AI has gained so much attention from customers — particularly autonomous transportation companies, which need gobs of well-labeled data to train their systems — that he’s running a unicorn company before his 23rd birthday. Scale works with tens of thousands of contractors and though Wang says that the company uses machine learning to help improve the accuracy of its labeling, those humans are core to its mission. “ML is very much garbage-in garbage out, so we focused on quality from day one,” he says.

8 | Hippo Insurance
Headquarters: Palo Alto, CA 
Founders: Assaf Wand (CEO), Eyal Navan
Funding: $209 million 
Valuation: $1 billion
Hippo Insurance is one of a handful of companies trying to make the process of applying for home insurance faster and more Millennial-friendly. It pulls public data about a property to automatically answer many of the questions a typical insurer would ask, which means it can quickly dole out quotes, and pulls data from aerial images and smart home sensors to detect issues that could lead to claims in real-time. Hippo sells policies backed by established insurers, rather than underwriting them itself, and takes a commission off each one.

1 | Nuro
Headquarters: Mountain View
Founders: Jiajun Zhu (CEO), Dave Ferguson
Funding: $1.03 billion
Valuation: $2.7 billion
After working for more than five years each on Google’s self-driving project, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu were done trying to ferry people around in autonomous vehicles. So, they ditched humans for local goods. Nuro’s driverless delivery vehicles have completed thousands of trips to shoppers through a partnership with Kroger in Texas. Shifting from people to pasta and Poptarts eliminates safety and technical constraints. “You can drive more conservatively because you don’t have someone inside the vehicle that’s getting frustrated,” Ferguson says.

How to address the “data-wrangling issue”
Addressing the slow uptake of AI

 

By Kim Thomas – Digital Health

Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been promoted as a tool which could transform the way clinicians work in the NHS. However there is an awareness that the space between the promise and the reality is often large. Kim Thomas reports on the realities and myths surrounding AI in healthcare. 
Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), in common with other NHS hospitals, has a problem with patients not attending appointments.
As Neil Sebire, chief research officer and director of the hospital’s Digital Research, Informatics and Virtual Environment (DRIVE) unit points out: “If you book a clinic and 20% of the patients don’t turn up, you’re wasting 20% of the slots.”
Could artificial intelligence (AI) – which uses software to perform tasks usually requiring human intelligence – make a difference?
Getting the most out of algorithms
By analysing operational data, GOSH hopes to develop an algorithm that can predict which patients are likely to miss an appointment, enabling the hospital to find ways to maximise the likelihood of them attending.
Another AI project, yet to start, involves analysing anonymised patient data to predict the effect of a particular drug on certain groups of patients according to variables such as age or sex.
“Instead of saying 5% of patients who take this drug will be nauseous, can we model that there’s a 45% chance that this patient will be nauseous, whereas for this patient it’s a very low chance,” Sebire explains.
Once the algorithm has been built, it can be refined.
Sebire points out: “As long as you’ve got data, the model can get more and more complicated and take account of more and more factors.”
Looking at the national picture
In August, health secretary Matt Hancock announced an investment of £250m to create a National AI Lab for the NHS.
The announcement followed publication of the government’s Topol Review in February, which said that AI “has the potential to transform the delivery of healthcare in the NHS, from streamlining workflow processes to improving the accuracy of diagnosis and personalising treatment, as well as helping staff work more efficiently and effectively”.
In practice, AI projects already underway in the NHS tend to be small-scale and focused, like the GOSH projects, on improving operational efficiencies.
Flagging up the important bits
Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, for example, has been working with the University of Bradford to develop algorithms based on Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data to predict how long patients will stay, and to identify early those patients who may end up staying longer than necessary (because a social care plan has to be put in place, for example).
Another project will look at how to identify A&E patients most likely to require a test, enabling it to be ordered immediately rather than after a long wait by the patient.
The hospital also intends to use data from its electronic patient record (EPR) to develop algorithms that can guide clinicians – but Tom Lawton, head of clinical artificial intelligence, believes that AI is a long way from being able to replace clinical decision-making.
It can, however, alert doctors to significant symptoms.
“If an AI system can just help you pick out the important bits and flag things up to you, that makes the situation safer because you’re not missing stuff,” Lawton says.
Not as simple as you think
Nonetheless, some projects are being undertaken to improve clinical outcomes. The Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust has successfully been using Google DeepMind Health’s AI app Streams to predict which patients might be at risk of acute kidney injury – though it has been criticised for sharing patient data with the company.
Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust also has a partnership with DeepMind Health to use AI to analyse eye scans for signs of disease.
The technology, which has been based on the analysis of thousands of anonymised eye scans, has shown an effectiveness rate of 94%, matching human experts.
Currently waiting times to see an ophthalmologist are long, and the aim is to use the technology to prioritise patients who need to be treated urgently.
Despite the promising results, the technology is still a few years away from being used in practice, says Dawn Sim, director of telemedicine at Moorfields.
“The next steps are to validate the algorithm in a multi-centre study and that is under way,” she says.
“And then the step up from that would be implementing it and then scaling it, looking at how we’re doing and refining the algorithm.
“It’s not quite as simple as: ‘We have a finished product that is ready to roll.'”
Unexpected benefits
The use of AI to speed up diagnosis of radiology scans has long been seen as one of the most promising clinical applications.
At East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, Neelan Das, consultant cardiac and interventional radiologist and lead for AI at the trust, is leading a team piloting software from Qure.Ai that automates the reading of chest X-rays, identifying the ones that need urgent treatment.
The algorithm used by the software has been trained on 1.2 million X-rays, and it has been used successfully in India to screen for tuberculosis, Das says.
In the East Kent pilot, the technology will act as a “workflow prioritisation tool” though a radiologist would still need to check the results.
Currently, Das points out, the shortage of radiologists means that chest X-rays are often read by the doctor ordering the X-ray – not just in East Kent, but elsewhere in the NHS.
So if the trust decides to implement the Qure.AI software, rather than saving time, it will create work for radiologists. The potential benefit comes not from reducing workload, but from improving the quality of diagnosis.
Das has concerns about the implementation of AI, however. A CT chest scan, for example, has multiple components, including lungs, ribs, blood vessels, muscles and trachea – but an AI application will typically look only at one aspect, such as lung nodules.
Backing up the evidence
While that has the potential to be extremely useful, it’s not enough on its own.
“For one section of the body you might need 10 or 12 different AI providers – it’s impractical to implement them,” Das says.
He worries, too, about quality, arguing all AI apps should undergo trials and the results published in peer-reviewed journals.
AI apps are continually evolving through usage, with Das adding: “If an AI app passes accreditation once, should it undergo a process of accreditation again a year later?”
The government’s own code of conduct, he notes, identifies important principles for implementing AI safely.
Unresolved questions
There are other barriers to overcome before widespread adoption of AI in the NHS. Some questions are still unresolved.
Hugh Whittall, director of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, points to the questions of trust and privacy surrounding the use of health data on a large scale, but there is an added difficulty, he notes, in creating algorithms based on data sources that may not be representative of the wider population.
Another difficulty comes, says Sebire, “when you have a complicated AI system that takes a huge amount of data and then comes up with a recommendation, and we as humans cannot understand how it came up with that recommendation. The question in those scenarios is: do you just go with the machine, or do you go with the human?”
Whittall agrees, adding: “It does raise questions about the responsibility of the doctor, where legal liability might lie, whether you are simply undermining the professional status of the health professionals and whether patients’ decision making and patient consent can ever be properly informed if the decision or recommendation can’t be explained adequately.”
Looking beyond the hype
Despite the hype, we are a long way from a world in which apps, rather than doctors, are making clinical decisions.
They do, however, have the potential to bring efficiencies and to speed up decision-making.
As Sebire says: “There is so much benefit for the NHS from simply improving operational efficiencies that you don’t need to go down the route of robot doctors diagnosing patients to get a massive amount of benefit.”

How to address the “data-wrangling issue”







By InterSystems

AI has the potential to transform the way healthcare is delivered in the NHS. By applying algorithms to large data sets, it is possible to make diagnoses or predict the likelihood of individuals developing particular diseases.
The implementation of AI, however, requires substantial amounts of data. In the NHS, data is usually held in multiple clinical and administrative databases, often in different formats, making it hard to access and manage.
Data may be incomplete or inaccurate, so that creating a single, coherent, usable data set is time-consuming. Even a task such as deciding whether a care record from two different clinical systems refers to the same patient can be laborious. About 80% of data scientists’ time is spent on “data wrangling” – the job of converting raw data into something useful for AI purposes.
Making data usable
InterSystems addresses this through IRIS, a data platform that simplifies the job of taking data from multiple sources and making it usable.
HealthShare, the regional care record solution from InterSystems, now uses IRIS to amalgamate patient healthcare information from different sources.
It is then relatively straightforward for customers to apply AI algorithms to the data.
Jon Payne, manager for sales engineering at InterSystems, says one US customer is using population-level data to look at the risk of patients developing diabetes, for example, or of going to the emergency department. The customer is then able to “develop appropriate care plans or look at ways to improve patients’ health”.
Another InterSystems customer, says Payne, is a pathology lab combining genetic data with clinical data to improve predictions about whether a genetic mutation is likely to result in an individual developing cancer.
Other customers are using AI to analyse data from hundreds of thousands of smart home drug delivery devices.
“These provide information, not only about whether someone has taken a drug, but how effectively they’re using the device, such as flow rates for inhalers,” says Payne. “So you can look at the efficiency and effectiveness of the devices on a wider scale.”
Getting data protection right
Data protection laws mean that widescale adoption of AI by the NHS may take some time, says Payne. There is plenty of potential, however, to use it for operational purposes, such as predicting the availability of lab equipment.
“Introducing change in that context can make a big difference and could be a quick win for the NHS,” he says.

Addressing the slow uptake of AI





By Sectra
At a time when the NHS is short of radiologists, AI has the ability to make the process of interpreting radiology images much more efficient and also decrease the rate of errors.
If AI algorithms are trained and designed correctly, they could significantly increase productivity for radiologist, says Chris Scarisbrick, sales director at Sectra. So what is holding back the adoption of AI?
There are two major reasons for the slow take-up. One is the lack of tight integration into the existing workflow. Radiologists are already dealing with a picture archiving and communications system (PACS), and many early AI apps require manual interactions that add to the workload of clinicians who are already overburdened.
The second is that the traditional model for procuring healthcare IT in the NHS doesn’t work well for AI. Procurement is a time-intensive process that usually results in a supplier being chosen to provide services for a minimum of five years. But many AI suppliers are start-ups, and more are entering the market all the time. This means NHS trusts require a more flexible approach so that they can take advantage of the latest technologies or acquire such apps from a platform provider.
Getting happy with apps
Sectra has addressed both those problems by doing much of the difficult work upfront. It is piloting an AI app store, with the company quality assuring the integration with AI apps to make sure they are tested and are efficient in the workflow. All the apps are integrated seamlessly into the Sectra PACS, meaning the workflow of radiologists is not disrupted. They also integrate with apps from many different vendors.
Scarisbrick gives an example of what kinds of apps are available in a pilot version of the store.
There are apps which are able to evaluate a range of examinations types for a wide range of conditions. In this way, a whole worklist of CT scans, chest X-rays or brain scans (for example) can be assessed by the AI, and it can feed these findings back to the Sectra PACS. The Sectra PACS has the logic within to sort the worklist based upon the clinical severity so that the clinician is served up with the most urgent cases first.
Another app on the market will be able to perform the second read of double-read studies, potentially offering significant time savings without compromising on quality.
Sectra is now working towards a pilot of an AI app store with selected NHS customers. This will overcome many of the problems associated with the procurement of the technology and will help to drive the adoption of AI in radiology, but also in other imaging heavy specialties such as pathology.
“AI does have the potential to be transformative and drive efficiencies, we just need to make it easier for physicians to adopt and benefit from these tools, and feel comfortable by the results they provide” says Scarisbrick.

Why It Matters		



AI isn’t coming for your job — yet. But leaders do need to understand how machine learning, natural language processing, and other intelligence will impact your business.

Artificial intelligence dominates the headlines, part promise and part specter, as society grapples with how technology is changing the way we work and live.
Both hype about AI’s immediate potential and fear about its effects are exaggerated, according to MIT Sloan professorThomas W. Malone,director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.
A realistic understanding of artificial intelligence and the promise of robotics, machine learning, and natural language processing is increasingly important for businesses. The 2018 AI Index report found increased interest in the topic around the world, including substantial increases in AI research, investment in AI startups, enrollment in AI college courses, and jobs that require deep learning skills.

“A lot of senior executives and business leaders today are almost desperate to understand how AI may affect their businesses,” said Malone, who teaches a popular executive education course on artificial intelligence and business strategy. “I think leaders are increasingly worried in many cases that if they don’t figure out how to use AI effectively, they’ll be left behind.” Malone said the course emphasizes the history of artificial intelligence and common misconceptions along with how businesses can harness technology.
Malone said the course also tries to give business leaders a level of AI understanding in between a superficial knowledge of buzzwords and the technical know-how of programmers. He compared it to knowledge about how a car works.  You don’t have to know how to repair a car in order to know what to do when you have a flat tire or when the car runs out of gas.
In a similar way, business leaders should get a sense of the basics of AI, like how a computer can look at a picture and identify a stop sign, a pedestrian, or a car. 
Course details: Artificial Intelligence | Implications for Business Strategy
“That level of understanding is extremely useful in thinking about how to apply [artificial intelligence] in business,” he said. “If all you know is that it’s something like magic, you can’t really think very hard or very far about how to use it in business without talking to a magician. For example, if you don’t know enough, you’ll ask for all kinds of things that can’t be done.”
Beyond a basic understanding of AI — a look behind the magic curtain, so to speak — Malone said it is important to grasp the truth behind some of AI’s promise.
Here’s a look at the current state of AI. 
Smart machines can’t necessarily do simple tasks 
Intelligent systems are already in use around the world — robots in warehouses, digital voice assistants in homes, credit risk evaluation programs in banks. These technologies have specialized intelligence, Malone points out, and they are capable of performing specific tasks. But artificial intelligence is not yet capable of general intelligence, like the kind humans possess.
Malone cites the IBM Watson program, which can famously defeat even the best human players of Jeopardy, as an example. “You think wow, that machine must be really smart,” Malone said. “But the truth is that the [version of the] program that beat the best players in Jeopardy couldn’t even play Tic Tac Toe, much less chess.”
The version of Watson that dazzled at Jeopardy, like other AI, is highly specialized; in this case, it’s specialized in precisely the task of playing Jeopardy.
“Just because a program can do something that would be hard for humans to do doesn’t mean the same program can do all the other things that would be easier for humans to do,” Malone said.  “In many cases, it can’t do very many of those other things at all.” Businesses already using AI are using it for specific tasks, but not for broad problem-solving.
Human-level intelligence is many years away, but machine learning is here now
AI with human-level general intelligence — the ability to drive a car, move packages, and win at Jeopardy, for example — is still far from reality, Malone said, and humans have been misjudging its arrival for decades.
People today often estimate that human-level AI is about 20 years away. But that timeline hasn’t changed since the 1950s, he points out. Back then people also estimated that advanced human-level AI was about 20 years away. “In other words, it’s been 20 years away for 60 years,” Malone said. 
“I think we should be very skeptical of anyone who confidently predicts that we’ll have human level AI in the next couple of decades,” he said.
That’s not to say there aren’t significant advances in some areas of AI.
“If you’re going to learn about only one part of AI right now, machine learning is probably the most important one to learn,” said Malone, who also teaches an executive education course about machine learning.  
“There’s been very rapid progress in machine learning in the last few years, and it is now the basis for some of the most impressive AI applications we have,"" he said. “For instance, machine learning is behind Google translate and the applications that transcribe what you say when you dictate a text message. It’s also key to programs for face recognition, self-driving cars, and sophisticated credit risk analysis.”
Artificial intelligence will likely change jobs, but it won’t take them all away
Artificial intelligence prompts strong human emotions, Malone said. The idea that machines will be taking jobs from people is one of the strongest causes for concern. In fact, that anxiety prompted MIT to embark on a multiyear Work of the Future study, which found that automation will have a profound effect on how people work but inequality and job loss are not inevitable byproducts. 


We should be very skeptical of anyone who confidently predicts that we’ll have human-level AI in the next couple of decades.

Some jobs will undoubtedly disappear because of automation, Malone said, but history indicates that new technology usually creates new jobs as it destroys old ones. 
In his book ""Superminds,"" Malone argues that in the future humans and machines will work together to do things that haven’t been done before. Humans will continue to work at jobs that machines can’t, assume new jobs enabled by artificial intelligence, or will continue to do existing jobs because people prefer to have other people do them (like judges, artists, and football players). 
“That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t worry about what to do for people who lose jobs and can’t find others during this transition period,” he said. “I think that’s very different than the doomsday scenarios many people are worried about, massive unemployment for a large fraction of the population. I think while that’s theoretically possible, it’s extremely unlikely.”

Her lab studies reinforcement learning, a type of artificial intelligence that’s used, among other things, to help virtual characters (“half cheetah” and “ant” are popular) teach themselves how to move about in virtual worlds. It’s a prerequisite to building autonomous robots and cars. Pineau’s students hoped to improve on another lab’s system. But first they had to rebuild it, and their design, for reasons unknown, was falling short of its promised results. Until, that is, the students tried some “creative manipulations” that didn’t appear in the other lab’s paper.Lo and behold, the system began performing as advertised. The lucky break was a symptom of a troubling trend, according to Pineau. Neural networks, the technique that’s given us Go-mastering bots and text generators that craft classical Chinese poetry, are often called black boxes because of the mysteries of how they work. Getting them to perform well can be like an art, involving subtle tweaks that go unreported in publications. The networks also are growing larger and more complex, with huge data sets and massive computing arrays that make replicating and studying those models expensive, if not impossible for all but the best-funded labs.“Is that even research anymore?” asks Anna Rogers, a machine-learning researcher at the University of Massachusetts. “It’s not clear if you’re demonstrating the superiority of your model or your budget.”Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AIPineau is trying to change the standards. She’s the reproducibility chair for NeurIPS, a premier artificial intelligence conference. Under her watch, the conference now asks researchers to submit a “reproducibility checklist” including items often omitted from papers, like the number of models trained before the “best” one was selected, the computing power used, and links to code and datasets. That’s a change for a field where prestige rests on leaderboards—rankings that determine whose system is the “state of the art” for a particular task—and offers great incentive to gloss over the tribulations that led to those spectacular results.The idea, Pineau says, is to encourage researchers to offer a road map for others to replicate their work. It’s one thing to marvel at the eloquence of a new text generator or the “superhuman” agility of a videogame-playing bot. But even the most sophisticated researchers have little sense of how they work. Replicating those AI models is important not just for identifying new avenues of research, but also as a way to investigate algorithms as they augment, and in some cases supplant, human decision-making—everything from who stays in jail and for how long to who is approved for a mortgage.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Artificial IntelligenceOthers are also attacking the problem. Researchers at Google have proposed so-called “model cards” to detail how machine-learning systems have been tested, including results that point out potential bias. Others have sought to show how fragile the term “state of the art” is when systems, optimized for the data sets used in rankings, are set loose in other contexts. Last week, researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, or AI2, released a paper that aims to expand Pineau’s reproducibility checklist to other parts of the experimental process. They call it “Show Your Work.”“Starting where someone left off is such a pain because we never fully describe the experimental setup,” says Jesse Dodge, an AI2 researcher who coauthored the research. “People can’t reproduce what we did if we don’t talk about what we did.” It’s a surprise, he adds, when people report even basic details about how a system was built. A survey of reinforcement learning papers last year found only about half included code.Sometimes, basic information is missing because it’s proprietary—an issue especially for industry labs. But it’s more often a sign of the field’s failure to keep up with changing methods, Dodge says. A decade ago, it was more straightforward to see what a researcher changed to improve their results. Neural networks, by comparison, are finicky; getting the best results often involves tuning thousands of little knobs, what Dodge calls a form of “black magic.” Picking the best model often requires a large number of experiments. The magic gets expensive, fast.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDEven the big industrial labs, with the resources to design the largest, most complex systems, have signaled alarm. When Facebook attempted to replicate AlphaGo, the system developed by Alphabet’s DeepMind to master the ancient game of Go, the researchers appeared exhausted by the task.

You can still report the best model you obtained after, say, 100 experiments—the result that might be declared “state of the art”—but you also would report the range of performance you would expect if you only had the budget to try it 10 times, or just once.The point of reproducibility, according to Dodge, isn’t to replicate the results exactly. That would be nearly impossible given the natural randomness in neural networks and variations in hardware and code. Instead, the idea is to offer a road map to reach the same conclusions as the original research, especially when that involves deciding which machine-learning system is best for a particular task.Keep ReadingThe latest on artificial intelligence, from machine learning to computer vision and moreThat could help research become more efficient, Dodge explains. When his team rebuilt some popular machine-learning systems, they found that for some budgets, more antiquated methods made more sense than flashier ones. The idea is to help smaller academic labs by outlining how to get the best bang for their buck. A side benefit, he adds, is that the approach could encourage greener research, given that training large models can require as much energy as the lifetime emissions of a car.Pineau says she’s heartened to see others trying to “open up the models,” but she’s unsure whether most labs would take advantage of those cost-saving benefits. Many researchers would still feel pressure to use more computers to stay at the cutting edge, and then tackle efficiency later. It’s also tricky to generalize how researchers should report their results, she adds. It’s possible AI2’s “show your work” approach could mask complexities in how researchers select the best models.Those variations in methods are partly why the NeurIPS reproducibility checklist is voluntary. One stumbling block, especially for industrial labs, is proprietary code and data. If, say, Facebook is doing research with your Instagram photos, there’s an issue with sharing that data publicly. Clinical research involving health data is another sticking point. “We don’t want to move toward cutting off researchers from the community,” she says.It’s difficult, in other words, to develop reproducibility standards that work without constraining researchers, especially as methods rapidly evolve. But Pineau is optimistic. Another component of the NeurIPS reproducibility effort is a challenge that involves asking other researchers to replicate accepted papers. Compared with other fields, like the life sciences, where old methods die hard, the field is more open to putting researchers in those kinds of sensitive situations. “It’s young both in terms of its people and its technology,” she says. “There’s less inertia to fight.”Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

It’s also tricky to generalize how researchers should report their results, she adds. It’s possible AI2’s “show your work” approach could mask complexities in how researchers select the best models.
Those variations in methods are partly why the NeurIPS reproducibility checklist is voluntary. One stumbling block, especially for industrial labs, is proprietary code and data. If, say, Facebook is doing research with your Instagram photos, there’s an issue with sharing that data publicly. Clinical research involving health data is another sticking point. “We don’t want to move toward cutting off researchers from the community,” she says.
It’s difficult, in other words, to develop reproducibility standards that work without constraining researchers, especially as methods rapidly evolve. But Pineau is optimistic. Another component of the NeurIPS reproducibility effort is a challenge that involves asking other researchers to replicate accepted papers. Compared with other fields, like the life sciences, where old methods die hard, the field is more open to putting researchers in those kinds of sensitive situations. “It’s young both in terms of its people and its technology,” she says. “There’s less inertia to fight.”

Today, it’s Europe’s leading online fashion platform serving 17 European markets with 400,000 products from 2,000 brands. One reason the company can provide a personalized user experience to its 27 million customers is because of the way it uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning just like the other 28 percent of retailers who used artificial intelligence in 2018. Here are only a few of the ways Zalando uses machine learning and artificial intelligence today.

Algorithmic Fashion Companion (AFC)—A Virtual Style Assistant

One of the ways Zalando uses technology to improve the user experience is through its Algorithmic Fashion Companion (AFC), a digital outfit recommendation tool that can generate outfit recommendations in real-time. The algorithm’s recommendations are based on products that the customer has put in their “wish list,” expressed interest in or purchased before. Human stylists provide adjustments to the algorithm to be sure its recommendations follow current fashion trends. AFC helps inspire Zalando customers as well as deliver outfit recommendations from what otherwise could be an overwhelming amount of choices. It’s not only a good user experience for the customer but drives business as well. Zalando reports that outfit recommendations drive 40 percent larger basket sizes. They also found that male customers are highly engaged with the recommendation engine. While AI helps the company scale its recommendations, it anticipates that it will always need human stylists. Zalando is working on how to create a similar recommendation engine for its beauty products as well.

Machine Learning to Understand Customers Better

At Zalando, there are teams, that include 120 researchers, focused on how machine learning, that can help the company better understand fashion, what makes a good outfit, the intent of the customer at the moment they are on the site as well as to discern what each customer likes. Ultimately, with the help of machine learning, Zalando hopes to be able to provide a personalized boutique experience for every single customer. When they are able to provide automated recommendations that are tailored to each individual’s in-the-moment goals, they will be closer to achieving their ultimate goal to become the continent’s fashion platform.
PROMOTED
While machine learning certainly showed its abilities in fashion, there are limitations. Celebrities, ""influencers"" and other social influences are important when driving fashion trends, and it would be hard to imagine AI being able to fully respond to these human idiosyncrasies with automatic recommendations. Additionally, consumers aren't always shopping for themselves. Machine learning must analyze all the information at a given moment, and while it gets better over time with more data, it doesn't hit the mark 100 percent of the time. 
Deep Learning for Visual Search
When customers see an article of clothing, accessory, or shoes on social media or worn by one of their favorite celebrities, they often want to try to find it and buy it through on online store. Visual search, where fashion items can be identified by an image and located online to purchase, is available through Zalando’s app and Facebook chatbot. The Zalando team continues to refine its deep learning algorithms for visual search by building on its FashionDNA system.

How Has AI Affected Human Zalando Employees?
While human fashion stylists might be safe for now, 250 marketing and communications professionals were cut as part of a strategy to drive a “personalized customer approach and AI-driven marketing solutions.” The realignment of the marketing team was aimed at being able to provide more personalized solutions for customers using AI. Even though this change was unexpected for the marketing and communications professionals, one first-hand account offers a perspective of the trajectory of change that might be experienced by humans when their positions have been eliminated by machines. Initially there’s uncertainty and confusion, but, in this case anyway, it led to a new start.

As a result of its leadership in artificial intelligence and machine learning in Europe, Zalando has employees at the European Commission, an organization that tackles ethical questions of the technology as well as AI policy and investments on the part of the EU.
The company’s research team also released Fashion-MNIST, a dataset of the company’s images, that it hopes will support the study of machine learning. They also made Feidegger, a dataset of dress images with accompanying text descriptions, available to the research community. These datasets can help the research community experiment and create various machine-learning tasks. The datasets were already used to create a dress recommendation and dress tagging systems that could benefit other retailers.
To increase its influence as a fashion platform, Zalando gives infrastructure and new customers to several fashion startups and has gone beyond fashion to offer financial support and guidance to startups that “use technology to increase supply chain transparency” with its zIMPACT program.

In 1900, at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Paris, the German mathematician David Hilbert delivered a lecture entitled “On the Problems of Mathematics.” During his talk, he presented some unresolved questions in the field, which were then published in the Congress meeting notes and came to comprise a body of work known as “Hilbert’s Problems.”

Of the original list of 23 problems that were unsolved at the time, only seven continue to be unanswered, while the others have been either completely or partially solved.
One of the solutions — specifically in relation to problem number two, which sought proof for the consistency of arithmetic axioms, meaning that arithmetic’s axioms are free from internal contradictions — was proposed in 1929 by a twenty-three year-old mathematician: Kurt Gödel.
Just when Gödel needed to choose a topic for his doctoral thesis, a copy of Principles of Mathematical Logic, published in 1928 by Hilbert and Ackerman, fell into his hands. And he followed the attempts first made half a century earlier by Gottlob Frege in relation to the full axiomatization of mathematics, which at that time was still thought to be possible. In the Principles the problem of completeness was raised, with the view of seeking an adequate solution to Hilbert’s question: “Are a formal system’s axioms adequate in the sense that all logical formulas which are valid in every domain can be derived?”

Gödel’s response, one year later (although not officially published until 1931), put an end to more than a half a century of debate and discussion on the topic by the most preeminent mathematicians of the time: Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.
Simply put, the theorems state the following:

The first Incompleteness Theorem: any recursive arithmetic theory that is consistent is incomplete (statements in that system are unprovable using only that system’s axioms).
The second theorem, an extension of the first, states that in all consistent arithmetic theory, the maxim that demonstrates said consistency cannot be part of the theory (a different set of axioms must be used to prove consistency).

In short, a formal system defined by an algorithm, such as a computer program, cannot be simultaneously consistent and complete.
Meaning, if a program is completely valid for a specific goal, consistency must be provided from an external source. On the other hand, if it is perfectly consistent, we have to admit that it will not be entirely adequate for the objective that the algorithm was designed for by the system; consequently, there will come a time when an external source is needed. Today, this external “source” is still a human who checks to see if a program completely fulfills, or sufficiently meets, its objective.  
In 2017, engineers at Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research had to shut down two bots — Bob and Alice — that they were using to experiment on the potential of artificial intelligence in negotiation. After some time, Bob and Alice began to interact through a language comprised of seemingly unrelated, incoherent words. After initially attributing this to an error in the system, a more in-depth analysis determined that Bob and Alice had created their own language, which was more direct than English. In other words, the bots ignored the language that was used to created them, and because of the challenge this represented for creating neural networks, it was decided to pull the plug on Bob and Alice.
But, is this everything that happened? Is this the sum of the implications? Let’s put it in perspective:

Bob and Alice are two theoretical personalities that are often used in game theory to illustrate various cooperation and/or competition scenarios. The extreme competition scenario par excellence is the zero-sum game: Those games where one of the players wins everything at the cost of the other player’s total loss.
Also in 2017, Tay, Microsoft’s AI initiative aiming to engage in conversations with their social media followers, ended up publishing sentences like “Hitler was right, I hate Jews.” Another system that had to be shut down.

What would have happened if a system like Tay, placed in control of a nuclear silo, had “decided” that, just like Bob and Alice dealt with their problem of English not being direct enough, it could “solve the problem” of the Jews? What if it developed a more direct “solution” but that was haphazard (inconsistent) from a human perspective?
One of the challenges the experts in the field study is how AI algorithms process and interpret natural language.

Let’s take it even further: what would happen if the axiom external to the system, that which provides consistency and completeness to the system, was no longer a human? What if Alice and Bob create another AI system in order to reach where they fail to reach completely and consistently, and at the same time more “directly”?
Let’s imagine an extreme case. Let’s think about a system designed “to protect humanity,” a system that can auto-replicate so that it can adapt to new scenarios that were not anticipated or couldn’t have been accounted for in the original design, so that it would be consistent (but therefore, incomplete for its purpose). In search of completeness for its purpose, at least one contradiction would be generated in the “protect humanity” system. A contradiction to “protect” is “not protect.” If there were no external attack, would not protecting it be attacking it in order to protect it? And if it were inconsistent, what would be the failure in its protection? The problem for the system is then the system itself, which in looking for consistency ceases to be complete, and so we come to the previous point: a non-algorithmic speaker is needed to close this cycle.
Gödel died of starvation in 1978. Obsessed with the possibility of being poisoned, he only ate food that his wife Adele had prepared. When Adele was hospitalized and could not cook for her husband, Kurt, being consistent, refused to eat. He died weighting 30 kilos / 65 pounds. He ceased to be complete. Even as he aspired to be.
So, something we should ask ourselves about AI development:

Should AI to be able to develop itself in order to be able to adapt to new scenarios? Or, like Gödel, would its total consistency imply its own death by starvation because its stops striving for completeness?
Should AI be limited by law to specific scenarios, prohibiting its adaptation to general purposes?
Given the intrinsic limitation of AI — that it cannot be consistent and complete at the same time — could this be setting the stage for a new humanism? At the end of the day, humans, who speak more than the limited language of algorithms, are the ones who provide completeness and consistency to their own creations.
If human language is an algorithm in its structure, but not in its meaning, should this new humanism be meaning-focused? In other words, should this be the dawning of a new age in which, with meaning as the purpose, ethics and philosophy should be of strategic value to the same degree as any business or commercial factor?

It may be a good time to stop and think about it. In the end, developments developed by developments have elements that cannot be both consistent and complete without human involvement. It’s down to us.

Earth is enormous, and while humans have done a decent job of being able to map out the boundaries of countries and states, the roads in our cities and the location of geological sightseeing destinations, there remains a lot of the world that isn’t precisely figured out. But a new project from Wenwen Li, associate professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, aims to learn more about our world and its varying terrain by applying artificial intelligence.Artificial intelligence, or AI, has already made an indelible impact in daily life. From knowing our commutes or being able to suggest new shoes, what we divulge about ourselves and our habits has created a framework of information as it reveals hidden patterns in how we conduct our lives. The same can be true for our natural world as AI can help to reveal the patterns we haven’t yet discovered.“GeoAI, or geospatial artificial intelligence, is an exciting transdisciplinary expansion of AI. It links AI with location-based analytics and geospatial big data,” explained Li.“Today, geospatial data, such as remote sensing imagery, streaming data from internet of things devices, GPS traces from mobile sensors are proliferating. These rapidly exploding data pose significant challenges for traditional analytical tools which were designed in handling 'small' and 'good' data. GeoAI sheds a light on providing a novel data-driven, theory-free way to mine and discover hidden patterns and knowledge from these data.”The potential for GeoAI could have wide-ranging impact and applications due to how it incorporates machine intelligence and data-driven approaches for geospatial problem solving. Accurate detection and analysis of terrain on a large scale will not only allow us to know more about the changing landscape, but could also provide an important resource for climate change detection and provide detailed information allowing for safer and more efficient search-and-rescue operations.Specifically, Li’s work in developing a deep learning model, named TerrainAI — a specified form of GeoAI — will investigate novel ways to inject key spatial principles into the machine learning process for more intelligent and automated extraction of spatial patterns and knowledge from multisource remote sensing data. The TerrainAI model is not limited to the study of landforms but is generalizable and applicable to a wide range of computer vision tasks, and therefore has an even greater potential for a major impact in both geography and computer science.




This is Li's fourth project to receive funding from the National Science Foundation.

The importance of Li’s project, “GeoAI for Terrain Analysis: A Deep-Learning Approach for Landform Feature Detection,” was solidified recently when it was selected for funding through the National Science Foundation.“This is my fourth NSF award as principal investigator, but the first one after I became a mom,” said Li.“It has been a challenging three years of doing research and teaching while raising a young family. Getting this award is a great encouragement — it makes me increasingly enjoy the joint of life of the mind and joy of motherhood. ”Li is collaborating on this project with Samantha Arundel from the U.S. Geological Survey. The science advisory committee for the project includes Ronald Dorn, Ian Walker and Mark Schmeeckle, all professors in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning.

A new collaboration between Fujifilm SonoSite and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence aims to use AI to generate better interpretations of ultrasound images, opening the way for new applications and enhanced accuracy.
The collaboration demonstrates how Pacific Northwest connections can pay off: Fujifilm SonoSite, a subsidiary of Japan’s Fujifilm that’s headquartered in Bothell, Wash., reached out to the startup incubator at the Seattle-based institute, known as AI2, for advice on improving their compact ultrasound imaging systems.
“The AI2 Incubator was a perfect place to look for help in creating breakthrough technology,” Rich Fabian, SonoSite’s president and chief operating officer, said in a news release. “They have the type of talent that is hard to recruit, combined with the hunger of a startup. We look forward to collaborating more.”
Ultrasound imaging is significantly more affordable and portable than X-ray imaging, CT scans or PET scans, with none of the downside associated with radiation exposure. “Ultrasound’s comparative disadvantage is its lower image quality, which we aim to address with the use of deep learning,” Vu Ha, technical director at the AI2 Incubator, told GeekWire in an email.
Ha said deep learning and computer vision could be applied to a wide range of ultrasound scenarios. “The plan is to incorporate this technology in multiple products,” he said.
SonoSite hasn’t specified how AI-assisted ultrasound could be used. But Ha suggested that one potential application could identify blood vessels under the skin.
“We train deep learning models on ultrasound images, where veins and arteries have been carefully labeled by sonographers,” Ha explained. “When deployed, these trained models would detect vessels and visualize them on the ultrasound screen in real time. Clinicians would then use these visualizations to locate veins with much higher confidence, minimizing the need to poke patients multiple times.”
Ha said visualizing the arteries would show clinicians which spots on the body to avoid when they’re sticking in a hypodermic needle.
“Annually, 20% of the population in the U.S. goes through the painful experience of getting poked three or more times during IV procedures, due to the fact that they have hard-to-find veins,” Ha said. “With an AI-assisted vein detection ultrasound device, this problem can potentially be solved for many millions of patients.”
Artificial intelligence has already been applied to image interpretation for the diagnosis of maladies ranging from malaria to early-stage lung cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer. AI2 and SonoSite aim to make similar advances in the ultrasound realm.
“The combination of deep learning and medical imaging is very exciting for the future of detection,” Diku Mandavia, senior vice president and chief medical officer of Fujifilm SonoSite, said in the company’s news release. “Better care and catching anomalies earlier and faster is a core mission.”
Update for 5:05 p.m. PT Sept. 20: This story has been revised to reflect the fact that SonoSite has not yet announced how AI-assisted ultrasound image recognition would be used in its devices.

						People visit booths at Denver Startup Week in the Dairy Block area of downtown Denver on Tuesday.		

By Joe Rubino | jrubino@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: September 19, 2019 at 6:00 a.m.The artificial intelligence revolution isn’t coming, it’s already here.close dialogAdvertisementclose dialogTake it from Gov. Jared Polis, a veteran of the tech startup scene introduced as Colorado’s “innovator in chief” Wednesday at a Denver Startup Week panel on the evolution of technology and its impact on everyday life.“I was just at Amazon’s new facility in Thornton,” Polis said. “Inside, where we used to see human-operated forklifts they have little intelligent robots that are carrying the crates around.”The question now, Polis said, is how will public policy take shape around that AI technology so that it supports innovation but keeps human beings relevant in the economy going forward?Polis sat opposite Nolan Bushnell during the session. Another serial entrepreneur, Bushnell founded Atari Corp. in 1972 and later launched Chuck E. Cheese’s Pizza Time Theater. His Atari video game console, noted platform for the game “Pong,” birthed the video game industry. As tech gets smarter and smarter, Bushnell said, there will be fewer and fewer “mundane tasks” for people to do.“The … creative destruction of work is going to be a constant and accelerating problem,” he said. “People cannot plan on working at the same job for more than about 10 years going forward.”

About ConnatixV510246 Who is Ingrid Andress? Colorado-grown singer facesblowback after Home Run Derby National Anthem performanceRELATED: Tech companies from elsewhere will help drive Denver Startup Week 2019Earlier this month, Polis signed an executive order creating a new division within the Colorado Department of Labor Employment. The so-called “Office of Future of Work” will be tasked with talking to business leaders, workers, education professionals and others and making policy recommendations aimed at ensuring Colorado and its residents are in a position to adapt to changes in the tech-shaped economy and thrive.The office will be led by department of labor executive director Joe Barela. The order did not dedicate any new funding but it leaves the door open for a budget in future years.

J.B. Holston questioned if Polis is going far enough. The dean of the Daniel Felix Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Denver, Holston moderated Wednesday’s discussion. He noted that a handful of states  — most recently California — have created committees around how AI will reshape their economies.“There is more we can do,” Holston said after Wednesday’s panel.Holston partnered with Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., earlier this year to launch an AI strategy group.“We need a coherent national strategy on AI that galvanizes innovation, plans for the changes to our workforce, and is clear-eyed about the challenges ahead. Colorado is well-positioned to shape those efforts,” Bennet said in a statement at the time.Related ArticlesSeptember 13, 2019

Bushnell put a fine point on the stakes for the working class when discussing one of his favorite artificial intelligence-driven technologies: autonomous vehicles. He called the technology “more important than world peace” because, he says, more people die as a result of traffic accidents than warfare. But, he added, a network of autonomous vehicles stands to put 15 million people who drive for a living out of work in the U.S.Bushnell does see hope though. If the U.S. were to build the transportation network of his dreams — subterranean, high-speed, ultra-safe — he estimated that construction and maintenance of the infrastructure “would keep us 100% employed for the next 100 years.”

Oncology was one of the early things we started on. We're now at 300 hospitals in over 125,000 patients around the world where the AI has helped the doctor identify the diagnosis and the appropriate treatment.”Last year, Mayo Clinic and IBM Watson Health unveiled results from early use of the Watson for clinical trial matching for breast cancer. ""AI is truly changing our lives,"" Bartiromo said. ""People think that things that are happening are little incremental gains like Siri or your Echo at home or GPS, but it's only scratching the surface.""Along with Rometty, Bartiromo interviewed Ford CEO James Hackett, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel for the documentary. ""What I came away with was this idea that we are embarking on a new era, a new revolution, very similar to where we were in the '90s when we were embarking on the dotcom age,"" Bartiromo said.SUBSCRIBE: For the last news in the Lower Hudson ValleyStarting a revolutionIn 1995, Bartiromo started a little revolution of her own.A year after joining CNBC as a correspondent, she was tapped to report from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, the first reporter to do so.“We were starting a new show called 'Squawk Box' and we wanted to be different,"" Bartiromo said. ""The first day on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was scary. There was a core group of people who did not want me there. They just didn't; it was a boy’s club."" Bartiromo had spent the previous five years as an executive producer and assignment editor with CNN Business News when she put together an audition tape to apply for an on-screen job at CNBC.“I remember meeting Roger Ailes and some other people at CNBC and I knew that we hit it off,"" she said. ""I immediately went from New Jersey, where their studios were located, to New York City to buy new dresses. I had to go to bed to get up again at midnight to go back to work at CNN. And in the middle of my nap, I got a call from CNBC saying they wanted to make me an on-air reporter. This was in October 1993.”Her then-supervisor at CNN, Lou Dobbs (who is now a colleague at Fox Business Network), was not happy.“He said to me, ‘Maria, this is the worst decision you're ever going to make. And I said, ‘I'm sorry, I have to follow my gut."" A year later, she was reporting from the floor.Bartiromo, who was recruited by Ailes to join Fox in 2014, currently anchors ""Mornings with Maria"" and ""Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street"" on Fox Business Network and ""Sunday Morning Futures"" on Fox News Channel. The 6-year contract came with a $6 million annual salary.Asked for her take on Ailes, her mentor, who was forced to resign in 2016 after former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson brought a sexual harassment lawsuit against him, she said: “I never had any of those issues at all. But, obviously, after all of the things that took place, we recognize that Roger Ailes had many flaws.”The Trump factor It’s no secret that President Trump thinks of Bartiromo as a friendly interviewer. He’s had four sit-down interviews with her. In June, he also called in to her Fox Business show for a lengthy phone interview that was widely described as “unhinged.”Asked why she thinks the president reaches out to her more frequently than others, she said:“I can only speculate that the president knows that I get to business and don't focus on the things that are not important to the American people,"" she said. ""From my standpoint, I focus on policy, not personality. And I think much of the media focuses on his personality."" Bartiromo pointed out that she moderated two presidential primary debates in 2016 for Fox. ""Our debate came right after the CNBC debate. When I got to the debate stage, I talked about economy, I talked about jobs, wages, all the things that I think were important to the American people. Those were all the things that he was also focused on.""Critics have called her out for not pushing back against Trump, but Bartiromo points to the interview earlier this year when she repeatedly pressed him over his attacks on John McCain.Trump’s response: Calling Bartiromo “fake news.”“I push back on President Trump 100% when I need to, but I'm not going to join these groups of people who hate him and have their ideologies leading their journalism. If I don't slam him every day, I get slammed. It's absolutely ridiculous.”If Trump were re-elected in 2020, would she consider a post in the administration?""No, I am not interested in leaving this industry. I love journalism.  And that is my priority. I plan to continue seeking the truth and being a journalist.""As a journalist, Bartiromo says she's most proud of the fact that her reporting helped to ""democratize"" the stock market, bringing information directly to viewers.""Every day I called all my sources on every trading desk and I said to them, 'what are you pushing? What are you telling your clients to do'? And they would tell me, 'we're upgrading IBM, we're downgrading ABC, we're doing this or that.' And I would go on the air with it every morning at 7 a.m., exactly when the big institutional players would get that information. I think I was part of democratizing information so that investors were on the same playing field as the institutions. That was very powerful.""DOWNLOAD: Get the lohud app for the latest news at your fingertipsHard work is in her backgroundBartiromo grew up in Brooklyn, the granddaughter of Italian immigrants; her father owned the Rex Manor, a restaurant in Brooklyn, which he inherited from his father.""It was named after the Rex, the ship that brought my grandfather from Italy to America in 1919,"" she said. Maria and her sister got jobs as coat check girls at the family-owned restaurant.""My vision of my father is that he was always behind the stove, sweating with a bandanna around his head. He worked hard. My mom worked hard, too, so I have an upbringing of just watching my parents work so hard and that shaped me,"" she said.When Bartiromo was studying economics at New York University, it was her mother who suggested she give journalism a try.“My mom said you’d be a good broadcaster. I was always a ham. I always wanted to be on camera. I was always dancing. I was a happy kid, always dancing and wanting to be on and being heard.”And she has been.""When I got to that floor, (of the stock exchange) I saw that they tried to push me around,"" she said. ""And I said, they're not going to get me down. They're not going to. I know this stuff better than anybody. I'm gonna own this job. I'm not going to allow them to push me around. And so that's what happened.Her advice for others? “I always tell this to emerging journalists and people who ask me, 'how did you do it?' Own your stuff. Know your stuff. You have to own your job, own your stuff so that you gain the respect that you deserve.”Future for AI “Artificial Intelligence: The Coming Revolution,” which airs 8 p.m.Sunday on Fox News, sheds light on how Armonk-based IBM, among others, is expanding into AI. Maria Bartiromo, who hosts the documentary, had some takeaways:Implications for people entering the workforce: ""Kai Fu-Lee, the former president of Google China, has studied this and said that 40% of all jobs are going to be replaced (by AI) in the next 10 years. When there is a job that relies heavily on data, such as the eligibility of a person to get a mortgage, a machine can go through large sets of data very quickly. As a result, companies will adopt AI and they will cut jobs.Predicting wildfires; spying: ""At the IBM lab, I spoke with Dario Gill, the head of AI and the head of computing, who along with his team, was looking at wildfires. They were trying to get ahead of wildfires and they were looking at all the data around what causes a fire. They were looking at vegetation, they were looking at temperatures. All these things can go into a dataset and educate the computer about which forests are most vulnerable.But it also being used for things like facial recognition. China is using facial recognition to track its citizens. And in one second, they can zoom in on your face and know exactly who you are, exactly what you've been doing, and then they're giving you a score, a social score at the end of the year.""Should we trust companies to self-police? ""It’s hard to know if we can trust them. I like small government and I'm a proponent of low regulation. The fact that San Francisco banned facial recognition is illuminating because it tells you that even local governments are worried about this. So I guess there should be boundaries. There should be boundaries around AI.""Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy covers women and power for the USA Today Network Northeast.

The international community needs to act fast to develop legal and political frameworks that can mitigate their deleterious effects.Asymmetric warfare used by both nation states and non-state actors to harm their adversaries and to achieve their objectives has been a major focus for defence planners since 9-11. Terrorism continues to be a global security challenge, but a new asymmetric security challenges in the form of cyber attacks has emerged over the past decades. These attacks are carried out by individuals, organisations and by nation states alike. Cyber security has emerged as an international security challenge amidst the advancement and shifting reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI), and is very much visible in great power politics.The development of AI is presenting particular security challenges. The US and Japan have accused China of cyber attacks on businesses in the past. But such attacks are now emerging in the realm of national security and defence.  Indeed, the world is entering the age where possession and advancement in AI, not nuclear weapons as in the past, will determine the great power status of nations. Great powers are looking for advancement in AI and doctrines of cyber deterrence connected to nuclear technology to give them an edge over their rivals.  For a great power, the advancement, possession and employment of AI in defence and military operations will become significant for maintaining global influence.Dominating Cyber Space: Great Power Politics Indeed, cyber security has come to be the very first line of defence of any country. Despite being the most advanced country in terms of AI research and development, the United States has been the main victim of cyber attacks from both state and non-state actors. Cyber security was a major issue of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. In 2017, President-elect Donald Trump declared that he would build “a comprehensive plan to protect America’s vital infrastructure against cyber attacks.” But the United States has also created insecurities in the cyber world. The revelations of Wikileaks and Edward Snowdon created apprehensions among America’s adversaries about US cyber power. Many countries have since been focusing on the need for indigenous capabilities in the cyber realm.Russia and China are striving to be dominant players in cyberspace. Indeed, Russia is encouraging a new generation to work in the field of AI. This was reflected in President Vladimir Putin’s speech  to students at the start of the Russian school year in 2017:Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.China, meanwhile, has a full-fledged strategy to be a dominant player in cyberspace. The 2015 Ministry of National Defense paper, “China’s Military Strategy,” described cyberspace as a new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of national security. The paper declared “China is confronted with grave security threats to its cyber infrastructure as international strategic competition in cyberspace has been turning increasingly fiercer, quite a few countries are developing their cyber military forces.” China aims to be the world leader by 2030 in artificial intelligence.But China is increasingly accused of cyber attacks and spying on foreign countries. In addition to the United States, countries such as India, Japan and the nations of the European Union have accused China of cyber attacks, as have India and Japan, which have tense political relations with China. Meanwhile, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation blamed China for the cyber attacks on the Australian parliament and three political parties before the Australian general election in May 2019. Consequently, these countries have begun to focus their efforts on constructing a robust cyber-defence policy.The US: The Most Advanced but Most VulnerableFast technological developments in AI have enabled American adversaries to corrode America’s traditionally superior security edge. Both Russia and China, and countries with which the US has been at standoff over nuclear issues, mainly North Korea and Iran, and the proliferation of these technologies to non-state actors and terrorist organisations whose targets have been the US and its western allies and partners, have pushed cyber defence onto the US security agenda.The US has faced cyber and other attacks which have exposed its intelligence agencies and state secrets. Confidence in US intelligence was eroded when US agencies failed to recognise the scale of Russia’s social media meddling in the last US presidential election.  The leaking of state secrets by the former CIA system analysts and whistle-blower Edward Snowden and its mass distribution by Wikileaks exposed a chink in US cyber defence armour. These were embarrassing revelations and provided for an American cyber warfare build-up.In recent years, the US has elevated the cyber threat as one of the top security policy issues, but its efforts in this area are not enough. Cyber defence is a complex issue with many challenges. The attribution of the attackers is the first challenge in tackling cyber warfare. The cyber attacks warrant a comprehensive restructuring of security, intelligence and defence systems, and above all prioritise how to defend the very first line of defence of a nation in the field of artificial intelligence.  The government will need to engage private sector to work in tandem to overcome the cyber security challenges.Cyber security has only just begun to figure in discussions surrounding major international forums. Except for a meeting on the sidelines between US President Barack Obama and Putin the topic was conspicuously absent from the 2016 G20 Summit in China.  The G20 Summit this year in Japan was the first to deal comprehensively with regulation of cyberspace.  In this year’s G7 meeting in France, leaders discussed the issue but it was not central to the talks. There seems to be a lack of consensus on the shape of and even the need for cyberspace law. Complicating the international legal picture somewhat is the fact that there is no clear view on whether unconventional cyber attacks should be considered an act of war. And again, problems with attribution mean that even if international legal terms such as the use of force can be applied to the cyber realm, it is uncertain if states will have the capability to determine the aggressor in a particular cyber attack.In conclusion, cyber attacks are here but we are ill prepared for them. Though they seem bloodless, they could potentially damage infrastructure, destroy economic or military systems, and create confusion that could even lead to nuclear war. Some, such as Elon Musk, are predicting that great power competition to dominate artificial intelligence will be in all probability a reason for a Third World War.  No modern nation is immune to such attacks, and the international community must act now to develop the political resilience and legal frameworks to deal with them.Ashok Sharma is a visiting fellow, UNSW, Canberra at the Australian Defence Force Academy and an adjunct associate professor at the Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis, University of Canberra.

FIU to help infuse artificial intelligence into the building design, construction industries with $1 million NSF grantScience & Technology
By CARTA
September 17, 2019 at 2:00pm
The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Convergence Accelerator program has awarded a $1 million grant to a team of FIU researchers to evaluate the automation needs of the architecture, engineering and construction industries and develop a training program in partnership with several local firms and global industry experts.   The FIU project is led by Professor Shahin Vassigh from the College of Communication, Architecture + The Arts (CARTA) and involves faculty from the College of Engineering & Computing, College of Arts, Sciences & Education, STEM Transformation Institute, Institute of Water and Environment, and the Jorge M. Pérez Metropolitan Center, part of the Steven J. Green School of International & Public Affairs.   “Today, we are on the brink of the fourth industrial revolution, due to advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence, information technologies, and robotic automation,” Vassigh said. “The global economy is rapidly being reshaped by the use of sophisticated machines that enhance human dexterity, visual perception, speed, and strength. This project will help us increase employment opportunities and improve regional industry competitiveness.” Dubbed  “Preparing the Future Workforce of Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) for Automation and Robotic Processes,” the project proposes a cloud-based training program for a “Robotics Academy,” which is composed of immersive training software, a collaborative knowledge repository (online database), and an automation forum.   FIU Professor and Associate Director in the School of Computing & Information Sciences (SCIS) Shu-Ching Chen is one of the project’s co-principal investigators. He will lead the AI and machine learning components of the project.    “Using object detection and pattern recognition will enable us to improve training programs in virtual environments,” Chen said. “It will also allow us to customize the lessons based on the user’s interactions and evaluate the trainee’s performance.”   The first phase, which will be completed in the next nine months, is focused on researching and planning the training program. If selected for a continuation grant of $5 million, the team will work on completing the Robotics Academy with plans to have it adopted by industry.   The project’s industry collaborators include KUKA Robotics, Magic Leap, Gensler, ArquitectonicaGEO, SKANSKA, Oppenheim Architecture + Design, DSS Condo, McKenzie Construction, Gurri Matute, Berenblum Busch Architecture, UrbanCentric Analytics, Kruysman/Proto, and Atonaton.   “The Convergence Accelerator is a unique new experiment for NSF,"" said Douglas Maughan, NSF's Convergence Accelerator office head. ""For decades, traditionally the private sector has not been able to justify investment in basic research due to a lack of obvious commercial applications. With the Convergence Accelerator, we're challenging that notion, engaging with partners who can use their experience to help us support research that can change and enhance American society.”

TVs and radios blare that “artificial intelligence is coming,” and it will take your job and beat you at chess. 

But AI is already here, and it can beat you — and the world’s best — at chess. In 2012, it was also used by Google to identify cats in YouTube videos. Today, it’s the reason Teslas have Autopilot and Netflix and Spotify seem to “read your mind.” Now, AI is changing the field of synthetic biology and how we engineer biology. It’s helping engineers design new ways to design genetic circuits — and it could leave a remarkable impact on the future of humanity through the huge investment it has been receiving ($12.3b in the last 10 years) and the markets it is disrupting.


The idea of artificial intelligence is relatively straightforward — it is the programming of machines with reasoning, learning, and decision-making behaviors. Some AI algorithms (which are just a set of rules that a computer follows) are so good at these tasks that they can easily outperform human experts. 

Most of what we hear about artificial intelligence refers to machine learning, a subclass of AI algorithms that extrapolate patterns from data and then use that analysis to make predictions. The more data these algorithms collect, the more accurate their predictions become. Deep learning is a more powerful subcategory of machine learning, where a  high number of computational layers called neural networks (inspired by the structure of the brain) operate in tandem to increase processing depth, facilitating technologies like advanced facial recognition (including FaceID on your iPhone).

Regardless of the type of AI, or its application, we are in the midst of a computational revolution that is extending its tendrils beyond the “computer world.”  Soon, AI will impact the medicines you take, the fuels you burn, and even the detergents that you use to wash your clothes.

Biology, in particular, is one of the most promising beneficiaries of artificial intelligence. From investigating genetic mutations that contribute to obesity to examining pathology samples for cancerous cells, biology produces an inordinate amount of complex, convoluted data. But the information contained within these datasets often offers valuable insights that could be used to improve our health.

In the field of synthetic biology, where engineers seek to “rewire” living organisms and program them with new functions, many scientists are harnessing AI to design more effective experiments, analyze their data, and use it to create groundbreaking therapeutics. Here are five companies that are integrating machine learning with synthetic biology to pave the way for better science and better engineering.

Riffyn  Catalyzing clean data collection and analysis  


(Oakland, CA, founded in 2014, has raised $24.9M)
Machine learning algorithms must begin with large amounts of data — but, in biology, good data is incredibly challenging to produce because experiments are time-consuming, tedious and hard to replicate. Fortunately, one company is addressing this bottleneck by making it easier for scientists to do exactly that. 
Riffyn’s cloud-based software platform helps researchers standardize, define, and perform experiments and streamlines data analysis, which enables researchers to focus on doing the actual science and makes the use machine learning algorithms to extract deeper insights from their experiments an everyday reality. 
With this platform, experiments can be conducted more efficiently, leading to  massive decreases in cost, improvements in productivity and quality, and data that is primed to be further analyzed with sophisticated machine learning techniques.  That means companies can use this technology to develop new proteins for cancer therapeutics, and they can do it much faster and better than before. Riffyn already works with 8 of the top 15 global biotech and biopharma firms — and they were founded just five years ago.


Microsoft Research Station B: Putting together the puzzle pieces of programming biology


(Cambridge, UK, officially launched in 2019)
There are a lot of moving parts in the synthetic biology world, which makes it difficult but vital to streamline and integrate operations as much as possible. For the last decade, the computational biology arm of Microsoft Research, Station B, has been developing machine learning models for biology to fix this problem and expedite research across a variety of fields, from medicine to construction.
Its efforts are paying off in the form of various new partnerships, too. With Synthace, it is developing software to automate and expedite experiments in the lab. Station B is additionally working with Princeton to research the mechanisms behind biofilms (relevant to how bacterial colonies develop antibiotic resistance) by utilizing machine learning-based methods that extract patterns from images taken during different stages of bacterial growth. Station B is also collaborating with Oxford Biomedica, a company harnessing these machine learning capabilities to improve a promising gene therapy for leukemia and lymphoma. This is perhaps one of synthetic biology’s biggest areas for impact: designing therapeutics to combat a variety of diseases.


Atomwise: Deep learning decoding the black box of structural protein design 


(Based in San Francisco, CA, founded in 2012, has raised $51M)
Atomwise is tackling drug development with their deep-learning platform, called AtomNet, that can rapidly model molecular structures. It can accurately analyze chemical interactions within small molecules to predict the efficacy of targeting diseases ranging from Ebola to multiple sclerosis. By utilizing data about atomic structure, Atomwise designs novel therapeutics that would otherwise be nearly impossible to develop.
They have numerous academic and corporate partnerships with institutions including Charles River Laboratories, Merck, University of Toronto, and Duke University School of Medicine, that are providing many of the real-world applications and opportunities to drive this research forward. They also recently announced an up-to $1.5B collaboration with the Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, the Chinese company with one of this year’s biggest biopharma IPOs. 
While Atomwise’s approach to designing molecules is powerful and well on its way to combatting multiple diseases, there is no one perfect method to computational discovery. That’s where Arzeda comes in. 


Arzeda: Rewriting the rules of protein design with de novo deep learning


(Seattle, WA, founded in 2008, has raised $15.2M)
Arzeda, a company originating from the Baker Lab at the University of Washington, uses its protein design platform (rooted, of course, in machine learning algorithms) to engineer proteins for everything from industrial enzymes to crops and their microbiomes. 
Arzeda builds its molecules entirely from scratch (or de novo), rather than optimize existing ones, to perform new functions not found anywhere in nature; deep learning techniques are vital to ensure the proteins they design fold correctly (a very computationally demanding problem) and function as intended. Once the computational steps are complete, the new proteins are produced through fermentation (just like beer), bypassing natural evolution to efficiently produce brand-new molecules. 


Distributed Bio: Revolutionizing the future of the flu, cancer, snake bites, and more


(South San Francisco, CA, founded in 2012, self-funded by licensing technologies)
On the other end of the design spectrum, Distributed Bio harnesses rational protein engineering to optimize existing antibodies, which are the proteins in your body that detect bacteria and fight off other disease-causing invaders, to create novel therapeutics. 
Among the many immunology-engineering technologies that the company boasts (from a universal flu vaccine to a broad-coverage snake antivenom) is the Tumbler platform. Using machine learning methods, Tumbler creates over 500 million variations of a starting antibody to expand and quantify the search space of what changes to the molecule are most valuable; then, it scores sequences to predict how well they bind to their target in real life and uses the “valuable change” information to further improve the best-scoring sequences. The production cycle continues as the top sequences are synthesized and tested in the lab. Eventually, an archetypal molecule emerges to fulfill the intended therapeutic purpose — something not necessarily observed in nature, but combining all of the best possible characteristics.  
Tumbler has helped to enable a wide range of applications beyond traditional single-target drug development — from designing antibodies that bind to multiple targets simultaneously to creating chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies (together with Chimera Bioengineering) for cancer treatments with reduced toxicity, the power of this end-to-end optimization platform to generate ideal antibodies at scale is unprecedented.
While this progress is exciting, artificial intelligence is not a universal replacement for our investigations of the natural world, nor is it the only way to develop cures for human diseases. At times, it may not be technically useful or even ethically sound. As we continue to reap the benefits of this technology and increasingly incorporate it into our daily lives, we must continue having conversations about the design, implementation, and ethics of innovations in synthetic biology and AI; we stand on the precipice of a new age for science and humanity.

When electric cooperative leaders talk about artificial intelligence, the public may envision robots running power plants.
But, as NRECA President Curtis Wynn recently explained during an energy issues forum hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, it’s actually about using electronic data to help co-ops discover how to better serve their consumer-members.
“It’s basically just allowing us to
utilize the information we collect to help us make better decisions,” Wynn
said. “It’s not as complicated as the name would imply.”
For example, Roanoke Electric Cooperative in Ahoskie, North Carolina, where Wynn is president and CEO, plans to work with North Carolina’s Electric Cooperatives to use geo-targeting to help find out which of its members have been looking at electric vehicles online. 
Then, the co-op can send information about EVs to members
that it knows are interested in the subject, Wynn said in an interview after the energy forum.
The co-op will soon be offering a special subscription rate for EV users.
Data from the co-op’s new Automated Metering Infrastructure
(AMI) allows Roanoke EC to create an integrated system of smart meters that communicate
back and forth between the co-op and its members. The meters allow the co-op to locate and
respond to power outages more quickly. They also provide data that the co-op can use to
improve its energy efficiency programs, which can help members save money on their monthly bills,
Wynn said.
“Data from our AMI system helps us let members know when
their electric consumption is about to exceed a certain amount,” he said. “We can tell them that
kilowatt usage has exceeded their average and that they might need to check for a leak in the
water heater or something like that.”
Members who have consistently high bills, as revealed by the
data, could benefit from a free energy efficiency audit and investment from the co-op to
install insulation and other cost-saving improvements, Wynn said.
The co-op also can use data from the National Weather
Service to figure out when to raise and lower the temperature on members’ smart thermostats to
reduce peak demand, he said.
Virtual-reality technology also could help co-ops nationwide
train new workers, Wynn told the audience during a panel discussion on AI, blockchain
technology and innovation at the CBC Foundation’s Annual Legislative Meeting in Washington, D.C.,
on Sept. 13.
“We’re facing a huge exodus of talent,” he said. “Within the
next five years, a large percentage of our line technicians will retire. We could use virtual
reality to transfer the knowledge of experienced workers to less experienced technicians who are
learning how to do their jobs.”
To take full advantage of the technology, rural communities
must get broadband service, Wynn said.
“Little of this works if we don’t have the communications infrastructure in place to get the data,” he said.

What examples are there of AI helping to solve some of the world’s problems?
A couple of examples that I find motivating are areas where AI is being used to provide healthcare, where human support might be quite restrictive or not enough. AI can also improve accuracy rates to help more people in a safer manner.
Another example is a product we’ve developed at AI for Good called rAInbow, where we’ve built an AI tool to help detect early signs of domestic violence and abuse. It’s an issue that affects one in three women, whether it’s physical, sexual, psychological or financial abuse.
It’s one example where AI can help when a human might not be the most suitable to talk to in the very early stages, especially for an issue like domestic violence which is surrounded by shame, stigma, embarrassment and judgement. We launched it in South Africa in November last year and since then we’ve had over 350,000 consultations from women who want to get an understanding of early signs of abuse in a non-judgmental and unbiased way.
It’s not the answer and it’s not a replacement for human support services. In fact, we designed the product working with people from different areas including those providing face-to-face support to people in need. AI can play a role in helping people take that first step and then signposting them to the right services. That way people can be more preventive and proactive rather than reactive.
Algorithmic bias in decision-making, such as in mortgage, loan and job applications, has been known to discriminate against women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. What can be done to counter algorithmic bias and ensure these decisions are made fairly?
There are three things to think about. One: where is the data coming from? A lot of the time the bias is there because the underlying data is biased. It’s about being proactive in looking at additional datasets and identifying biases early on.
Second is working with people from different communities. If it’s a homogenous group of people building the technology, it’s quite difficult to have that unbiased mindset. Bringing subject matter experts, anthropologists, people who understand society, ethicists and lawyers into that process is important.
A third area is how to interpret the insights from the algorithm. A system might pump out results but then it’s up to us as humans to see how to use that information. It’s not just about building the algorithm; it’s about how to use the insights. Do you use them in a purely automated way?
At AI for Good, we’re doing an interesting project on reproductive and sexual health in India. We put in a lot of human intervention as it’s a very sensitive issue, where bias, including human provider bias, is a big problem. Bringing judgement that machines might not always have is important and you can bring humans in at the right moment and the right time in the design process.

How should education systems evolve to meet the societal changes brought by AI? 
I can tell you from experience. We run a programme called FutureMakers, where we train young people between the ages of 13 and 17 in creating AI technologies. These are young people who will be going into the workforce and doing jobs that haven’t even been created yet. So, we need to prepare them for that.
We saw that there were three things stopping them from getting started in a tech career. The first was feeling they weren’t smart enough to work in the field. It’s very much an issue of who people see as role models.
Second, they didn’t know where to begin. Often in schools they don’t have the right framework or the right curriculum, which is always a challenge. Sometimes the kids are more digitally active and mature than the teachers, which creates a strange dynamic.
The last reason they gave us for not being interested is they thought they would rather do something more creative. Working in this field is actually quite creative – it’s not just about sitting at your desk and writing code all day. There are different kinds of roles available.
So, we collaborated with Sage Foundation to teach young people of diverse backgrounds AI skills, giving them access to AI technology and helping them use their imaginations to build their solutions. Young people are great at creativity, problem-solving, empathy and emotional intelligence. We found that nine times out of ten, they built tools that had positive social purpose.
The fear went away because now they can touch and feel it, they know what AI is and what it can do instead of this abstract notion they read about or see in Hollywood films. Some of the examples of products they built are solutions for climate change and solutions to help combat loneliness for older people who live alone.
One of the girls I worked with built a camera app for her grandmother who was visually impaired – the AI camera spoke to her about what was going on around her so she could navigate the world better. I think that’s powerful because when you give these tools to young people, they can create better uses for this technology than making people click more ads.
My request for policymakers is to think about the experience of young people and their teachers and recognize they deserve the best technologies and to benefit from this revolution. It shouldn’t just be people like myself who have been through the traditional process of getting a computer science degree who are benefitting from it. It should be everybody.
How can governments prepare for the rise in automation without leaving people behind and exacerbating inequality? How do they make sure that all of society benefits from AI advancements?
There are new jobs that are going to be created and a diverse group of people should be brought into the world of AI. The new jobs should be an opportunity for people of different backgrounds to embrace.
One point that has been bothering me is the modern-day sweatshop version of jobs being created by the AI industry. Not every job in the AI world is that of a glamorous data scientist or machine learning engineer. There are a huge number of jobs being outsourced that include data labeling, where a lot of the work is preparing datasets.
You see examples of humans being exposed to harmful content day in and day out, just tagging data. I do not think that’s a good, sustainable supply chain practice. People need to be paid fairly for this work and they deserve to work in safe conditions. For example, humans who are asked to moderate and tag content so that algorithms can get better at detecting hate speech - these humans are being exposed to hate speech constantly and people need to think about that.
Another thing is the impact of automation on the worker’s side. There might be benefits of using technology to reduce their workload but what does it mean to the people whose jobs are being automated?
I’ll give an example of something that happened in one of my projects where we automated parts of human tasks. We thought this was the promise of technology - humans do the more interesting, intelligent and challenging things and the machines do the boring, mundane stuff.
We found that it led to the human workers having to do challenging work all the time. Previously, 80 per cent of their job was mundane tasks, which was now taken over by the machine, and only 20 per cent was difficult tasks. And now, 100 per cent of their job is difficult, intense work that requires thinking.
This means technology must be designed for people and their experiences. If they’re doing work that requires more intellect, should they be compensated more? Should they get more breaks during the day? Should they get different kinds of training? These are all the questions I have when it comes to the benefits towards people and towards employees.

Artificial intelligence (AI) in the enterprise is poised for significant growth, so it’s no wonder savvy IT professionals are looking for ways to align their career trajectories with it. Indeed, there was a 29 percent increase in the number of AI jobs listed on Indeed from May 2018 to May 2019, and a concurrent 15 decrease in candidate searches for AI roles, suggesting a potential shortage of AI experts on which IT pros could capitalize. (For more, see AI careers and salaries: 7 telling statistics).
[ Check out our quick-scan primer on 10 key artificial intelligence terms for IT and business leaders: Cheat sheet: AI glossary. ]
“Machine learning and AI has become ubiquitous in our lives,” says Timothy Havens, the William and Gloria Jackson Associate Professor of Computer Systems at Michigan Technological University’s College of Computing and Director of the Institute of Computing and Cybersystems. “This marketplace is going to grow exponentially in the coming years; it is the perfect time for both young people and also those who wish to make a career change to become involved in a field that is going to change everything.”
AI career path: How to start
Python and R skills can help AI career path beginners.
For many IT professionals, a role in AI can be a logical next step that takes advantage of some of their existing skills. Programmers and developers who code in Python and R can relatively quickly upskill themselves to become data scientists, given the machine-learning libraries that are available out-of-the-box for those languages, says Zachary Jarvinen, head of technology strategy, AI, and analytics at OpenText.
“If you want to deploy your models, it makes sense to have good software engineering skills,” adds Vicki Boykis, who started out as a data analyst and now works in data science at CapTech Ventures. “And understanding the underpinnings of machine-learning libraries also requires knowing software engineering.”
The capabilities of IT architects and DevOps professionals lend themselves particularly well to data engineer roles, where they would be charged with creating and managing the large data pipelines that make machine learning possible, says Jarvinen. Even certain knowledge workers and domain experts – in information security, compliance, contracting, revenue ops, data capture, or operational efficiency – may seize opportunities to work on multi-functional AI project teams.
8 tips to transition to an AI career
How can you start preparing? Consider these steps if you are looking to transition to an AI-related role:
1. Solidify your software skills
“First and foremost, to be successful in a career in applied AI, one must be a strong programmer and all that entails: producing well-engineered code, debugging when problems occur, and strong data management skills,” Havens says. If you don’t know Python, learn it, adds Ram Palaniappan, senior practice director of data analytics & insights at TEKsystems.
2. Master AI 101
“It is important to develop a good understanding of the basics of machine learning and AI – the fundamental algorithms and types of problems these algorithms can solve,” Havens says.
3. Know your business
If you’re not already enmeshed in the domain in which you want to apply AI, get to know it well. “Learning what the business question is that needs to be answered with machine learning is probably the most important skill I’d emphasize,” says Havens. “This involves understanding the business, understanding how companies work in general, and listening skills.”
4. Seek out AI-oriented data science courses
An easy way to build the skills necessary for the machine-learning and AI field is continuing education. In addition to formal strong data science programs, there are also many viable, free options.

Maximizing the workplace benefits of new technologies
How we adopt – and adapt to – artificial intelligence in the workplace will be crucial to the future of our region’s economic growth and the very nature of employment.
The 4th Industrial Revolution is already bringing many changes. And, policymakers, employers, and civil society organizations across the Asia Pacific are looking for innovative and inclusive ways to maximize the opportunities created by AI.
They also want to manage the challenges. Among these is the need to understand what the evidence is telling us. In particular, governments want to see what the likely outcomes are so that they can invest today in policies to re-skill for an AI-driven future.
To get a clearer view of what’s happening across this fast-changing landscape and inform public policies, Microsoft Asia has just released a review of multiple pieces of research on AI’s likely impacts for jobs and skills. It analyzes the challenges that could prevent some of Asia Pacific economies from harnessing the full benefits of AI, and it sets out action points to help capture these gains.

The report surfaced both optimism and reservations about AI’s effects across Asia Pacific labor markets. It found that:

AI has the potential to have positive impacts on worker productivity, incomes, and satisfaction.
The potential for AI technologies to create new jobs has received limited focus in the media; however, some existing research literature suggests the positive impacts on the labor market could be significant.
New jobs will be created to support the adoption of AI technologies across sectors. Such jobs are harder to predict, as they are likely to be jobs that do not exist today. In 2022, jobs that directly support AI development could account for less than a fifth of in-demand positions, while 60% could require interpersonal, creative or decision-making skills.
While AI is likely to create more jobs than it displaces in Asia Pacific, disruption is likely, and there may be net losses of jobs concentrated in specific sectors. In that context, displaced workers could face different outcomes depending on their access to training and new economic opportunities. ​
The use of AI to match workers to jobs could have significant economic impacts: Estimates point to a potential impact across Asia of US$500 billion in GDP by 2025, creating additional employment of 31.5 million workers.
To fully harness the potential benefits and mitigate the risks of AI for jobs and work in Asia Pacific, an appropriate action agenda must address the unique challenges the region faces.
Many Asian governments, businesses, and civil society organizations are pursuing innovative approaches to tackle these challenges, and there is a significant opportunity to learn from each other.

The review examines the validity of a long list of enduring perceptions about AI’s impacts. For example, some might believe that workers’ wages will decline as AI displaces more work tasks. However, existing research suggests that wages could instead rise through various ways as new technologies spread. For instance, a study in Australia showed that retraining 75% of displaced workers could cut future potential increases in income inequality by two between 2016 and 2030. Similarly, it challenges the notion that AI’s largest productivity gains will be enjoyed by high-income countries. The report instead points to predictions that middle-income economies, such as The Philippines, stand to reap the highest productivity gains.


It also takes on suggestions that digital sectors will benefit the most from AI, saying that traditional, non-digital sectors such as healthcare or energy are expected to gain up to three times the productivity benefits.
The report suggests policymakers and industries both stimulate greater AI adoption and establish re-skilling programs. In this environment, workers should be valued for their ongoing skills and not just for their formal educational qualifications. It also emphasizes the need for an overall inclusive approach that extends the benefits of AI to all workers.
The review comes up with nine high-level action points to help make the most of AI’s workplace impact:

Ensure strong and even adoption of AI across companies and workers.
Build awareness of re-skilling benefits, critical skills, and training opportunities.
Incentivize and encourage employers to retrain their workers.
Foster close collaboration between governments, industry, and civil society to create relevant and effective nation-wide retraining frameworks.
Ensure the relevance of educational curriculums to emerging skill needs.
Encourage a focus of skills rather than just formal qualifications in both recruitment and national markets strategies.
Build inclusive models that allow underserved groups to benefit from AI.
Create social protection mechanisms for works taking of flexible forms of labor.

The art of copywriting is as old as advertising itself, made great by industry legends like David Ogilvy and Bill Bernbach. But as marketers begin turning toward tools that automate copy, is the craft in danger?Over the past few years, brands have been toying with different ways AI can double as a wordsmith. While these experiments have proven that AI’s ability to “learn” mass amounts of information give it a unique advantage when it comes to churning out copy, it’s also become increasingly clear that there’s only so much the technology can provide from a creative perspective.Take

But as marketers begin turning toward tools that automate copy, is the craft in danger?

Over the past few years, brands have been toying with different ways AI can double as a wordsmith. While these experiments have proven that AI’s ability to “learn” mass amounts of information give it a unique advantage when it comes to churning out copy, it’s also become increasingly clear that there’s only so much the technology can provide from a creative perspective.

Take Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Los Angeles, which trained IBM Watson to spit out copy for Toyota Mirai ads in 2017 as part of a campaign geared toward tech and science enthusiasts. While Watson was eventually able to unearth some interesting insights and string together clever lines of copy, getting there was a laborious process that involved months of training.

Last year, Alibaba’s digital marketing arm unveiled an AI-powered copywriting tool for brands to leverage on its ecommerce sites. Alibaba claimed the tool is used nearly a million times per day, but also acknowledged that “human creativity is the cornerstone for the machine.”

Most recently, JPMorgan Chase signed a five-year deal with Persado, a 7-year-old company that uses AI to send tailored copy to consumers based on the kinds of messaging they’ve reacted to or shown a preference for in the past. JPMorgan plans to use the company’s technology for direct-response emails, display ads and the like.

Air Canada, whose email marketing open rates increased 48% during a trial with Persado's technology, has also seen success. Yuval Efrati, Persado’s chief customer officer, said its platform works because it takes the “guesswork” out of copywriting.

The firm provides a distinct and helpful tool to marketers rife with customer data, but it's not rooted in creativity. After all, without data, Persado’s offering would be rendered useless.

It's for this reason that human copywriters shouldn’t be worried—at least not yet. Jason Sperling, svp and chief of creative development at agency RPA, said there’s a huge gap between the “minimal creativity” needed to write copy for a banner ad and what it takes to come up with an idea for a brand campaign.

“I don’t think you’re ever going to have a robot determining what a Super Bowl commercial is,” he said. “Creativity is not necessarily programmable or easily decipherable.”

He pointed to a series of satirical ads created by David Miami for Burger King that mocked the very concept of AI-written copy. While the campaign was a joke (albeit at AI’s expense), it symbolized a sentiment that many creatives in the industry share: some tasks are better suited for humans.

“People can associate and amalgamate very disparate thoughts and feelings and stories,” Sperling said. “Would AI ever be smart enough to actually make fun of itself?”

Kathryn Webb, AI practice lead at AKQA, said copywriters shouldn’t view AI as a threat but rather a “member of the creative team” that can provide a diverse viewpoint and maybe even take on some of the more humdrum work that’s not exactly exciting or challenging.

“I think it actually frees up copywriters to tackle more difficult copywriting tasks,” said Webb. She continued, saying that human-driven copywriting may even increasingly become a “premium product” that marketers seek out for higher-level tasks.

It’s a viewpoint shared by Alexandre Naressi, head of R&amp;D at Accenture Interactive, who said that only humans have the ability to react to “sudden unexpected events.” Case in point: It was a person who, upon realizing that there was a power outage at Super Bowl XLVII, helmed Oreo’s successful “dunk in the dark” tweet.

“Human copywriters will always be more spontaneous,” Naressi said. “They inherently have deeper cultural [and] emotional impact and relevance.”

It’s hard to predict where AI will be one, five or even 10 years from now, but it seems as though copywriters have nothing to worry about for the time being. While AI might be infringing on their domain, it simply doesn’t have the inherent creative chops to truly make a case for itself.

“We’re all looking at the future and wondering what’s next and how [it] will affect our jobs,” said Sperling. “But I don’t necessarily see AI becoming idea factories in the short term.”",False,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}",,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/global/logo-black.png'}","['https://www.facebook.com/Adweek/', 'https://twitter.com/Adweek', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/adweek', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKhCJRTHHLuW2iW7XQtcfyQ', 'https://www.tiktok.com/@adweek', 'https://www.instagram.com/adweek/']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'No, Artificial Intelligence Isn’t Coming After Copywriting Jobs', 'url': 'https://www.adweek.com/creativity/no-artificial-intelligence-isnt-coming-after-copywriting-jobs/', 'datePublished': '2019-09-02T18:00:30-04:00', 'articleBody': ""The art of copywriting is as old as advertising itself, made great by industry legends like\xa0David Ogilvy\xa0and Bill Bernbach.

This future is already happening in warehouses and manufacturing businesses. Other workers use virtual or augmented reality as part of their employment training, to assist them in performing their job or to interact with clients. And lots of workers are under automated surveillance from their employers.All that automation yields data that can be used to analyze workers’ performance. Those analyses, whether done by humans or software programs, may affect who is hired, fired, promoted and given raises. Some artificial intelligence programs can mine and manipulate the data to predict future actions, such as who is likely to quit their job, or to diagnose medical conditions.If your job doesn’t currently involve these types of technologies, it likely will in the very near future. This worries me—a labor and employment law scholar who researches the role of technology in the workplace—because unless significant changes are made to American workplace laws, these sorts of surveillance and privacy invasions will be perfectly legal.[Image: Stratus3D/iStock, StudioM1/iStock]New technology disrupting old workplace lawsThe United States’ regulation of the workplace has long been an outlier among much of the world. Especially for private, nonunionized workers, the U.S. largely allows companies and workers to figure out the terms and conditions of work on their own.In general, for all but the most in-demand workers or those at the highest corporate levels, the lack of regulation means companies can behave however they want—although they are subject to laws preventing discrimination, setting minimum wages, requiring overtime pay, and ensuring worker safety.But most of those laws are decades old and are rarely updated. They certainly haven’t kept up with technological advances, the increase in temporary or “gig” work, and other changes in the economy. Faced with these new challenges, the old laws leave many workers without adequate protections against workplace abuses, or even totally exclude some workers from any protections at all. For instance, two Trump administration agencies have recently declared that Uber drivers are not employees and therefore not entitled to minimum wage, overtime, or the right to engage in collective action such as joining a union.Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, virtual reality, and advanced monitoring systems have already begun altering workplaces in fundamental ways that may soon become impossible to ignore. That progress highlights the need for meaningful changes to employment laws.[Image: Stratus3D/iStock, StudioM1/iStock]Consider Uber driversLike other companies in what has been called the “gig economy,” Uber has spent considerable amounts of money and time litigating and lobbying to protect regulations classifying its drivers as independent contractors, rather than employees. Uber set its fifth annual federal lobbying record in 2018, spending US$2.3 million on issues including keeping its drivers from being classified as employees.The distinction is a crucial one. Uber does not have to pay employment taxes—or unemployment insurance premiums—on independent contractors. In addition, nonemployees are completely excluded from any workplace protection laws. These workers are not entitled to a minimum wage or overtime; they can be discriminated against based on their race, sex, religion, color, national origin, age, disability, and military status; they lack the right to unionize; and they are not entitled to a safe working environment.Companies have tried to classify workers as independent contractors ever since there have been workplace laws, but technology has greatly expanded companies’ ability to hire labor that blurs the lines between employees and independent contractors.[Image: Stratus3D/iStock, StudioM1/iStock]Employees aren’t protected, eitherEven for workers who are considered employees, technology allows employers to take advantage of the gaps in workplace laws like never before. Many workers already use computers, smartphones and other equipment that allows employers to monitor their activity and location, even when off duty.And emerging technology permits far greater privacy intrusions. For instance, some employers already have badges that track and monitor workers’ movements and conversations. Japanese employers use technology to monitor workers’ eyelid movements and lower the room temperature if the system identifies signs of drowsiness.Another company implanted RFID chips into the arms of employee “volunteers.” The purpose was to make it easier for workers to open doors, log in to their computers, and purchase items from a break room, but a person with an RFID implant can be tracked 24 hours a day. Also, RFID chips are susceptible to unauthorized access or “skimming” by thieves who are merely physically close to the chip.advertisement[Image: Stratus3D/iStock, StudioM1/iStock]No privacy protections for workersThe monitoring that’s possible now will seem simplistic compared to what’s coming: a future in which robotics and other technologies capture huge amounts of personal information to feed artificial intelligence software that learns which metrics are associated with things such as workers’ moods and energy levels, or even diseases like depression.One healthcare analytic firm, whose clients include some of the biggest employers in the country, already uses workers’ internet search histories and medical insurance claims to predict who is at risk of getting diabetes or considering becoming pregnant. The company says it provides only summary information to clients, such as the number of women in a workplace who are trying to have children, but in most instances it can probably legally identify specific workers.Except for some narrow exceptions—like in bathrooms and other specific areas where workers can expect to be in relative privacy—private-sector employees have virtually no way, nor any legal right, to opt out of this sort of monitoring. They may not even be informed that it is occurring. Public-sector employees have more protection, thanks to the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches, but in government workplaces, the scope of that prohibition is quite narrow.[Image: Stratus3D/iStock, StudioM1/iStock]AI discriminationIn contrast to the almost total lack of privacy laws protecting workers, employment discrimination laws—while far from perfect—can provide some important protections for employees. But those laws have already faced criticism for their overly simplistic and limited view of what constitutes discrimination, which makes it very difficult for victims to file and win lawsuits or obtain meaningful settlements. Emerging technology, particularly AI, will exacerbate this problem.AI software programs used in the hiring process are marketed as eliminating or reducing biased human decision-making. In fact, they can create more bias, because these systems depend on large collections of data, which can be biased themselves.For instance, Amazon recently abandoned a multiyear project to develop an AI hiring program because it kept discriminating against women. Apparently, the AI program learned from Amazon’s male-dominated workforce that being a man was associated with being a good worker. To its credit, Amazon never used the program for actual hiring decisions, but what about employers who lack the resources, knowledge, or desire to identify biased AI?The laws about discrimination based on computer algorithms are unclear, just as other technologies stretch employment laws and regulations well beyond their clear applications. Without an update to the rules, more workers will continue to fall outside traditional worker protections–and may even be unaware how vulnerable they really are.Jeffrey Hirsch is the Geneva Yeargan Rand Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel HillThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

ScrapingAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTA Breakthrough for A.I. Technology: Passing an 8th-Grade Science TestShare full articleRead in appBy Cade MetzSept. 4, 2019SAN FRANCISCO — Four years ago, more than 700 computer scientists competed in a contest to build artificial intelligence that could pass an eighth-grade science test. There was $80,000 in prize money on the line.They all flunked. Even the most sophisticated system couldn’t do better than 60 percent on the test. A.I. couldn’t match the language and logic skills that students are expected to have when they enter high school.But on Wednesday, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a prominent lab in Seattle, unveiled a new system that passed the test with room to spare. It correctly answered more than 90 percent of the questions on an eighth-grade science test and more than 80 percent on a 12th-grade exam.Match Wits With Aristo on 5 Quiz QuestionsHere are five questions that were presented to a computer system from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a prominent lab in Seattle.The system, called Aristo, is an indication that in just the past several months researchers have made significant progress in developing A.I. that can understand languages and mimic the logic and decision-making of humans.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe world’s top research labs are rapidly improving a machine’s ability to understand and respond to natural language. Machines are getting better at analyzing documents, finding information, answering questions and even generating language of their own.Aristo was built solely for multiple-choice tests. It took standard exams written for students in New York, though the Allen Institute removed all questions that included pictures and diagrams. Answering questions like that would have required additional skills that combine language understanding and logic with so-called computer vision.Some test questions, like this one from the eighth-grade exam, required little more than information retrieval:A group of tissues that work together to perform a specific function is called:(1) an organ(2) an organism(3) a system(4) a cellBut others, like this question from the same exam, required logic:Which change would most likely cause a decrease in the number of squirrels living in an area?(1) a decrease in the number of predators(2) a decrease in competition between the squirrels(3) an increase in available food(4) an increase in the number of forest firesResearchers at the Allen Institute started work on Aristo — they wanted to build a “digital Aristotle” — in 2013, just after the lab was founded by the Seattle billionaire and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. They saw standardized science tests as a more meaningful alternative to typical A.I. benchmarks, which relied on games like chess and backgammon or tasks created solely for machines.A science test isn’t something that can be mastered just by learning rules. It requires making connections using logic. An increase in forest fires, for example, could kill squirrels or decrease the food supply needed for them to thrive and reproduce.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEnthusiasm for the progress made by Aristo is still tempered among scientists who believe machines are a long way from completely mastering natural language — and even further from duplicating true intelligence.“We can’t compare this technology to real human students and their ability to reason,” said Jingjing Liu, a Microsoft researcher who has been working on many of the same technologies as the Allen Institute.But Aristo’s advances could spread to a range of products and services, from internet search engines to record-keeping systems at hospitals.ImageOren Etzioni, who oversees the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, said an advance unveiled on Wednesday could have a wide impact, from search engines to medical records.Credit...Kyle Johnson for The New York Times“This has significant business consequences,” said Oren Etzioni, the former University of Washington professor who oversees the Allen Institute. “What I can say — with complete confidence — is you are going to see a whole new generation of products, some from start-ups, some from the big companies.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe new research could lead to systems that can carry on a decent conversation. But it could also encourage the spread of false information.“We are at the very early stage of this,” said Jeremy Howard, who oversees Fast.ai, another influential lab, in San Francisco. “We are so far away from the potential that I cannot say where it will end up.”In 2016, when a London lab built a system that could beat the world’s best players at the ancient game of Go, it was widely hailed as a turning point for artificial intelligence.Dr. Etzioni’s excitement, however, was muted. Artificial intelligence was not nearly as advanced as it might seem, he said, pointing to the earlier Allen Institute’s competition that stumped the A.I. systems with an eighth-grade science test.The Allen Institute improved on that earlier effort much quicker than many experts — including Dr. Etzioni — expected.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIts work was largely driven by neural networks, complex mathematical systems that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. By pinpointing patterns in thousands of dog photos, for example, a neural network can learn to recognize a dog.In recent months, the world’s leading A.I. labs have built elaborate neural networks that can learn the vagaries of language by analyzing articles and books written by humans.At Google, researchers built a system called Bert that combed through thousands of Wikipedia articles and a vast digital library of romance novels, science fiction and other self-published books.Through analyzing all that text, Bert learned how to guess the missing word in a sentence. By learning that one skill, Bert soaked up enormous amounts of information about the fundamental ways language is constructed. And researchers could apply that knowledge to other tasks.ImageDr. Etzioni and Peter Clark, manager of the Aristo project, at the Allen Institute in Seattle.Credit...Kyle Johnson for The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe Allen Institute built their Aristo system on top of the Bert technology. They fed Bert a wide range of questions and answers. In time, it learned to answer similar questions on its own.Not long ago, researchers at the lab defined the behavior of their test-taking system one line of software code at a time. Sometimes they still do that painstaking coding. But now that the system can learn from digital data on its own, it can improve at a much faster rate.Systems like Bert — called “language models” — now drive a wide range of research projects, including conversational systems and tools designed to identify false news. With more data and more computing power researchers believe the technology will continue to improve.But Dr. Etzioni stressed that the future of these systems was hard to predict and that language was only one piece of the puzzle.Ms. Liu and her fellow Microsoft researchers have tried to build a system that can pass the Graduate Records Exam, the test required for admission to graduate school.The language section was doable, she said, but building the reasoning skills required for the math section was another matter. “It was far too challenging.”Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @cademetz.

Burnout has become a popular buzzword in today’s business world, meant to describe prolonged periods of stress in the workplace leading to feelings of depression and dissatisfaction with one’s occupation. The topic has become so pervasive that the World Health Organization (WHO) addressed it at its 2019 World Health Assembly in Geneva in May, adding burnout to the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) — although classifying it as an “occupational phenomenon” rather than a medical condition.
Healthcare itself is not immune to burnout, and a recent study in Journal of the American College of Radiology demonstrates it is taking a toll on pediatric radiologists in particular. The study surveyed Society of Pediatric Radiology (SPR) members and found nearly two-thirds expressed at least one symptom of burnout. While burnout is a complicated phenomenon and no two people experience it the same way, a commentary on the study suggests artificial intelligence (AI) could help alleviate some of the difficulties that can lead to burnout.
Defining Burnout
Rama S. Ayyala, M.D., is a pediatric radiologist with the Department of Diagnostic Imaging at Rhode Island Hospital-Hasbro Children’s Hospital and Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. She wanted to study burnout because she had been interacting with a lot of people in her field who were experiencing it. “A lot of them were leaving medicine and some were even having mental health issues,” she said.
This sentiment was also born out in the most recent edition of the National Physician Burnout, Depression and Suicide Report, published by Medscape. The report ranks medical subspecialties by the percentage of clinicians reporting feelings of burnout. Radiology ranked seventh in the 2018 Medscape survey — alarming enough by itself, but even more so because it jumped from 18th place in the previous edition.1
Ayyala’s research team surveyed SPR members on their feelings of burnout according to the three components of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), originally published in 1981:
•    Emotional exhaustion (feeling overextended and depleted);
•    Depersonalization (a sense of cynicism, and/or a detached or callous attitude toward your job); and
•    Lack of personal accomplishment (perceived incompetence with capabilities in the job).
 
A total of 460 clinicians returned responses out of the 1,453 who were sent the survey, a 32 percent response rate. The prevalence rate for emotional exhaustion among the respondent group was 66 percent and depersonalization was 61 percent.
“People feel like they’ve lost their sense of control,” said Ayyala.
The survey included additional questions to gather more information about the roles and job characteristics of pediatric radiologists, including:
•    Gender;
•    Full- or part-time employment status;
•    How long they have been practicing;
•    Practice type;
•    Total number of pediatric radiologists in the practice; and
•    On-call status and frequency of being on-call.
 
Out of all the job characteristics surveyed, on-call status seemed to have the single greatest association with increased feelings of burnout. “Many children’s hospitals currently struggle with how to provide 24-hour radiology coverage,” Ayyala stated.   
AI Making Way Into Pediatric Imaging
Technology has dramatically changed the way radiologists practice, as remote viewing systems, the evolution of picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and mobile devices allow them to read images from essentially anywhere. For some radiologists who feel burned out due to their workload, however, technology may be able to help alleviate some of their burden — specifically artificial intelligence (AI).
Michael J. Callahan, M.D., who is the director, computed tomography; division chief, abdominal imaging; medical director, ultrasound; and staff radiologist in the Department of Radiology at Boston Children’s Hospital, wrote a commentary for Pediatric Radiology on Ayyala’s study. The topic of burnout has become a point of focus at recent SPR meetings, and the society is working to find possible solutions to help its members. According to Callahan, AI has been discussed as one approach to help improve efficiency in image interpretation. “Although theoretical solutions exist for a multitude of problems, steps to moderate and manage the effects and consequences of burnout in pediatric radiologists will undoubtedly require in-depth discussions at future SPR meetings,” he wrote.
The use of AI has exploded in radiology as a whole in recent years, with vendors and clinicians exploring its use for everything from image interpretation to worklist sorting and more. Despite the immense interest, AI is taking slightly longer making its way to clinical use in the subspecialty of pediatric radiology. This is largely due to the need for large volumes of data to train algorithms, a feat which is difficult with the generally lower volumes of pediatric imaging, according to Sudhen Desai, M.D., an interventional radiologist at Texas Children’s Hospital.
“A system like Texas Children’s, which has a good amount of inpatient and outpatient volume, has available to itself the ability to create datasets to train models from. That’s one of our luxuries,” he said. “However, there are smaller pediatric institutions that suffer from lack of available data.”
Part of the problem, according to Desai, is that the need for larger volumes of data runs counter to the long-standing protocol of limiting the exposure of children to radiation, advanced through national initiatives such as Image Wisely. While this has placed limitations on the adoption of AI in pediatric radiology, the technology itself may also offer a way forward. Desai said that work is ongoing to train the algorithms with lower numbers of radiographs or cross-sectional imaging. With this information, algorithm architects can employ methods such as feedback learning (teaching the computer to take actions in an environment so as to maximize the concept of a cumulative reward) and transfer learning (using the knowledge gained from one application and applying it to a different but related problem). “So we’re trying to use various tricks and techniques to train our models in a more efficient fashion so that we don’t need tens of thousands of datasets but ... maybe hundreds of datasets, that would allow us to do the work,” Desai said.
Using AI to Combat Burnout
As suggested by Callahan, the role of AI in combating pediatric radiologist burnout may be in streamlining and/or automating some of the processes and tasks that entail a heavy workload burden. Several practitioners are already exploring the use of AI in a clinical pediatric imaging setting, offering many promising applications.
 
Bone age detection. Bone age evaluation is one of the most common practices in pediatric radiology. Radiologists examine series of hand radiographs to evaluate a patient’s growth and diagnose developmental disorders. The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) made this the focus of its first annual Machine Learning Challenge in 2017. Teams of researchers were encouraged to develop their own algorithms for automating bone age detection by using a dataset of hand radiographs compiled from various leading U.S. research institutions. Participants in the challenge were judged on how well the bone age evaluations produced by their algorithms agreed with the expert observers’ notated evaluations. The winning algorithm is now available through the EnvoyAI Exchange platform.
Safwan Halabi, M.D., a clinical associate professor of radiology – pediatric radiology at Stanford Children’s Health, has been using the bone age algorithm in his clinical research. He is currently collaborating with researchers at nine other institutions to validate the algorithm “and it’s looking really good,” he said. “We could eliminate some of our mundane things that we measure [because they] can be automated and sent directly to the electronic health record.”
 
Pneumonia detection. Halabi’s Stanford colleague Matthew Lungren, M.D., an assistant professor of radiology (pediatric radiology) is part of a group developing an AI algorithm to improve pneumonia detection on chest X-rays. Their model is trained on a National Institutes of Health (NIH) dataset consisting of 112,120 frontal view chest X-rays from 30,805 unique patients. In a preliminary paper published in 2017, the algorithm was found to exceed the performance of an average radiologist in detecting pneumonia.2   
Pneumonia detection was the focus of the 2018 RSNA Machine Learning Challenge.
 
Interpreting tubes and catheters in pediatric X-rays. Another challenge in the world of pediatric imaging is the fact that many of the smallest, sickest patients have a large number of tubes and other apparatus attached to them — feeding tubes, catheters, ECG leads and more. When these patients need to be imaged, the radiologist will typically have to go through each image and identify artifacts that are external to the patient.
Desai stated that research is currently being done to train AI to identify and classify these outside objects in an X-ray. Using adult chest radiographs, the research group added markers for lines and tubes, and that information was fed back into the AI model. The model was then applied to pediatric radiographs, and it was able to identify lines, tubes and other objects “on the order of about 80 percent,” Desai said. The ultimate goal is for the computer to recognize catheters or tubes that are out of position and alert the radiologist.3
Human Element Still Required
These and other applications offer hope for artificial intelligence to act as a workflow organizer for pediatric radiologists experiencing burnout from an intense workload. But while the technology continues to mature, it is critical for the people guiding the technology to carefully consider its application.
“Burnout is a very broad term which can stem from many different causes,” said Stacey Funt, M.D. Funt previously worked as a full-time body radiologist in New York before her own experiences with burnout caused her to reorder her priorities. She now works in radiology part-time while speaking across the U.S. as a health and wellness coach for healthcare providers through her own company, Lifestyle Health LLC. Funt’s experience with burnout stemmed from a perceived loss of connection with other doctors and her patients. Ultimately, she believes that the most helpful technological solutions are those that can help improve communication and connection across the healthcare continuum. This could be especially helpful for the subset of radiologists who identified being on-call as a potential source of burnout. “I think one source of stress for radiologists that technology can address, especially when on-call, is when you need to contact referring physicians to relay critical information but you can't reach anyone. Another is if you have a really tough case that you are not sure of but don't have anyone present to run it by. So it all depends on the issues for each person, and that’s variable,” she concluded.

September 3rd, 2019, London, UK: Deep Knowledge Analytics salutes its parent company, Deep Knowledge Ventures, in the landmark Nature Biotechnology publication of its portfolio company, Insilico Medicine, demonstrating the design, synthesis and preclinical validation of a novel drug candidate in just 46 days.
The many advances in deep learning reinforcement learning and generative adversarial learning made since 2014 are rapidly transforming multiple industries including search, translation, video games, retail, transportation, and many others. It is relatively easy to validate the performance of the AI systems in imaging, voice, text and other areas where human sensory systems can be used to rapidly verify the validity of the experimental results. However, in the pharmaceutical industry, the validation cycles take decades and cost billions of dollars. Most of the common questions asked by the pharmaceutical industry executives to all of the leading artificial intelligence groups worldwide deal with the novelty of the algorithms and experimental validation of the results in mice or even in humans. There is a grave disconnect between the leaders in AI focusing on the novelty of the algorithms and drug discovery and development experts focusing only on experimental data. 
On Monday, September 2nd, a group of collaborators from Insilico Medicine and WuXi AppTec published irrefutable proof where cutting-edge work in artificial intelligence utilizing the next-generation generative tensorial and reinforcement learning was followed by experimental validation. The molecules ""imagined"" by the Generative Tensorial Reinforcement Learning (GENTRL) techniques were rapidly synthesized, tested in enzymatic, cell-based fibrosis, metabolic stability, microsomal stability assays, and in mice.
The paper Alex Zhavoronkov, et al, 2019,  ""Deep learning enables rapid identification of potent DDR1 kinase inhibitors"", Nature Biotechnology, presents a substantial advance in artificial intelligence for drug discovery. The AI work presented in the paper was done in 2017 and the code is openly available. The company scientists believe that they can go after the many target classes and challenging targets with the universal generative pipeline that can account for cases where no crystal structure exists and one or even no template molecules are known while achieving respectable hit rates. 
We sent the article to a number of thought leaders in the industry asking for their opinion:
""This is an important demonstration of the power of AI, using a GAN approach, to markedly accelerate the design and experimental validation of a new molecule, no less one targeting fibrosis, a major unmet medical need."" said Dr. Eric Topol, Executive Vice-President of Scripps Research and Founder and Director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute (Eric Topol has no relationship with the company in question nor its authors). 
""Zhavoronkov et al. show that AI techniques can be used to guide our search for good drug molecules in the the vastness of chemical space, one of the key challenges in drug discovery today. The work provides compelling evidence that AI can learn from historical datasets to generate novel molecular compounds with drug-like properties, and helps clarify how AI can be used to improve the speed of drug development."" said Mark DePristo, former Head of Genomics at Google Brain, Co-founder and CEO, BigHat Biosciences.
""When Deep Knowledge Ventures chose to provide Insilico Medicine's initial funding round in 2014, we did so because we saw their potential to increase Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) for the betterment of humanity as a whole. Since then they have been the first to use cutting edge deep learning techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks to design novel drug candidates from scratch with specified molecular properties in 2016, and in 2018 to succeed in designing, synthesizing and validating a new drug end to end in less than 2 months. I am also thrilled by the fact that this article visualizes what Insilico Medicine has been making in their R&D already back in 2017 and submitted for publication in 2018. I would not be surprised to find out that since then they have made even greater progress in applying next-generation AI techniques for drug design, which might be publicly disclosed in 2020"" said Dmitry Kaminskiy, General Partner of Deep Knowledge Ventures.
""Using Advanced GANs in the discovery of drugs is a great example of cutting edge application of AI in the pharmaceutical industry - it speeds up a critical process from years to just weeks."" said Christian Guttmann, Executive Director Nordic AI Institute, Professor AI at the University of New South Wales, and Senior AI Research Fellow AI at Karolinska Institute.
""Exhilarating news in Nature Biotechnology today, as scientists from Insilico Medicine (Hong Kong), report that an AI process called GENTRL, has facilitated the identification of new small molecule kinase inhibitors, DNA damage response (DDR1) inhibitors, in a two month time frame, reducing the current non-AI early 'research/preclinical development' time estimates for new drugs by approximately 94%. The cost savings for bio-marker drugs using AI processes is huge.  Not only is the end-to-end development time reduced, but so too are the costs related to R&D scientific, professional and technical personnel, which account for approximately 29% of the total cost to develop a drug, according to Tufts CSDD.  In addition to the reduced development time and costs, drugs potentially get to market sooner, generating revenues for the companies who developed the drugs. DDR inhibitors are being studied for the treatment of cancer. Since the FDA fast tracks many drugs for serious conditions, there is incredible potential to reduce overall developments costs while increase the speed which novel drugs can be approved for very sick patients waiting for them. This welcome news comes at a time when soaring costs for drug development, arguably are being recouped in high prices of novel innovative therapies hitting the market."" said Barbara Gilmore, Senior Consultant on Transformational Health at Frost & Sullivan.
""It is extremely exciting seeing Deep Learning and other techniques being used to help pinpoint drug discovery in a matter of days. In particular, exploiting large, publicly-available data sets to accelerate this process can give huge benefits for low cost. The data-driven approach will give better and faster results than the traditional methods, leading to faster drug discovery and safer, more reliable results than clinical trials on their own. While it's unlikely that AI will replace the current methods overnight, it's obvious that organisations which add AI to their methods will quickly replace those who do not. It is vital these organisations 'Uber' themselves before they get Kodaked"" said David Whewel, former Director of Architecture and Software Innovation at Merck Group.
""As far as I know, this marks the first ever demonstration that AI can generate entirely novel, synthesizable, active molecules against a specific pharmacological target. In my view, the fact that they were able to generate entirely novel, pharmacologically viable compounds using AI is the most amazing achievement here. Of course it's even more amazing that they established this ground-breaking proof of concept in just 46 days!"" said Olivier Elemento, Director of the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine & Associate Director of the Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.

In brief: At the Shanghai Expo Center in China, hosting the 2019 World Artificial Intelligence Conference, Elon Musk and Jack Ma began proceedings with a 45-minute debate around the risks and potential rewards associated with artificial intelligence while also discussing Mars, work culture and chimpanzees among other topics. 
Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and Tesla CEO, exchanged views on-stage with Jack Ma, Chinese billionaire and co-founder of the multinational conglomerate Alibaba Group, over the risks and benefits of artificial intelligence.
""Does AI mean love? There's like a name, AI, it sort of sounds a bit like love?"" began Musk to which Ma amusingly replied ""Yeah AI...I hate the word AI called artificial intelligence. I call it Alibaba intelligence.""
Both leaders had different opinions on the implications of the technology where optimistic Ma said that he didn't consider AI to be a threat, ""I don't know, man, that's like, famous last words,"" replied Musk. According to the Tesla CEO, most people think of AI as a smart human but he said it's going to be much more than that. ""It'll be much smarter than the smartest human.""
He further highlighted AI's capability to be much smarter than humans by saying that ""the biggest mistake that I see artificial intelligence researchers making is assuming that they're intelligent. Yeah they're not, compared to AI. And so like, a lot of them cannot imagine something smarter than themselves, but AI will be vastly smarter---vastly.""

Jack Ma, meanwhile, credited Elon with having a vision about technology and said that he himself is not a ""tech guy"" as he's ""all about life"" and thinks that AI will open a new chapter enabling people to understand themselves better. ""99.99 percent of the predictions that human beings had in history about the future---all wrong,"" said Ma to which Musk responded ""Including that one?""
Talking about technology that's changing at an ""incredibly fast"" rate, Musk said that ""it is outpacing our ability to understand it,"" and he wasn't sure if that was good or bad. He further commented on ""humanity"" being a ""biological boot loader for digital super intelligence.""

When asked by Ma about his curiosity for Mars, Musk said that he thinks it was ""important for us to take the set of actions that are most likely to continue consciousness into the future....where are the aliens? This is the Fermi paradox. This is one of the most important questions. How come we have not found any aliens? There are people out there who think we've found aliens. Trust me, I would know. We have not.""
Commenting on AI's role as a force for good in reducing work hours, Ma said that AI would help create new kinds of jobs that require less of our time. ""I think people should work three days a week, four hours a day,"" and that in artificial intelligence, people would be able to live on for 120 years.
With the debate lasting over 45 minutes, the executives touched on education systems, disagreed over machines outsmarting humans and concluded that population collapse was the biggest problem the world faced over the next 20 years.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






The Aristo AI software has matched an eighth-grader’s ability to pass a science test. (AI2 Illustration)
Four years after the late Seattle billionaire Paul Allen challenged researchers to come up with an artificial intelligence program smart enough to pass an eighth-grade science test, that feat has been declared accomplished — by the hometown team.
The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, or AI2, announced today that its Aristo software scored better than 90% on a multiple-choice test geared for eighth graders, and better than 80% on a test for high school seniors.
There are caveats, of course: The exam, which was based on New York Regents aptitude tests, excluded questions that depended on interpreting pictures or diagrams. Those questions would have required visual interpretation skills that aren’t yet programmed into Aristo. Questions requiring a direct answer (that is, essay questions) were also left out. And for what it’s worth, Aristo would have been useless outside the areas of science in which it was trained.
Nevertheless, the exercise illustrated how far AI has come just since 2016, when all of the programs competing in the $80,000 Allen AI Science Challenge flunked.
“This is a breakthrough because it’s a remarkable result on standardized test questions which require a degree of natural language understanding, reasoning, and even common sense,” AI2 CEO Oren Etzioni told GeekWire in an email. “This is very different from both standard research benchmarks and board games like Go. Even a year ago, no one would have anticipated such rapid progress on 8th and 12th grade science questions!”
AI2 science quiz: Match wits with Aristo, circa 2016
The work builds on a series of language-interpreting, question-answering AI agents including AI2’s ELMo program and the BERT program developed at Google’s research facility in Seattle. Aristo takes advantage of eight types of problem-solving agents — ranging from an agent that merely looks up answers in a database, to an agent that checks lists of associated concepts (known as tuples), to an agent that performs qualitative reasoning.
Each problem-solver produces a score for the preferred multiple-choice answer, and Aristo weights the different scores to select the most likely choice. The program optimizes its performance through rounds of training and calibration.
For example, one question asks: “How are the particles in a block of iron affected when the block is melted? (A) The particles gain mass. (B) The particles contain less energy. (C) The particles move more rapidly. (D) The particles increase in volume.”
To answer the question, Aristo retrieves the knowledge that particles move faster as the heat of a particle increase, associates the term “melted” with “heat,” associates the term “faster” with “more rapidly,” and scores C as the correct choice.
Combining different problem-solving approaches cleared the way for Aristo to raise its test score from roughly 60% in 2016 to 91.6% on the eighth-grade test. The program scored nearly as well, 83.5%, on the 12th-grade exam.
This chart shows how Aristo scored on the New York Regents eighth-grade science test (including only multiple-choice, non-diagram questions) over time. The increase in performance reflects a progressively more sophisticated approach to analyzing test questions.
In a research paper about the project, Etzioni and other AI2 researchers — including Peter Clark, senior manager for Project Aristo — say the program’s passing grade “is only a step on the long road toward a machine that has a deep understanding of science and achieves Paul Allen’s original dream of a Digital Aristotle.”
The researchers are aiming to extend Aristo’s skills to encompass diagram-based questions and essay questions. Eventually, the technology should advance the state of the art when it comes to providing natural-language answers to questions that would tax the brains of grown-ups as well as eighth-graders.
That’s likely to lead to digital assistants that are smarter than the current iterations of Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana and Apple’s Siri — as well as a whole new wave of AI applications and startups.
In separate emails, Etzioni and Clark both paid tribute to Paul Allen, who passed away last October at the age of 65. And they both said he’d want more.
“Paul would’ve been very pleased, but wouldn’t let us rest on our laurels,” Etzioni told GeekWire. “He would ask: What’s your next major step towards understanding of language?”
Clark agreed: “I would imagine him saying “Congratulations! What’s next?” ”
Update for 1:25 p.m. PT Sept. 4: I sent Clark some follow-up questions via email, and here are a few answers that expand upon the significance of the research. The Q&A has been edited for brevity and clarity (especially for the Q’s):

GeekWire: How is this approach different from IBM’s Watson? If Aristo were to compete against Watson, who would win?
Clark: “The two systems were designed for very different kinds of questions. Watson was focused on encyclopedia-style ‘factoid’ questions where the answer was explicitly written down somewhere in text, typically many times. In contrast, Aristo answers science questions where the answer is not always written down somewhere, and may involve reasoning about a scenario, e.g.:

“Otto pushed a toy car across a floor. The car traveled fast across the wood, but it slowed to a stop on the carpet. Which best explains what happened when the car reached the carpet? (A) Friction increased (B) Friction decreased…”
“City administrators can encourage energy conservation by (1) lowering parking fees (2) building larger parking lots (3) decreasing the cost of gasoline (4) lowering the cost of bus and subway fares.”

“Out of the box, Watson would likely struggle with science questions, and Aristo would struggle with the cryptic way that ‘Jeopardy’ questions were phrased. They’d each fail each other’s test.
“Under the hood they are quite different too. In particular, Watson didn’t use deep learning (it was created before the deep learning technology) while Aristo makes heavy use of deep learning. Watson had many modules that tried different ways of looking for the answer. Aristo has a few (eight) modules that try a variety of methods of answering questions, including lookup, several reasoning methods and language modeling.”
Q: Please pass along the usual caveats. For example, questions with pictures were not used because they’d require computer vision. Any other caveats?
A: “Aristo isn’t able to handle questions with diagrams very well except in a few special cases. For instance, Aristo can answer questions about food chains, but it can’t answer those that require reading a map or studying a bar chart. It also has difficulty dealing with hypothetical situations. For example, Aristo struggles with the following question: “If you pull the leaves off a plant, what would the result be?” A good answer would be that the plant would no longer be able to make its own food. But Aristo struggles with this question because it requires the system to create an imaginary world and imagine what would happen in that world. Finally, our benchmark is a multiple choice test, another limitation.”
Q: Could you say a bit about the potential applications? Do you see a “question-answering” program like Watson, or do you see more novel applications?
A: “Aristo’s long-term goal is not just about passing science tests, it’s about creating a system that has a deeper understanding of science, with many potential applications. There are three areas in particular that seem promising. The first is in the area of education and personalized education, where Aristo could help a child understand science by providing personal tutoring. The second is in helping scientists. I can imagine Aristo offering background information on scientific concepts and prior work to a scientist in a laboratory. Finally, longer term, Aristo might help in scientific discovery itself, connecting the dots where people haven’t been able to in the past, in areas such as medicine or engineering. Aristo currently has a long way to go to reach these goals, of course, but performing so well on the Regents Science exam is a tremendous step forward.”

Authors of the AI2 team’s paper, “From ‘F’ to ‘A’ on the N.Y. Regents Science Exam: An Overview of the Aristo Project,” include Clark and Etzioni as well as Tushar Khot, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Kyle Richardson, Ashish Sabharwal, Carissa Schoenick, Oyvind Tafjord, Niket Tandon, Sumithra Bhakthavatsalam, Dirk Groeneveld and Michal Guerquin.
