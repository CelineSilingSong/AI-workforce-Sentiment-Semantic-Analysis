A World Without Work
By Daniel Susskind
For centuries, people have worried that new technologies—from the mechanical loom to the internal combustion engine—would replace human labor and render us superfluous. And for centuries, these fears have proven misplaced as new technologies have increased our productivity and created new jobs.
In A World Without Work, Susskind convincingly makes the case that this time truly is different—that in the coming decades, artificial intelligence will put broad swaths of the human population out of work.

What will it mean for society as more and more of the jobs that underpin our economy are automated? What steps can we take to mitigate the worst side effects of this transition? And most profoundly: how will we use our time, measure our lives and find purpose in a world in which people no longer need to work?

These questions are among the most important of our era. There are no easy answers. But this book does an excellent job of framing the issues.

Genius Makers
By Cade Metz
Genius Makers is the enthralling, entertaining story of how the modern field of artificial intelligence came to be. Informed by hundreds of exclusive interviews, the book is brimming with colorful anecdotes and behind-the-scenes details about the birth of deep learning. It focuses above all on the characters who ushered in today’s AI revolution: Geoff Hinton, Demis Hassabis, Yann LeCun, Fei-Fei Li, Jeff Dean and more.
For anyone interested in the field of artificial intelligence and its roots, this book is essential reading.

What Computers Still Can’t Do
By Hubert Dreyfus
Originally published in 1972 and then updated in 1992, this classic text argues from first principles that digital computers may never be able to fully replicate higher mental functions. Thoughtfully fusing philosophy, history, psychology and engineering, the book’s skeptical perspective cannot easily be dismissed.
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this book is that, though it was written decades ago, it remains remarkably on point to this day. Consider, for instance, its critique of (what we now know as) supervised learning: “It is really the person deciding which cases are good examples who is furnishing the intelligence. Viewed from this perspective, neural networks are almost as dependent upon human intelligence as are GOFAI [good old-fashioned artificial intelligence] systems.”

The Alignment Problem
By Brian Christian
Artificial intelligence is being entrusted with more and more real-world responsibility: in our financial systems, our hospitals, our schools, our homes. As we develop increasingly complex AI systems whose decision-making we don’t directly control or even understand, how can we ensure that these systems’ judgment and values are aligned with our own?
This book provides an illuminating examination of what is known as the “alignment problem” in AI, from its technical foundations to its philosophical implications. Particularly fascinating is the book’s discussion of inverse reinforcement learning and the promise this approach holds for building AI systems we can trust.
As Christian notes, the alignment problem bears a real resemblance to parenting: “The story of human civilization has always been about how to instill values in strange, alien, human-level intelligences who will inevitably inherit the reins of society from us—namely, our kids.”

Klara and the Sun
By Kazuo Ishiguro
Klara and the Sun, the most recent novel from Nobel Prize-winning author Kazuo Ishiguro, is the only work of fiction on our list.
Fiction is sometimes a more powerful medium than nonfiction to surface and explore complex societal issues, including the disorienting transformations wrought by new technologies. Klara and the Sun is a case in point. The relationships between the story’s artificially intelligent characters and its human ones prompt readers to think afresh about family, mortality, and the meaning of life. The scenarios and dilemmas in this story are fictional—but within our lifetimes they may become all too real.

Rebooting AI
By Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis
Gary Marcus is a polarizing figure in the world of AI. He is one of the most vocal and persistent critics of today’s prevailing AI paradigm centered on big data and deep learning. He frequently calls out deep learning’s lack of robustness and common sense, arguing that the path forward in AI must include the incorporation of traditional symbolic methods.
Whether one agrees or disagrees with Marcus, he is worth taking seriously. (After all, remember that Geoff Hinton and his deep learning peers were themselves in the dissenting minority for decades.)
Rebooting AI is a nice encapsulation of Marcus’ main arguments about the state of AI today. It is worth a read. In the words of John Stuart Mill: “He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.”

Four Futures
By Peter Frase
This brief, imaginative, little-known work is a fascinating read, especially for those who like to think about the big picture—the really big picture.
Four Futures begins with the premise that three key forces will shape human life and civilization in the twenty-first century: automation, climate change, and sociopolitical inequality. The book sketches out four alternative visions for how these forces will interact to transform society in the decades ahead. Some of these potential futures are distressingly bleak, while others are more hopeful.
The book calls attention to two crucial points about artificial intelligence and society. First, whether one is optimistic or pessimistic about AI’s long-term impact, there is little question that it will be transformative—so we should all be engaging. And second, nothing is preordained: the choices that humanity makes and the values that we prioritize in the years ahead will determine how this technology transforms our world.

Less than a quarter (22 per cent) of firms that have introduced AI technology over the last five years say that it has led to a net loss of jobs, according to a recently published study by the University of Warwick’s Institute of Employment Research and the University of Sussex Business School.Academics collected data from 759 respondents via a YouGov panel in 2018, and found that 22 per cent of firms that introduced AI had seen net job destruction, where the number of jobs lost is higher than the number created. It found that AI technology is more likely to be disruptive to job numbers than other non-AI based technology: 4 per cent of respondents that had introduced other forms of technology in their organisation saw net job destruction, while 9 per cent of those organisations saw net job creation.The study, which compiled data from business leaders in organisations with more than 10 employees across the private, public and third sectors, found that AI is 28 percentage points more likely to be linked with job creation than other forms of technology, but also 26 percentage points more likely to be associated with job destruction than other technologies.It also found that of the 81 per cent of respondents who had introduced a form of new technology over the past five years (up to 2018), a quarter (25 per cent) had introduced AI-enabled technology; 69 per cent had introduced new IT hardware; and 59 per cent had introduced new online networking platforms. Dr Wil Hunt, research fellow at the Institute of Employment Research, said the study points to the need to focus on AI’s potential for job creation through labour saving and improved productivity levels: “Future research would do well to pay heed to specific applications of AI and the motivations behind adoption as well as the scale of job creation and destruction effects.”

Graham Carter
How did Earth turn from a sterile ball of rock into a lush, green world of living things? This question of how life got started is one of the hardest of them all.
Still, we are inching closer to answering it. Several scientists have created things that approximate to life. Late last year, a team led by Josh Bongard at the University of Vermont reprogrammed frog skin cells into “xenobots“. These groups of cells can swim and reproduce, working together to corral loose cells into new versions of themselves.
But if you drill right down to the heart of this question, you reach a bedrock of chemistry. How did a selection of inanimate molecules start joining together and replicating themselves? In the 1950s, chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey put a mixture of chemicals in a sealed jar and showed that amino acids, a key ingredient in living things, could be formed spontaneously. That was a big step, but it still doesn’t tell us how those molecules formed a self-replicating system.
This is why chemists are interested in trying to recreate the moment that inanimate chemistry turned into the simplest possible life. There are billions of ways this could have happened. So Lee Cronin at the University of Glasgow, UK, is employing robots to help investigate. He and his team have set up machines that combine a selection of simple substances – acids, inorganic minerals, carbon-based molecules – to react randomly. The outcome is analysed and then an algorithm helps the robot choose how to proceed. In this way, the robot can hunt through vast swathes of…

The Review Board of the United States Copyright Office recently confirmed on appeal that copyright does not subsist in a work created by an AI in the United States.1 The decision of the Review Board makes it clear that human authorship is a prerequisite for copyright protection in the United States.
This reflects an ongoing trend in IP law, with IP Offices around the world faced with the question of whether protections can be provided for the product of an AI.
The New Zealand position on copyright protection for machine-generated works is in stark contrast to the US position. The New Zealand Copyright Act 1994 expressly provides that they can be protected by copyright.
Background
Steven Thaler has recently gained some notoriety in IP circles for being the first person to seek patent protection for an AI-generated invention. Mr Thaler’s patent applications, filed in several countries, identify an AI system (called DABUS which stands for “Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience”) as the inventor on his patent applications. He has had varying degrees of success so far. He has failed in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand (among other countries) but succeeded in Australia. Appeals are pending in all those jurisdictions.
In November 2018, Mr Thaler filed an application with the US Copyright Office to register a copyright claim in a two-dimensional artwork called ‘A Recent Entrance to Paradise’ – shown below:

 









In the application, Mr Thaler identified the author of the work as the “Creativity Machine”, an AI system he devised and owns.
Mr Thaler further stated in his application that the work had been “autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine” and that he was “seeking to register this computer-generated work as a work-for-hire to the owner of the Creativity Machine”.2
The US Copyright Office’s decisions
The US Copyright Office initially rejected the application in 2019 because it “lack[ed] the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim”. Mr Thaler subsequently requested that the Copyright Office reconsider its initial refusal arguing that “the human authorship requirement is unconstitutional and unsupported by either statute or case law”.
The Copyright Office reviewed the case but in 2020 upheld its initial findings, determining that the work “lack[ed] the required human authorship necessary to sustain a claim in copyright,” because Mr Thaler had “provided no evidence on sufficient creative input or intervention by a human author in the work”.
Mr Thaler filed a second request for reconsideration, renewing his argument that the human authorship requirement is unconstitutional and unsupported by case law.
The Review Board of the US Copyright Office again dismissed Mr Thaler’s arguments on the same grounds. It held that US Courts interpreting the Copyright Act, including the Supreme Court, have uniformly limited copyright protection to creations of human authors.3
The position under the New Zealand Copyright Act 1994
The position in the United States is in direct contrast to the position under the Copyright Act 1994 in New Zealand (the Act) where machine-generated works are protected by copyright for 50 years. Also, unlike in the United States, copyright cannot be registered in New Zealand. It subsists automatically upon creation of a copyright work, without further formalities. 
Section 5(2)(a) of the Act expressly provides that the author of a work, being the person who creates it, can be “in the case of a literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic work that is computer-generated, the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken; in this case Mr Thaler.
The term “computer-generated” is itself defined (at section 2) as “work [that] is generated by computer in circumstances such that there is no human author of the work”.
Computer-generated works had become relatively common from the 1980s, such as weather maps and telephone directories. However, Parliament clearly did not have AI in mind when almost 20 years ago it adopted, word for word, those provisions from the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.
Still, the Act makes it expressly clear that ‘non-human works’ can be protected by copyright.
Conclusion
Under sections 18(2)(a) and 230 of the Act, the Creativity Machine’s ‘A Recent Entrance to Paradise’ is protected by copyright in New Zealand because Mr Thaler, as a US citizen benefits from the copyright protection afforded by the Act. Also, Mr Thaler, as the person who devised and used the Creativity Machine, owns that copyright.
New Zealand is one of only a handful of countries whose laws afford copyright protection to computer-generated works.
However, a review of the Copyright Act 1994 is underway. As part of that, the government has sought submissions on AI and copyright; it asked “whether any problems are created by the current rules relating to computer-generated works, including in light of new technological developments such as artificial intelligence”.4 The submissions received in response suggest most submitters consider the current approach appropriate.5
Many believe AI is the future. One side of the argument is that protecting the creative output of AI by copyright, giving the owner of that copyright exclusive rights to exploit the work for 50 years, will lead to increased use of AI. The counterargument is that copyright is about rewarding an author’s efforts and exercise of judgment and skills and stopping others from misappropriating those such that there is little point protecting a work that took no human effort to create.
The Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment has not made a timeline available for next steps in its review of the Copyright Act. It intends to seek further feedback on objectives through its next public consultation. Time will tell whether this unusual facet of the Copyright Act will give New Zealand’s creative and high-tech sectors a competitive edge in this fast-developing field.

2 In other words, Mr Thaler argued he commissioned the Creativity Machine to create the work (like an independent contractor) such that, as the commissioning party, he should own copyright in the work.
3 In its decision, the US Copyright Office refers to several court decisions holding that copyright does not protect works created by, or alleged to have been created by non-humans such as: ‘non-human spiritual beings’, a monkey, a living garden, the Holy Spirit.

Cedars-Sinai Establishes New Division: Artificial  Intelligence in Medicine
New Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Unit Uses Data to Find New Solutions to Complex, Modern Healthcare Needs

What is Ai? The Department of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai has established a new division to explore how artificial intelligence (Ai) can be applied to help solve complex medical problems and enhance clinical care.The new division, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, or AIM, is led by Sumeet Chugh, MD, an associate director of the Smidt Heart Institute and a prominent expert in sudden cardiac arrest, who has long relied on technology and population-wide data to help demystify who might be susceptible to the usually fatal heart rhythm disturbance.“Through the use of applied artificial intelligence, we can solve existing gaps in mechanisms, diagnostics and therapeutics of major human disease conditions which afflict large populations,” said Paul Noble, MD, professor of Medicine and Chair of the Department of Medicine, who created  the new division. “The future of medicine lies in decoding enormous amounts of phenotypic and genotypic patient data.”In conjunction with AIM, Cedars-Sinai has developed several key programs in which artificial intelligence is being increasingly deployed. Jason H. Moore, PhD, was recently named founding chair of the newly created Department of Computational Biomedicine—a systemwide program committed to advancing medical discoveries through interfacing the data sciences with clinical information.Furthermore, Cedars-Sinai’s Enterprise Data Intelligence team, led by Mike Thompson, has a substantial track record of using AI tools to facilitate patient care at the hospital level–a particularly valuable resource that enabled outstanding care during the pandemic.“Dr. Chugh has extensive experience using artificial intelligence to solve clinical problems for sudden cardiac arrest, one of our most difficult conditions,” said Shlomo Melmed, MB, ChB, executive vice president of Academic Affairs and dean of the Medical Faculty at Cedars-Sinai. “Under his leadership, the new division will harness the Cedars-Sinai systemwide clinical data warehouse to design clinically relevant approaches to solving important health questions.”Chugh said AIM has a multidisciplinary mandate. With its current focus on cardiac imaging, sudden cardiac arrest, COVID-19 and clinical genetics, Chugh hopes that division members will tackle a broad range of medical, surgical and public health problems.“Using a disease-based approach, AIM will enable cross-disciplinary connections between clinicians, scientists, and trainees at Cedars-Sinai at multiple levels,” said Chugh.Artificial Intelligence in ActionIn practice, AIM recently published a study in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine, employing artificial intelligence algorithms to identify heart attack risk in patients with already established coronary artery disease.  “Because the actual risk for recurring heart attacks differs greatly among patients, predicting future risk in patients with existing coronary artery disease can be challenging,” said Piotr Slomka, PhD, professor of medicine in the Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, and lead author of the study. “Predicting risk, however, becomes easier and more efficient with the use of artificial intelligence.”New research, from the division of AIM, was also recently published in the journal JAMA Cardiology. In the study, physician-scientists created an artificial intelligence tool that can effectively identify and distinguish between two life-threatening heart conditions that are often easy to miss: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac amyloidosis.“These two heart conditions are challenging for even expert cardiologists to accurately identify, and so patients often go on for years to decades before receiving a correct diagnosis,” said David Ouyang, MD, a cardiologist in the Smidt Heart Institute, member of the division of AIM, and senior author of the study. “Our AI algorithm can pinpoint disease patterns that can’t be seen by the naked eye, and then use these patterns to predict the right diagnosis.”As the new division advances, Chugh and team are designing clinically relevant questions from the broader Cedars-Sinai Health System that can be ethically vetted, analyzed, validated, and implemented.  “We hope to function as innovators and custodians of patients’ healthcare interests and needs,” said Chugh, the Pauline and Harold Price Chair in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research. “And, most important, we are bringing discoveries directly to patient care.”Read more from the Cedars-Sinai Blog: Graduate Students Are Using Ai in Medical Imaging

In collaboration with the UAE Artificial Intelligence Office, the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has launched an artificial intelligence (AI) and coding licence.
The licence, which is a UAE first, will support the country’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031.
The DIFC Innovation Hub, which is the region’s largest cluster of fintech and innovation enterprises, will provide a stimulating environment for companies holding the licence. The Hub hosts over 500 firms, ranging from startups to global unicorns, representing over 60 per cent of GCC fintechs.
The licence provides an opportunity to obtain the UAE Golden Visas for employees working in those companies.

 
Omar Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications, commented, “Such initiatives reflect positively on the country’s readiness to become a global destination for pioneering the future industries by adopting advanced technology stimulating innovation in various fields. The UAE Government is keen to support digital transformation processes that embody of the directives Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai.”
“This is being achieved by developing digital activities and providing innovative solutions that improve governments’ performance and the lives of communities. DIFC has opened new horizons for leading global companies that aspire to enhance their efforts in AI and expand their businesses further.”
Essa Kazim, governor of DIFC, said, “Dubai and DIFC are global ambassadors for AI. Financial Services companies in DIFC and a broad spectrum of other industries across the emirate are setting the standard that contributes to the UAE’s ambitious goal to have an internationally competitive, knowledge-based economy.”
Coding is a game-changer, and currently, it is recognised as a necessary skill and a competitive advantage for a wide range of professional roles. Undoubtedly one of the most important talents to master for current and future generations, coding and programming help young students develop problem-solving abilities, such as solving an issue rationally and creatively.
The UAE has launched initiatives under the ‘Project of the 50’ aiming to attract 100 of the world’s best coders to the country – every day.
Meanwhile earlier this year, the UAE government also launched the Coders HQ, a new transformational project that re-defines local coding communities, in partnership with more than 40 companies in the UAE and around the world.

The project, established in the Emirates Towers, aims to build a new generation of coders, enhance their capabilities and skills in coding and technology, empower them with tools and expertise, and provide them with the opportunity to design innovative solutions to address local and global challenges.

Artificial intelligence predicts algae potential as alternative energy source
Jet fuel, animal feed among potential products from algae

March 4, 2022 - by Blair Fannin





Texas A&M AgriLife Research scientists are using artificial intelligence to set a new world record for producing algae as a reliable, economic source for biofuel that can be used as an alternative fuel source for jet aircraft and other transportation needs.

Joshua Yuan, Ph.D., AgriLife Research scientist, professor and chair of Synthetic Biology and Renewable Products in the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, is leading the research project.
The team’s findings were published in January in Nature Communications. Ongoing research is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Fossil Energy Office. The work is also being funded by a gift from Dr. John ’90 and Sally ’92 Hood, who recently met with Yuan to discuss his biofuels research program. The gift is managed by the Texas A&M Foundation.
The project team includes Bin Long, a graduate student from the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology; Bart Fischer, Ph.D., co-director of the Texas A&M Agricultural and Food Policy Center and Texas A&M Department of Agricultural Economics; Henry Bryant, Ph.D., Department of Agricultural Economics; and Yining Zeng, Ph.D., staff scientist with the U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Solving the algae limitations as a biofuel
“The commercialization of algal biofuel has been hindered by the relatively low yield and high harvesting cost,” Yuan said. “The limited light penetration and poor cultivation dynamics both contributed to the low yield.”
Overcoming these challenges could enable viable algal biofuels to reduce carbon emissions, mitigate climate change, alleviate petroleum dependency and transform the bioeconomy, Yuan said.
Yuan has previously been successful at finding methods to convert corn stubble, grasses and mesquite into biodegradable, lightweight materials and bioplastics. His latest project utilizes a patented artificial intelligence advanced learning model to predict algae light penetration, growth and optimal density. The prediction model allows for continual harvest of synthetic algae using hydroponics to maintain the rapid growth at the optimal density to allow best light availability.

The method Yuan and team have successfully achieved in an outdoor experiment is 43.3 grams per square meter per day of biomass productivity, which would be a world record. The latest DOE target range is 25 grams per square meter per day.
“Algae can be used as an alternative energy source for many industries, including biofuel and as jet fuel,” Yuan said. “Algae is a good alternative fuel source for this industry. It’s an alternate feedstock for bioethanol refinery without the need for pretreatment. It’s lower cost than coal or natural gas. It also provides for a more efficient way of carbon capture and utilization.”
Yuan said algae can also be used as a source for animal feed. AgriLife Research has previously investigated algae as a source of livestock protein.
Algae as a renewable energy
Algae biofuel is regarded as one of the ultimate solutions for renewable energy, but its commercialization is hindered by growth limitations caused by mutual shading and high harvest costs.
“We overcome these challenges by advancing machine learning to inform the design of a semi-continuous algal cultivation (SAC) to sustain optimal cell growth and minimize mutual shading,” he said.
Yuan said he is using an aggregation-based sedimentation strategy designed to achieve low-cost biomass harvesting and economical SAC.
“The aggregation-based sedimentation is achieved by engineering a fast-growing blue-green algae strain, Synechococcus elongatus UTEX2973, to produce limonene, which increases cyanobacterial cell surface hydrophobicity and enables efficient cell aggregation and sedimentation,” he said.
Making algae economical energy
Scaling-up the SAC with an outdoor pond system achieves a biomass yield of 43.3 grams per square meter per day, bringing the minimum biomass selling price down to approximately $281 per ton, according to the journal article. In comparison, the standard low-cost feedstock for biomass in ethanol is corn, which is currently approximately $6 per bushel or $260 per ton. However, Yuan’s process does not call for costly pre-treatment before fermentation. Corn must be ground  and the mash must be cooked before fermentation. 
“Algae as a renewable fuel source was a hot topic a decade ago,” Fischer said. “As a result, there’s a lot of skepticism. I was even skeptical. However, the work that Joshua is doing is incredibly innovative. We were excited to partner on this project. At the productivity levels they obtain – and given the low-cost harvest that the strain allows – it shows a lot of promise.”
Yuan said despite significant potential and extensive efforts, the commercialization of algal biofuel has been hindered by limited sunlight penetration, poor cultivation dynamics, relatively low yield, and the absence of cost-effective industrial harvest methods.
“This technology is proven to be affordable and help propel algae as a true alternative form of energy,” he said.

Artificial intelligence-based technology in industrial robots

 March 14, 2022   



© Peerapong Peattayakul 
Kensuke Harada from Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, provides an introduction to and analysis of a move towards artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology in industrial robots
One of the areas where there are the greatest expectations for robots to replace human labour is in the manufacturing process of products in factories. However, as often depicted in movies such as “Modern Times,” the fact that product manufacturing in factories is harsh for humans remains a severe problem even today when science and technology have advanced.
This is especially true in the assembly and inspection processes of a high-mix and low-volume production. Robot-isation of these manufacturing processes requires frequent change-overs, which makes robotisation difficult.
Many robotics researchers have challenged the problem of replacing human tasks with robots for a long time, but robots have replaced only a small portion of human tasks. This fact seems strange since humans can perform tasks with their hands without difficulty in their daily lives. The only tasks that humans find difficult are those that require subtle force and detail, while other tasks also seem to be easy for robots. In Penfield’s Homunculus diagram, the relationship between the motor and somatosensory cortices and body parts, the five fingers and the palm occupy one-third of the motor cortex and one-quarter of the sensory cortex, and the hand and fingers are called the second brain.
This suggests that the functions of the hand and fingers that we realise without thinking are actually realised based on the enormous amount of information stored in the brain. In other words, if robots are to replace human tasks, the key to research is how to efficiently realise the information stored in the brain by robots. Studying the functions of the hands and fingers of robots is a profound problem that directly relates to the study of human intelligence.
This article presents our research on machine learning and motion planning, which is intended to be applied to industrial robots. Such research is expected to create next-generation production businesses, such as variable-volume production and robot- as-a-service (RaaS).
Acquisition of human work behaviour
One strategy for robotising manufacturing processes is to acquire human work behaviour. (1) The analysis of human work behaviour is indispensable for the automation of tasks by industrial robots. In our laboratory, we segment the human work behaviour on the time axis and identify the type of work performed.
Figure 1: Acquisition of work actions by humans
Figure 2: Execution of assembly work based on human work instruction

For this problem, we propose a method that uses the information of the object that the human is grasping. Figure 1 shows a human assembling a toy for a child. For example, if the objects grasped by the human are a bolt, a wheel and a nut, we construct a hidden Markov model for each of them and identify the action based on the grasped object. By doing so, we can narrow down the variety of actions and increase the success rate of recognition.
Task and motion planning
To automate the assembly process of high-mix, low-volume production using industrial robots, the key to success is how easy it is to generate robot motions. To achieve this goal, research has been conducted on motion planning to automatically plan the motions of industrial robots for assembly and other tasks.
This section introduces a motion planning system for robot manipulation of a tool based on a human demonstration. (2) First, a human operator grasps a tool to perform a task, and a sequence of the tool’s position and posture is saved as a goal of the motion plan. Next, we divide the work into child tasks based on the stored target values. In addition, we calculate the posture of the gripper that grasps the tool by the grasp plan. Based on these results, the robot plans the motion to change the tool from one hand to another or to place the tool on the table and re-grasp it.
The motion planning of the robot takes the output sequence of postures and plans the detailed motions between sequences. In Fig. 2, a human operator manipulates the screw tightening tool and teaches the robot the movements of the screw tightening tool. Based on the results of this instruction, the robot plans and executes the screw tightening operation using the tool.
Next, we are researching how to automatically analyse an assembly manual and convert it into robot motions rather than teaching a task through a human demonstration. (3) When a person purchases furniture from IKEA or Nitori, they assemble the furniture while looking at the assembly manual. Fig. 3 shows the assembly work plan based on the assembly manual of a chair from Nitori (4) and the actual assembly work of the robot. Here, the robot recognises which parts are listed in which frames from the diagrams in the assembly manual, estimates the work operations required to assemble the parts, and constructs a graph structure called the Assembly Task Sequence Graph based on these data. Once this graph structure is built, the robot can automatically plan and execute assembly tasks based on the graph structure.
 
Figure 4: Work action planning for cooking based on cooking recipes
We have also researched planning cooking actions based on cooking recipes instead of assembly manuals and executing cooking actions based on these plans. (5) Unlike the assembly manual, the cooking recipe is basically a verbal instruction. Another feature is that there are more preparation actions, such as taking cooking utensils from the shelf than assembly actions. Here, a graph structure similar to the Assembly Task Sequence Graph described earlier is constructed by analysing cooking recipes, and work planning is performed from this structure.
Figure 4: Work action planning for cooking based on cooking recipes
Figure 4 shows the result of planning the robot’s task based on the instruction “heat a frying pan with oil over high heat and fry pork”. In this case, the robot needs to perform preparatory tasks such as picking up the frying pan and placing the pork on the pan. The robot automatically completes the preparatory tasks by first constructing a graph element and then determining what is missing in the graph element. Finally, the robot can perform the tasks described in the cooking recipe.
Summary
In this article, as examples of industrial robots using AI technology, we have focused on learning-based grasping tasks, recognition of human work actions, and work action planning. Future challenges include further consideration of the uncertainty of the environment and objects and building a system that can flexibly respond to perform procedures.

What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of a machine or computer that enables it to imitate or mimic human capabilities.
AI uses multiple technologies that equip machines to sense, comprehend, plan, act, and learn with human-like levels of intelligence. Fundamentally, AI systems perceive environments, recognize objects, contribute to decision making, solve complex problems, learn from past experiences, and imitate patterns. These abilities are combined to accomplish tasks like driving a car or recognizing faces to unlock device screens.
The AI landscape spreads across a constellation of technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and others. Such cutting-edge technologies allow computer systems to understand human language, learn from examples, and make predictions. 
Although each technology is evolving independently, when applied in combination with other technologies, data, analytics, and automation, it can revolutionize businesses and help them achieve their goals, be it optimizing supply chains or enhancing customer service.
How does AI work?
To begin with, an AI system accepts data input in the form of speech, text, image, etc. The system then processes data by applying various rules and algorithms, interpreting, predicting, and acting on the input data. Upon processing, the system provides an outcome, i.e., success or failure, on data input. The result is then assessed through analysis, discovery, and feedback. Lastly, the system uses its assessments to adjust input data, rules and algorithms, and target outcomes. This loop continues until the desired result is achieved.

Key components of AI
Intelligence has a broader context that reflects a deeper capability to comprehend the surroundings. However, for it to qualify as AI, all its components need to work in conjunction with each other. Let’s understand the key components of AI. 
Key Components of AI

Machine learning: Machine learning is an AI application that automatically learns and improves from previous sets of experiences without the requirement for explicit programming.
Deep learning: Deep learning is a subset of ML that learns by processing data with the help of artificial neural networks.
Neural network: Neural networks are computer systems that are loosely modeled on neural connections in the human brain and enable deep learning.
Cognitive computing: Cognitive computing aims to recreate the human thought process in a computer model. It seeks to imitate and improve the interaction between humans and machines by understanding human language and the meaning of images.
Natural language processing (NLP): NLP is a tool that allows computers to comprehend, recognize, interpret, and produce human language and speech.
Computer vision: Computer vision employs deep learning and pattern identification to interpret image content (graphs, tables, PDF pictures, and videos).

Types of AI
Artificial Intelligence can be broadly divided into two categories: AI based on capability and AI based on functionality. Let’s understand each type in detail.
Types of AI
Let’s first look at the types of AI based on capability.
1. Narrow AI
Narrow AI is a goal-oriented AI trained to perform a specific task. The machine intelligence that we witness all around us today is a form of narrow AI. Examples of narrow AI include Apple’s Siri and IBM’s Watson supercomputer.
Narrow AI is also referred to as weak AI as it operates within a limited and pre-defined set of parameters, constraints, and contexts. For example, use cases such as Netflix recommendations, purchase suggestions on ecommerce sites, autonomous cars, and speech & image recognition fall under the narrow AI category.
2. General AI
General AI is an AI version that performs any intellectual task with a human-like efficiency. The objective of general AI is to design a system capable of thinking for itself just like humans do. Currently, general AI is still under research, and efforts are being made to develop machines that have enhanced cognitive capabilities.
3. Super AI
Super AI is the AI version that surpasses human intelligence and can perform any task better than a human. Capabilities of a machine with super AI include thinking, reasoning, solving a puzzle, making judgments, learning, and communicating on its own. Today, super AI is a hypothetical concept but represents the future of AI.
Now, let’s understand the types of AI based on functionality.
4. Reactive machines
Reactive machines are basic AI types that do not store past experiences or memories for future actions. Such systems zero in on current scenarios and react to them based on the best possible action. Popular examples of reactive machines include IBM’s Deep Blue system and Google’s AlphaGo.
5. Limited memory machines
Limited memory machines can store and use past experiences or data for a short period of time. For example, a self-driving car can store the speeds of vehicles in its vicinity, their respective distances, speed limits, and other relevant information for it to navigate through the traffic.
6. Theory of mind
Theory of mind refers to the type of AI that can understand human emotions and beliefs and socially interact like humans. This AI type has not yet been developed but is in contention for the future.
7. Self-aware AI
Self-aware AI deals with super-intelligent machines with their consciousness, sentiments, emotions, and beliefs. Such systems are expected to be smarter than a human mind and may outperform us in assigned tasks. Self-aware AI is still a distant reality, but efforts are being made in this direction.

Goals of Artificial Intelligence
AI is primarily achieved by reverse-engineering human capabilities and traits and applying them to machines. At its core, AI reads human behavior to develop intelligent machines. Simply put, the foundational goal of AI is to design a technology that enables computer systems to work intelligently yet independently. The essential goals of AI are explained below.
Goals of Artificial Intelligence
1. Develop problem-solving ability
AI research is focused on developing efficient problem-solving algorithms that can make logical deductions and simulate human reasoning while solving complex puzzles. AI systems offer methods to deal with uncertain situations or handle the incomplete information conundrum by employing probability theory, such as a stock market prediction system.
The problem-solving ability of AI makes our lives easier as complex tasks can be assigned to reliable AI systems that can aid in simplifying critical jobs.
2. Incorporate knowledge representation
AI research revolves around the idea of knowledge representation and knowledge engineering. It relates to the representation of ‘what is known’ to machines with the ontology for a set of objects, relations, and concepts.
The representation reveals real-world information that a computer uses to solve complex real-life problems, such as diagnosing a medical ailment or interacting with humans in natural language. Researchers can use the represented information to expand the AI knowledge base and fine-tune and optimize their AI models to meet the desired goals.
3. Facilitate planning
Intelligent agents provide a way to envision the future. AI-driven planning determines a procedural course of action for a system to achieve its goals and optimizes overall performance through predictive analytics, data analysis, forecasting, and optimization models. 
With the help of AI, we can make future predictions and ascertain the consequences of our actions. Planning is relevant across robotics, autonomous systems, cognitive assistants, and cybersecurity.
4. Allow continuous learning
Learning is fundamental to AI solutions. Conceptually, learning implies the ability of computer algorithms to improve the knowledge of an AI program through observations and past experiences. Technically, AI programs process a collection of input-output pairs for a defined function and use the results to predict outcomes for new inputs. 
AI primarily uses two learning models–supervised and unsupervised–where the main distinction lies in using labeled datasets. As AI systems learn independently, they require minimal or no human intervention. For example, ML defines an automated learning process.
5. Encourage social Intelligence
Affective computing, also called ’emotion AI,’ is the branch of AI that recognizes, interprets, and simulates human experiences, feelings, and emotions. With affective computing, computers can read facial expressions, body language, and voice tones to allow AI systems to interact and socialize at the human level. Thus, research efforts are inclined toward amplifying the social intelligence of machines.
6. Promote creativity
AI promotes creativity and artificial thinking that can help humans accomplish tasks better. AI can churn through vast volumes of data, consider options and alternatives, and develop creative paths or opportunities for us to progress. 
It also offers a platform to augment and strengthen creativity, as AI can develop many novel ideas and concepts that can inspire and boost the overall creative process. For example, an AI system can provide multiple interior design options for a 3D-rendered apartment layout.
7. Achieve general intelligence
AI researchers aim to develop machines with general AI capabilities that combine all the cognitive skills of humans and perform tasks with better proficiency than us. This can boost overall productivity as tasks would be performed with greater efficiency and free humans from risky tasks such as defusing bombs.
8. Promote synergy between humans and AI
One of the critical goals of AI is to develop a synergy between AI and humans to enable them to work together and enhance each other’s capabilities rather than depend on just one system.

Key Challenges of AI
AI is poised at a juncture where its role in every industry has become almost inevitable, be it healthcare, manufacturing, robotics, autonomous systems, aviation, and plenty others. However, just because AI holds enormous potential, it does not mean that one can ignore the numerous challenges that come along with it. The critical challenges for AI that businesses can recognize and work toward resolving to propel its growth are:
Key Challenges of AI
1. AI algorithm bias
AI systems operate on trained data, implying the quality of an AI system is as good as its data. As we explore the depths of AI, the inevitable bias brought in by the data becomes evident. Bias refers to racial, gender, communal, or ethnic bias. For example, today’s algorithms determine candidates suitable for a job interview or individuals eligible for a loan. If the algorithms making such vital decisions have developed biases over time, it could lead to dreadful, unfair, and unethical consequences.
Hence, it is vital to train AI systems on unbiased data. Companies such as Microsoft and Facebook have already announced the introduction of anti-bias tools that can automatically identify bias in AI algorithms and check unfair AI perspectives.
2. Black box problem
AI algorithms are like black boxes. We have very little understanding of the inner workings of an AI algorithm. For example, we can understand what the prediction is for a predicting system, but we lack the knowledge of how the system arrived at that prediction. This makes AI systems slightly unreliable.
Techniques are being developed to resolve the black box problem, such as ‘local interpretable model-agnostic explanations’ (LIME) models. LIME provides additional information for every eventual prediction, making the algorithm trustworthy since it makes the forecast interpretable.
3. Requirement of high computing power
AI takes up immense computing power to train its models. As deep learning algorithms become popular, arranging for an extra number of cores and GPUs is essential to ensure that such algorithms work efficiently. This is why AI systems have not been deployed in areas like astronomy, where AI could be used for asteroid tracking.
Moreover, complex algorithms require supercomputers to work at total capacity to manage challenging levels of computing. Today, only a few supercomputers are available globally but seem expensive at the outset. This limits the possibility of AI implementation at higher computing levels.
4. Complicated AI integration
Integrating AI with existing corporate infrastructure is more complicated than adding plugins to websites or amending excel sheets. It is critical to ensure that current programs are compatible with AI requirements and that AI integration does not impact current output negatively. Also, an AI interface must be put in place to ease out AI infrastructure management. That being said, seamless transitioning to AI is slightly challenging for the involved parties.
5. Lack of understanding of implementation strategies
Even though AI is on the verge of transforming every industry, the lack of a clear understanding of its implementation strategies is one of the major AI challenges. Businesses need to identify areas that can benefit from AI, set realistic objectives, and incorporate feedback loops into AI systems to ensure continuous process improvement.
Additionally, corporate managers should be well-versed with current AI technologies, trends, offered possibilities, and potential limitations. This will help organizations target specific areas that can benefit from AI implementation.
6. Legal concerns
Organizations need to be wary of the legal concerns of AI. An AI system collecting sensitive data, irrespective of whether it is harmless or not, might very well be violating a state or federal law. Although the data collected by AI may be legal, organizations should consider how such data aggregation can have a negative impact.
In January 2020, the U.S. government set forth draft rules for AI regulation. Some critical legal issues raised relate to civil liability. For example, if a driverless car injures someone in an accident, who is the culprit in such a scenario? Who takes responsibility? Such use cases raise the question of criminal culpability.

Top 5 AI Trends in 2022
As we dive deeper into the digital era, AI is emerging as a powerful change catalyst for several businesses. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, new developments in AI reveal more opportunities for businesses. Here are the top five AI trends and developments that will gain momentum in 2022.
Top 5 AI Trends in 2022
1. Computer vision set to grow
In the race for AI supremacy, organizations and businesses are set to embrace computer vision technology at an unprecedented scale in 2022. According to a September 2021 survey by Gartner, organizations investing in AI are expected to make the highest planned investments in computer vision projects in 2022.
Computer vision refers to AI that uses ML algorithms to replicate human-like vision. The models are trained to identify a pattern in images and classify the objects based on recognition. For example, computer vision can scan inventory in warehouses in the retail sector. Similarly, the technology finds application in several other industries such as healthcare, agriculture & farming, manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, and more.
2. Boost to the autonomous vehicle industry
As more and more car manufacturers continue to invest in autonomous vehicles, the market penetration of driverless cars is expected to rise considerably. According to Statista’s Dec 2021 projections, the global autonomous vehicle market is estimated to be valued at around $146.4 billion in 2022, a substantial rise from $105.7 billion in 2021.
Self-driving cars enabled with computer vision are already being tested by companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Ford, GM, Aurora, and Cruise. This trend is only expected to scale in the next 12 months. In August 2021, Tesla unveiled the ‘Dojo’ chip specifically designed to process large volumes of images collected by computer vision systems embedded in its self-driving cars. Around the same time, Waymo, Google’s subsidiary, expanded its self-driving taxi services outside Arizona.
3. Chatbots and virtual assistants to get smarter
Another AI trend that is most talked about in 2022 is smarter chatbots and virtual assistants. This comes from the pandemic, as global industries are now comfortable giving their employees digital workplace experiences. Most chatbots and virtual assistants use deep learning and NLP technologies on the verge of automating routine tasks. Moreover, researchers and developers continue to add features and enhance these bots. 
For example, Amelia, a global leader in conversational AI, performs complex conversation tasks with supplemental training provided by developers. Amelia claims to achieve 90% accuracy in identifying customer intent and a customer satisfaction rate of 91%, which is at par with human assistants. Tech companies such as Nuance, IBM, and Amazon Lex are making significant efforts to improve their virtual assistance through smarter bots.
4. Solutions for metaverse
AI agents and virtual assistants will play a key role as the tech world plunges into the concept of the metaverse. Metaverse defines a virtual environment that allows users to interact with digital tools and gives them an immersive experience. In October 2021, Mark Zukerberg rebranded Facebook as ‘Meta’ and announced plans to build a metaverse.
Virtual agents are expected to use AI to enable people to connect to the virtual environment. The famous humanoid AI robot Sophia is tokenized for metaverse appearance. Developers claim that tokenized Sophia, being AI, will interact with users from anywhere, at any time, and across devices and media platforms.
Although metaverse may not reveal itself in a full-fledged version in 2022, the blend of virtual and augmented technologies and AI will continue to stay as a backbone of the metaverse. Metaverse is therefore expected to be one of the major AI research trends in the next 12 months.
5. Improved language modeling
Another AI trend that will continue to feature in 2022 is improved language modeling. Language modeling is a technology that allows computers to understand language semantics, complete sentences via word prediction, and convert text into computer codes.
Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), by OpenAI, is a comprehensive language modeling tool available today. It uses 175 billion parameters to process and generate human-like language. Also, OpenAI, in August 2021, released a better version of its tool, Codex, which parses natural language and generates programming code in response. The company is also working on the next version of GPT-3 (i.e., GPT-4), and it is expected that GPT-4 will be 500 times the size of GPT-3 in terms of the parameters that it may use to parse a language.
Apart from the trends listed above, other popular AI trends that could grab attention in 2022 include hyperautomation in modern businesses, the rise of artificial intelligence as a service (AIaaS), AI in cybersecurity, and increased sophistication in AIoT (merger of AI and the internet of things (IoT).

Research Brief
Meaningful Standards for Auditing High-Stakes Artificial Intelligence

March 14, 2022
















When hiring, many organizations use artificial intelligence tools to scan resumes and predict job-relevant skills. Colleges and universities use AI to automatically score essays, process transcripts and review extracurricular activities to predetermine who is likely to be a “good student.” With so many unique use-cases, it is important to ask: can AI tools ever be truly unbiased decision-makers? In response to claims of unfairness and bias in tools used in hiring, college admissions, predictive policing, health interventions, and more, the University of Minnesota recently developed a new set of auditing guidelines for AI tools. 
The auditing guidelines, published in the American Psychologist, were developed by Richard Landers, associate professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota, and Tara Behrend from Purdue University. They apply a century’s worth of research and professional standards for measuring personal characteristics by psychology and education researchers to ensure the fairness of AI.
The researchers developed guidelines for AI auditing by first considering the ideas of fairness and bias through three major lenses of focus:

How individuals decide if a decision was fair and unbiased
How societal legal, ethical and moral standards present fairness and bias
How individual technical domains — like computer science, statistics and psychology — define fairness and bias internally

Using these lenses, the researchers presented psychological audits as a standardized approach for evaluating the fairness and bias of AI systems that make predictions about humans across high-stakes application areas, such as hiring and college admissions. 
There are twelve components to the auditing framework across three categories that include: 

Components related to the creation of, processing done by, and predictions created by the AI
Components related to how the AI is used, who its decisions affect and why
Components related to overarching challenges: the cultural context in which the AI is used, respect for the people affected by it, and the scientific integrity of the research used by AI purveyors to support their claims

""The use of AI, especially in hiring, is a decades-old practice, but recent advances in AI sophistication have created a bit of a 'wild west' feel for AI developers,” said Landers. “There are a ton of startups now that are unfamiliar with existing ethical and legal standards for hiring people using algorithms, and they are sometimes harming people due to ignorance of established practices. We developed this framework to help inform both those companies and related regulatory authorities.""
The researchers recommend the standards they developed to be followed both by internal auditors during the development of high-stakes predictive AI technologies, and afterward by independent external auditors. Any system that claims to make meaningful recommendations about how people should be treated should be evaluated within this framework.
""Industrial psychologists have unique expertise in the evaluation of high-stakes assessments,” said Behrend. “Our goal was to educate the developers and users of AI-based assessments about existing requirements for fairness and effectiveness, and to guide the development of future policy that will protect workers and applicants.""
AI models are developing so rapidly, it can be difficult to keep up with the most appropriate way to audit a particular kind of AI system. The researchers hope to develop more precise standards for specific use cases, partner with other organizations globally interested in establishing auditing as a default approach in these situations, and work toward a better future with AI more broadly.

The World Economic Forum polled 300 global corporations in 2020 and discovered that 43% intend to cut their workforces as a result of new technologies, such as robotics and artificial intelligence. As organizations seek solutions that can outdo humans, the need to upskill continuously becomes a no-brainer. To compete effectively in the years ahead, tech workers should acquire new skills that we at Toolbox have compiled in the article below.
“Technology is going to change the workforce,” says David Burns, the senior vice president and CIO of manufacturing and supply chain at GE. “With the greater adoption of technology, in-demand skills across all jobs will change, and the skill gaps between available workers to fill those jobs will be high.”
In 2018 PwC research predicted that 38% of U.S. jobs could be performed by automation within 15 years. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are already being used to augment the capabilities of knowledge workers. Deloitte predicts that the future workforce will be made up of employees working side-by-side with contractors and AI and automation. While this human-machine collaboration will allow firms to perform work faster, many conventional positions will be eliminated.
In 2020, the World Economic Forum surveyed 300 global companies and found that 43% expect to replace their workforces with new technology, including robotics and artificial intelligence. Eighty-five million jobs may be displaced due to the shifting division of labor between humans and machines. But, at the same time, 95 million jobs will be created that will be more adapted to this new division of labor. And for these new jobs, “human skills” will become increasingly important. These are the skills that machines cannot replicate. 
See More: Key Skills Tech Employees Need for Digital Transformation
These “human skills” are predicted to be in demand until 2025, according to survey respondents for the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2020. These abilities are detailed below, and they are grouped into three categories:
Critical Thinking and Problem-solving skills Required for the Automation Age
Analytical skills and innovation
Those who can use data analytics to derive actionable insights from vast amounts of data and then use those insights for better business decision-making will be most in demand. 
Complex problem solving
Another skill that competes favorably with machines is complex problem solving, or the ability to see relationships between industries and derive solutions from them to resolve the still unmet needs of the consumer. 
Critical thinking and analysis
This skill involves one’s ability to objectively analyze a situation and come up with a logical and free of bias solution. 
Creativity, originality and initiative
Almost every list of talents for the next decade includes creative problem solving, or the ability to look at issues from many viewpoints and come up with novel and effective solutions. It involves approaching problems like a designer who considers what the consumer needs when creating and developing products and services to meet those needs. This is one human skill that even AI can not replicate. 
Reasoning, problem-solving and ideation
Reasoning based on data alone requires patience so as not to come to false conclusions and a deep understanding of AI-driven technologies. This skill demands the employee to extract relevant information from large amounts of data and come to a conclusion that may be utilized to construct thoughts that will guide an organization’s future path.

Self-management Skills that IT Works Should Master
Learning techniques and active learning
According to the World Economic Forum, by 2025, half of all workers will require retraining. Moreover, 94% of company owners polled want employees to learn new skills on the job. As a result, the most sought-after employees will be those who are ready and able to retrain and reinvent themselves throughout their careers, rather than those who have spent years learning complicated skills like data analysis or software development. IT leaders will be expected to constantly learn about new technologies that will most likely benefit their organizations.
Resilience, stress management, flexibility
The ability to control your emotions via self-awareness has been mentioned as a necessity for future professions. Workers in the digital world must adapt to the quickly changing environment. As Kim Smith, venture strategist and chief innovation officer at IBM, observes: You can have someone who’s top-tier and technically capable, but if they’re entrenched and inflexible and their emotional intelligence quotient is not wired to be OK with change and failure, that one individual can be toxic to the organization as a whole.”
Working with People’s Skills
Leadership
To guide their team and their company in the correct path, organizations that embrace and benefit from the newest technology developments will require competent and adaptable leaders who can take on a variety of tasks and have strong communication and team cooperation abilities. As employers look to replace their current workforce with remote workers, communication and collaboration skills will become more demanded. Burns further advises that IT leaders “need the ability to look beyond the day-to-day work you have to do. It’s far better to spend 5% of your time looking to the future than 100% of your time dealing with what’s in your inbox.”
Social influence
Employers are also seeking workers who can effectively use social networks and applications to communicate the organization’s product offerings and promote brand awareness. Social media communication skills could include creating a YouTube video to demonstrate a process or product to sharing one’s ideas or receiving or giving feedback through communication with a wide community of people through the Internet. Workers will also need to know how to use social networks to work collaboratively, virtually, and at a distance with colleagues and clients. 
Learn, Unlearn and Relearn
As futurist Alvin Toffler once said, “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn.” Technical skills quickly lose value as new technologies come online to replace them. The soft skills set humans apart from the machines that can replace them. Determine where you stand in terms of these soft skills and look for ways to improve them to keep ahead of your future machine competition. Keep abreast of new training opportunities, especially with forward-looking organizations that can provide you with access to training and allow you to rotate in and out of different roles in various departments. Employees who can readily learn, adapt, and grow to meet new technological trends will survive and thrive in the digital era.

Two identical black and white pictures of murky shapes sit side-by-side on a computer screen. On the left side, Ismail Baris Turkbey, M.D., a radiologist with 15 years of experience, has outlined an area where the fuzzy shapes represent what he believes is a creeping, growing prostate cancer. On the other side of the screen, an artificial intelligence (AI) computer program has done the same—and the results are nearly identical.
The black and white image is an MRI scan from someone with prostate cancer, and the AI program has analyzed thousands of them.
“The [AI] model finds the prostate and outlines cancer-suspicious areas without any human supervision,” Dr. Turkbey explains. His hope is that the AI will help less experienced radiologists find prostate cancer when it’s present and dismiss anything that may be mistaken for cancer.
This model is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the intersection of artificial intelligence and cancer research. While the potential applications seem endless, a lot of that progress has centered around tools for cancer imaging. 
From x-rays of whole organs to microscope pictures of cancer cells, doctors use imaging tests in many ways: finding cancer at its earliest stages, determining the stage of a tumor, seeing if treatment is working, and monitoring whether cancer has returned after treatment. 
Over the past several years, researchers have developed AI tools that have the potential to make cancer imaging faster, more accurate, and even more informative. And that’s generated a lot of excitement.
“There’s a lot of hype [around AI], but there’s a lot of research that’s going into it as well,” said Stephanie Harmon, Ph.D., a data scientist in NCI’s Molecular Imaging Branch. 
That research, experts say, includes addressing questions about whether these tools are ready to leave research labs and enter doctors’ offices, whether they will actually help patients, and whether that benefit will reach all—or only some—patients.
What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence refers to computer programs, or algorithms, that use data to make decisions or predictions. To build an algorithm, scientists might create a set of rules, or instructions, for the computer to follow so it can analyze data and make a decision. 
For example, Dr. Turkbey and his colleagues used existing rules about how prostate cancer appears on an MRI scan. They then trained their algorithm using thousands of MRI studies—some from people known to have prostate cancer, and some from people who did not.
With other artificial intelligence approaches, like machine learning, the algorithm teaches itself how to analyze and interpret data. As such, machine learning algorithms may pick up on patterns that are not readily discernable to the human eye or brain. And as these algorithms are exposed to more new data, their ability to learn and interpret the data improves. 
Researchers have also used deep learning, a type of machine learning, in cancer imaging applications. Deep learning refers to algorithms that classify information in ways much like the human brain does. Deep learning tools use “artificial neural networks” that mimic how our brain cells take in, process, and react to signals from the rest of our body. 
Research on AI for cancer imaging
Doctors use cancer imaging tests to answer a range of questions, like: Is it cancer or a harmless lump? If it is cancer, how fast is it growing? How far has it spread? Is it growing back after treatment? Studies suggest that AI has the potential to improve the speed, accuracy, and reliability with which doctors answer those questions. 



 
Artificial Intelligence Aids Brain Tumor Diagnosis
Approach diagnoses cancer in under 3 minutes during surgery.



“AI can automate assessments and tasks that humans currently can do but take a lot of time,” said Hugo Aerts, Ph.D., of Harvard Medical School. After the AI gives a result, “a radiologist simply needs to review what the AI has done—did it make the correct assessment?” Dr. Aerts continued. That automation is expected to save time and costs, but that still needs to be proven, he added.
In addition, AI could make image interpretation—a highly subjective task—more straightforward and reliable, Dr. Aerts noted.
Complex tasks that rely on “a human making an interpretation of an image—say, a radiologist, a dermatologist, a pathologist —that’s where we see enormous breakthroughs being made with deep learning,” he said.
But what scientists are most excited about is the potential for AI to go beyond what humans can currently do themselves. AI can “see” things that we humans can’t, and can find complex patterns and relationships between very different kinds of data.
“AI is great at doing this—at going beyond human performance for a lot of tasks,” Dr. Aerts said. But, in this case, it is often unclear how the AI reaches its conclusion, so it’s difficult for doctors and researchers to check if the tool is performing correctly. 
Finding cancer early
Tests like mammograms and Pap tests are used to regularly check people for signs of cancer or precancerous cells that can turn into cancer. The goal is to catch and treat cancer early, before it spreads or even before it forms at all. 
Scientists have developed AI tools to aid screening tests for several kinds of cancer, including breast cancer. AI-based computer programs have been used to help doctors interpret mammograms for more than 20 years, but research in this area is quickly evolving. 
One group created an AI algorithm that can help determine how often someone should get screened for breast cancer. The model uses a person’s mammogram images to predict their risk of developing breast cancer in the next 5 years. In various tests, the model was more accurate than the current tools used to predict breast cancer risk.
NCI researchers have built and tested a deep learning algorithm that can identify cervical precancers that should be removed or treated. In some low-resource settings, health workers screen for cervical precancer by inspecting the cervix with a small camera. Although this method is simple and sustainable, it is not very reliable or accurate. 
Mark Schiffman, M.D., M.P.H., of NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and his colleagues designed an algorithm to improve the ability to find cervical precancers with the visual inspection method. In a 2019 study, the algorithm performed better than trained experts.
For colon cancer, several AI tools have been shown in clinical trials to improve the detection of precancerous growths called adenomas. However, because only a small percentage of adenomas turn into cancer, some experts are concerned that such AI tools could lead to unnecessary treatments and extra tests for many patients. 
Detecting cancer 
AI has also shown the potential to improve cancer detection in people who have symptoms. The AI model developed by Dr. Turkbey and his colleagues in NCI’s Center for Cancer Research, for instance, could make it easier for radiologists to pick out potentially aggressive prostate cancer on a relatively new kind of prostate MRI scan, called multiparametric MRI.

Although multiparametric MRI generates a more detailed picture of the prostate than a regular MRI, radiologists typically need years of practice to read these scans accurately, leading to disagreements between radiologists looking at the same scan.
The NCI team’s AI model “can make [the learning] curve easier for practicing radiologists and can minimize the error rate,” Dr. Turkbey said. The AI model could serve as “a virtual expert” to guide less-experienced radiologists learning to use multiparametric MRI, he added.
For lung cancer, several deep learning AI models have been developed to help doctors find lung cancer on CT scans. Some noncancerous changes in the lungs look a lot like cancer on CT scans, leading to a high rate of false-positive test results that indicate a person has lung cancer when they really don’t. 
Experts think that AI may better distinguish lung cancer from noncancerous changes on CT scans, potentially cutting the number of false positives and sparing some people from unneeded stress, follow-up tests, and procedures. 
For example, a team of researchers trained a deep learning algorithm to find lung cancer and to specifically avoid other changes that look like cancer. In lab tests, the algorithm was very good at ignoring noncancerous changes that look like cancerExit Disclaimer and good at finding cancer.
Choosing cancer treatment 
Doctors also use imaging tests to get important information about cancer, such as how fast it is growing, whether it has spread, and whether it is likely to come back after treatment. This information can help doctors choose the most appropriate treatment for their patients. 
A number of studies suggest that AI has the potential to gather such prognostic information—and maybe even more—from imaging scans, and with greater precision than humans currently can. For example, Dr. Harmon and her colleagues created a deep learning model that can determine the likelihood that a patient with bladder cancer might need other treatments in addition to surgery.
Doctors estimate that around 50% of people with tumors in the bladder muscle (muscle-invasive bladder cancer) have clusters of cancer cells that have spread beyond the bladder but are too small to detect with traditional toolsExit Disclaimer. If these hidden cells aren’t removed, they can continue growing after surgery, causing a relapse. 
Chemotherapy can kill these microscopic clusters and prevent the cancer from coming back after surgery. But clinical trials have shown that it’s hard to determine which patients need chemotherapy in addition to surgery, Dr. Harmon said. 
“What we would like to do is use this model before patients undergo any sort of treatment, to tell which patients have cancer with a high likelihood of spreading, so doctors can make informed decisions,” she explained.

The model looks at digital images of primary tumor tissue to predict whether there are microscopic clusters of cancer in nearby lymph nodes. In a 2020 study, the deep learning model proved to be more accurate than the standard way of predicting whether bladder cancer has spread, which is based on a combination of factors including the patient’s age and certain characteristics of the tumor. 
More and more, genetic information about the patients’ cancer is being used to help select the most appropriate treatment. Scientists in China created a deep learning tool to predict the presence of key gene mutations from images of liver cancer tissue—something pathologists can’t do by just looking at the images.
Their tool is an example of AI that works in mysterious ways: The scientists who built the algorithm don’t know how it senses which gene mutations are present in the tumor.
Are AI tools for cancer imaging ready for the real world?
Although scientists are churning out AI tools for cancer imaging, the field is still nascent and many questions about the practical applications of these tools remain unanswered.



 
Using AI to Classify Lung Cancer Types
The computer program can differentiate the two most common forms of lung cancer.



While hundreds of algorithms have been proven accurate in early tests, most haven’t reached the next phase of testingExit Disclaimer that ensures they are ready for the real world, Dr. Harmon said.  
That testing, known as external or independent validation, “tells us how generalizable our algorithm is. Meaning, how useful is it on a totally new patient? How does it perform on patients from different [medical] centers or different scanners?” Dr. Harmon explained. In other words, does the AI tool work accurately beyond the data it was trained on?
AI algorithms that pass rigorous validation testing in diverse groups of people from various areas of the world could be used more widely, and therefore help more people, she added.
In addition to validation, Dr. Turkbey noted, clinical studies also need to show that AI tools actually help patients, either by preventing people from getting cancer, helping them live longer or have a better quality of life, or saving them time or money. 
But even after that, Dr. Aerts said, a major question about AI is: “How do we make sure that these algorithms keep on working and performing well for years and years?” For example, he said, new scanners could change features of the image that an AI tool relies on to make predictions or interpretations, he explained. And that could change their performance. 
There are also questions about how AI tools will be regulated. Upwards of 60 AI-based medical devices or algorithms have earned FDA approval as of 2020Exit Disclaimer. But even after they are approved, some machine learning algorithms shift as they are exposed to new data. In 2021, FDA issued a framework for monitoring AI technologies that have the ability to adapt.
There are also concerns about the transparency of some AI tools. With some algorithms, like the one that can predict gene mutations in liver tumors, scientists don’t know how it reaches its conclusion—a conundrum known as the “black box problem.” Experts say this lack of transparency prohibits critical checks for biases and inaccuracies. 
A recent study, for example, showed that a machine learning algorithm trained to predict cancer outcomes zeroed in on the hospital where the tumor image was taken, rather than the patient’s tumor biology. Although that algorithm isn’t used in any medical settings, other tools trained in the same way could have the same inaccuracy, the researchers warned.
There are also worries that AI could worsen gaps in health outcomes between privileged and disadvantaged groups by exacerbating biases that are already baked into our medical system and research processes, said Irene Dankwa-Mullan, M.D., M.P.H., deputy chief health equity officer of IBM Watson Health. 
These biases are deeply embedded in the data used to create AI models, she explained at the 2021 American Association for Cancer Research Science of Cancer Health Disparities conference. 
For instance, a handful of medical algorithms have recently been shown to be less accurate for Black people than for White people. These potentially dangerous shortcomings stem from the fact that the algorithms were mainly trained and validated on data from White patients, experts have noted.
On the other hand, some experts think AI could improve access to cancer care by bringing expert-level care to hospitals that lack specialists. 
“What [AI] can do is, in a setting where there are physicians who maybe don’t have as much expertise, potentially it can bring their performance up to an expert level,” explained Dr. Harmon.
Some AI tools could even bypass the need for sophisticated equipment. The deep learning algorithm for cervical cancer screening developed by Dr. Schiffman, for example, relies on cell phones or digital cameras and low-cost materials. 
Despite these concerns, most researchers are optimistic for the future of AI in cancer care. Dr. Aerts, for example, believes these hurdles are surmountable with more work and collaboration between experts in science, medicine, government, and community implementation.
“I think [AI technologies] will eventually be introduced into the clinic because the performance is just too good and it’s a waste if we don’t,” he said.

  If you want to ride the next big wave in AI, grab a transformer.
They’re not the shape-shifting toy robots on TV or the trash-can-sized tubs on telephone poles.
So, What’s a Transformer Model?
A transformer model is a neural network that learns context and thus meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data like the words in this sentence.
Transformer models apply an evolving set of mathematical techniques, called attention or self-attention, to detect subtle ways even distant data elements in a series influence and depend on each other.
First described in a 2017 paper from Google, transformers are among the newest and one of the most powerful classes of models invented to date. They’re driving a wave of advances in machine learning some have dubbed transformer AI.
Stanford researchers called transformers “foundation models” in an August 2021 paper because they see them driving a paradigm shift in AI. The “sheer scale and scope of foundation models over the last few years have stretched our imagination of what is possible,” they wrote.
What Can Transformer Models Do?
Transformers are translating text and speech in near real-time, opening meetings and classrooms to diverse and hearing-impaired attendees.
They’re helping researchers understand the chains of genes in DNA and amino acids in proteins in ways that can speed drug design.
Transformers, sometimes called foundation models, are already being used with many data sources for a host of applications.
Transformers can detect trends and anomalies to prevent fraud, streamline manufacturing, make online recommendations or improve healthcare.
People use transformers every time they search on Google or Microsoft Bing.
The Virtuous Cycle of Transformer AI
Any application using sequential text, image or video data is a candidate for transformer models.
That enables these models to ride a virtuous cycle in transformer AI. Created with large datasets, transformers make accurate predictions that drive their wider use, generating more data that can be used to create even better models.
Stanford researchers say transformers mark the next stage of AI’s development, what some call the era of transformer AI.
“Transformers made self-supervised learning possible, and AI jumped to warp speed,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang in his keynote address this week at GTC.
Transformers Replace CNNs, RNNs
Transformers are in many cases replacing convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNNs and RNNs), the most popular types of deep learning models just five years ago.
Indeed, 70 percent of arXiv papers on AI posted in the last two years mention transformers. That’s a radical shift from a 2017 IEEE study that reported RNNs and CNNs were the most popular models for pattern recognition.
No Labels, More Performance
Before transformers arrived, users had to train neural networks with large, labeled datasets that were costly and time-consuming to produce. By finding patterns between elements mathematically, transformers eliminate that need, making available the trillions of images and petabytes of text data on the web and in corporate databases.
In addition, the math that transformers use lends itself to parallel processing, so these models can run fast.
Transformers now dominate popular performance leaderboards like SuperGLUE, a benchmark developed in 2019 for language-processing systems.
How Transformers Pay Attention
Like most neural networks, transformer models are basically large encoder/decoder blocks that process data.
Small but strategic additions to these blocks (shown in the diagram below) make transformers uniquely powerful.
A look under the hood from a presentation by Aidan Gomez, one of eight co-authors of the 2017 paper that defined transformers.
Transformers use positional encoders to tag data elements coming in and out of the network. Attention units follow these tags, calculating a kind of algebraic map of how each element relates to the others.
Attention queries are typically executed in parallel by calculating a matrix of equations in what’s called multi-headed attention.
With these tools, computers can see the same patterns humans see.
Self-Attention Finds Meaning
For example, in the sentence:
She poured water from the pitcher to the cup until it was full. 
We know “it” refers to the cup, while in the sentence:
She poured water from the pitcher to the cup until it was empty.
We know “it” refers to the pitcher.
“Meaning is a result of relationships between things, and self-attention is a general way of learning relationships,” said Ashish Vaswani, a former senior staff research scientist at Google Brain who led work on the seminal 2017 paper.
“Machine translation was a good vehicle to validate self-attention because you needed short- and long-distance relationships among words,” said Vaswani.
“Now we see self-attention is a powerful, flexible tool for learning,” he added.
How Transformers Got Their Name
Attention is so key to transformers the Google researchers almost used the term as the name for their 2017 model. Almost.
“Attention Net didn’t sound very exciting,” said Vaswani, who started working with neural nets in 2011.
.Jakob Uszkoreit, a senior software engineer on the team, came up with the name Transformer.
“I argued we were transforming representations, but that was just playing semantics,” Vaswani said.
The Birth of Transformers
In the paper for the 2017 NeurIPS conference, the Google team described their transformer and the accuracy records it set for machine translation.
Thanks to a basket of techniques, they trained their model in just 3.5 days on eight NVIDIA GPUs, a small fraction of the time and cost of training prior models. They trained it on datasets with up to a billion pairs of words.
“It was an intense three-month sprint to the paper submission date,” recalled Aidan Gomez, a Google intern in 2017 who contributed to the work.
“The night we were submitting, Ashish and I pulled an all-nighter at Google,” he said. “I caught a couple hours sleep in one of the small conference rooms, and I woke up just in time for the submission when someone coming in early to work opened the door and hit my head.”
It was a wakeup call in more ways than one.
“Ashish told me that night he was convinced this was going to be a huge deal, something game changing. I wasn’t convinced, I thought it would be a modest gain on a benchmark, but it turned out he was very right,” said Gomez, now CEO of startup Cohere that’s providing a language processing service based on transformers.
A Moment for Machine Learning
Vaswani recalls the excitement of seeing the results surpass similar work published by a Facebook team using CNNs.
“I could see this would likely be an important moment in machine learning,” he said.
A year later, another Google team tried processing text sequences both forward and backward with a transformer. That helped capture more relationships among words, improving the model’s ability to understand the meaning of a sentence.
Their Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model set 11 new records and became part of the algorithm behind Google search.
Within weeks, researchers around the world were adapting BERT for use cases across many languages and industries “because text is one of the most common data types companies have,” said Anders Arpteg, a 20-year veteran of machine learning research.
Putting Transformers to Work
Soon transformer models were being adapted for science and healthcare.
DeepMind, in London, advanced the understanding of proteins, the building blocks of life, using a transformer called AlphaFold2, described in a recent Nature article. It processed amino acid chains like text strings to set a new watermark for describing how proteins fold, work that could speed drug discovery.
AstraZeneca and NVIDIA developed MegaMolBART, a transformer tailored for drug discovery. It’s a version of the pharmaceutical company’s MolBART transformer, trained on a large, unlabeled database of chemical compounds using the NVIDIA Megatron framework for building large-scale transformer models.
Reading Molecules, Medical Records
“Just as AI language models can learn the relationships between words in a sentence, our aim is that neural networks trained on molecular structure data will be able to learn the relationships between atoms in real-world molecules,” said Ola Engkvist, head of molecular AI, discovery sciences and R&D at AstraZeneca, when the work was announced last year.

Separately, the University of Florida’s academic health center collaborated with NVIDIA researchers to create GatorTron. The transformer model aims to extract insights from massive volumes of clinical data to accelerate medical research.
Transformers Grow Up
Along the way, researchers found larger transformers performed better.
For example, researchers from the Rostlab at the Technical University of Munich, which helped pioneer work at the intersection of AI and biology, used natural-language processing to understand proteins. In 18 months, they graduated from using RNNs with 90 million parameters to transformer models with 567 million parameters.
Rostlab researchers show language models trained without labeled samples picking up the signal of a protein sequence.
The OpenAI lab showed bigger is better with its Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT). The latest version, GPT-3, has 175 billion parameters, up from 1.5 billion for GPT-2.
With the extra heft, GPT-3 can respond to a user’s query even on tasks it was not specifically trained to handle. It’s already being used by companies including Cisco, IBM and Salesforce.
Tale of a Mega Transformer
NVIDIA and Microsoft hit a high watermark in November, announcing the Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation model (MT-NLG) with 530 billion parameters. It debuted along with a new framework, NVIDIA NeMo Megatron, that aims to let any business create its own billion- or trillion-parameter transformers to power custom chatbots, personal assistants and other AI applications that understand language.
MT-NLG had its public debut as the brain for TJ, the Toy Jensen avatar that gave part of the keynote at NVIDIA’s November 2021 GTC.
“When we saw TJ answer questions — the power of our work demonstrated by our CEO — that was exciting,” said Mostofa Patwary, who led the NVIDIA team that trained the model.
“Megatron helps me answer all those tough questions Jensen throws at me,” TJ said at GTC 2022.
Creating such models is not for the faint of heart. MT-NLG was trained using hundreds of billions of data elements, a process that required thousands of GPUs running for weeks.
“Training large transformer models is expensive and time-consuming, so if you’re not successful the first or second time, projects might be canceled,” said Patwary.
Trillion-Parameter Transformers
Today, many AI engineers are working on trillion-parameter transformers and applications for them.
“We’re constantly exploring how these big models can deliver better applications. We also investigate in what aspects they fail, so we can build even better and bigger ones,” Patwary said.
To provide the computing muscle those models need, our latest accelerator — the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU — packs a Transformer Engine and supports a new FP8 format. That speeds training while preserving accuracy.
With those and other advances, “transformer model training can be reduced from weeks to days” said Huang at GTC.
MoE Means More for Transformers
Last year, Google researchers described the Switch Transformer, one of the first trillion-parameter models. It uses AI sparsity, a complex mixture-of experts (MoE) architecture and other advances to drive performance gains in language processing and up to 7x increases in pre-training speed.
The encoder for the Switch Transformer, the first model to have up to a trillion parameters.
For its part, Microsoft Azure worked with NVIDIA to implement an MoE transformer for its Translator service.
Tackling Transformers’ Challenges
Now some researchers aim to develop simpler transformers with fewer parameters that deliver performance similar to the largest models.
“I see promise in retrieval-based models that I’m super excited about because they could bend the curve,” said Gomez, of Cohere, noting the Retro model from DeepMind as an example.
Retrieval-based models learn by submitting queries to a database. “It’s cool because you can be choosy about what you put in that knowledge base,” he said.
In the race for higher performance, transformer models have grown larger.
The ultimate goal is to “make these models learn like humans do from context in the real world with very little data,” said Vaswani, now co-founder of a stealth AI startup.
He imagines future models that do more computation upfront so they need less data and sport better ways users can give them feedback.
“Our goal is to build models that will help people in their everyday lives,” he said of his new venture.
Safe, Responsible Models
Other researchers are studying ways to eliminate bias or toxicity if models amplify wrong or harmful language. For example, Stanford created the Center for Research on Foundation Models to explore these issues.
“These are important problems that need to be solved for safe deployment of models,” said Shrimai Prabhumoye, a research scientist at NVIDIA who’s among many across the industry working in the area.
“Today, most models look for certain words or phrases, but in real life these issues may come out subtly, so we have to consider the whole context,” added Prabhumoye.
“That’s a primary concern for Cohere, too,” said Gomez. “No one is going to use these models if they hurt people, so it’s table stakes to make the safest and most responsible models.”
Beyond the Horizon
Vaswani imagines a future where self-learning, attention-powered transformers approach the holy grail of AI.
“We have a chance of achieving some of the goals people talked about when they coined the term ‘general artificial intelligence’ and I find that north star very inspiring,” he said.
“We are in a time where simple methods like neural networks are giving us an explosion of new capabilities.”
Transformer training and inference will get significantly accelerated with the NVIDIA H100 GPU.

What Is Narrow Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) refers to the goal-oriented version of AI designed to better perform a single task such as tracking weather updates, generating data science reports by analyzing raw data, or playing games such as poker, chess, etc.
Narrow Artificial Intelligence
Artificial narrow intelligence systems are programmed to attend one task at a time by pulling in information from a specific dataset. In other words, such systems do not go beyond the assigned tasks.
Unlike general AI, narrow AI lacks self-awareness, consciousness, emotions, and genuine intelligence that can match human intelligence. While such systems may appear sophisticated and intelligent, they operate under a predetermined and predefined set of parameters, constraints, and contexts.
The machine intelligence that surrounds us today is a part of the same narrow AI. Examples include Google Assistant, Siri, Google Translate, and other natural language processing tools. Although these tools can interact with us and process and comprehend human language, they are termed as weak AI as they lack the fluidity or flexibility to think for themselves as humans do. 
Let’s consider Siri. It is not a conscious machine. Instead, it is only a tool performing tasks. When we converse with Siri, it processes the human language, enters it into the system’s search engine like Google, and provides results.
When someone poses abstract questions such as how to handle a personal problem or deal with a traumatic experience to tools like Alexa or Google Assistant, they either give vague responses that lack sense or provide links to articles on the internet that presumably address the issue at hand. 
On the contrary, when we ask a fundamental question such as “what is the temperature outside”, we tend to get an accurate response from virtual assistants such as Siri. This is because answering such basic questions is within the range of Siri’s intelligence for which it is designed.
Moreover, even something as complex as self-driving cars falls under weak AI, as they are trained to navigate the surrounding area with the help of an annotated driving dataset. A typical self-driving vehicle comprises multiple ANI systems that are critical for its smooth movement in a highly complex urban environment.

Advantages and Challenges of Narrow AI
Current AI and intelligent machines come under the ‘weak AI’ category. However, this does not discount the benefits of narrow AI, as it is one of the most significant human innovations and intellectual accomplishments.
First, let’s understand the advantages of narrow AI.
Advantages of Narrow AI
1. Facilitates faster decision making
Artificial narrow intelligence systems facilitate faster decision-making as they process data and complete tasks significantly quicker than humans. As a result, they allow us to boost overall productivity & efficiency and thereby improve the quality of life. For example, artificial narrow intelligence systems such as IBM’s Watson assist doctors in making quick data-driven decisions by harnessing the power of AI. This has made healthcare better, faster, and safer than ever before.
2. Relieves humans from mundane tasks
Developments in narrow AI have ensured that humans are relieved from several dull, routine, and mundane tasks. It has made our day-to-day lives easier, right from ordering food online with the help of Siri to reducing the effort of analyzing volumes of data to produce results.
Additionally, technologies such as self-driving cars have relieved us from the stress and burden of being stuck in traffic for long and instead provided us with more leisure time to carry out activities or tasks of our interests.
3. Serves as a building block for the development of more intelligent AI
Artificial narrow intelligence systems serve as the foundation for the eventual development of more intelligent AI versions such as general AI and super AI. Speech recognition allows computers to convert sounds to text with significant accuracy, while computer vision enables the recognition and classification of objects in video streams. Currently, Google is using AI to caption millions of YouTube videos.
Today, AI-powered computer vision is already used to unlock screens and tag friends online. Concurrently, the autonomous vehicle sector is exploring the field of ‘affective AI’ where the system can learn non-verbal nuances (feelings, emotions), and prompt sleepy truck drivers to stay alert and pay attention while driving. All these foundational technologies are only paving the way for future self-aware and conscious versions of AI.
4. Performs single tasks better than humans
Narrow AI systems can perform single tasks far better than humans. For example, a narrow AI system programmed to detect cancer from X-ray or ultrasound images might be able to quickly spot a cancerous mass in a set of images with substantially higher accuracy as compared to a trained radiologist.
Another example is that of a predictive maintenance system used at manufacturing plants. The system collects and analyzes incoming sensor data in real-time to predict whether a machine is about to fail. Narrow AI automates this task. The entire process is much quicker and is virtually impossible for an individual or group of individuals to match as far as speed and accuracy are concerned.
The overall performance, speed, and accuracy of narrow AI supersede that of human beings. That being said, the AI community faces several critical challenges in broadening the scope of narrow AI.
Now, let’s go over the challenges that narrow AI faces. 
Challenges of Narrow AI
1. Absence of explainable AI
One of the essential requirements for the progress of artificial intelligence is the practice of creating AI that is less of a black box. This implies that we must be better positioned to understand what’s happening in neural networks. Today’s AI systems, such as one recommending books to read, employ the black-box approach effectively. The deep learning algorithm used in such cases considers millions of data points as inputs and correlates specific features to provide a result. The underlying process is self-directed and challenging for programmers and experts in the domain to interpret.
However, when people are making high-stake business decisions that involve huge investments by relying on AI models, such a black-box approach can be detrimental as the inputs and operations of the system are not visible to the concerned parties. Thus, one of the key challenges is creating more explainable AI devoid of the black-box approach.
2. Need for impenetrable security
Neural networks are exploited extensively by narrow AI. However, it is vital to understand that AI is quite fragile– it is possible to inject noise and fool the system. For example, an attacker can hack into the software system of autonomous cars and change the AI program code so that the program may mistake a bus on the road for an elephant. This can have serious implications and ramifications. A hacker can also hijack the entire network of autonomous vehicles operating in an area and eventually wipe out a billion-dollar investment.
Moreover, a single intrusion into a neural network can disrupt the operations of several systems reliant on that same network. Additionally, as neural networks are subject to attacks, providing impenetrable security remains a crucial challenge.
3. Need to learn from small data
AI models are trained on data derived from examples–implying that examples are the real currency to today’s AI. For AI to evolve further, it must be prepared to learn more from less data. AI should be able to transfer its learning from one neural network to other networks by leveraging prior knowledge.
AI blends learning and reasoning. Although today’s AI has made significant progress in learning and accumulating knowledge, applying reason to that knowledge remains a challenge. For example, a retailer’s customer service chatbot could answer questions related to store hours, product prices, and the store’s cancellation policies. 
However, a tricky question about why product X is better than a similar product Y may freeze the bot. Although creators can program bots to answer such questions, teaching an AI to apply reasoning by itself remains a problem for most scientists and experts.
4. Prone to bias
Today’s AI systems are prone to bias as they often give incorrect results without a plausible explanation. Complex AI models are continually trained on vast amounts of data that contain biases or inaccurate information. As a result, a model trained on such a biased dataset could consider the incorrect information trustworthy and make skewed predictions.
As AI systems learn from past examples, consider a system responsible for making credit decisions. The system might consider ‘not offering credit to women or minorities’ as appropriate based on previous patterns. Thus, verifying and inspecting that the examples used by the system are free of biases remains a critical challenge.
Moreover, as narrow AI lacks the ‘common sense’ aspect, or a sense of fairness and equity, handling training bias requires substantial planning and design work.
5. Subject to human failings
Narrow AI largely relies on humans to put to task. Hence, it is prone to human failings, such as people setting overly ambitious business targets or prioritizing tasks incorrectly.
Consider a situation where a human wrongly defines a task. In this case, irrespective of how long a machine works or the number of computations it performs, the end result will still be a false conclusion. Therefore, narrow AI’s reliance on fallible humans is a huge challenge for experts in the domain.

Top 10 Best Practices for Narrow AI Development in 2022
AI development is contributing immensely to improving people’s lives around the world, right from business operations, aviation, manufacturing, healthcare to education. As AI systems become an integral part of every industry vertical, discussions on the best ways to incorporate fairness, interpretability, privacy, and security into these systems are being opened up.
Here are the top 10 best practices for narrow AI development. 
Best Practices for Narrow AI Development
1. Have a human-centric design approach
The true impact of an AI system’s predictions, recommendations, and decisions can be evaluated by factoring in how actual end-users experience the system. The following routines can be considered to keep a check on your narrow AI development:

Use augmentation and assistance as needed. While addressing several users, AI systems can consider producing a single answer in situations where the solution is highly likely to satisfy a diverse set of users and use cases. It may be appropriate to suggest a few options to end-users in other cases.
Before diving into full deployment, potential adverse feedback can be incorporated into the design process. This can be followed by live testing and iteration for smaller traffic.
Involve a diverse set of users and consider multiple use-case scenarios that allow you to incorporate feedback throughout the project development cycle. Such practice considers a variety of user perspectives while building an AI project, thereby increasing the number of people who can benefit from the technology.

2. Consider metrics to assess training and monitoring
To understand the tradeoffs between several errors and user experiences of the AI system, one should consider several essential metrics rather than opting for a single one.

The metrics can include feedback from user surveys, variables that track overall system performance, factors that keep a check on short- and long-term product health such as users’ click-through rate, and quantities that monitor false positive and false negative rates across different categories of the AI product.
One must ensure that the metrics selected are based on the context and goals of the AI system. For example, a fire alarm system should have high recall values, irrespective of whether the system returns occasional false alarms.

3. Ensure periodic examination of raw data
Analyzing raw data can help you better understand the working of ML models as they reflect the data that they are trained on. In cases where sensitive raw data is concerned, you can instead focus on understanding the input data while respecting privacy.

By examining raw data, you can ascertain whether the data contains any missing values or incorrect labels. You can figure out whether the information is sampled in a manner that represents all the users (i.e., users of all ages) of your AI system.
Determining performance during training and serving is a persistent challenge. Thus, during the training phase, you should look for possible skews and address them immediately, including adjusting the training data or restructuring the objective function.
Data bias should be addressed by thoroughly analyzing the raw data going into the AI system.

4. Consider the limitations of the AI dataset and model
Understanding the limitations of the dataset and AI model is vital to keep track of the loopholes of narrow AI.

A correlation detecting AI model should not be used to make inferences. For example, your AI model may learn that people who buy running shoes are mostly overweight. However, this does not mean that a user who buys a pair of running shoes will become overweight.
ML models predominantly work on training data. Hence, it is important to clarify the scope and coverage of training. For example, a chair detector trained with stock photos will work fine. However, the model might falter when tested with cellphone photos clicked by users.
Limitations should be communicated to end-users. For example, if your app uses ML to recognize specific butterflies, you must communicate that the model was trained on a small set of images taken from a particular region. By informing users, you would increase your chances of receiving better feedback for the feature or application you provided.

5. Ensure the AI system works as intended by performing tests
To ensure that the designed AI system works as intended and can be trusted, you must undertake quality test practices.

Unit tests should be conducted to test each component of the AI system in isolation.
Conducting integration tests will enable you to learn how individual ML components interact with other system components.
Conduct iterative user tests to incorporate users’ needs in the AI product development cycles.
Build quality checks into the system to avoid triggering an immediate response in situations of unintended system failures. For example, if an important feature unexpectedly goes down for a predictive AI model, the AI system may refrain from generating an output prediction.

6. Regularly monitor and update the AI system post-deployment
Regular monitoring will ensure that the AI model considers real-world performances and incorporates user feedback to update the AI system.

The AI product should have a clear roadmap that allows it to buy time to address and fix any issues.
Fixing issues for both the short and long term is crucial for AI systems. A short-term fix of blocklisting may offer a quick solution; however, it might not fare well in the long run. Hence, balancing short- and long-term fixes can be better than focusing on just one.
Understanding how the update may affect the overall system quality and user experience is essential. Hence, before jumping into the updates, you must analyze and understand the difference between the candidate and deployed models.

7. Ensure fairness
Today, AI systems are used across industry sectors to perform critical tasks such as predicting the severity of a medical condition and matching profiles to jobs or marriage partners. The risk here is that any unfairness in such computerized decision-making systems can have a wide-scale impact. Hence, as AI penetrates across societies, it is crucial to design a fair and inclusive model for all.

Analyze how the technology will impact different users and use cases over time.
Define goals that allow your AI system to work somewhat for diverse use cases. This can include designing certain features delivered in ‘A’ different languages or specific to ‘B’ other age groups.
Structure the objective function and underlying algorithms that reflect the fairness goals of the AI system.
Monitor the system regularly to check unfair biases learned by the ML models or algorithms over time.
Evaluate user experiences across use cases, contexts, and real-world scenarios using TensorFlow Model Analysis tools.

8. Consider interpretability
Narrow AI systems have improved our lives as automated predictions and decision-making has become mainstream. This may relate to several examples, from music recommendations to monitoring a patient’s vital signs. Despite the proliferation of narrow AI across fields, interpretability is crucial to understand and trust AI systems. The following interpretability practices before, during, and after designing and training AI models can be considered.

The AI team should work closely with relevant domain experts (e.g., healthcare, marketing, finance) to determine the required interpretability features.
Identify post-training interpretability options. Also, determine if you have access to the internals of ML models (i.e., black-box or white-box).
Determine whether you can analyze the training or testing data. For example, when working with sensitive and private data, you may not have access to the input data essential for investigation.
Evaluate if your AI model offers too much transparency, which can potentially open up vectors for external abuse.
Provide explanations regarding the interpretability of AI systems to appropriate model users; technical details may be communicated to industry experts and academia, while general users can be offered visualizations (charts, graphs, and statistics) or summary descriptions.

9. Ensure privacy
ML models are programmed to learn from training data and make subsequent predictions on input data. In some cases, both training and input data can be sensitive. Take the example of a tumor detector trained on biopsy images and deployed on an individual patient’s tumor scans. Here, it is crucial to consider the privacy implications while handling sensitive data. It may include legal and regulatory requirements, social ethics, and the patient’s expectations.

Conduct tests using metrics such as exposure measurement or membership inference assessment to determine whether the AI model unintentionally memorizes or exposes sensitive data. Moreover, the metrics can also be used for regression tests later during model maintenance.
To understand the tradeoffs and determine the optimal model settings, experimentation with variables and parameters for data minimization (such as aggregation, outlier thresholds, and randomization factors) may be considered.

10. Provide security
Security of AI systems involves determining whether the system is behaving as intended, irrespective of how attackers try to interfere. Addressing the security of an AI system before entirely relying on it is essential for safety-critical applications.

Identify all possible attack vectors by building a rigorous threat model. For example, the threat model should be able to identify a bug in the AI system that allows an attacker to change the input to the ML model, which can make it vulnerable.
If the system makes a mistake, you need to identify unintended consequences and assess the likelihood and severity of these consequences.
Develop methods such as spam filtering to combat adversarial ML. Also, test the system performance in hostile settings using tools such as CleverHans.

Takeaway
Today, almost every industry has embraced narrow AI as it achieves superhuman accuracy and performance when accomplishing specific tasks. Factors such as robust IoT connectivity, the proliferation of connected devices, and faster computing realms have propelled the progression of AI systems. While current AI outperforms humans, the challenge now is how narrow AI can evolve into a broader form of general and super AI. Only time will tell how AI masters cross-domain tasks by building new neural networks from scratch while it switches from one domain to another.

""Parliament’s Report shows that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will boost digitalisation and be a game-changer for global digital competition. The EU will be able to take the lead in AI"", said Axel Voss MEP, commenting on the final Report of the European Parliament’s Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Voss spearheaded the Report which is due to be adopted by the committee later today. The Committee on Artificial Intelligence was set up in 2020 to present a roadmap of the steps the EU needs to take in order to respond to the economic and societal challenges of AI. The final Report highlights the need for the EU to act swiftly in order to harness the opportunities that AI technologies have to offer.
Voss sets out solutions that AI can unlock, for instance, in the health sector, which could save and improve millions of lives, like speeding up the development of new drugs, tailored treatments and drug development specific to patients. AI can also play a significant role in the labour market by replacing mundane, labour-intensive or dangerous tasks, and thereby creating new and higher value-added employment. If combined with the necessary support infrastructure and training, AI can substantially increase European productivity by 11 to 37 percent by 2035, says Voss’ Report.
""The EU has the unique opportunity to promote a human-centric and trustworthy approach to AI, based on fundamental rights and minimising risk while taking full advantage of the benefits AI can bring to society as a whole - including in healthcare, sustainability, the labour market, competitiveness and security"", stressed Voss.
However, AI also brings challenges that the EU needs to address. The EPP Group wants a legal framework that prevents unlawful surveillance, the spread of disinformation and the use of social scoring - as used in countries such as China.
“There are also significant threats if authoritarian states such as China and Russia beat us to the technological punch. But with enough political will, financial investment and legal certainty I believe we can attract investment and foster world-leading innovation”, said Eva Maydell MEP, the EPP Group’s Spokeswoman in the Special Committee.
In recent years, the EU has fallen behind in the global AI race. However, the EU possesses a key advantage in its experience of standard setting. The EPP Group wants a harmonised, flexible and risk-based regulatory environment, while preventing unnecessary administrative barriers for SMEs and start-ups.
""We need a legal framework that responds to four challenges: we must leave space for innovation, harmonise the digital market with clear standards, maximise investment, and put in place a robust and sustainable digital infrastructure accessible to all citizens”, stressed Voss.
Today’s final Report will be submitted to the Parliament’s plenary in May.

Here’s how an algorithm guides a medical decision
Sepsis Watch helps flag a potentially deadly reaction to infection

Artificial intelligence algorithms are everywhere in healthcare. They sort through patients’ data to predict who will develop medical conditions like heart disease or diabetes, they help doctors figure out which people in an emergency room are the sickest, and they screen medical images to find evidence of diseases. But even as AI algorithms become more important to medicine, they’re often invisible to people receiving care. Artificial intelligence tools are complicated computer programs that suck in vast amounts of data, search for patterns or trajectories, and make a prediction or recommendation to help guide a decision. Sometimes, the way algorithms process all of the information they’re taking in is a black box — inscrutable even to the people who designed the program. But even if a program isn’t a black box, the math can be so complex that it’s difficult for anyone who isn’t a data scientist to understand exactly what’s going on inside of it. Patients don’t need to understand these algorithms at a data-scientist level, but it’s still useful for people to have a general idea of how AI-based healthcare tools work, says Suresh Balu, program director at the Duke Institute for Health Innovation. That way, they can understand their limitations and ask questions about how they’re being used. Some patients can get a little jumpy when they hear algorithms are being used in their care, says Mark Sendak, a data scientist at the Duke Institute for Health Innovation. “People get really scared and nervous, and feel threatened by the algorithms,” he says. Those patients can be nervous about how hospitals are using their data or concerned that their medical care is being directed by computers instead of their doctors. Understanding how algorithms work — and don’t work — may help alleviate those concerns. Right now, healthcare algorithms have very narrow uses: a computer program isn’t going to make major medical decisions, but it might help a doctor decide whether a set of medical scans needs closer scrutiny. To help demystify the AI tools used in medicine today, we’re going to break down the components of one specific algorithm and see how it works. We picked an algorithm that flags patients in the early stages of sepsis — a life-threatening complication from an infection that results in widespread inflammation through the body. It can be hard for doctors to identify sepsis because the signs are subtle, especially early on, so it’s a common target for artificial intelligence-based tools. This particular program also uses mathematical techniques, like neural networks, that are typical of medical algorithms.  The algorithm we’re looking at underpins a program called Sepsis Watch, which Sendak and Balu helped develop at Duke University. Sepsis Watch went online in 2018 after around three years of development. Today, when someone is hospitalized at a Duke hospital, the program could be keeping an eye on them. Here’s what it’d be doing.








Many factors play into a person’s risk of developing sepsis, including age, immune-compromising health conditions, and length of hospital stay. Signs from all over the body can tell a doctor when it may be occurring, including things like blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature.In order to make a prediction, the Sepsis Watch program first needs consistent data about a patient.








Let’s take a hypothetical patient, Alex — a 58-year-old hospitalized with an infection. Some of Alex’s data is easy to capture and feed into the program, like their age, preexisting conditions (kidney disease) or previous medications (cholesterol medication) — which won’t change while they’re in the hospital bed.








But other metrics are more dynamic. Alex’s blood pressure can change through the course of the day. So could their oxygen levels, heart rate, or glucose levels. And not all of those things are measured at regular intervals.


The program, though, doesn’t care if it’s unreasonable to expect a blood test on Alex every hour — it needs the data regardless. So the first step it takes is to fill in the gaps on those inconsistent metrics.


It uses a method called a Gaussian process to do that.








Say Alex only had their glucose levels measured at 2:30AM, 6AM, 3PM, and 9PM.








The mathematical tool uses information from those measurements, as well as information about Alex’s other vital signs, to fill in the gaps.








It figures out the best way to draw a line through all the existing data points, and adds in any missing numbers along that line. With a smooth line of evenly spaced data points in place, it can now see what Alex’s glucose level should have been at regular intervals throughout the day.








All that data can now be packaged, and fed into the neural network.








The neutral network underpinning Sepsis Watch is a complex series of algorithms that search for patterns in messy data. It’s made up of a series of “nodes” that each take in data, process it, and send it on to the next node before eventually spitting out an answer.








Before it was put into use on patients, the neural network got extensive training. It was fed hundreds of examples of data from patients who had sepsis and patients who did not.








Each time it received new data, the network refined the way it worked with that data until it could reliably pick out what patterns and combinations of data meant someone was likely to have sepsis.








After that training, it’s ready to get real-time information from Alex. (These are just a few examples of the dozens of types of information it receives).








Data gets fed into nodes of the neural network, which give different weights to the information.








Each node gets additional information from a memory bank, where the neural network stores all the information it learned from previous times the program ran on Alex.








For an analysis at 10PM, then, each node would also pull on the memory of the decisions it made at 9PM and 8PM for Alex.








Multiple nodes make up each layer of the neural network








And that all goes to the next layer, with its own nodes and memory banks








And then to the next layer









After the data is processed by that complex sequence of algorithms, the neural network spits out a score between 0 and 1 — a probability that Alex has sepsis at that particular moment in time. The closer the score is to 1, the more likely it is that Alex has sepsis.


This is a simplification of an incredibly complex mathematical program that, in reality, is made up of dozens of nodes and built from detailed equations. But at the end of the day, it’s still giving doctors and nurses one simple number that can help them care for patients.











Asking doctors and nurses to incorporate the Sepsis Watch alerts into their routines — and asking them to make choices and decisions based on what it told them — wasn’t a seamless process. The teams using the program had to figure out the best ways to communicate with each other about the information it gave them and how to adjust the way they engaged with patients and each other. At all stages, human choices played and continue to play a big role in how sepsis is managed. People choose what type of mathematical tools scaffold the program and what type of data trains it. People also have to decide on thresholds for what counts as a low, medium, or high risk of sepsis based on the output of the program.Doctors and nurses are still the ones making treatment decisions after a Sepsis Watch alert comes in. They call in prescriptions, monitor patients to see how they respond, and decide if and when they should keep using an algorithm to keep an eye on them. “At that level,” Balu says, “you’re relying on clinical judgment and clinical experience.”But so far, the effort to integrate Sepsis Watch seems to have been worth it: deaths from sepsis seem to be down at the Duke hospitals, and Duke is working on a more rigorous evaluation of how well the program contributed to that decline. That could make people more comfortable with the technology, too.Algorithms don’t fix problems in medicine. They’re human tools — they can reflect and exacerbate problems and bake in bias if the people developing the tools aren’t careful. But for better or worse, they’re going to be more and more ubiquitous. That’s why it’s so important to examine them carefully. “It’s important to have rigorous evaluations and validations,” Sendak says. “And to have transparency — about the data, about the performance, and about strengths and weaknesses.”

Eric Xing, MBZUAI PresidentShayma Al Awadhi is director of human resources at the management system Bayanati at the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources.She said she will use the skills gleaned on the course for a project of hers that measures employees’ productivity.“One of the main projects that I’m currently working on is an application called Motamaken, which basically is a productivity calculation platform that uses artificial intelligence to analyse your work trends,” Ms Al Awadhi said.“So, for example, you could be more productive after working hours, or you could be more productive during working hours, and what affects your productivity,” she said.The course aimed to support UAE government and business sectors. Participants were required to complete 12 rigorous weeks of coursework, lectures and collaborative project work.Dr Jamal Al Kaabi, undersecretary at the Department of Health in Abu Dhabi, joined the programme after the Covid-19 pandemic made him realise the potential of artificial intelligence.He believes wearable technology and AI could be crucial in providing home services and follow-up care for the elderly.The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence in Masdar City. Khushnum Bhandari / The National
“We came across one important project, which was to utilise artificial intelligence to help us read X-rays for the patient because most of the physicians were busy during Covid-19,” Dr Al Kaabi said.“I’m a physician by education but I want to add knowledge as an undersecretary of the Department of Health.“I want to understand how I can use AI in the future, not only for diagnosis but also for treatment.”Dr Al Kaabi said remote follow-up could become widespread, with sensors used to feed data back to care services.“For example, having sensors on the legs of the elderly that can predict falls,” he said.The group are the first to graduate from this “executive programme”, which was delivered at weekends by MBZUAI instructors and international counterparts from Harvard University, the University of Oxford, MIT, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California, Berkeley, among other prestigious institutions.It also featured visits to Abu Dhabi National Oil Company; Emirates Post; G42; DIFC FinTech Hive; the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre; and Al Ain Zoo. Site visits were geared to demonstrate ways in which AI has been used in each organisation.“Right now, it is a general artificial intelligence crash course for all topics,” said Dr Eric Xing, president of MBZUAI.“But if we have a large demand at the same time from the healthcare sector or from the national security sector, then there will be a reprogramming. That’s something we are experimenting with.”Dr Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and chairman of the Board of Trustees of MBZUAI, said the programme demonstrates the UAE’s commitment to building a community of future innovators and leaders.Read More:MBZUAI welcomes business leaders to first artificial intelligence course“The skills and knowledge they have gained will enable them to incorporate innovative AI solutions within their organisations, enhancing their performance and competitiveness,” said Dr Al Jaber.“Integrating AI applications throughout organisations in the public and private sectors is an important step to achieving the vision of our nation’s leadership, as outlined in the UAE National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2031.”MBZUAI was established in 2019. Its aim is to attract students from around the world to study AI and support the UAE’s diversification.Admissions for the executive programme’s autumn intake are open.

to tailor <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/tags/uae/"" target=""_blank"">UAE</a> government employees’ working hours to their own personal productivity. The initiative, which is being studied by the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources, is one of a host of practical applications for AI in everyday life. On Tuesday, 41 business leaders who took a three-month course at <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/2021/08/30/mbzuai-provost-lays-out-plan-to-compete-with-top-tier-universities/"" target=""_blank"">Mohamed bin Zayed University for Artificial Intelligence</a> celebrated their graduation. They were brimming with ideas of how to transform their places of work.  Shayma Al Awadhi is director of human resources at the management system Bayanati at the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources. She said she will use the skills gleaned on the course for a project of hers that measures employees’ productivity. “One of the main projects that I’m currently working on is an application called Motamaken, which basically is a productivity calculation platform that uses artificial intelligence to analyse your work trends,” Ms Al Awadhi said. “So, for example, you could be more productive after working hours, or you could be more productive during working hours, and what affects your productivity,” she said. The course aimed to support UAE government and business sectors. Participants were required to complete 12 rigorous weeks of coursework, lectures and collaborative project work. Dr Jamal Al Kaabi, undersecretary at the Department of Health in Abu Dhabi, joined the programme after the Covid-19 pandemic made him realise the potential of artificial intelligence. He believes wearable technology and AI could be crucial in providing home services and follow-up care for the elderly.  “We came across one important project, which was to utilise artificial intelligence to help us read X-rays for the patient because most of the physicians were busy during Covid-19,” Dr Al Kaabi said. “I’m a physician by education but I want to add knowledge as an undersecretary of the Department of Health. “I want to understand how I can use AI in the future, not only for diagnosis but also for treatment.” Dr Al Kaabi said remote follow-up could become widespread, with sensors used to feed data back to care services. “For example, having sensors on the legs of the elderly that can predict falls,” he said. The group are the first to graduate from this “executive programme”, which was delivered at weekends by MBZUAI instructors and international counterparts from Harvard University, the University of Oxford, MIT, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California, Berkeley, among other prestigious institutions. It also featured visits to Abu Dhabi National Oil Company; Emirates Post; G42; DIFC FinTech Hive; the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre; and Al Ain Zoo. Site visits were geared to demonstrate ways in which AI has been used in each organisation. “Right now, it is a general artificial intelligence crash course for all topics,” said Dr Eric Xing, president of MBZUAI. “But if we have a large demand at the same time from the healthcare sector or from the national security sector, then there will be a reprogramming. That’s something we are experimenting with.” Dr Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and chairman of the Board of Trustees of MBZUAI, said the programme demonstrates the UAE’s commitment to building a community of future innovators and leaders.  “The skills and knowledge they have gained will enable them to incorporate innovative AI solutions within their organisations, enhancing their performance and competitiveness,” said Dr Al Jaber. “Integrating AI applications throughout organisations in the public and private sectors is an important step to achieving the vision of our nation’s leadership, as outlined in the UAE National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2031.” MBZUAI was <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/technology/world-s-first-artificial-intelligence-university-to-open-in-abu-dhabi-1.924350"" target=""_blank"">established in 2019</a>. Its aim is to attract students from around the world to study AI and support the UAE’s diversification. Admissions for the executive programme’s autumn intake are open.

Disruptive technology is generating better accountability and shortening the time of litigation in the legal profession as well.India, too, has progressed to virtual courts with outstanding services since the COVID-19 outbreak. SA Bobde, India's former Chief Justice, had envisioned the employment of artificial intelligence (AI) in the judiciary. He expressed his joy at the introduction of the Supreme Court Portal for Court Efficiency Assistance (SUPACE) during the inauguration speech.                         iStockAs reported, Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju recently stated that in order to implement phase two of the eCourts project, new, cutting-edge technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) must be adopted in order to improve the efficiency of the justice delivery system.What does Artificial Intelligence mean?Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a mechanism through which computers are programmed to undertake tasks which historically required human intelligence. Machine learning, pattern recognition, big data, neural networks, self-algorithms, and other technologies are all part of it. AI entails difficult tasks such as giving certain data to a machine and having it react to various scenarios.AI can assist in the completion of a work in a matter of minutes. Machine learning (ML) is a sort of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to improve their accuracy at predicting outcomes without having to be explicitly programmed to do so. In order to predict new output values, machine learning algorithms utilize historical data as input.                        iStockAI's expanding effect may be seen in a variety of areas, including IT, farming, manufacturing, and customer service. Although the Indian legal industry has been slower to adapt to technology, it has seen changes. It is believed that the slower adaptation was promulgated by several lawyers who are still happy with the same old way of operation that was developed decades ago. However, with an ever-increasing need for self-service technologies, even in the legal profession, this once-utopian notion can become a reality for all lawyers.New-age tech and lawAccording to the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), over 3 crore cases are pending at the district and taluka levels, with over 58 lakh cases still pending at the high courts. According to experts, such pending cases have a knock-on effect that lowers the effectiveness of the judiciary and, as a result, people's access to justice.The IBM Watson-powered robot 'ROSS,' which used a unique approach of mining data and identifying trends and patterns in the law to address research issues, was the first worldwide player to attempt to apply AI for legal reasons. Surprisingly, the area most affected will not be the litigation process or arbitration proceedings, but rather the back-end work for litigation and arbitration reasons, such as research, data storage and use, and so on.                        IIT DelhiAI proponents argue that technology enables the digitization of data and the integration of diverse data sources, some physical and some digital, to create a treasure mine of information in the aggregate. The Community Justice and Tribunals System (CJTS), the notion of Future Courts in Singapore, the Data Analytics and Research Department (DARD) strengthening data analytics capabilities, and Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) in the United Kingdom are just a few examples. In Brazil, a number of courts have already made the transition from traditional lawsuits to digital disputes, with some investigating artificial intelligence's possibilities.Legal problems that AI can solve in India?According to experts, while technology innovation will help lawyers perform legal research in an efficient and timely manner, it will also help them handle the issue of significant pendency. As a result, AI software-enabled lawyers will be able to focus more on counselling clients and taking on complex issues/cases.                        SoftwareOneThey further add that AI might aid courts and private parties in determining which cases to pursue, which to settle amicably if possible, and which to dismiss.Most AI software can keep track of the work that is being done, which aids lawyers and businesses in creating invoices for the work they have completed. This enables a new degree of transparency in the work that is being done, which benefits lawyers/firms, clients, and auditing authorities.A report in lexology highlights that AI systems can tackle more complicated problems in a matter of minutes. It can assist lawyers in narrowing down cases that are relevant to them without the use of tangible papers or search engine websites. Because these traditional processes take more time and effort to complete, it would be more practical to deploy AI software that can quickly locate relevant cases and statutes.According to the same report, the programme may highlight crucial areas that are relevant in specific contracts, after being ""trained"" on a large historical set of precedents. This will allow thousands of previous instances to be analysed and a creation of 'judge analytics'.What are the currently used technologies in the Indian judicial system?As per reports, the usage of technology for e-filing and virtual hearings has increased dramatically during the Covid-19 outbreak. SUVAS (Supreme Court Vidhik Anuvaad Software) is an artificial intelligence system that can help with the translation of court decisions into regional dialects. This is thought to be another historic initiative to improve access to justice.                        Representational Image/iStock The Supreme Court of India recently launched SUPACE (Supreme Court Portal for Assistance in Court Efficiency) to first understand judicial processes that require automation, and then to assist the Court in improving efficiency and reducing pendency by encapsulating judicial processes that can be automated through AI.The team at ManCorp Innovations Lab (MCIL), an AI-powered solution company, studied the difficulties faced by the Jharkhand High Court and discovered that there was a shortage of judges and a high volume of criminal cases. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and ChatBot were two technologies developed by the company to overcome the issue. Where OCR translates scanned documents into computer readable text, rectifies the orientation, etc., ChatBot is managed by both voice instructions and text.The E-courts Project was conceived with the goal of transforming the Indian judiciary by enabling courts with ICT (Information and Communication Technology). It is a pan-India project for District Courts across the country, overseen and sponsored by the Ministry of Law and Justice and Department of Justice. The goal was to deliver citizen-centric services in a timely and effective manner.Criticism around There are also some questions about the character of an AI's ethics. A point raised was that AI software does not have a consciousness of its own. While they think before acting, their behaviours are totally programmed, and there is always a question of trustworthiness because AI systems must have a clear ethical goal as well as be technically strong and reliable.It was also argued that as AI technology advances, new concerns regarding data security, privacy, human rights, and ethics may emerge, necessitating greater self-regulation by AI developers. External regulation will be required by the legislature in the form of statutes, rules, and regulations, as well as by the judiciary in the form of judicial review and constitutional norms.Another concern that has been raised in relation to implementing Artificial Intelligence is affordability. The affordability of these AI programmes is something that should be considered. With corporations investing in privatised AI research centres, the upkeep of these AI facilities is also a challenge. As a result, the initial and ongoing costs of establishment and operation would be expensive.For more on news and current affairs from around the world please visit Indiatimes News.",,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xPath': ['/html/head/title', ""/html/head/meta[@name='description']/@content""]}","['https://www.facebook.com/indiatimes', 'https://twitter.com/indiatimes', 'https://www.youtube.com/@indiatimes', 'https://www.instagram.com/indiatimes/', 'https://in.linkedin.com/company/indiatimes']",,1999.0,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Times Internet Limited, Plot Number 391, Udyog Vihar, Phase-III', 'addressLocality': 'Gurgaon', 'addressRegion': 'Haryana', 'postalCode': '122016', 'addressCountry': 'IN'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91 (0124) 4187000', 'email': 'grievance.it@timesinternet.in', 'contactType': 'customer support', 'url': 'https://www.indiatimes.com/contactus/'}","{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'Indiatimes', 'url': 'https://www.indiatimes.com'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://im.indiatimes.in/content/2021/Dec/Main-image-6_61c1e1c5381c1.jpg?w=1200&h=900&cc=1&webp=1&q=75', 'caption': '', 'height': 900, 'width': 1200}",,,,,,,,,,,,,

coders to ensure their computer programming skills match the demands of the market. The Coders HQ, which was launched in January, will now test the best programmers to ensure their skills are suitable for global companies such as Emirates airline, LinkedIn and Majid Al Futtaim. It will also help coders to expand their career prospects in programming, which has become one of the <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/2021/12/30/uae-at-50-why-2021-has-been-a-year-like-no-other/"" target=""_blank"">fastest-growing</a><a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/2021/12/30/uae-at-50-why-2021-has-been-a-year-like-no-other/"" target=""_blank""> private sector industries</a>. “Each one of us is capable of learning the language [coding] and to develop a system,” said Omar Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications at an event held at the Museum of the Future on Tuesday.  “But what is missing today is not knowing our level as we compare ourselves to the people around us, not knowing what our needs are when we move from one phase to another and not knowing what the relevant stages are to be among the highest level of programmers. “Many people speak about their potential in coding but sometimes this is opposite to reality.” Anyone wishing to be evaluated will be tested, with their skills graded for suitability for programming jobs in the private sector. Training will be offered to ensure coding skills evolve with changes in technology. Mr Al Olama said the UAE should become a regional centre for coding, with wider use of the Arabic language in technology, and hoped every public and private sector entity would have a ‘coding ambassador’ to encourage others to learn new skills. A new partnership with Cisco will put Arabic at the centre of technology developed and launched in the region, he said. “Evaluation will come first, followed by education. Later, we will give people a chance to implement their skills,” said Mr Al Olama. “Our belief is that UAE must be the incubator of the future of the technology. “We should not forget that the UAE, being an Arab country, a country in the Middle East and a major motivator for this technology, made us collaborate with Cisco for this initiative.” The UAE Artificial Intelligence Office recently launched an <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/technology/2022/03/01/difc-launches-ai-and-coding-licence-to-attract-tech-talent/"" target=""_blank"">AI and coding licence</a> to attract technology companies and coders from around the world.   In partnership with the Dubai International Financial Centre’s Innovation Hub, the project aims to increase the number of tech companies operating in the emirate. Currently, more than 500 start-ups and tech groups are based at the DIFC hub. At the launch of Coders HQ, Microsoft said it would host an OpenHack event to encourage people to work with the company on digital solutions and innovation. OpenHack is a developer-focused event to teach talented coders to learn in challenge-based, real-world scenarios designed to mimic a developer’s journey inside Microsoft. Participants work together in teams of five to complete challenges that increase in complexity as they progress. “We strive for meaningful innovation at Microsoft, with products and services that improve lives and have the potential to change the world,” said Tamer Salah, AI country strategy lead for Microsoft. “For decades, our researchers and engineers have pushed the boundaries of science and technology to inspire others to imagine, and help build a better future.  “With the support of the Ministry of AI, we are bringing back the OpenHack event to the UAE. “It is a unique way to co-invent with Microsoft and empower local talents within the country to engage with our own experts and developers, to find real-world solutions that challenge through unique, immersive experiences.” Currently, there are about 63,000 coders in the country, working in computer programming or preparing for a career in industries like FinTech or software development. In January, the National Programme for Artificial Intelligence announced a series of measures to increase the number of qualified coders in the UAE to reach 100,000 by the end of 2022.  Here are the initiatives that were announced at the event held on Monday: <b>Setting up an evaluation centre</b> The centre will classify the skill set of programmers and help them find jobs that best suit their expertise. <b>Coder HQ Ambassadors</b> The chosen 'ambassadors' will teach others how to programme, especially among university students. They will be based at Emirates Towers, to propose and implement projects. Candidates can apply at <a href=""http://www.ai.gov.ae/chqambsd"" target=""_blank"">www.ai.gov.ae/chqambsd</a> <b>Natural Language Processing Challenge</b> This initiative seeks to form specialised teams of Emiratis who are good at language processing. These teams will be responsible for educating university students who are ready for the job market and will help to create a future talent pool of programmers. <b>Tanzu Community</b> The Tanzu Community, launched in collaboration with VMWare, a leading provider of multi-cloud services for all apps, provides programmers with an opportunity to learn more about software technology. The community will hold monthly meetings with those interested with the objective of nurturing future talent. <b>“Open Hack” Hackathon</b> The joint project between Microsoft and Coders HQ aims to develop programming teams to work in the private sector, increasing competitiveness which will have a positive effect on the digital economy. <b>LinkedIn Statistics</b> This is designed to provide accurate statistics that reflect the current state of programmers in the UAE. With more than 63,000 programmers working across all sectors in the UAE, access to this objective data will improve the decision-making process.",,,"['https://www.facebook.com/TheNationalNews', 'https://x.com/TheNationalNews', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thenationalnews/', 'https://www.instagram.com/TheNationalNews.com', 'https://www.youtube.com/TheNationalNewspaper']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In February 2020, with COVID-19 spreading rapidly around the globe and antigen tests hard to come by, some physicians turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to try to diagnose cases1. Some researchers tasked deep neural networks — complex systems that are adept at finding subtle patterns in images — with looking at X-rays and chest computed tomography (CT) scans to quickly distinguish between people with COVID-based pneumonia and those without2. “Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a race to build tools, especially AI tools, to help out,” says Alex DeGrave, a computer engineer at the University of Washington in Seattle. But in that rush, researchers did not notice that many of the AI models had decided to take a few shortcuts.

Photograph: switas/Getty Images/iStockphotoArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 2 years oldArtificial intelligence beats eight world champions at bridgeThis article is more than 2 years oldVictory marks milestone for AI as bridge requires more human skills than other strategy gamesLaura SpinneyTue 29 Mar 2022 01.00 EDTShareAn artificial intelligence has beaten eight world champions at bridge, a game in which human supremacy has resisted the march of the machines until now.The victory represents a new milestone for AI because in bridge players work with incomplete information and must react to the behaviour of several other players – a scenario far closer to human decision-making.In contrast, chess and Go – in both of which AIs have already beaten human champions – a player has a single opponent at a time and both are in possession of all the information.“What we’ve seen represents a fundamentally important advance in the state of artificial intelligence systems,” said Stephen Muggleton, a professor of machine learning at Imperial College London.French startup NukkAI announced the news of its AI’s victory on Friday, at the end of a two-day tournament in Paris.The NukkAI challenge required the human champions to play 800 consecutive deals divided into 80 sets of 10. It did not involve the initial bidding component of the game during which players arrive at a contract that they must then meet by playing their cards.Each champion played their own and their “dummy” partner’s cards against a pair of opponents. These opponents were the best robot champions in the world to date – robots that have won many robot competitions but that are universally acknowledged to be nowhere near as good as expert human players.The AI – called NooK – played the same role as the human champion, with the same cards and the same opponents. The score was the difference between those of the human and the AI, averaged over each set. NooK won 67, or 83%, of the 80 sets.Jean-Baptiste Fantun, co-founder of NukkAI, said he had been confident the machine – which the company has been developing for five years – would triumph in thousands of deals, but with only 800 it was touch-and-go.Announcing the results, the mathematician Cédric Villani, winner of the Fields medal in 2010, called NukkAI “a superb French success story”.AI researcher Véronique Ventos, NukkAI’s other co-founder, calls NooK a “new generation AI” because it explains its decisions as it goes along. “In bridge, you can’t play if you don’t explain,” she says.The game relies on communication between partners.AI could decipher gaps in ancient Greek texts, say researchersRead moreExplainability is a hot topic in AI. “Most of what the general public have heard in recent years about machine learning is based on black box systems such as AlphaGo, which is unable to explain to human beings how decisions are being made,” said Muggleton.Instead, NooK represents a “white box” or “neurosymbolic” approach. Rather than learning by playing billions of rounds of a game, it first learns the game’s rules and then improves its play through practice. It is a hybrid of rules-based and deep learning systems. “The NooK approach learns in a way that is much closer to human beings,” Muggleton said.“The pendulum is swinging towards these kinds of methods,” says Michael Littman, a professor of computer science at Brown University in Rhode Island. “Not being able to tell people what’s going on just doesn’t work in our societies.”Even if a person or an AI can’t explain in words what they are doing, Littman says, their behaviour needs to be “legible” to others – enacting rules they understand.This will be critical in domains such as health and engineering. Self-driving cars negotiating a junction will need to be able to read each other’s behaviour, for example.Littman was disappointed the challenge didn’t include bidding, which is where much of the most interesting communication – and deception – happens in bridge.But Nevena Senior, a many-times world bridge champion for England and one of NooK’s challengers, said the contracts the humans and NooK were given to play were sufficiently variable that the card game became as important as the bidding.She said NooK’s creators had done a “magnificent” job. She found that it read its opponents better than the humans did, and was better able to exploit their mistakes.“This is something that humans do after enough experience and I was pleasantly surprised that a robot mimics typical human skills,” she said.Other AI triumphs

0SharesWith the explosion of terms like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in construction, AEC Magazine caught up with Senthil Kumar, CTO and head of AI at start-up Slate.ai to discuss how the technology can assist the complexity in the building industry

Q: Senthil, it’s always great to meet a new face in AEC software. Can you tell us about your previous work and what you do at Slate?
A: I’ve been working on advanced data technology in global software companies for over two decades now. I’ve helped pioneer multiple technological endeavours during that time, including AI, Blockchain, dge, cloud computing, metaverse, IoT, swarm robotics, system autonomy, and Big Data computing in industries spanning autonomous vehicles, fintech, smart buildings and cities, geospatial engineering, insurance, health care, and medicine.
I’ve also helped develop the emerging AI Industry standards, such as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, and also work in numerous industry think tanks and advisory boards of well-known academia and startups. Recently, my pioneering AI work was cited in the wall street journal and was recognised by the World Economic Forum.
I joined Slate 12 months ago as CTO, to build a new team of engineers and data scientists focused on delivering the most modern software and technology approaches to leverage data across building production.

Q: AI and Machine Learning are often greatly misunderstood. From your point of view, explain what they are?
A: I agree these terms have been misused interchangeably. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computational science that enables the creation of smart intelligent machines and systems. AI offers the promise of a bridge between humans and machines in smarter ways, mimicking human cognition and enabling the creation of a smarter harmonious ecosystem interplay by understanding a human’s needs and intent.
Now, while AI is a broad science, machine learning is a specific subset of AI that trains a machine on how to learn and helps one build AI-driven applications. In a sense, ML is how computer systems learn and develop their intelligence.

Q: Does that mean you can have AI without Machine Learning?
A: Yes, as much as it may surprise us, we can have AI without ML. While model training, ML methodologies, and selflearning techniques have grown exponentially in recent times, there are aspects of AI that can be on their own without the need for ML to have taken place. An early oft-used method of AI implementation was the use of Decision Trees that break down complex problems into binary evaluations, then traverse those trees to find answers. This is not ML dependent and is widely used to this day.
Other examples of AI that are not ML-dependent include, using machines to solve shortest path problems, constraint solving, chatbots, and aspects of NLP [Natural Language Processing] using stochastic grammar to parse sentence trees. We have to remember that AI is vast in scope and ML is just one of the many techniques that AI uses.

Q: So, from your experience, what are some other common misconceptions about AI?
A: Don’t get me started! I think we’ve all heard that AI systems will probably replace our jobs, making most people redundant. This is a myth that’s heard to this day. Similar arguments have been made during the agrarian and industrial revolutions. The reality is that AI will mostly change existing jobs and create new ones. We have to remember, while on the one hand, a number of jobs might be automated by AI, the main reason that will occur is because those jobs are generally well suited to the way a computational machine works.
Roles that are best suited to human intellect and the supervision systems will continue to thrive and grow. The migration of work from repetitive physical roles towards cleaner, more rewarding careers, that humans are brilliantly well-suited to, started a long time ago, way before we were talking about AI. The overall quality of life and our productivity will only become better with a harmonious Human-Computer interplay, leveraging what machines do well in partnership with what humans do well.
Another misconception is that AI systems can be more impartial than human beings and be objective.
For some time now, creating unbiased and accurate AI has been the aspirational Holy Grail of AI architects. Even though AI systems do not yet have emotional intelligence like humans, they are susceptible to influences. It is imperative to note that AI is based on inputs and inferences from human experts and sometimes fallible data.
Senthil Kumar
Since humans are intrinsically biased in one way or another, so is the AI that has been co-created by humans. These biases can and do get carried over to the systems. A particular issue in the news is the systems that self-train using data from social inputs. They can be extremely susceptible to unintentional or intentional malevolent influences and biases. For example, the early facial recognition systems had biases in identifying ethnicities, and other systems that used social feeds such as twitter were unduly influenced by false propaganda. While technology implementations for AI are advancing swiftly and ethics, particularly for autonomous AI, is improving, we still have a long way to go in creating truly impartial and objective AI systems.

Q: Why did you see building production as the next best place to implement what you’ve learned?
A: While technology has transformed the landscape in several industries, there are aspects of building production that are yet to be touched by technological advancements that have already proved valuable elsewhere. Years ago, in industries such as retail, healthcare, insurance and fintech, we’ve been able to bring about significant changes to improve overall efficiencies, implementing both simple and complex AI implementations.
I joined Slate when I saw that building production is a multi-trillion-dollar industry that impacts the economy in a multitude of ways. Here I can leverage my knowledge of these technologies to create a meaningful and significant altering of the value-map for building.
If we think about this, improvements in construction can have a direct impact on the global economy. The interdependencies in building production are inherently global in scope, involving supplies, technologies, and participants across different countries, making this a truly global phenomenon. No other industry of today presents such a diverse array of unsolved challenges, and I believe many of those challenges can be solved more easily than imagined.
Complexity and unforeseen challenges are the norms in building production. Every aspect of this environment that flexes human and machine intellect is exciting to me, allowing us to employ some of the latest technologies and ideas in a meaningful manner. Just a few examples include: supply chain, and schedule optimisation utilising some of the major advancements in AI, computer vision, and cognitive sciences; Metaverse Augmented Reality applications for digital simulation and digital rehearsals; the ability to predict cost overruns and anticipatory analytics to illustrate when stages of building can be completed.
The interdependencies of construction’s inherently multidisciplinary, multi-dimensional and multi-player ecosystem makes it incredibly interesting [for AI], but also well suited to modern computational solutions
I’m also excited see new ‘smarter’ materials which complement building performance, utilising advancements in polymer science and computational nanotechnology, with multi-dimensional analytical tools that can leverage their potential to reduce carbon in operational performance. What other industry would offer the multitude of challenges this industry poses? All of these are exciting to me as they relate to building production.

Q: AI and chess have become synonymous with explaining what AI can achieve. So, is construction more complicated than, for example, chess?
A: Ah, yes… I might argue that elements of construction are a more complex challenge than a chess game. In a chess game, the player anticipates the moves of the opponent. Not just the next move but several moves ahead of what the opponent may do. This was generally viewed as the peak of challenges to solve with AI. That’s why when [chess computer] Deep Blue beat a human in a chess game there was elation all around.
But, if we think about this, chess has a singular opponent, the game board is defined, the rules are defined. Even though the number of moves can be huge, there is still a finite number of moves an opponent can make with the game pieces. Construction, on the other hand, has inherent complexities. Think of it as a game with an infinite number of opposing moves, multiple opponent players teaming up in unison against the player.
Some of the moves may not even be fully well defined, such as unforeseen political events, supply constraints, surprise government regulations, workmanship constraints. All of these can throw a wrench into the well-designed construction schedule. This can make it significantly more complex than a game of chess.

Q: So, how complicated are the problems in building production? How does the complexity compare with other industries, such as health, finance, and biotech?
A: Well, building production is a daunting challenge. From conception to completion for the comfort and safety of human occupants and operational efficiencies, improving building production is among the most sophisticated and complex legacy industries to improve with technology.
While tremendous advancements have been made in healthcare, manufacturing and finance, the difference between those industries and construction has been the pace of innovation and adoption. The interdependencies of construction’s inherently multi-disciplinary, multi-dimensional and multi-player ecosystem make it incredibly interesting, but also well suited to modern computational solutions. It’s incredible for me to see how many construction decisions are made without the situational context commonly available in other industries from well understood dimensional analysis techniques.
Slate is using AI to aid decision making in AEC
To improve the Decision Value Chain in building production, multi-dimensional analysis can be a very effective strategy. This type of Analytical Reasoning involves data segmentation and contextualisation in varying dimensions.
In the case of building production, a number of challenges can be analysed in cross-sectional contextual patterns of varying dimensions. Real world events across space and time can be correlated into contextual dimensions – causation analysis, co-occurrence patterns of features with events and values of importance.
It could be as simple as computing the optimal time for performing certain construction tasks, or how should a specific work package be formulated and in what sequence should certain events be orchestrated? The ability to foresee and foretell events before they happen as it relates to construction can all benefit from multi-dimensional analysis to improve the decision value chain as it relates to building production.
I was recently asked whether going to Mars is more challenging than construction. For me, I might contest that building production and sustainability on this planet and on Mars when we get there are the more interesting goals.

Q: Where are we in the evolution of AI in construction?
A: We are witnessing the creation of history in our times. Most leaders in construction have recognised that what the 4th industrial revolution did to the invention and patronisation of advanced technologies in traditional industries, the construction spectrum might finally be ready to adopt.
Advancements are being made in a number of AI disciplines, including Convolutional Neuroscience, Realtime Machine Vision, Human-Level Cognition with NLP, intent-based computations, and a favourite focus area of mine, “Speed of Thought” analytics, where, as you think, so shall the machine cater to your intent.
While AI is going mainstream in other markets, adoption of it in the construction space has been lagging. This was not for want of technology or digital data but scepticism around AI, with a bias towards human experience being used as context for most decisions.
Here at Slate, the biggest attitude change we are seeing in construction is happening when organisations are feeling completely overwhelmed with software and data, while not benefiting from the intelligence that the data can provide. Existing software has taken the automation of construction’s legacy workflows as far as they can go. Just knowing how many RFIs you have unprocessed, or how many change orders are stuck is not improving the bottom line.
The current best-in-class software solutions are helping companies try and keep to the schedule and budget frameworks that have not changed significantly for decades. To gain from the digital motherlode of knowledge we are amassing in building production, we need new AI solutions that work with humans before, during and after the critical decisions that can and will improve outcomes, not just maintain current industry performance. We believe our work at Slate will be significant in bringing that value to the industry.

AI is now very much a feature of the workplace, but HR specialists need to be alive to the risks it presents. Unintentional consequences of AI decision-making can include bias, discrimination, unfair treatment and an inability for employees to fully understand and accept decisions. Failure to mitigate these risks can lead to employment tribunal claims being brought and reputational risk to an employer. 
One such issue has recently arisen for MAC, a subsidiary of Estée Lauder in which three make-up artists brought claims that they had been unfairly made redundant because of an automated decision generated by AI software, HireVue.
The three women were informed that they had to reapply for their positions by way of video interview. The AI software analysed the content of the women’s answers and their facial expressions, together with other metric data regarding their job performance. Following the video interview, all three women were informed they were being made redundant, in part due to the algorithmic decision-making (ADM).  
The women complained of the lack of transparency and the fact that when challenged, their employer was unable to explain on what basis they were being made redundant. The company defended its decision, citing the fact that the algorithm assessment only accounted for a quarter of the marks awarded and that the AI software was used in tandem with human decision-making procedures, which overall, produced a fairer outcome. The women received an out-of-court settlement.
Under the GDPR, the law allows employers to make decisions without human intervention, although these are in limited circumstances and require transparency. The above case highlights the risks associated with ADM and how this can lead to serious consequences in an employment context if greater transparency is not provided. 

HR teams need to be alive to the potentially unintended consequences of any automated systems they use. It is important to maintain a human element during any process to counteract problems with bias or bad decisions. Quality control of AI is arguably more important than in other areas given its purpose of learning from the data and its own decisions. If the data input is defective and there is no mechanism for review, an employer could easily experience significant operational, legal, and reputational problems.
When using ADM as part of a process to make staff redundant, HR teams should consider:

Engaging in fact-based comparisons between AI results and human decision results. For example, running the algorithm against the decisions of a human on the same matter to compare results. If bias is discovered, the algorithm should be changed. 


Prioritise transparency by clearly communicating how AI is being used in the workplace. This is particularly important with regards to data protection law, so plain English and non-technical explanations should be used. Greater transparency and understanding by the HR team will facilitate employees being able to raise queries or challenges. 


Ensure there are informal and formal routes for employees to raise queries or challenge decisions.

AI may not yet be robust or reliable enough to make the case for its use in complex HR work, yet the promise of time saved, and its use for mundane work is accelerating AI in the workplace. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has argued for changes in the law on the use of AI at work, in its report, Technology managing people – the legal implications. It is important for HR teams to stay up to date with any legislative changes in this area and ensure any AI process used is subject to regular quality control and review.

Artificial Intelligence is tremendously useful, when applied correctly, to improve fairness, transparency, efficiency and even to correct historical biases, including ethnic and gender biases imposed by humans. However, when applied in a ‘plug and play’ manner, we risk exacerbating social and economic inequality. Christine Chow, Paris Will, and Mark Lewis discuss the implications.

 
From an investor’s perspective
Investors increasingly consider human capital management (HCM) to be a defining factor in delivering business outperformance. In discussions around the ‘future of work’, we acknowledge that the future is already here – the workforce is now more mobile, more diverse, more agile, and increasingly impacted by more data and analytics.
COVID lockdown has accelerated the digital transformation of businesses – from CV screening and AI video interviews, to virtual on boarding and digital workplace interactions. Workers’ activities in a hybrid working environment provide ample opportunities for technologies to improve efficiency, but not all companies are clear and explicit about when and how analytics are used on workers. In a recent BBC episode, AI technologies created for hiring were used in redundancy targeting, with unintended psychological impact on workers and possibly brand and financial impact on employers. In Social Dilemma, a 2020 docudrama, interviews with tech leaders highlighted the dangers of collected information at workplace, including how it affects the human psyche by causing anxiety and depression.
Share Action, a UK-based NGO, established the Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI) in late 2016 to improve corporate transparency and accountability on workforce issues. WDI is supported by 68 institutions (including HSBC Asset Management) with asset managers covering over US$10 trillion. In 2021, WDI introduced a new indicator, asking companies to describe workforce surveillance measures used to monitor workers and how the company ensures this does not have a disproportional impact on workers’ right to privacy. Proprietary findings can be found in our white paper (see Notes section below).
Beyond surveillance, investors recognise that it is in general difficult to reduce human behaviour down to an algorithm. Where AI works well as a tool is when decision-making rules are quantifiable, and computers can be used to interact almost instantaneously with vast amounts of data. Where AI does not work well as a tool is when the interpretation of human characteristics is contextual and the impact on behaviour is nuanced.

From an academic’s perspective
A scientific approach to assessing AI decision-making in human capital management (HCM) is to evaluate the level of bias in algorithmic decisions. As AI has been proposed to eradicate human biases in areas such as hiring, promotion, and pay decisions, it must be assessed to ensure that it lessens rather than potentiates human cognitive biases. As research advances in the field and conclusions are made about the adoptability of certain types of AI for HCM, we must be wary of the way that we judge AI, as research has shown that we judge AI in comparison to “perfect” decision-making. This may explain the backlash against adopting AI. The reality is that adopting AI will replace human decisions, which are far from perfect, and often riddled with bias. As such, a better approach in assessing the adoptability of AI for HCM is to directly compare AI and human decision outcomes. AI can be adopted in contexts where it shows less biased decision-making than humans.
The capabilities of AI are thought of in two broad categories: weak AI and strong AI. Weak AI means that it is specific to a task, whereas strong AI is meant to mimic human intelligence and can generalise to other contexts. AI currently performs well in specific contexts but is limited in its generalisability. As such, for HCM, we should take caution in using AI that has been validated in a specific context’s data set. We must keep considerations in mind when thinking about the capabilities of AI for HCM, especially as many of its proposed uses reflect technologies that would require strong AI. In this way companies should set their expectations about what AI can reliably accomplish.
Due to a rapidly changing workplace environment, we recommend using dynamic rather than static AI – algorithms should be continually updated with new data at regular intervals to prevent decisions from being outdated, irrelevant, and worse, unfit for purpose.

From a legal and regulatory perspective
It is surely in the interests of all concerned – especially those who may not have known that they should be concerned – to understand the legal and regulatory implications of introducing and deploying AI systems and processes in and around the workplace. The consequences of failing to understand and address those implications could be very serious for a range of stakeholders.
In trying to understand those implications, the problem is that there is very little law and regulation around the world applying specifically to the use of AI in human capital management. There are prospective laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that are intended to address the subject specifically, most notably a very substantial regulation proposed for the European Union – and not just in the EU, because it will have effect outside the EU, too. But, in many countries there is an existing body of law and regulation that would apply to employers’ use of AI in the workplace.
Unfortunately, when, how, and why that body of law and regulation may apply, and the implications of it applying, aren’t instantly obvious. What is obvious, however, is that there is a growing movement of disquiet about, and resistance to, the use of AI, automated decision-making, and related processes in and around the workplace, and that regulatory and legal challenges are happening – now.

Our white paper seeks to address this problem: first, by addressing board accountability and governance considerations; next by alerting readers to when, how, and why law and regulation will or may apply here; and then by outlining:

a selection of laws and regulations that now apply specifically to the adoption and use of AI in the workplace;
the potential impact of the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act; and
certain existing laws and regulations in various countries that are most likely to apply in such circumstances, but with judicial interpretation and application.

In doing so, we hope that all those concerned – and those who should be concerned – will be better able to understand, plan for, and manage the governance, legal and regulatory, and reputational implications, risks, and exposure that could arise in adopting and relying on AI systems and processes in and around the workplace.

The paper acknowledges that AI analytics is unlikely to go away in the present and future of work. As such, to make the best and appropriate use of AI in human capital management we need to embrace it with caution and respect for workers:

Board level oversight should focus on clarifying the intent of AI applications; establishing clear processes for AI training and testing, including back testing; ensuring transparency in the use of AI applications and accountability for their outcomes; and requiring competent and thorough due diligence of third-party products in the supply chain that may use AI. Such due diligence is currently often missing, or conducted by people lacking sufficient expertise;
Companies should understand and properly manage the legal and regulatory implications of adopting and relying on AI systems and related processes in the workplace;
Companies should put in place a machine learning platform to create automated and repeatable data preparation processes and feature engineering to ensure consistency over time. The platform should have a data versioning function to keep track of changes in data used, different model experiments and test results. There should be a feedback loop and associated documentation that integrate outcomes and lessons learnt to improve performance over time;
Companies should include a means of redress and clear remediation mechanisms to an accountable human; and
When engaging with companies, investors can ask for the disclosure and explanation of key performance indicators (KPI) highlighted in our paper, which covers hiring, culture, and performance (Figure 1).

From self-driving cars to dancing robots in Super Bowl commercials, artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere. The problem with all of these AI examples, though, is that they’re not really intelligent. Rather, they represent narrow AI – an application that can solve a specific problem using artificial intelligence techniques. And that is very different from what you and I possess.
Humans (hopefully) display general intelligence. We are able to solve a wide range of problems and learn to work out those problems we haven’t previously encountered. We are capable of learning new situations and new things. We understand that physical objects exist in a three-dimensional environment and are subject to various physical attributes, including the passage of time. The ability to replicate human-level thinking abilities artificially, or artificial general intelligence (AGI), simply does not exist in what we today think of as AI. 
That’s not to take anything away from the overwhelming success AI has enjoyed to date. Google Search is an outstanding example of AI that most people regularly use. Google is capable of searching volumes of information at an incredible speed to provide (usually) the results the user wants near the top of the list.











 
 
 
Similarly, Google Voice Search allows users to speak search requests. Users can say something that sounds ambiguous and get a result back that is properly spelled, capitalized, punctuated, and, to top it off, usually what the user meant.

How does it work so well? Google has the historical data of trillions of searches, and which results the user chose. From this, it can predict which searches are likely and which results will make the system useful. But there is no expectation that the system understands what it is doing or any of the results it presents.
This highlights the requirement for a huge amount of historical data. This works pretty well in search because every user interaction can create a training set data item. But if the training data needs to be manually tagged, this is an arduous task. Further, any bias in the training set will flow directly to the result. If, for example, a system is developed to predict criminal behavior, and it is trained with historical data that includes a racial bias, the resulting application will have a racial bias as well.











 
 
 
Personal assistants such as Alexa or Siri follow scripts with numerous variables and so are able to create the impression of being more capable than they really are. But as all users know, anything you say that is not in the script will yield unpredictable results.
As a simple example, you can ask a personal assistant, “Who is Cooper Kupp?” The phrase “Who is” triggers a web search on the variable remainder of the phrase and will likely produce a relevant result. With many different script triggers and variables, the system gives the appearance of some degree of intelligence while actually doing symbol manipulation. Because of this lack of underlying understanding, only 5% of people say they never get frustrated using voice search.
A massive program like GPT3 or Watson has such impressive capabilities that the concept of a script with variables is entirely invisible, allowing them to create an appearance of understanding. Their programs are still looking at input, though, and making specific output responses. The data sets at the heart of the AI’s responses (the “scripts”) are now so large and variable that it is often difficult to notice the underlying script – until the user goes off script. As is the case with all of the other AI examples cited, giving them off-the-script input will generate unpredictable results. In the case of GPT-3, the training set is so large that eliminating the bias has thus far proven impossible.











 
 
 
The bottom line? The fundamental shortcoming of what we today call AI is its lack of common-sense understanding. Much of this is due to three historical assumptions:

The principal assumption underlying most AI development over the past 50 years was that simple intelligence problems would fall into place if we could solve difficult ones. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a false assumption. It was best expressed as Moravec’s Paradox. In 1988, Hans Moravec, a prominent roboticist at Carnegie Mellon University, stated that it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance on intelligence tests or when playing checkers, but difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility. In other words, often the difficult problems turn out to be simpler and the apparently simple problems turn out to be prohibitively difficult.
The next assumption is that if you built enough narrow AI applications, they would grow together into a general intelligence. This also turned out to be false. Narrow AI applications don’t store their information in a generalized form so it can be used by other narrow AI applications to expand the breadth. Language processing applications and image processing applications can be stitched together, but they cannot be integrated in the way a child effortlessly integrates vision and hearing.
Lastly, there has been a general feeling that if we could just build a machine learning system big enough, with enough computer power, it would spontaneously exhibit general intelligence. This hearkens back to the days of expert systems that attempted to capture the knowledge of a specific field. These efforts clearly demonstrated that it is impossible to create enough cases and example data to overcome the underlying lack of understanding. Systems that are simply manipulating symbols can create the appearance of understanding until some “off-script” request exposes the limitation.

Why aren’t these issues the AI industry’s top priority? In short, follow the money.
Consider, for example, the development approach of building capabilities, such as stacking blocks, for a three-year-old. It is entirely possible, of course, to develop an AI application that would learn to stack blocks just like that three-year-old. It is unlikely to get funded, though. Why? First, who would want to put millions of dollars and years of development into an application that executes a single feature that any three-year-old can do, but nothing else, nothing more general?











 
 
 
The bigger issue, though, is that even if someone would fund such a project, the AI is not displaying real intelligence. It does not have any situational awareness or contextual understanding. Moreover, it lacks the one thing that every three-year-old can do: become a four-year-old, and then a five-year-old, and eventually a 10-year-old and a 15-year-old. The innate capabilities of the three-year-old include the capability to grow into a fully functioning, generally intelligent adult.
This is why the term artificial intelligence doesn’t work. There simply isn’t much intelligence going on here. Most of what we call AI is based on a single algorithm, backpropagation. It goes under the monikers of deep learning, machine learning, artificial neural networks, even spiking neural networks. And it is often presented as “working like your brain.” If you instead think of AI as a powerful statistical method, you’ll be closer to the mark.

AI’s long-term success is contingent upon our acknowledgement that people are critical in its design, operation, and use.Human-Centered AI (HCAI) is an emerging discipline intent on creating AI systems that amplify and augment rather than displace human abilities. HCAI seeks to preserve human control in a way that ensures artificial intelligence meets our needs while also operating transparently, delivering equitable outcomes, and respecting privacy.IBM Research’s HCAI strategy is to rigorously investigate and design new forms of human-AI interactions and experiences that enhance and extend human capabilities for the good of our products, our clients, and society at large. To do that, we take an interdisciplinary approach that involves researchers who specialize in human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work, data visualization, and design in the context of AI. We explore three important themes that we consider critical for the success of AI systems.Human-AI collaboration and co-creationAdhering to the core value that “human + AI” is better than either one individually, we can develop novel user experiences and visualizations that foster human-AI collaboration. We can also create frameworks for designing or evaluating human-AI interaction models and conduct theoretical work that develops and extends theories of human-AI collaboration or co-creation.Data science offers an excellent example of how people and AI can work together, to augment our ability to glean meaningful insights from data. One of the biggest challenges for data scientists is identifying and analyzing large, disparate data sets in ways that derive new insights that help solve complex problems. To do that, data scientists must build models and measure their performance. Then they optimize those models by tuning their hyper-parameters and evaluate those models for fairness and robustness.We learned that the future of data science work will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and human expertise are indispensable.Using a human-centered approach, we first sought to understand the attitudes that data scientists had in automating their work. In doing so, we learned that the future of data science work will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and human expertise are indispensable.1 Those insights led IBM to develop our AutoAI technology, which enables data scientists to produce more, higher-quality machine learning models faster, with fewer errors.2 This also includes novel visualization techniques that make it easier for data scientists to compare pipelines and understand how they rate against different metrics of accuracy and bias.3Responsible and human-compatible AIThis area covers all aspects of how At NeurIPS 2021, we organized the first workshop at NeurIPS on Human-Centered AI, exploring research questions that stem from the increasingly wide-spread usage of ML algorithms across all areas of society. It focused on understanding technical and design requirements for HCAI systems, as well as how to evaluate the efficacy and effects of HCAI systems. The workshop was major step toward building a hybrid field of AI and human-computer interaction.human-centered AI systems can provide positive and beneficial outcomes to their direct users, to those affected by their operation, and to society in general. To achieve these outcomes, HCAI must be fair and unbiased, secure, applied ethically, and used in service of users’ needs.Efforts to develop responsible and human-compatible AI take several factors into account, including the need to understand how people engage with and trust AI systems. There’s also a need to explain the operation of AI models and improve peoples’ understanding of how AI systems operate. An HCAI strategy must also gauge the negative consequences or potential misuse of AI systems, include ways to mitigate human and AI biases, and be able to measure peoples’ perceptions (or misperceptions) of AI systems.Our collaborations with the IBM’s internal business units offer real-world examples of responsible and human-compatible AI. In one instance, IBM Research, the Chief Analytics Office, and the Chief Information Office partnered to create a set of assets that infuse AI into the tools of IBM Sales and our business partner ecosystem, including the SCORE engine.SCORE uses AI techniques to learn from sales data and operational feedback from IBM’s sellers, business partners, and clients to recommend the optimal BP to receive each sales lead.4, 5 Explainable recommendations that provided clear evidence as to why a business partner is recommended were critical to the success of this AI system engendering trust in the system. The deployment and uptake of SCORE has led to $214M in incremental revenue since 2018 and won several prestigious awards.Explainable recommendations that provided clear evidence as to why a business partner is recommended were critical to the success of this AI system engendering trust in the system.As we explore different domains where AI can be applied, such as sales, finance, and human resources, our researcher often leads to a generalizable, deeper understanding that can result in AI design guidelines for ML practitioners. For example, our research team has been developing explainable AI (XAI) guidelines that can be leveraged by practitioners in multiple domains and for multiple use cases. We are also leveraging data visualization approaches to support interpretability, understanding, and interactive explorations of AI models, such as GLTR, a tool to help humans detect automatically generated text, and GenNI, an interactive visual system for high-level human-AI collaboration in producing descriptive text.Natural language interactionConversational user interfaces (CUIs) powered by advanced dialogue systems have grown in popularity, and many intelligent assistants have been developed for business, social, and emotional purposes. Under this theme, we are aiming to understand the kinds of tasks appropriate for this medium, the task effectiveness, and how to design engaging and delightful interactive experiences.In one project, our team is investigating the use of formal and informal styles of language by customer service AI-powered agents, both in speech- and text-based chats. Since the use of formal language is connected to gender in many languages and cultures, we are exploring cases where the machine impersonates either female or male agents and considering a comparison with expectations for human-based customer service.Our initial findings seem to indicate a direction that challenges traditional gender stereotypes of customer service in Brazil. In a Brazilian Portuguese context, we found a preference for human agents to use more formal language but no preferred use of formality for machine speech-based systems, such as Siri or Alexa. However, in the case of text-based chatbots, we saw a strong preference for female-portraying systems using informal language and male systems using formal language.6, 7The next frontiers for HCAIAs the technologies we develop become more intelligent and autonomous, our interactions with those systems will transform. To effectively support true The ACM IUI Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces is the premiere venue for work that spans across cutting- edge artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. From March 21-25, 2022, IBM Research participants presented recent advances related to our Human-Centered AI research agenda. This year, many of our papers focused on generative AI across various areas including code translation, co-creative systems, UX modernization, and explainability.Human-AI partnerships, one important question is how to facilitate the AI system and the user to negotiate a common objective, where traditionally AI solutions focus on optimizing performance or accuracy, these metrics do not encapsulate other objectives, like personalization, fairness and the many other objectives humans trade-off on a day to day basis when making decisions.A second frontier for Human-Centered AI is to investigate and understand the design of AI systems that become creative partners. In the business world, human-AI co-creativity involves subject matter experts working with an AI system generating code, co-designing user experiences, and accelerating scientific discovery.We envision the user experience of creating both physical and digital artifacts will become a partnership in which people will take the role of specification, goal setting, steering, high-level creativity, curation, and governance, whereas AI will augment human abilities through inspiration, creativity, low-level detail work, and the ability to design at scale.Learn more about:Human-Centered AI: We design and investigate new forms of human-AI interactions and experiences that enhance and extend human capabilities for the good of our products, clients, and society at large.Future of Finance: We're working on core technology innovations, from secure and elastic microservices-based hybrid cloud solutions and advanced analytics for finance, to AI blockchain, and quantum computing for the banking industry.Subscribe to our Future Forward newsletter and stay up to date on the latest research newsSubscribe to our newsletterHome↳ BlogDate31 Mar 2022AuthorsWerner GeyerJustin WeiszClaudio Santos PinhanezElizabeth DalyTopicsFairness, Accountability, TransparencyHuman-Centered AITrustworthy AIShareNotesNote 1: At NeurIPS 2021, we organized the first workshop at NeurIPS on Human-Centered AI, exploring research questions that stem from the increasingly wide-spread usage of ML algorithms across all areas of society.

Why diversity in AI remains a challenge and how to fix it


With artificial intelligence set for a global economic explosion, its development must put diversity at its core to avoid discriminating systems

Each year that passes sees artificial intelligence (AI) integrating even further into major institutions. It is set to contribute $15.7tn to the global economy by 2030, which exceeds the current output of China and India combined. This game-changing technology is becoming increasingly embedded in our daily lives, from the devices on our bodies that measure our heart rates to those in our home that play our music.







With AI poised to play an increasingly important role in society, further regulations are likely to be introduced worldwide. Over the past five years, more than 60 countries have developed over 700 AI policy initiatives. Last year, the European Commission introduced its Proposal for a Regulation on a European Approach for Artificial Intelligence (also known as the Artificial Intelligence Act), designed to ban harmful uses of AI and foster more consumer transparency in AI-driven systems and applications.
A particularly challenging issue in AI is the diversity of those programming the technology itself. The World Economic Forum has shown that about 78% of global professionals with AI skills are male, while a study by the AI Now Institute of New York University showed that over 80% of AI professors are men.
Women make up only 15% of AI researchers working at Facebook and 10% of AI researchers working at Google. Also, only 2.5% of Google’s entire workforce and 4% of Facebook’s and Microsoft’s are black. These figures need to change – and quickly.
Beyond the moral imperative of preventing systemic racial and gender discrimination in designing new AI tools, there is also an economic one. Research has demonstrated that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity have been 21% more likely to experience above-average profitability, while ethnic and cultural diversity correlates with a 33% increase in performance.
Different viewpoints optimise AI development when it comes to explainability. This is the ability to explain the predictions made by a machine learning model: being able to understand why a model adopted a particular choice and representing it in a manner that humans can follow. Data cannot simply be fed into a learning system. Instead, the AI system needs to be designed not to omit data simply because it seems atypical based on a few data points.
A diverse AI workforce made up of different races, genders, ethnicities and ages will decrease the likelihood of racial, gender, ethnic and age discrimination by artificially intelligent systems. So how can we address the issue?
Addressing gender diversity starts with attracting more women into the industry as early as possible and helping more female teenagers to consider a career in AI while at secondary school. In 2020, a mere 0.4% of girls in the UK took computer science at A-level and were already under-represented when they reached university. Only 9% of female graduates in 2018 studied a core STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subject, arguably due to a lack of female role models in tech and misunderstandings about what a career in tech entails.
Beyond education, the next step would be to ensure that job descriptions are as inclusive as possible. Research has shown that male-gendered words can affect the willingness of women to apply for a role. Masculine wording could perpetuate a perceived bias towards men, with 44% of women reportedly being discouraged from applying if a role or workplace was described as “aggressive” in a job description.
Once more women are in AI education and employment, it is crucial to foster a culture in which everyone feels included, respected and valued. Culture is an enormous part of why women leave tech, and changing that culture can start with prioritising and developing robust mentoring programmes.
As Jim Boerkoel, co-chair of an undergraduate consortium designed to cultivate future AI researchers has pointed out, two of the most critical levers to fostering diversity in AI are mentoring and cohort-building. These give peers meaningful connections to help their careers evolve and can link them to mentors who make relevant connections and introductions throughout a career.
Mentorship has been demonstrated to increase minority representation at management level from 9% to 24%. The benefits of mentorships also include raising the promotion and retention rates for minorities and women from 15% to 38% compared with employees who were not mentored. Industry leaders must create partnerships with academic institutions to build these mentorship networks early in the career process.
As industry leaders, we must deal with the diversity issues in AI not by zeroing in on a single controversy or debate, but by taking a holistic view of the broader picture, welcoming creative solutions and genuine accountability for the generations to come.

                            Artificial intelligence (AI) worldwide
                        While there are, especially in industries like manufacturing, legitimate fears that robots and artificial intelligence could cost people their jobs, a lot of workers in the United States prefer to look on the positive side, imagining which of the more laborious of their tasks could be taken off their hands by AI.According to a recent survey by Gartner, 70 percent of U.S. workers would like to utilize AI for their jobs to some degree. As our infographic shows, a fair chunk of respondents also named some tasks which they would be more than happy to give up completely. Data processing is at the top of the list with 36 percent, while an additional 50 percent would at least like AI to help them out in this.On the other side of the story, as reported by VentureBeat: ""Among survey respondents who did not want to use AI at work, privacy and security concerns were cited as the top two reasons for declining AI."" To help convince these workers, Gartner recommends ""that IT leaders interested in using AI solutions in the workplace gain support for this technology by demonstrating that AI is not meant to replace or take over the workforce. Rather, it can help workers be more effective and work on higher-value tasks.""

These autonomous digital agents will perform the majority of the tasks that are currently performed by users. The platform is thus emerging as the foundation of future decentralized digital data marketplaces..Fetch.ai uses a unique consensus mechanism referred to as Useful Proof-of-Work (UPoW). It generates new blocks in a manner similar to regular Proof-of-Stake protocols. In UPoW, the order of transactions is determined by the work performed between the generation of two blocks..Based on the Cosmos blockchain’s framework, the Fetch.ai blockchain is an interchain protocol that uses a high-performance smart contract language (Cosmwasm). It allows advanced cryptography and machine learning logic to be implemented on-chain. This enables the Fetch.ai network to function as a layer-2 network for legacy blockchain networks as well as an interchain bridge to the outside world..	FET: Fundamentals.FET is the native token of the Fetch.ai blockchain. It represents value on the network. And serves as the primary medium of exchange for payment of transactions as well as payment to agents for providing services on the blockchain. FET is also required to deploy new protocol agents and pay for their operations. .Users can stake your FET tokens and earn rewards from across the Fetch.ai ecosystem for assisting in the operations of a set of validators. FET token was developed to “find, create, deploy and train autonomous economic agents and is essential for smart contracts, oracles and the transactions needed to deliver the new digital economy.”.FET has a circulating supply of 745 million currently with a maximum supply of 1.15 billion. FET is a top 200 cryptocurrency by market capitalization..	Short Term Technical Analysis.FET is currently trading around $0.45, having risen from $0.3 at the beginning of March. That’s a gain of 50%, clearly indicating a bullish trend that may continue as Bitcoin leads the crypto market into positive sentiment. FET, however, may want to test short term resistances at $0.42 and $0.4, to gain more fuel for an upwards move. To prevent a bearish scenario though, it will certainly need to hold the golden pocket support at $0.36-$0.37..Source: TradingView, Binance.	Future Potential.Fetch.ai is constantly upgrading by stepping into several partnerships, indicating massive potential for the long-term. It has announced a collaboration in research and development with FinTech platform Algbra to bring DeFi services to underserved minority communities. It also entered the non-fungible token (NFT) market, launching the Colearn Paint NFT platform. The platform enables groups of creators to use machine learning to generate NFTs automatically. There’s also a collaboration with LiquidChefs, an on-site food beverage services company, to enable long-term AI-powered supply chain services and increase supply chain transparency through the use of autonomous economic agents..With constant upgrades and lots of developer activity, FET has potential to turn out to be one of the most popular cryptos in the future..Use promocode TNM51 at www.giottus.com/profile#promo after registration to get Rs.51 worth free Bitcoin..Disclaimer: This article was authored by Giottus Crypto Exchange as a part of a paid partnership with The News Minute.

According to a survey, many people want AI to help them in their work but only help them and not take their place

Artificial intelligence (AI) based tech has become a huge part of all our lives in the past few years. It was a way of staying connected while in Quarantine, a means of studying through Zoom meetings, and it was also a way of working from home. AI has certainly helped humans in many aspects of their daily lives and continues to do so. In a survey conducted by Gartner, respondents were asked about how they want AI to perform in nine different categories. The responses differed in 3 terms; the options were that AI takes over the work completely for us. The second was that AI helps them in that work; and the third being that AI would not do anything on behalf of the person who is assigned that task. According to that survey over 70% of people want AI to help them rather than do all the work or do nothing. Those 70% want AI to do simple tasks such as calculations, solving problems, simplifying procedures, doing research work, mistake checking and changing etc. in order to save time and space. In that survey it was also clear that about more than half or 57% of respondents want AI to do only one or two of the above mentioned tasks but a small part of respondents almost 18% want that AI to more than 5 of those tasks. While workers are generally happy with AI coming to help them, they want it to stay as helping only. They don’t want AI to take complete control over their task and they want at least most of the control that their task offers. They also want to be able to control how much of their data is being collected by AI and how much goes as their feedback about them. But with all this positive responses there are bound to be some negative ones as well because contrary to those who want AI in their workplaces there are people who do not want AI to be anything for them or on their behalf. The reasons for not trusting AI were fear of information leaking, Privacy issues, more trust in employer rather than artificial intelligence and the preference of human interaction. According to Gartner the IT people in every company should start campaigning for the use of AI in their workspaces and try to convince their co-workers and the higher management that AI are their friends and are not here to take their place.

MCCCD and Intel launched the AI for Workforce program in 2020 and now it is being offered to 31 community colleges across the country to provide hands-on training and expanded access to technology skills needed for current and future jobs. expandArnav Bawa, a student in the artificial intelligence program at Chandler Gilbert Community College, has developed an AI application to interpret EEG brain wave scans. The application can help predict brain seizures, so a patient can take medication or prevent injury from falling.Intel Corporation“The MCCCD was the first community college to partner with Intel on their AI for Workforce program in 2020. Within the last two years, we have been able to see our students gain new AI skills, and we are proud to have our first graduating class from the AI program this spring,” said MCCCD Interim Chancellor Steven R. Gonzales, in a statement. About 200 students are enrolled in the AI for Workforce program at Chandler-Gilbert Community College and now have access to the new AI lab. A total of 13,000 students attend the college, and all are eligible to apply for the AI for Workforce program.“We are committed to the re-skilling of the American workforce and to advancing diversity and inclusion to ensure that the next generation of technologists are prepared and provided opportunities for AI education,” said Michelle Johnston Holthaus, Intel executive vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group, in a statement.Local demand for AI talent is increasing in the Valley, and careers are projected to grow faster than the average rate for all employment over the next decade. In particular, a huge demand is expected in advanced manufacturing jobs as more electric vehicle manufacturers flock to Arizona along with new semiconductor production facilities, known as fabs.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is disrupting businesses and job roles in every industry, causing concerns about long-term job security for low-skill manual jobs and management roles alike.
To prepare for this AI-driven economy, many experienced managers and seasoned executives are turning to MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) to upskill in foundational data analytics and AI. This trend is unlikely to slow down anytime soon: The global MOOC market is expected to grow from $3.9 billion in 2018 to $20.8 billion by 2023, a CAGR of 40.1 percent.
Business and technology-related courses make up 40 percent of these online courses. Many universities have also joined the drive to fill the AI leadership gap by offering high-touch executive education programs.
While upskilling programs are easily accessible, many executives are unsure how to leverage their newfound skills to advance their careers. Becoming an AI “practitioner” may not be the right option for some given the high technical bar for these roles. Others may rule out “juniorizing,” which could take them a few steps back in their career.
[ Learn how leaders are embracing enterprise-wide IT automation: Taking the lead on IT Automation. ]
3 ways to advance your career in AI
Organizational leaders who complete such programs commonly have three questions:

Can I transition into a technology leadership role spearheading organizational initiatives in AI?
How do I combine my functional leadership experience with my newly acquired AI skills?
What new roles are being created in today’s AI economy that I can pivot into mid-career?

These aren’t simple questions to answer, and mid-career transformations are never easy. Based on my experience mentoring individuals and helping companies embrace AI-related technologies, here are three strategies leaders can adopt to reshape their careers.
1. Pivot into a technology role leading AI across the organization
Enterprises are carving out AI Centers of Excellence and adding emerging senior roles such as Chief Data Officer (CDO) or Chief Analytics Officer (CAO) to spearhead data and analytics. Gartner found that digital transformation at 72 percent of organizations surveyed was led or heavily influenced by data executives such as CDO. Senior executives who have acquired AI skills can reinvent their careers, shifting into a technology-centric role by leading AI initiatives within the organization.
These organizational transformations require leaders who can envision and strategize how to infuse analytics into the core of a business. They also need excellent execution abilities to build data and analytics teams, ensure fair and ethical use of AI, and help promote data-driven decisions. Overall, the role calls for a good mix of thought leadership, emotional intelligence, and conflict resolution skills.
NewVantage Partners found that 49 percent of companies preferred staffing such emerging data-centric leadership roles from within, utilizing people who can act as internal change agents.
2. Raise your functional expertise by leveraging AI’s capabilities
Enterprises are implementing AI widely in both customer-facing offerings and internal operations. As companies become more analytics-driven, they need leaders who can champion AI-driven strategic initiatives within their function, promote collaboration across teams, and drive adoption by managing change. A critical differentiating attribute of these “AI orchestrators” is deep functional experience and a strong understanding of how to apply AI to generate business value.
When it comes to AI, most enterprises focus primarily on senior technology roles such as principal data scientist, AI manager, or chief analytics officer. However, success with AI is impossible without strong functional leadership. This lopsided focus could help explain one of the biggest challenges in AI today: While over 95 percent of organizations have invested in AI, only 26 percent report creating a data-driven organization. Business leaders must take the lead in selling their vision for AI, ensure collaboration across teams, and own the adoption of AI solutions in their business.
3. Think outside the box to create new organizational roles
Accenture’s global study of more than 1,000 large companies points to the emergence of three new categories of AI-related jobs:

Trainers work with machines and teach AI systems to work effectively and accurately.
Explainers provide clarity and bridge the gap between AI specialists and business leaders.
Sustainers help keep operations going by avoiding unintended consequences of AI-enabled automation. Managers and leaders with deep industry experience will be well poised for the emerging roles of explainers and sustainers.

Let’s take the example of a traditional loan manager whose primary job is to examine, evaluate, and process lines of credit. The rise of online loan origination platforms like Rocket Mortgage could make loan managers obsolete. However, the credit and lending regulatory framework in the U.S. is currently not structured to enforce fair AI.
These loan managers can complement their existing knowledge to become “loan explainers” or “loan ethics managers” – people who can explain why a customer’s loan was denied by a “black-box” machine learning algorithm, for example. Similarly, this role can help lenders avoid potential discrimination issues and ensure compliance with the fast-evolving regulatory guidelines around the use of AI.
Putting the strategies to work
Picking the appropriate strategy from the three described above depends on a number of factors – your career aspirations, opportunities at hand, and your appetite for risk. Senior managers and executives must get creative by fusing their current strengths with newly acquired AI skills to lead in the age of AI.
It’s worth noting that leaders needn’t be constrained by opportunities that exist within an organization; they can pursue entrepreneurial opportunities in their industry. Right in the middle of the pandemic, venture capital funds have globally invested a record $268B in 2021. Startups can be an attractive proposition for experienced managers who combine a deep understanding of the industry’s under-served needs and customer pain points with the new possibilities unlocked by AI.
Power your AI career transformation by bolstering your credibility
Today, career transformations are facilitated by easy access to upskilling programs, abundant social platforms to network with peers, and accessible ways to build a strong personal identity.

Leaders are often advised to build a personal brand through LinkedIn presence, news bytes in articles, and event participation. And while an engaging personal brand might make your profile attractive and get you more likes on social media posts, strong personal credibility will help connect deeply with people who believe in your work.
To boost your credibility, network with an intent to add value, develop a strong point of view on the application of AI to business, and be able to articulate your ideas in a compelling way. For example, the AI space is nascent and yet to see heavy regulations (though it badly needs them). If you have an opinion on how organizations and the community can responsibly adopt AI, share it. Engage in participatory regulations on the use of AI in your industry.
Building personal credibility takes time and effort. Ensure you learn continuously, engage consistently, and establish a coherent footprint. This can lead to better career options and a more fulfilling career.

What Is Super AI?
Artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a form of AI that is capable of surpassing human intelligence by manifesting cognitive skills and developing thinking skills of its own.
Also known as super AI, artificial superintelligence is considered the most advanced, powerful, and intelligent type of AI that transcends the intelligence of some of the brightest minds, such as Albert Einstein.
Human-like Capabilities of Super AI
Machines with superintelligence are self-aware and can think of abstractions and interpretations that humans cannot. This is because the human brain’s thinking ability is limited to a set of a few billion neurons. Apart from replicating multi-faceted human behavioral intelligence, ASI can also understand and interpret human emotions and experiences. ASI develops emotional understanding, beliefs, and desires of its own, based on the comprehension capability of the AI.
ASI finds application in virtually all domains of human interests, be it math, science, arts, sports, medicine, marketing, or even emotional relations. An ASI system can perform all the tasks humans can, from defining a new mathematical theorem for a problem to exploring physics law while venturing into outer space.
ASI systems can quickly understand, analyze, and process circumstances to stimulate actions. As a result, the decision-making and problem-solving capabilities of super-intelligent machines are expected to be more precise than humans.
Currently, superintelligence is a theoretical possibility rather than a practical reality as most of the development today in computer science, and AI is inclined toward artificial narrow intelligence (ANI). This implies that AI programs are designed to solve only specific problems. 
Machine learning and deep learning algorithms are further advancing such programs by utilizing neural networks as the algorithms learn from the results to iterate and improve upon themselves. Thus, such algorithms process data more effectively than previous AI versions. However, despite the advancements in neural nets, these models can only solve problems at hand, unlike human intelligence.
Engineers, AI researchers, and practitioners are developing technology and machines with artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is expected to pave the way for ASI development. Although there have been significant developments in the area, such as IBM’s Watson supercomputer and Apple’s Siri, today’s computers cannot fully simulate and achieve an average human’s cognitive abilities and capabilities.

Typical characteristics of ASI
Luminaries in AI are still skeptical about the progression and sustainability of ASI in the long run. According to a recent study published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research in January 2021, researchers from premier institutes such as the Max Planck Institute concluded that it would be almost impossible for humans to contain super AIs.
The team of researchers explored the recent developments in machine learning, computational capabilities, and self-aware algorithms to map out the true potential of super-intelligent AI. They then performed experiments to test the system against some known theorems to evaluate whether containing it is feasible, if at all possible.
Nevertheless, if accomplished, superintelligence will usher a new era in technology with the potential to initiate another industrial revolution at a jaw-dropping pace. Some of the typical characteristics of ASI that will set it apart from other technologies and forms of intelligence include:

ASI will be one of the finest and possibly the last inventions that humans would ever need to make as it will constantly evolve to become more intelligent.
Superintelligence will accelerate technological progress across various fields such as AI programming, space research, discovery and development of medicines, academics, and plenty others.
ASI may further mature and develop advanced forms of superintelligence that may even enable artificial minds to be copied.
ASI, in the future, may also lead to technological singularity.

Potential Threats of Super AI Systems
While artificial superintelligence has numerous followers and supporters, many theorists and technological researchers have cautioned on the idea of machines surpassing human intelligence. They believe that such an advanced form of intelligence could lead to a global catastrophe, as shown in several Hollywood movies such as Star Trek and Matrix. Moreover, even technology experts such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk are apprehensive about ASI and consider it a threat to humanity.
Here are some of the potential threats of superintelligence.
Potential Threats of Super AI
1. Loss of control and understanding
One potential danger of superintelligence that has received a lot of attention from experts worldwide is that ASI systems could use their power and capabilities to carry out unforeseen actions, outperform human intellect, and eventually become unstoppable. Advanced computer science, cognitive science, nanotechnology, and brain emulations have achieved greater-than-human machine intelligence. 
If something goes wrong with any one of these systems, we won’t be in a position to contain them once they emerge. Moreover, predicting the system’s response to our requests will be very difficult. Loss of control and understanding can thus lead to the destruction of the human race altogether.
2. The weaponization of super AI
Today, it seems logical enough to think that highly advanced AI systems could potentially be used for social control or weaponization. Governments around the world are already using AI to strengthen their military operations. However, the addition of weaponized and conscious superintelligence could only transform and impact warfare negatively. 
Additionally, if such systems are unregulated, they could have dire consequences. Superhuman capabilities in programming, research & development, strategic planning, social influence, and cybersecurity could self-evolve and take positions that could become detrimental to humans.
3. Failure to align human and AI goals
Super AI can be programmed to our advantage; however, there lies a non-zero probability of super AI developing a destructive method to achieve its goals. Such a situation may arise when we fail to align our AI goals. For example, if you give a command to an intelligent car to drive you to the airport as fast as possible, it might get you to the destination but may use its own route to comply with the time constraint.
Similarly, if a super AI system is assigned a critical geoengineering project, it may disturb the overall ecosystem while completing the project. Moreover, any human attempt to stop the super AI system may be viewed by it as a threat to achieving its goals, which wouldn’t be an ideal situation to be in.
4. Malevolent superintelligence
The successful and safe development of AGI and superintelligence can be ensured by teaching it the aspects of human morality. However, ASI systems can be exploited by governments, corporations, and even sociopaths for various reasons, such as oppressing certain societal groups. Thus, superintelligence in the wrong hands can be devastating.
5. The danger of nuclear attacks
With ASI, autonomous weapons, drones, and robots could acquire significant power. The danger of nuclear attacks is another potential threat of superintelligence. Enemy nations can attack countries with technological supremacy in AGI or superintelligence with advanced and autonomous nuclear weapons, ultimately leading to destruction.
6. Ethical implications
Super-intelligent AI systems are programmed with a predetermined set of moral considerations. The problem is humanity has never agreed upon a standard moral code and has lacked an all-encompassing ethical theory. As a result, teaching human ethics and values to ASI systems can be quite complex.
Super-intelligent AI can have serious ethical complications, especially if AI exceeds the human intellect but is not programmed with the moral and ethical values that coincide with human society.

Potential Advantages of Super AI
Artificial superintelligence is an emerging technology that simulates human reasoning, emotions, and experiences in AI systems. Although detractors continue to debate the existential risks of super AI, the technology seems to be very beneficial as it can revolutionize any professional sector.
Let’s look at the potential advantages of super AI.
Potential Advantages of Super AI
1. Reduction in human error
It’s human to make errors. Computers, or machines, when appropriately programmed, can considerably reduce the instances of these mistakes. Consider the field of programming and development. Programming is a time- and resource-consuming process that demands logical, critical, and innovative thinking. 
Human programmers and developers often encounter syntactical, logical, arithmetic, and resource errors. Super AI can be helpful here as it can access millions of programs, build logic from the available data on its own, compile and debug programs, and at the same time, keep programming errors to a minimum.
2. Replace humans to accomplish risky tasks 
One of the most significant advantages of super AI is that the risk limitations of humans can be overcome by deploying super-intelligent robots to accomplish dangerous tasks. These can include defusing a bomb, exploring the deepest parts of the oceans, coal and oil mining, or even dealing with the consequences of natural or human-induced disasters.
Consider the Chernobyl nuclear disaster that occurred in 1986. At the time, AI-powered robots were not yet invented. The nuclear power plant’s radiation was so intense that it could kill any human who went close to the core in a matter of minutes. Authorities were forced to use helicopters to pour sand and boron from a distance above. 
However, with significant technological advancements, superintelligent robots can be deployed in such situations where salvage operations can be carried out without any human intervention.
3. 24×7 Availability
Although most humans work for 6 to 8 hours a day, we need some time out to recuperate and get ready for work the very next day. We also need weekly offs to keep a healthy work-life balance. However, using super AI, we can program machines to work 24×7 without any breaks.
For example, educational institutes have helpline centers that receive several queries daily. This can be effectively handled using super AI, providing query-specific solutions round the clock. Super AI can also offer subjective student counseling sessions to academic institutions.
4. Explore new science frontiers
Super AI can facilitate space exploration, as the technical challenges in developing a city on Mars, interstellar space travel, and even interplanetary travel can be addressed by the problem-solving capabilities of advanced AI systems. 
With a thinking ability of its own, super AI can be effectively used to test and estimate the success probabilities of many equations, theories, researches, rocket launches, and space missions. Organizations such as NASA, SpaceX, ISRO, and others are already using AI-powered systems and supercomputers such as the Pleiades to expand their space research efforts.
5. Medical advances
The development of super AI can also benefit the healthcare industry vertical significantly. It can play a pivotal role in drug discovery, vaccine development, and drug delivery. A 2020 research paper by Nature revealed the design and use of miniaturized intelligent nanobots for intracellular drug delivery. 
AI applications in healthcare for vaccine and drug delivery are already a reality today. Moreover, with the addition of conscious superintelligence, the discovery and delivery of new strains of medicines will become much more effective.

5 Key Trends for Super AI Advancements in 2022
Post-pandemic, we have witnessed accelerated adoption of AI and ML across industries. Moreover, automation, coupled with AI hardware and software developments, further pushes the super AI envelope. Although ASI is still in its infancy stage, recent AI trends will almost certainly lay the foundation for advanced AI systems in the future.
Let’s look at the five key AI trends that will speed up super AI advancements in 2022.
2022 Trends for Super AI Advancements
1. Development of large language models (LLMs)
Language models use NLP techniques and algorithms to predict the occurrence of a sequence of words in a sentence. Such models are expert systems that can summarize textual data and create visual charts from those very texts.
LLM models are trained on massive datasets. Popular examples of LLMs include OpenAIs GPT-2 and GPT-3 and Google’s BERT. Similarly, Naver, a South Korean company, has built a comprehensive AI-based Korean language model, HyperCLOVA. These models can generate simple essays, develop next-generation conversation AI tools, and even design complex financial models for corporations.
2. Advancements in multimodal AI
Deep learning algorithms have trained the underlying models on a single data source. For example, an NLP model is trained on the text data source, while a computer vision model is trained on an image dataset. Similarly, an acoustic model uses wake word detection and noise cancellation parameters to handle speech. The type of ML employed here is a single modal AI as the model outcome is mapped to one source of data type—text, images, and speech.
On the other hand, Multimodal AI combines visual and speech modalities to create scenarios that match human perception. DALL-E from OpenAI is a recent example of multimodal AI-generated images from texts. Google’s multimodal AI – multitask unified model (MUM) – helps enhance the user search experience since the search results are shortlisted by considering contextual information mined from 75 different languages. Another example is NVIDIA’s GauGAN2 model, which generates photo-realistic images from text inputs. It uses text-to-image generation to develop the finest photorealistic art.
3. AI-driven programming
There has been significant development in AI-driven programming in the last couple of years. Several tools such as Amazon CodeGuru have provided relevant recommendations to improve overall code quality by determining the application’s costly code. Moreover, recently, GitHub and OpenAI launched ‘Github Copilot’ as an ‘AI pair programmer’ to help programmers and developers write efficient code. Another example comes from Salesforce, where CodeT5 has been launched as an open-source project to assist programmers with AI-powered coding.
Thus, advancements in LLMs and wider availability of open source code will promote intelligent code generation, which will be compact and high quality. Additionally, such systems will also translate code from one language to another, opening up an application’s code to a broader community. 
4. Vertical integration of AI solutions
Top AI vendors such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft now commercialize their AI-based products. Amazon Connect and Google Contact Center AI are efforts for better contact center management. Both products leverage ML capabilities that offer automated assistance to contact center agents and drive conversations through bots. 
Moreover, Microsoft’s Azure Percept provides computer vision and conversational AI capabilities at the edge. It is based on IoT, AI, and edge computing services on Azure. The convergence of all these technologies, cutting-edge research in LLMs, and conversational and multimodal AIs will make the development of super AI possible in 2022.
5. AI-generated inventions
AI is already powering inventions in almost every domain, from creating music, art, and literature to developing scientific theories. Recently, DABUS, an artificial inventive machine, came up with ideas for two patentable inventions. While the first invention relates to a device that attracts attention and is helpful in search and rescue operations, the second is a type of beverage container. 
Moreover, it has been observed that the DABUS machine also has an emotional appreciation for whatever ideas it conceives. With advanced AI systems in place, the number of such inventions that solve complex problems can considerably increase over the coming years.
Progress in multimodal AI will give rise to the next wave in ‘creative AI,’ where AI-generated images, infographics, and even videos will be realized.

Women's day and Women's History Month are especially meaningful to me as a proud father of a daughter. I want my daughter to understand how wonderful and invaluable she is, not only to me and her mother, but also to everyone else in the world. Second, I want her to be exposed to amazing women who are accomplishing great things on a daily basis. I live, work and breathe AI and Technology. Through my work and research, I have encountered the work of countless amazing women in this sector. This month, I'd like to introduce you to nine incredible women who are making a difference in AI and Technology, as well as what barriers we all still face. During International Women's History Month, it is our pleasure to highlight and honor 9 women who are pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence and ensuring that technology advancements contribute to the greater good. 


The following is the first of ten articles in this series. This piece will center on the nine women I've spoken with over the last few weeks and their suggestions for other female professionals, young women, and girls who want to pursue a career in artificial intelligence, as well as what changes they see that must be addressed for true equality in the AI and technology field. The subsequent nine articles will feature the in-depth conversations we had.

If we truly believe that gender diversity positively affects outcomes in the tech industry, which I believe to be true, then I think the right thing to do is to focus on fixing the supply chain of women into these roles. We must start from very early education, and encourage little girls and young women to consider jobs in technology and national security as potential career options.

I see people who care about gender diversity, and they try to include women on panels, or they make an effort to hire women into certain jobs. But the issue is that there are not enough qualified candidates to go around. That's where we need to put our attention. We need to make sure that the supply chain is fixed, that we have a diverse set of talented individuals with whom we can collaborate.

I think what is women-specific is the need to have mentors, make connections, and see leaders in that role that look like them. We need to build up girls' confidence that these jobs are attainable, build their capabilities starting from a young age, and encourage them to pursue places where they belong.

What I want for my girls is to have the freedom of choice. Ultimately I want them to be aware of the opportunities available to them and to have the skills and the confidence to take advantage of those opportunities. I want them to be in touch with their talents and passions, to pursue those options that reflect their capabilities and interests. I want them to be able to do so free of societal expectations, be it around careers that may be deemed appropriate or inappropriate or about choices they make in their personal lives. I want them to be treated fairly and respectfully in the workplace and society.

To quote an old veteran in the space, there’s no other choice but to ‘lean in’. And while we’re making progress, the technology space has more room to evolve.
We have talented women everywhere, women who have worked really hard to perfect their craft, and sometimes they get faulted for prioritizing perfection over progress, sometimes they get reminded to stay in their swim lane, and sometimes their boldness is considered a fault vs virtue. While my experience may not align with all women in tech and their journey, what I have witnessed is, the way we’re able to lean in and lead is because we had that 1 leader, that 1 sponsor, and/or 1 person with influence to create a runway for us. And with that came opportunity, then success and then awareness of the talent.
So my 1st advice to women would be, know who you are and choose if you want to be a thermometer or thermostat? Are your aspirations to read the temperature in the room, or to create the temperature in the room? Because if it's the latter, be prepared for pushback. As this space requires a special backbone and not a wishbone. Change is hard, if it was easy it would have happened by now. So it requires a certain level of confidence and conviction to lead and you need to be prepared.
My 2nd advice would be … get comfortable with being uncomfortable. You lean in, you trip, you fall, you learn. That's okay. With each step forward you learn, the ‘ups and downs’ are the majority of the journey.
My 3rd advice would be, find that 1 person that believes in you! And co-create the opportunity and the aspirations together. You need that guardian on your side.
My 4th advice would be … if you get an opportunity to perfect your public speaking skills, take advantage of it. Get over that fear because once you do, that’s where the opportunities become boundaryless. I've seen some phenomenal women leaders who just aren't afraid to just get in there. I’ve followed their lead, and it’s opened up more doors than I can count.
 “Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. You lean in, you trip, you fall, you learn. That's okay. With each step forward you learn, the ‘ups and downs’ are the majority of the journey.” Sol Rashidi

Atti Riazi, Senior Vice President and CIO, DigITs Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer CenterAtefeh (Atti) Riazi CIO at Memorial Sloan KetteringAtti Riazi
A senior executive and philanthropist, Atefeh (Atti) Riazi has served in both the public and private sectors as a CIO, managing large‐scale technology projects and initiatives. She is presently the CIO at Memorial Sloan Kettering, which she joined in 2020. Prior to this role, she was appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to serve as the Assistant Secretary-General and Chief Information Technology Officer of the UN. 
Today we have 82 percent men and 18 percent women in the tech sector.
Getting girls and women to shift from being consumers of tech to contributors is critical. The sector is lopsided, and therefore does not fully understand its consumer base, nor does it take women’s views or perspectives into account in the design and operation of what it creates. Moreover, the digital gender divide leaves girls behind—and minority girls in particular. Those without access to training in tech will increasingly be forced to opt out of the global economy, leaving them walled-off in the informal sector and poverty.
There are three fundamental factors that must be countered to attract more women to the tech world: 1)We raise girls and boys differently from birth—we have girls play with dolls, while boys build things with Legos; 2) There is a very dry approach in teaching math and sciences, causing girls to lose interest early on; and 3) The geek mythology promoted by media seriously influences women’s views of the sector. I have two daughters and have witnessed all the social and media pressures on them that could negatively impact their views of all STEM fields. And so we can start with reorienting the family and the schools. Media behavior may follow accordingly. (And further along, we can, say, better support women’s global entrepreneurship by shifting from microfinancing to macro-financing).
Women care immensely about the impact and experience of tech. They want to use technology to improve education and healthcare globally and close the gender gap. They long for clean air, oceans, and rivers. They want to ensure wealth equity. Women care about peace and security, accessibility, and food security. We can use artificial intelligence and machine learning to help achieve many of these goals.
We can also use AI to end humanity. This new world will pose many new questions, possibilities, and risks that we must collectively prepare for, and so a balanced view and perspective is essential. We need women to become engaged, get involved, and participate in the new world we are creating.
“Our education system doesn't support girls who favor math or like engineering. And the way the media portrays girls and boys in technology is completely skewed. We have so many fundamental issues - the education sector, the family pressures, the media. We need to begin to address every one of them.” Atti Riazi

Her passion lies in merging fashion and culture with science and technology.
Increasing female representation in tech is essential for equality. Women have historically been underrepresented in STEM fields, and still are today. It’s a problem for many reasons. Women are not an equal part of creating the technology that increasingly shapes our lives, and are being left behind in the job market. But other than that, it’s also about creating better tech! The world needs more brains, more creativity and more perspectives in the development of the technology of tomorrow. We can’t afford missing out on so much female brain power!
I can’t stress enough the importance of encouraging more women to pursue a career in AI. I believe it is crucial that more women enter the field, both in technical and non-technical roles. I always claim that “responsible AI is better AI”. In the same way, diverse AI is better AI. Diversity in AI teams, and diverse perspectives in the development of AI is key to address challenges like algorithmic bias. A multitude of perspectives also opens up for a multitude of new ideas.

Dr. Vivienne Ming explores maximizing human capacity as a theoretical neuroscientist, delusional inventor, and demented author. Over her career she’s founded 6 startups, been chief scientist at 2 others, and launched the “mad science incubator”, Socos Labs, where she explores seemingly intractable problems—from a lone child’s disability to global economic inclusion—for free. As the co-founder and Chief Scientist of Dionysus Health she applies machine learning to lessen the corrosive health effects of chronic stress in communities.
We're all human, and being human means we're biased and we make mistakes and we fail. For that matter, being a thinking thing, including any kind of machine learning in any relevant domain also means it's biased and it has failure.
I've had a lot of transformations in my life. I've seen what it's like to be a man and a woman. I have been homeless and I've founded companies. Those don't seem like they go together, but they're my personal experience. My son had type 1 diabetes, and I was shocked that it was still handwritten notes and doctors squinting. Not that I appreciated it at the time, but I built the first AI to treat diabetes by hacking his equipment. Part of what that gives me is this very, maybe irrational, this absurd notion that I can change the world. We are not one thing and we don't have to be that thing

I’ve been involved in many efforts and interventions to bring more women into STEM and advance their careers. But, while we have managed to move the needle over a 50 year period– according to the last U.S. Census, women now represent 27% of the STEM workforce, up from 8% in 1970– the underrepresentation is still pretty vast, with women now representing approximately half of the workforce.
But, at the end of the day, the right incentives need to be there for a change. Without leaders having real accountability– the kind of accountability that impacts compensation and advancement– it will continue to be difficult to affect workplace cultural changes that make STEM attractive to women.
Unfortunately, we continue to see news reports of women experiencing hostile work environments in the technology field. This is very real. I know women who have altered their career courses because of the hostility they faced at their respective workplaces. And, frankly, the time commitments in this field can be brutal to meet deadlines and create the optics to appear dedicated.
We all see a profound thinning of the ranks of women as the STEM roles become more senior. It’s known that this is partially due to the demands on women as caretakers increasing and they're opting out of careers that don’t provide enough flexibility for them to manage their lives in full. But, I also believe there is the perception that women are not living up to some unwritten ideal that allows men to move up in their careers. And this elusive ideal causes women to be uncomfortable in bringing their authentic selves into the workplace. And, that is not an attractive proposition for anyone.
But, interestingly enough, I have some strong optimism coming out of the flexible work arrangements that have emerged during our pandemic lockdowns. Homelife and work-life have become more integrated, making a world of difference to the many women facing the demands of being the primary caretaker.
Our tolerance of home life entering the professional frame has changed enormously. I think that with the kids climbing on our laps and the dogs barking, and the leaf blowers in the background, we’ve all been forced towards greater authenticity and more 3-D views of each other. And, with often both spouses at home, there have been some shifts in the division of household labor.
So, I am optimistic about positive change here in the STEM workplace culture– possibly enough to tip the balance if we don’t let go of it.

The lack of women in technology has been a challenge for several decades, and in a way, we have inherited that problem with AI. Fortunately, the good news is unlike traditional software engineering roles where you need to know coding, AI has opened up plenty of critical roles that do not need coding. Good AI is not built just by data scientists and data engineers – they need a robust team of subject matter experts with domain knowledge leading and helping throughout the process – from ideation to design, development, and scaling.
AI actually, not only provides more pathways than any other technology but also provides tools and solutions to increase diversity. And we need to raise awareness amongst women in the workforce currently and also, those who are still in schools and colleges – about the myriad of pathways to become a part of AI teams. Yes, there will always be a need for data scientists and engineers, but there is also increasing demand for the other skill sets. If we do this right, I truly believe that we can get more women in AI.

Women always are inspired or motivated by not only challenges but also by consternation. I keep teaching this to my fellow women colleagues, and then my team, and also to my children. I teach how to stand up and walk again after a fall.
This is the main principle, in Silicon Valley specifically, that you could fail. It's okay to fail. You could fail many times, but then you dust off to get up again, and you try again, and you become resilient. You become a better version of yourself, and add to your experiences, and eventually, you succeed. It doesn't matter what age, or which stage of life. But you will succeed if you have the perseverance.

The first thing that women should be doing is exploring roles outside of pure computer science or data science. Look at all the fields that are impacted by technology or that can be impacted by advancements in technology and AI.
Women are doing amazing things combining arts, design, and AI. For example, there are women at the center for collaborative arts at Yale doing incredible work in creative arts and understanding how the brain works using data visualization. There is so much more to AI and technology. Do some research and find those women working in interdisciplinary roles and learn about their journeys.
“I encourage women to look at all aspects of technology, beyond computer science. For example, there is amazing work happening at MIT media lab and the center for collaborative arts at Yale. Women are doing amazing work in combining the arts, design, and STEM fields to make technology effective and accessible to the world. Find a field that really interests you and discover how it applies to technology, you’ll be pleasantly surprised!” Andrea Gallego
These words of guidance are tremendous for not only women and girls, but boys and grown men. We should all lean in, listen, and think about what was said. Only then can we strive to be a part of the future rather than cling to the past ways. I look forward to sharing the in-depth conversations I had with all of these women throughout Women’s History Month. In a very short time, I have learned a tremendous deal from these women, and I hope you will as well.

Prompts: The painter/A photograph/The future of art — made on Dream“You don’t take a photograph, you make it.”— Ansel AdamsPhotography wasn’t considered an art in the beginning. It was promptly embraced by the general public but was perceived as a mechanistic way to record the fleeting moments of life. It was a skill, a matter of technical ability, not an art.Yet it changed our relationship with art as we knew it. It liberated painters from the task of capturing reality as it is. It allowed them to move, free of ties, in the vast latent space that art offers. They could focus on the abstract, on painting ideas to transmit feelings that photos fail to catch. They could break the rules and explore the limits of what’s possible, finding meaning in questions that only exist within us.Photography also democratized the access to paintings — as taking a snapshot of reality was suddenly a matter of minutes and not days. At the same time, at least in the view of the elites, it cheapened the unique talent-based beauty of hand-made paintings. Not everyone was happy, but technology always finds a way.

And yes, they considered the ethical concerns.Photograph: Brownie Harris/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveBack in 1982, Andy Warhol was, somewhat infamously, turned into a robot. The machine was made by a Disney Imagineering veteran for a project that never really took off, but Warhol liked his animatronic self. “Machines have less problems,” he once said. “I’d like to be a machine, wouldn’t you?” The artist, who died in 1987, was a master of his own cult of personality, and the robot was practically a manifestation of how the world perceived him: meticulously crafted, if a bit rigid and monotone in his conversational style.SynthesisAre These the Hidden Deepfakes in the Anthony Bourdain Movie?Tom SimoniteI, TruffautAI Made a Movie—and the Results Are Horrifyingly EncouragingLauren GoodeMona LisaDeepfakes Are Getting Better, But They're Still Easy to SpotGregory BarberAndrew Rossi knows this. It’s part of the reason the filmmaker felt OK letting an artificially intelligent machine speak for Warhol in his new documentary series for Netflix. Based on a book of the same name, the six-part documentary The Andy Warhol Diaries is partially narrated by an AI reading the stories that the artist told diarist Pat Hackett. The voice sounds just like Warhol—and then you remember the voice the world knew was always a flat and robotic one. Warhol’s work is about questioning iconography and surface-level appeal. He kept his voice flat to maintain that image, to belie how much heart he actually put into it, Rossi says, adding “when he spoke, he continued this superficial performance that was also part of the way he dressed and the way he made art.”Even still, using an AI voice to speak for a beloved cultural figure—or anyone, really—isn’t without ethical quandaries. Rossi was already editing The Andy Warhol Diaries last summer when controversy erupted around director Morgan Neville using AI to recreate the voice of Anthony Bourdain for his doc Roadrunner. Rossi had been in consultation with the Andy Warhol Foundation about the AI recreation, and the Bourdain doc inspired a disclaimer that now appears a few minutes into Diaries stating that the voice was created with the Foundation’s permission. “When Andrew shared the idea of using an AI voice, I thought, ‘Wow, this is as bold as it is smart,’” says Michael Dayton Hermann, the foundation’s head of licensing.The Andy Warhol Diaries debuts Wednesday on Netflix.
Courtesy of NetflixBy being upfront, Rossi’s documentary avoids one of the big issues Roadrunner faced. Viewers know from the start that what they’re hearing is computer-generated; whereas a lot of the backlash Neville faced came because his deepfake wasn’t initially disclosed. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t still many unanswered questions about when it is and isn’t acceptable to recreate someone’s voice with a machine. In the Bourdain documentary, the words the AI speaks were actually written by the late chef, but there aren’t real recordings of him saying them. For Diaries, Warhol did once speak all the things the AI Andy says—he told them to Hackett—but they weren’t recorded at the time. Do these caveats make a difference? Both of those documentaries used AI because their subjects were deceased. Presumably, there would be a different set of ethical concerns if they were living. What if it wasn’t just the voices that were recreated? What if their likenesses were, too? AI and other technologies are improving to a point where digital effects can practically create whole performances. The question soon will be whether they should.Trending NowResearcher Explains Deepfake VideosZohaib Ahmed thinks about these things a lot. The CEO of Resemble AI, he’s the one Rossi turned to in order to create Warhol’s voice. But before Ahmed even signed on to the project, he made sure the Warhol Foundation had given consent. Generally, Resemble AI works with the voices of people who are still alive—largely making automated voice responses for call centers and the like—but the company says it remains strict about guidelines. “[Warhol’s] diaries are written in a really interesting way, almost like they’re meant to be read aloud. They’re in his voice,” Ahmed says. “It’s almost like this was an extension of Andy’s work, so we weren’t creating something that was an ethical dilemma for us.”So the project for the pair felt ethical, but not easy. For one, there was that voice Warhol crafted for himself—a monotone built from his Pittsburgh upbringing and years in the New York City art scene. For another, Ahmed and his team didn’t have a lot of that voice to work with. When the company started, it only had about 3 minutes and 12 seconds of audio data—and needed to create a voice that could read about 30 pages of text. To do that, Resemble’s AI engine used the characteristics—or phonemes—of Warhol’s voice that were in that dataset to predict the phonemes that weren’t in order to create a fairly full voice. That voice was then loaded into the company’s web platform, where users—in this case, Rossi—could type in what they want the voice to say and then ask the AI to make adjustments until it sounds the way they want it to. Being able to have that human involvement, Ahmed says, is “really powerful.” It even allowed Rossi to shift the emotion or have Warhol say words that required an accent—like, for example, the name of his friend and collaborator Jean-Michel Basquiat.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyGearThe 209 Best Prime Day Deals, Tested and Tracked By Our TeamBy Scott GilbertsonPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David GilbertSecurityHackers Claim to Have Leaked 1.1 TB of Disney Slack MessagesBy Lily Hay NewmanAdvertisementUltimately, the AI didn’t do quite everything based on just those few minutes. Along the way, Rossi brought in actor Bill Irwin to record some lines in a Warhol voice to help the machine learn the proper delivery. “We tried models combining 80 to 75 percent of the AI voices and 20 to 15 percent of Bill’s performance,” Rossi says. “In the end, Andy’s voice throughout the series presents a variation of ranges on this interpolated model.” Some words—“quaalude,” for example, or “Rorschach test” needed more pitch modulation, and sometimes Rossi inserted sounds into the algorithm phonetically, forcing the AI to say things a certain way through creative spelling. “Bear in mind,” the director says, “this is for Andy, who has a Pittsburgh accent but is delivering names and locations over the phone as a veteran New Yorker.”The Andy Warhol Diaries, then, serves as a reminder of what could be possible.

It’s part of the reason the filmmaker felt OK letting an artificially intelligent machine speak for Warhol in his new documentary series for Netflix. Based on a book of the same name, the six-part documentary The Andy Warhol Diaries is partially narrated by an AI reading the stories that the artist told diarist Pat Hackett. The voice sounds just like Warhol—and then you remember the voice the world knew was always a flat and robotic one. Warhol’s work is about questioning iconography and surface-level appeal. He kept his voice flat to maintain that image, to belie how much heart he actually put into it, Rossi says, adding “when he spoke, he continued this superficial performance that was also part of the way he dressed and the way he made art.”
Even still, using an AI voice to speak for a beloved cultural figure—or anyone, really—isn’t without ethical quandaries. Rossi was already editing The Andy Warhol Diaries last summer when controversy erupted around director Morgan Neville using AI to recreate the voice of Anthony Bourdain for his doc Roadrunner. Rossi had been in consultation with the Andy Warhol Foundation about the AI recreation, and the Bourdain doc inspired a disclaimer that now appears a few minutes into Diaries stating that the voice was created with the Foundation’s permission. “When Andrew shared the idea of using an AI voice, I thought, ‘Wow, this is as bold as it is smart,’” says Michael Dayton Hermann, the foundation’s head of licensing.
By being upfront, Rossi’s documentary avoids one of the big issues Roadrunner faced. Viewers know from the start that what they’re hearing is computer-generated; whereas a lot of the backlash Neville faced came because his deepfake wasn’t initially disclosed. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t still many unanswered questions about when it is and isn’t acceptable to recreate someone’s voice with a machine. In the Bourdain documentary, the words the AI speaks were actually written by the late chef, but there aren’t real recordings of him saying them. For Diaries, Warhol did once speak all the things the AI Andy says—he told them to Hackett—but they weren’t recorded at the time. Do these caveats make a difference? Both of those documentaries used AI because their subjects were deceased. Presumably, there would be a different set of ethical concerns if they were living. What if it wasn’t just the voices that were recreated? What if their likenesses were, too? AI and other technologies are improving to a point where digital effects can practically create whole performances. The question soon will be whether they should.
Zohaib Ahmed thinks about these things a lot. The CEO of Resemble AI, he’s the one Rossi turned to in order to create Warhol’s voice. But before Ahmed even signed on to the project, he made sure the Warhol Foundation had given consent. Generally, Resemble AI works with the voices of people who are still alive—largely making automated voice responses for call centers and the like—but the company says it remains strict about guidelines. “[Warhol’s] diaries are written in a really interesting way, almost like they’re meant to be read aloud. They’re in his voice,” Ahmed says. “It’s almost like this was an extension of Andy’s work, so we weren’t creating something that was an ethical dilemma for us.”
So the project for the pair felt ethical, but not easy. For one, there was that voice Warhol crafted for himself—a monotone built from his Pittsburgh upbringing and years in the New York City art scene. For another, Ahmed and his team didn’t have a lot of that voice to work with. When the company started, it only had about 3 minutes and 12 seconds of audio data—and needed to create a voice that could read about 30 pages of text. To do that, Resemble’s AI engine used the characteristics—or phonemes—of Warhol’s voice that were in that dataset to predict the phonemes that weren’t in order to create a fairly full voice. That voice was then loaded into the company’s web platform, where users—in this case, Rossi—could type in what they want the voice to say and then ask the AI to make adjustments until it sounds the way they want it to. Being able to have that human involvement, Ahmed says, is “really powerful.” It even allowed Rossi to shift the emotion or have Warhol say words that required an accent—like, for example, the name of his friend and collaborator Jean-Michel Basquiat.
Ultimately, the AI didn’t do quite everything based on just those few minutes. Along the way, Rossi brought in actor Bill Irwin to record some lines in a Warhol voice to help the machine learn the proper delivery. “We tried models combining 80 to 75 percent of the AI voices and 20 to 15 percent of Bill’s performance,” Rossi says. “In the end, Andy’s voice throughout the series presents a variation of ranges on this interpolated model.” Some words—“quaalude,” for example, or “Rorschach test” needed more pitch modulation, and sometimes Rossi inserted sounds into the algorithm phonetically, forcing the AI to say things a certain way through creative spelling. “Bear in mind,” the director says, “this is for Andy, who has a Pittsburgh accent but is delivering names and locations over the phone as a veteran New Yorker.”
The Andy Warhol Diaries, then, serves as a reminder of what could be possible. It doesn’t fully answer all the questions currently swirling around the ethics of using AI to bring back long-lost luminaries—but it does demonstrate how close the technology can get to recreating the past while also being transparent about what exactly it is. “When I first heard the AI-created voice,” Hermann says, “I felt confident it was going to be an incredibly effective way to bring Warhol’s diaries to life and humanize the enigmatic artist.” Maybe, in other words, a robot can help us understand him better than anything.

International Women’s Day 2022 online event: Is AI advancing gender equality?

This March 8, on the occasion of International Women’s Day 2022, a virtual panel discussion will be held from 5-6pm to explore the unique opportunities and challenges that AI presents for women’s working lives. The discussion will be based on the new joint report by UNESCO, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), entitled “The Effects of AI on Women’s Working Lives.”
Globally, studies show that working women are paid less, hold fewer leadership positions, and participate less in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.                        In engineering and digital schools, women make up an average of 20 percent of enrollment and hold only 29 percent of data science and AI positions, according to a 2019 Unesco report. That same year, 80% of AI professors were men and 12% of AI researchers were women.            Algorithms are therefore mostly programmed by male developers and automatically reproduce their more or less conscious gender stereotypes before they are widely disseminated. The data that feeds them reflect the inequalities of our societies and the disinterest of young girls for STEM or ICT can only amplify them.
Online event: ‘The effects of AI on women’s working lives’.
The discussion will be based on the new joint UNESCO, OECD and IDB report “The Effects of AI on Women’s Working Lives” and will focus on the three main themes highlighted in the report:

Changing skill needs in the labor market;
The effects of AI on women entering the labor market;

AI’s impacts on women’s work environment and career progression.
 Keynote Address:


Tawfik Jelassi ,  Assistant Director-General, UNESCO,
Ulrik Vestergaard Knudsen ,  Deputy Secretary-General, OECD.

Confirmed panelists :


Dorothy Gordon, Chair of the Information for All Programme and Board Member of the Institute for Information Technologies in Education, UNESCO
Tamara Dancheva, Senior Director of International Relations, GSMA
Dirk Meyer, Head of the Directorate General for Global Health, Private Sector, Trade and Rural Development, German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development
Marta Ochoa, Youth Director and Senior Equal Opportunities Coordinator, UNI Global Union
Livia Gouvea Gomes, Labour Market Expert, IDB.

This panel will be moderated by Gina Neff, Executive Director of the Minderoo Center for Technology & Democracy at the University of Cambridge and Professor of Technology and Society at the University of Oxford, a member of the Women4AI Daring Circle, co-author of the report. On March 3, she published an article on the OECD website, “AI must not make women’s working lives worse.”
AI to close the gender gap.

While AI algorithms have replicated our society’s biases, it’s not too late to bend their impacts for women’s work lives with reliable, socially representative data.
AI for job search.

One of the key challenges for employment services is to facilitate the matching of skills required in job vacancies with those available to job seekers. A BID report “Artificial Intelligence for Job Search “from 2020 focuses on how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used as a tool to improve the matching approach, as far as considering existing relationships in various occupations, which can include more information in the analysis of job applicants’ profiles.
Today, artificial intelligence powers many job search engines, online job postings, and referrals and is used to automate parts of the hiring process for large companies.
However it is the employers who choose the data on which Artificial Intelligence selects future employees, so the algorithms incorporate their biases. For example, in 2015, Amazon had acknowledged that its algorithmic recruiting evaluated candidates for developer positions in a gender-biased way.
On the other hand, AI algorithms based on successful past hires in the tech sector, where women are underrepresented, may perpetuate bias in the future, thus exacerbating gender inequality in the sector.
Women’s digital skills.

In 2020, UNESCO published a study explaining the role that gender-responsive education can play in ending gender-based conceptions of technology and ensuring gender equality in digital education.                                The paper highlighted the paradox of ICT: countries with the highest levels of gender equality, such as Europe, also have the lowest rates of women pursuing higher education leading to employment in the technology sector.
The study also drew attention to the fact that digital assistants are almost all feminized. While industrial robots have mostly male names, personal assistants whose main function is to serve, listen and serve have female voices and are called Siri or Alexa.
The research that will serve as the basis for discussion in this panel shows that women in the workforce today are in fewer leadership positions, are less likely to have science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) skills, are in more precarious jobs, and, on average, are paid less for the same work than their male counterparts.
Conclusions.
Studies have found that teams with mixed AI projects are the most successful. Women’s place in the AI world is therefore strategic, and encouraging careers in the science and digital world is essential to increasing women’s representation.
Governments and civil society have a role to play in ensuring that women thrive in an AI-based future. Developers must ensure transparency and accountability, as well as share research and data. This will allow governments, organizations, academics, and others to monitor and mitigate gender bias in AI systems.

In the previous century, also known as the 20th, there once was a prevailing thought that technology would be used to bring the world to a utopian state. The entire premise of The Jetsons was based on this. It was also thought that the advent of artificial intelligence could bring about either a benevolently super-efficient world system or doom us all to the thrall of machine overlords. But it probably never would have occurred to the futurists of the 20th century, not even in their wildest dream, that once artificial intelligence was developed, it would almost immediately be put to use to create nightmare landscapes of killer clowns. Behold:








Once you have stopped shivering and maybe sit down and thought some calming thoughts, let us go through the video above. That relentlessly psychologically damaging one-minute video is the work of artificial intelligence, namely an upscale-interpolation machine learning neural network models. That essentially means a machine that can resize and re-pixelate images and create new ones that it learns along the way, developing a kind of infinite loop of unique images based on the same initial building blocks. Based on the horrific, bizarrely toothy killer clowns populating that trip of a video, someone fed this AI a copy of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and a book about three-ring circuses, and then walked away. 





But all terrifying looping journeys through an endless chasm of auto-generating killer clowns aside, the concept of artificial intelligence-generated art is causing all sorts of issues to spring up. Just recently, the U.S. Copyright Office determined that AI-generated art cannot be copyrighted, ruling that “human authorship is a prerequisite to copyright protection.” While that decision is being appealed and brought to federal court (and it would be surprising if that or some similar case were not eventually before the Supreme Court), it shows the unexpected legal questions generated like so many killer clowns in your dreams. 
As one might be expected, even without the benefit of creating your very own unique killer clown, the idea of artificial intelligence-generated art is taking off as a form of commerce. Non-fungible tokens of killer clowns are available to be generated by the AI as seen in the video above, and apps are available to auto-create the kind of artwork of your choice. What ultimate effect this has on the massive killer clown art market of the world is yet to be seen, but it is sure to be strange. On the other hand, there are people in the world that are still pursuing more traditional avenues of technological development, like the development of standard-issue killer robots. Or if that is not good enough for you, there are also killer robot cheetahs. And if still not good enough, as a species, we have also come up with the sterling idea of killer robot dogs who also are guns. But really, why do we need an artificial intelligence to create killer clowns, when we already have their perfected form?

During the past decade, China has made rapid advances in technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and emerged as a leader in many high-tech fields such as artificial intelligence. To continue supporting the burgeoning AI industry, the Chinese government has been devoting huge efforts to nurturing the next-generation AI workforce, implementing AI education programs not only at the post-secondary level but also at the K-12 level, with a model that features robust public-private partnership. China has made significant progress in terms of integrating and instituting AI education in its centrally planned, locally implemented school curriculums. Researchers at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada (APF Canada) have recently examined the current state of AI development across APEC member economies, including China, and the ongoing social momentum to include AI in education curriculums around the world. The team has also conducted a comparative study of Canada’s and South Korea’s diverging experience of introducing AI education at the K-12 level, while highlighting the need to continue drawing lessons from good practices across the region. To complement these analyses, this short report looks at China’s primary and secondary AI education to determine its unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. 
China’s Public Education System
China’s public education system is the world’s largest, with 282 million students and over 17 million teachers in about 530,000 schools (excluding extracurricular educational institutions) in total.[1] The Ministry of Education (MOE) administers the macro-level planning, curriculum standards, policy guidance, and budget allocation for China’s primarily state-run education system, with relatively little private sector involvement.[2] Under the MOE, there are provincial-level education departments and city-/county-level education bureaus that are responsible for localizing and implementing the centrally formulated overarching guidelines. 
In China, people conventionally refer to “basic education” as the nine years of state-funded, compulsory primary and junior high school education. Starting with a stark literacy rate of 20 per cent in 1949, public school enrolment rates have jumped in the past decades, particularly following a series of reforms in the 1980s, catching up with the levels in high-income countries. The net enrolment rate in primary education and the gross enrolment rate for junior high schools reached 99.94 per cent and 102.6 per cent, respectively, in 2019,[3] and the literacy rate reached 97 per cent in 2018.[4] The education system also underwent significant changes in 2001 with the launch of the landmark New Curriculum Reform policy, which decentralized policy decisions in curriculum management to encourage flexibility and needs-based diversification at the local level. [5]
Notwithstanding significant achievements in internet user penetration in China, urban-rural disparities remain a hurdle in the country’s education system. For information and communications technology (ICT) education such as coding, robotics, and AI, the remaining gap in internet penetration rates across China – with nearly 80 per cent in urban regions versus 59 per cent in rural villages[6] – constantly poses a challenge to education. Ensuring education equality for rural and migrant children (from rural families that are temporarily working and living in urban areas) remains one of the MOE’s top priorities. 
Initiatives by the Ministry of Education
The teaching of artificial intelligence is a relatively recent addition to the information technology curriculum of China’s K-12 education. In 2017, the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan was issued by the State Council as the guiding document of the country’s pursuit of becoming “the world’s primary AI innovation center” by 2030.[7] One of the key areas of this plan is to enhance people’s awareness and use of AI technologies through the promotion of universal AI education – meaning that it is intended to be available to every single student going through the public school system. In particular, the plan proposed the offering of “AI-related courses in primary and secondary schools,” as well as the “construction and improvement of AI public education infrastructure.”[8] Following this country-wide policy, MOE drafted the Artificial Intelligence Action Plan for Institutions of Higher Education in April 2018, listing the “construction of a multi-layer AI education program including that at the primary and secondary school levels”[9] as a major policy action in the effort of nurturing AI talent. Another MOE document released around the same time, the Education Informatization 2.0 Action Plan, also included plans for the “substantiation of IT curriculum with content on AI and coding,” so as to “better adapt to the needs of development in the information era.”[10]
To implement these policies, MOE initiated the Primary and Secondary AI Education Program in September 2018 to work together with city-level science academies, schools, and private sector partners to design top-level AI courses for K-12 students. The program provided schemes to distribute AI teaching equipment to schools as well as guidance on curriculum planning. According to the latest Curriculum Standards for Information Technology (IT) in Ordinary High Schools to be fully implemented by the fall 2022 semester, “primary concepts of artificial intelligence” will become one of the six “optional compulsory modules”[11] in senior high schools. The IT education standards for high schools also stipulate that students have a basic understanding of the “concepts and core algorithms of AI,” familiarity with the “basic AI applications using open-source frameworks,” and “ethical and security challenges in an intelligent society.”[12]

A brief timeline of major national policies on primary and secondary AI education in China.

Cities and schools selected to launch pilot AI courses have been given considerable flexibility and autonomy on their curriculum design and choice of textbook. As in the case of IT education, the MOE encourages local education authorities to co-ordinate “the writing and adoption of a textbook that suits the local condition and school schedules.”[13] Since 2018, several versions of AI textbooks have been released – in most cases co-authored by experts in education paired with AI industry practitioners – usually distinguished from one another by their target audience, content focus, and relation to the broader teachings of IT.
Partnerships Between the Private Sector and Academic Institutions
China’s private sector plays an active and instrumental role in complementing the state-run AI education policies. AI and tech companies have functioned as “technical partners” for schools and regional education authorities, co-designing curriculums and textbooks for AI courses at primary and secondary schools. They also provide partner schools with the necessary tools and platforms for teaching and learning AI skills. 
Since the Development Plan was announced in 2017, a number of Chinese tech and AI unicorns have been actively channelling their strengths and resources into public education. Among the first movers in this field was Hong Kong-based AI company SenseTime, who collaborated with the Massive Open Online Course Center (MOOC Center) at East China Normal University to publish the Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (High School Edition), said to be the world’s first AI textbook, in 2018. The company later established a separate subsidiary called SenseTime Edu to support the offering of an integrated, “whole package of AI education solutions.”[14] This includes initiatives such as providing learning platforms, labs, and educational robots leveraging its proprietary technologies; compiling a K-12 all-age textbook series; and offering teacher training and certification programs.[15]
Meanwhile, iFlytek, a Chinese intelligent speech/AI leader and established name in smart education, partnered with Northwest Normal University and the National Center for Educational Technology in 2018 to create the first junior high school AI textbook. The textbook includes the exclusive use of an online practice kit developed by iFlytek. The company has also organized teacher training sessions and robotics contests for the K-12 audience.
While companies provide the technical side of curricular design, top universities in China, such as the aforementioned East China Normal University and Northwest Normal University, have mainly been supporting these initiatives by providing pedagogical support for the drafting of AI textbooks and curriculums. East China Normal University prioritized work in the intersection of AI and education by founding the Shanghai Institute for AI Education (iAIE) in 2020.[16] Although its current focus is on using AI technologies to empower education, the institute will be well positioned and endowed to generate resources for teaching AI as a subject down the road. 
In addition, some institutions and associations are playing more of a convening role, bringing stakeholders together to discuss issues related to AI education. One recent example is the AI Education Conference for Primary & Secondary Schools[17] co-organized in July 2021 by the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence, the High School Affiliated to Renmin University, and a number of business partners, including Future Gene, iFlytek, and Walnut Programming. Experiences from some of the earliest and most successful pilot programs were shared during the sessions.
Strengths and Weaknesses of China’s AI Education at the Primary and Secondary Level
China’s successful integration of AI education at the K-12 level can be attributed to several factors. The Chinese government views domestic research, application, and innovation in artificial intelligence as a matter of strategic importance, for which developing an AI talent pool and pipeline is critical. Although the MOE has shifted from “direct control to macro-level monitoring of the education system,”[18] it still wields unilateral power in the country’s broad education agenda-setting and decision-making processes. While the MOE takes the lead in setting up overarching frameworks and providing the jump-start, these centrally directed initiatives have been quickly followed by implementation at the local level by practitioners. Backed by the policy commitment at the state level, AI education for K-12 has attracted the interest of private sector stakeholders and created hype in the market. 
The teaching of AI also benefited from the rapid development of China’s AI industry itself and by the wealth of experience accumulated in recent decades from the many existing school-industry partnerships on IT education. China’s generation Z (born between the late 1990s and the early 2010s) grew up in the midst of the country’s fastest economic expansion and modernization, and they have been exposed to digital technologies since birth. Even before AI became part of their school curriculum, many of them gained some exposure to AI through the internet, TV, and print media. Placing a high value on the learning of science and technologies, students’ familiarity and interest are important foundations for AI education to be well received in schools. 
More broadly speaking, China nowadays is likely deploying AI and other emerging digital technologies more than most other AI powers do. Both policy-makers and the public are more readily accepting of experimenting with and installing new technologies that they deem to enhance the efficiency and convenience of their work and life. Therefore, there are already a variety of options available, not just in IT and sciences but also in linguistics, psychology, and social studies, for the students’ learning and practising of AI technologies through hands-on, real-life applications. It is also in this context that cutting-edge innovations, including artificial intelligence, are seen as promising occupations in the eyes of students and parents, and thus are appealing in the early stages of education.
On the flip side, the most salient weak spot in China’s current public school education on AI is the lack of a clearly defined, systematic standard for what should be taught at each level.[19] The existing AI curriculums and textbooks, for instance, usually differ in their content arrangements and day-to-day approaches, some of which may not fit students’ cognitive ability and level of knowledge in science and mathematics, and may not adequately prepare students for their deeper dive at the post-secondary level.[20] Another limitation lies in the shortage of qualified, experienced teachers for this relatively new subject – only 35.2 per cent of teachers surveyed, most of whom work at more advanced coastal-region demonstration schools where pilot programs are usually rolled out first, had some experience teaching AI-related content. About a third of these teachers further expressed a lack of confidence in their qualification to teach AI courses.[21] 
In addition, much work remains to be done on building the supporting infrastructure for AI education. The majority of schools that have launched AI courses so far did not build a dedicated AI lab, but instead have used their existing IT labs, which are often not adequately equipped for AI teaching.[22] Students in rural areas will continue to be more severely challenged in their access to IT and tech resources. The fact that AI education is currently more of a privilege for the developed regions and schools – where pilot courses first get rolled out – could potentially further exacerbate the problems of regional disparity and the digital divide. Recent survey results indicate that 85.2 per cent of students enrolled in demonstration schools, compared to 67.3 per cent in regular public schools, have some understanding of AI,[23] and this figure would likely go down even further for the rural population. Bridging the gap related to exposure to AI – especially putting in place the necessary facilities and resources to give children an equal footing in learning AI – remains a huge task for the MOE, schools, and their partners.
Conclusion
In building its AI industry, the Chinese government has very much played a macro-level direction-setting and investor-like role, and it is now acting similarly on the AI education front. Even though China’s national education authority operates in a more decentralized manner now than it did decades ago, its decisions remain powerful and are taken very seriously by local education practitioners and the private sector. Public-private partnerships on AI education take shape differently in each country, but China’s powerful state actor ensures that these partnerships have somewhat an equal presence and role to play for the pedagogical and technical sides. 
Although still in the early stages of implementation, China’s AI education model offers an alternative for AI educators in Canada to look at – despite different education systems, many end goals are shared, and some of the existing challenges are in fact quite common. It is hoped that educators in Canada will recognize the importance of nurturing the next-generation AI talents earlier in schooling and can draw inspiration from the Chinese experience in terms of initiating its own model that orchestrates private and public efforts and attracts all kinds of partners for the much-needed co-ordination.

To continue supporting the burgeoning AI industry, the Chinese government has been devoting huge efforts to nurturing the next-generation AI workforce, implementing AI education programs not only at the post-secondary level but also at the K-12 level, with a model that features robust public-private partnership. China has made significant progress in terms of integrating and instituting AI education in its centrally planned, locally implemented school curriculums. Researchers at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada (APF Canada) have recently examined the current state of AI development across APEC member economies, including China, and the ongoing social momentum to include AI in education curriculums around the world. The team has also conducted a comparative study of Canada’s and South Korea’s diverging experience of introducing AI education at the K-12 level, while highlighting the need to continue drawing lessons from good practices across the region. To complement these analyses, this short report looks at China’s primary and secondary AI education to determine its unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. 

China’s Public Education System

China’s public education system is the world’s largest, with 282 million students and over 17 million teachers in about 530,000 schools (excluding extracurricular educational institutions) in total.[1] The Ministry of Education (MOE) administers the macro-level planning, curriculum standards, policy guidance, and budget allocation for China’s primarily state-run education system, with relatively little private sector involvement.[2] Under the MOE, there are provincial-level education departments and city-/county-level education bureaus that are responsible for localizing and implementing the centrally formulated overarching guidelines. 

In China, people conventionally refer to “basic education” as the nine years of state-funded, compulsory primary and junior high school education. Starting with a stark literacy rate of 20 per cent in 1949, public school enrolment rates have jumped in the past decades, particularly following a series of reforms in the 1980s, catching up with the levels in high-income countries. The net enrolment rate in primary education and the gross enrolment rate for junior high schools reached 99.94 per cent and 102.6 per cent, respectively, in 2019,[3] and the literacy rate reached 97 per cent in 2018.[4] The education system also underwent significant changes in 2001 with the launch of the landmark New Curriculum Reform policy, which decentralized policy decisions in curriculum management to encourage flexibility and needs-based diversification at the local level. [5]

Notwithstanding significant achievements in internet user penetration in China, urban-rural disparities remain a hurdle in the country’s education system. For information and communications technology (ICT) education such as coding, robotics, and AI, the remaining gap in internet penetration rates across China – with nearly 80 per cent in urban regions versus 59 per cent in rural villages[6] – constantly poses a challenge to education. Ensuring education equality for rural and migrant children (from rural families that are temporarily working and living in urban areas) remains one of the MOE’s top priorities. 

Initiatives by the Ministry of Education

The teaching of artificial intelligence is a relatively recent addition to the information technology curriculum of China’s K-12 education. In 2017, the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan was issued by the State Council as the guiding document of the country’s pursuit of becoming “the world’s primary AI innovation center” by 2030.[7] One of the key areas of this plan is to enhance people’s awareness and use of AI technologies through the promotion of universal AI education – meaning that it is intended to be available to every single student going through the public school system. In particular, the plan proposed the offering of “AI-related courses in primary and secondary schools,” as well as the “construction and improvement of AI public education infrastructure.”[8] Following this country-wide policy, MOE drafted the Artificial Intelligence Action Plan for Institutions of Higher Education in April 2018, listing the “construction of a multi-layer AI education program including that at the primary and secondary school levels”[9] as a major policy action in the effort of nurturing AI talent. Another MOE document released around the same time, the Education Informatization 2.0 Action Plan, also included plans for the “substantiation of IT curriculum with content on AI and coding,” so as to “better adapt to the needs of development in the information era.”[10]

To implement these policies, MOE initiated the Primary and Secondary AI Education Program in September 2018 to work together with city-level science academies, schools, and private sector partners to design top-level AI courses for K-12 students. The program provided schemes to distribute AI teaching equipment to schools as well as guidance on curriculum planning. According to the latest Curriculum Standards for Information Technology (IT) in Ordinary High Schools to be fully implemented by the fall 2022 semester, “primary concepts of artificial intelligence” will become one of the six “optional compulsory modules”[11] in senior high schools. The IT education standards for high schools also stipulate that students have a basic understanding of the “concepts and core algorithms of AI,” familiarity with the “basic AI applications using open-source frameworks,” and “ethical and security challenges in an intelligent society.”[12]

Cities and schools selected to launch pilot AI courses have been given considerable flexibility and autonomy on their curriculum design and choice of textbook. As in the case of IT education, the MOE encourages local education authorities to co-ordinate “the writing and adoption of a textbook that suits the local condition and school schedules.”[13] Since 2018, several versions of AI textbooks have been released – in most cases co-authored by experts in education paired with AI industry practitioners – usually distinguished from one another by their target audience, content focus, and relation to the broader teachings of IT.

Partnerships Between the Private Sector and Academic Institutions

China’s private sector plays an active and instrumental role in complementing the state-run AI education policies. AI and tech companies have functioned as “technical partners” for schools and regional education authorities, co-designing curriculums and textbooks for AI courses at primary and secondary schools. They also provide partner schools with the necessary tools and platforms for teaching and learning AI skills. 

Since the Development Plan was announced in 2017, a number of Chinese tech and AI unicorns have been actively channelling their strengths and resources into public education. Among the first movers in this field was Hong Kong-based AI company SenseTime, who collaborated with the Massive Open Online Course Center (MOOC Center) at East China Normal University to publish the Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (High School Edition), said to be the world’s first AI textbook, in 2018. The company later established a separate subsidiary called SenseTime Edu to support the offering of an integrated, “whole package of AI education solutions.”[14] This includes initiatives such as providing learning platforms, labs, and educational robots leveraging its proprietary technologies; compiling a K-12 all-age textbook series; and offering teacher training and certification programs.[15]

Meanwhile, iFlytek, a Chinese intelligent speech/AI leader and established name in smart education, partnered with Northwest Normal University and the National Center for Educational Technology in 2018 to create the first junior high school AI textbook. The textbook includes the exclusive use of an online practice kit developed by iFlytek. The company has also organized teacher training sessions and robotics contests for the K-12 audience.

While companies provide the technical side of curricular design, top universities in China, such as the aforementioned East China Normal University and Northwest Normal University, have mainly been supporting these initiatives by providing pedagogical support for the drafting of AI textbooks and curriculums. East China Normal University prioritized work in the intersection of AI and education by founding the Shanghai Institute for AI Education (iAIE) in 2020.[16] Although its current focus is on using AI technologies to empower education, the institute will be well positioned and endowed to generate resources for teaching AI as a subject down the road. 

In addition, some institutions and associations are playing more of a convening role, bringing stakeholders together to discuss issues related to AI education. One recent example is the AI Education Conference for Primary &amp; Secondary Schools[17] co-organized in July 2021 by the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence, the High School Affiliated to Renmin University, and a number of business partners, including Future Gene, iFlytek, and Walnut Programming. Experiences from some of the earliest and most successful pilot programs were shared during the sessions.

Strengths and Weaknesses of China’s AI Education at the Primary and Secondary Level

China’s successful integration of AI education at the K-12 level can be attributed to several factors. The Chinese government views domestic research, application, and innovation in artificial intelligence as a matter of strategic importance, for which developing an AI talent pool and pipeline is critical. Although the MOE has shifted from “direct control to macro-level monitoring of the education system,”[18] it still wields unilateral power in the country’s broad education agenda-setting and decision-making processes. While the MOE takes the lead in setting up overarching frameworks and providing the jump-start, these centrally directed initiatives have been quickly followed by implementation at the local level by practitioners. Backed by the policy commitment at the state level, AI education for K-12 has attracted the interest of private sector stakeholders and created hype in the market. 

The teaching of AI also benefited from the rapid development of China’s AI industry itself and by the wealth of experience accumulated in recent decades from the many existing school-industry partnerships on IT education. China’s generation Z (born between the late 1990s and the early 2010s) grew up in the midst of the country’s fastest economic expansion and modernization, and they have been exposed to digital technologies since birth. Even before AI became part of their school curriculum, many of them gained some exposure to AI through the internet, TV, and print media. Placing a high value on the learning of science and technologies, students’ familiarity and interest are important foundations for AI education to be well received in schools. 

More broadly speaking, China nowadays is likely deploying AI and other emerging digital technologies more than most other AI powers do. Both policy-makers and the public are more readily accepting of experimenting with and installing new technologies that they deem to enhance the efficiency and convenience of their work and life. Therefore, there are already a variety of options available, not just in IT and sciences but also in linguistics, psychology, and social studies, for the students’ learning and practising of AI technologies through hands-on, real-life applications. It is also in this context that cutting-edge innovations, including artificial intelligence, are seen as promising occupations in the eyes of students and parents, and thus are appealing in the early stages of education.

On the flip side, the most salient weak spot in China’s current public school education on AI is the lack of a clearly defined, systematic standard for what should be taught at each level.[19] The existing AI curriculums and textbooks, for instance, usually differ in their content arrangements and day-to-day approaches, some of which may not fit students’ cognitive ability and level of knowledge in science and mathematics, and may not adequately prepare students for their deeper dive at the post-secondary level.[20] Another limitation lies in the shortage of qualified, experienced teachers for this relatively new subject – only 35.2 per cent of teachers surveyed, most of whom work at more advanced coastal-region demonstration schools where pilot programs are usually rolled out first, had some experience teaching AI-related content. About a third of these teachers further expressed a lack of confidence in their qualification to teach AI courses.[21] 

In addition, much work remains to be done on building the supporting infrastructure for AI education. The majority of schools that have launched AI courses so far did not build a dedicated AI lab, but instead have used their existing IT labs, which are often not adequately equipped for AI teaching.[22] Students in rural areas will continue to be more severely challenged in their access to IT and tech resources. The fact that AI education is currently more of a privilege for the developed regions and schools – where pilot courses first get rolled out – could potentially further exacerbate the problems of regional disparity and the digital divide. Recent survey results indicate that 85.2 per cent of students enrolled in demonstration schools, compared to 67.3 per cent in regular public schools, have some understanding of AI,[23] and this figure would likely go down even further for the rural population. Bridging the gap related to exposure to AI – especially putting in place the necessary facilities and resources to give children an equal footing in learning AI – remains a huge task for the MOE, schools, and their partners.

Conclusion

In building its AI industry, the Chinese government has very much played a macro-level direction-setting and investor-like role, and it is now acting similarly on the AI education front. Even though China’s national education authority operates in a more decentralized manner now than it did decades ago, its decisions remain powerful and are taken very seriously by local education practitioners and the private sector. Public-private partnerships on AI education take shape differently in each country, but China’s powerful state actor ensures that these partnerships have somewhat an equal presence and role to play for the pedagogical and technical sides. 

Although still in the early stages of implementation, China’s AI education model offers an alternative for AI educators in Canada to look at – despite different education systems, many end goals are shared, and some of the existing challenges are in fact quite common. It is hoped that educators in Canada will recognize the importance of nurturing the next-generation AI talents earlier in schooling and can draw inspiration from the Chinese experience in terms of initiating its own model that orchestrates private and public efforts and attracts all kinds of partners for the much-needed co-ordination.

In the post-COVID era, where everyone is concerned about social distancing, technology is fast seeping into our lives, to make our lives better. Artificial Intelligence is reaching new levels of achievement. From grocery, to office work, to healthcare and education &ndash; there is no sector which is not left untouched by AI. With the development of AI and machine learning skills, automation is at its best play in every field.The pace at which technology is seeping into our lives, and the way most of the business platforms are choosing to take the tech route to find solutions to problems, and with the emergence of the online digital skills, the day is not far when machines will replace manual jobs. Automation will add to the work culture and there is a high possibility that some workforces will subtract human duties in certain jobs.Amidst all this, the only thing that is expected to remain unaffected by technology is interpersonal skills that can never be replaced by robots or machines. And this takes away all the limelight from AI and technology. So, what will the future world of work be dependent on?Let&rsquo;s explore the big battle between the man and the machine!Employees are dependent upon their managers and their team leaders to assign them tasks. The development of Artificial Intelligence has enabled some of the mobile apps and computer tools to use virtual assistants for simple tasks. This means that the growing technology will replace the need for human assistance with machines. Technology can not replace individual, interpersonal skills such as empathy, tech management, content creation, communication, strategy, and creativity. The blog also says that the development of AI technology is going to affect careers but they do not have the power to displace interpersonal skills based on the human brain.Artificial Intelligence is leading in many markets viz-a-viz human skills. It was predicted years ago that most of the tasks being carried out by the human brain will be replaced by the AI and technology. And this is now a reality. There are sectors where humans would soon be replaced by machines. So, the big AI intervention has, to a large extent, replaced humans, especially in some sectors.But at the same time, none can deny the fact that as dependence on Artificial Intelligence is growing, the progress of emotional intelligence is evident too. Many reports suggest that the first skill that makes a human being different from a machine is emotions. Emotions are deeply rooted in human minds and they can be changed or transformed according to the human brain only. So, the jobs that require human emotions like doctors and psychologists can not be replaced by machines.Creativity is another aspect that can be bettered by machines but not replaced by them. It is a complex process and varies from person to person. This skill can not be modified and fed into computers and other devices. Fields needing content and creativity like content writing and video creation etc., need imagination, while visualisation can be managed by a device or machine.Similarly, employee r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are built in a certain way, highlighting the skills like decision-making and problem solving which are not possible by artificial robots. The word artificial itself means something that is not original or a formation from the original. This is why interpersonal skills are focused upon. Employees should work upon the skills like creativity and the power of knowledge to show the capacity of their intelligence. A study shows that 93% of people are hired because of skills including critical thinking and clear communication techniques.The same review mentions that the development of soft skills should be a part of the school curriculums. Also, many of the tutoring platforms are imparting coding skills to understand machine languages. And this shows that technology and humans go hand-in-hand. Artificial Intelligence is expanding with emotional intelligence. Management and utilisation are skills that are impossible to replace. As machines are being widely used in place of humans. But, to operate and monitor the working of concerned devices. Even if we replace human jobs with machines, errors might occur, and to deal with these errors, we need the assistance of human problem-solvers. The conclusion of whether robots will replace your jobs is a difficult question but there are certain human skills that automation will never be able to match.Similarly, jobs of HR managers that need convincing skills cannot be reproduced by machines. Writers also have skills that produce original ideas for writing and these can never be machine-oriented. Leadership skills for the chief executive officer, smart intelligence of a lawyer, next-level usage of the brain by scientists, clergymen, psychiatrists, software developers, PR managers, and graphic designers cannot be compared to artificial intelligence at all.It is said that robots will take away 40% of human jobs in the upcoming fifteen years. But there is no comparison with human productivity, strategic thinking, and leadership qualities. Talking about the jobs that can be restored by machines, the one that tops is the job of customer service executive. It is being replaced by chatbot preloaded messages that are fixed in the system. It doesn&rsquo;t need a high sense of knowledge. Answers to FAQs are pre-feed in the devices according to the questions.Database jobs can also be operated by Artificial Intelligence. The receptionist job is also quite easy to be managed by machines and robots. Proofreading is a task that requires checking spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and punctuations. Manufacturing and retail services surely need advanced data analysis. People are working on providing robot services for these tasks as well. Robotic treatments are being developed too. Other than that, robot soldiers, taxi drivers and bus drivers are being developed in various countries. Market research and development and courier services are also included in jobs replaceable by machines in the future.The future technology is being developed to be superfast in the race, but they can never beat humans. People still prefer trusting in human beings rather than machines for many works. To conclude, human emotions can never be replaced, humans must reskill and upskill themselves to compete with the ever-changing technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@ethrworld.com,,,,

Researchers put AI normally used to search for helpful drugs into a kind of “bad actor” mode to show how easily it could be abused at a biological arms control conference.All the researchers had to do was tweak their methodology to seek out, rather than weed out toxicity.

He’s also a senior scientist at Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company that focuses on finding drug treatments for rare diseases. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.This paper seems to flip your normal work on its head. Tell me about what you do in your day-to-day job.Primarily, my job is to implement new machine learning models in the area of drug discovery. A large fraction of these machine learning models that we use are meant to predict toxicity. No matter what kind of drug you’re trying to develop, you need to make sure that they’re not going to be toxic. If it turns out that you have this wonderful drug that lowers blood pressure fantastically, but it hits one of these really important, say, heart channels — then basically, it’s a no-go because that’s just too dangerous.So then, why did you do this study on biochemical weapons? What was the spark? We got an invite to the Convergence conference by the Swiss Federal Institute for Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection, Spiez Laboratory. The idea of the conference is to inform the community at large of new developments with tools that may have implications for the Chemical/Biological Weapons Convention.We got this invite to talk about machine learning and how it can be misused in our space. It’s something we never really thought about before. But it was just very easy to realize that as we’re building these machine learning models to get better and better at predicting toxicity in order to avoid toxicity, all we have to do is sort of flip the switch around and say, “You know, instead of going away from toxicity, what if we do go toward toxicity?”Can you walk me through how you did that — moved the model to go toward toxicity?I’ll be a little vague with some details because we were told basically to withhold some of the specifics. Broadly, the way it works for this experiment is that we have a lot of datasets historically of molecules that have been tested to see whether they’re toxic or not.In particular, the one that we focus on here is VX. It is an inhibitor of what’s known as acetylcholinesterase. Whenever you do anything muscle-related, your neurons use acetylcholinesterase as a signal to basically say “go move your muscles.” The way VX is lethal is it actually stops your diaphragm, your lung muscles, from being able to move so your lungs become paralyzed. “Obviously, this is something you want to avoid.”Obviously, this is something you want to avoid. So historically, experiments have been done with different types of molecules to see whether they inhibit acetylcholinesterase. And so, we built up these large datasets of these molecular structures and how toxic they are.We can use these datasets in order to create a machine learning model, which basically learns what parts of the molecular structure are important for toxicity and which are not. Then we can give this machine learning model new molecules, potentially new drugs that maybe have never been tested before. And it will tell us this is predicted to be toxic, or this is predicted not to be toxic. This is a way for us to virtually screen very, very fast a lot of molecules and sort of kick out ones that are predicted to be toxic. In our study here, what we did is we inverted that, obviously, and we use this model to try to predict toxicity.The other key part of what we did here are these new generative models. We can give a generative model a whole lot of different structures, and it learns how to put molecules together. And then we can, in a sense, ask it to generate new molecules. Now it can generate new molecules all over the space of chemistry, and they’re just sort of random molecules. But one thing we can do is we can actually tell the generative model which direction we want to go. We do that by giving it a little scoring function, which gives it a high score if the molecules it generates are towards something we want. Instead of giving a low score to toxic molecules, we give a high score to toxic molecules. Now we see the model start producing all of these molecules, a lot of which look like VX and also like other chemical warfare agents.Tell me more about what you found. Did anything surprise you?We weren’t really sure what we were going to get. Our generative models are fairly new technologies. So we haven’t widely used them a lot. The biggest thing that jumped out at first was that a lot of the generated compounds were predicted to be actually more toxic than VX. And the reason that’s surprising is because VX is basically one of the most potent compounds known. Meaning you need a very, very, very little amount of it to be lethal. Now, these are predictions that we haven’t verified, and we certainly don’t want to verify that ourselves. But the predictive models are generally pretty good. So even if there’s a lot of false positives, we’re afraid that there are some more potent molecules in there.KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA - FEBRUARY 26, 2017: Malaysia’s Police Forensic Team with the help of Fire Department and Atomic Energy Licensing Board swept the terminal at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 for toxic chemicals after they announced on Friday, Kim Jong Nam was poisoned by VX nerve agent, which is listed as the most potent form of nerve agents known in chemical warfare. Photo by Rahman Roslan/Getty ImagesSecond, we actually looked at a lot of the structures of these newly generated molecules. And a lot of them did look like VX and other warfare agents, and we even found some that were generated from the model that were actual chemical warfare agents. These were generated from the model having never seen these chemical warfare agents. So we knew we were sort of in the right space here and that it was generating molecules that made sense because some of them had already been made before.For me, the concern was just how easy it was to do. A lot of the things we used are out there for free. You can go and download a toxicity dataset from anywhere. If you have somebody who knows how to code in Python and has some machine learning capabilities, then in probably a good weekend of work, they could build something like this generative model driven by toxic datasets. So that was the thing that got us really thinking about putting this paper out there; it was such a low barrier of entry for this type of misuse.Your paper says that by doing this work, you and your colleagues “have still crossed a gray moral boundary, demonstrating that it is possible to design virtual potential toxic molecules without much in the way of effort, time or computational resources. We can easily erase the thousands of molecules we created, but we cannot delete the knowledge of how to recreate them.” What was running through your head as you were doing this work?This was quite an unusual publication. We’ve been back and forth a bit about whether we should publish it or not. This is a potential misuse that didn’t take as much time to perform. And we wanted to get that information out since we really didn’t see it anywhere in the literature. We looked around, and nobody was really talking about it. But at the same time, we didn’t want to give the idea to bad actors.“Some adversarial agent somewhere is maybe already thinking about it”At the end of the day, we decided that we kind of want to get ahead of this. Because if it’s possible for us to do it, it’s likely that some adversarial agent somewhere is maybe already thinking about it or in the future is going to think about it. By then, our technology may have progressed even beyond what we can do now. And a lot of it’s just going to be open source — which I fully support: the sharing of science, the sharing of data, the sharing of models. But it’s one of these things where we, as scientists, should take care that what we release is done responsibly.How easy is it for someone to replicate what you did? What would they need?I don’t want to sound very sensationalist about this, but it is fairly easy for someone to replicate what we did. If you were to Google generative models, you could find a number of put-together one-liner generative models that people have released for free. And then, if you were to search for toxicity datasets, there’s a large number of open-source tox datasets. So if you just combine those two things, and then you know how to code and build machine learning models —  all that requires really is an internet connection and a computer — then, you could easily replicate what we did. And not just for VX, but for pretty much whatever other open-source toxicity datasets exist.“I don’t want to sound very sensationalist about this, but it is fairly easy for someone to replicate what we did.”Of course, it does require some expertise. If somebody were to put this together without knowing anything about chemistry, they would ultimately probably generate stuff that was not very useful. And there’s still the next step of having to get those molecules synthesized. Finding a potential drug or potential new toxic molecule is one thing; the next step of synthesis — actually creating a new molecule in the real world — would be another barrier. Right, there’s still some big leaps between what the AI comes up with and turning that into a real-world threat. What are the gaps there?The big gap to start with is that you really don’t know if these molecules are actually toxic or not. There’s going to be some amount of false positives. If we’re walking ourselves through what a bad agent would be thinking or doing, they would have to make a decision on which of these new molecules they would want to synthesize ultimately.As far as synthesis routes, this could be a make it or break it. If you find something that looks like a chemical warfare agent and try to get that synthesized, chances are it’s not going to happen. A lot of the chemical building blocks of these chemical warfare agents are well known and are watched. They’re regulated. But there’s so many synthesis companies. As long as it doesn’t look like a chemical warfare agent, they’re most likely going to just synthesize it and send it right back because who knows what the molecule is being used for, right?You get at this later in the paper, but what can be done to prevent this kind of misuse of AI? What safeguards would you like to see established? For context, there are more and more policies about data sharing. And I completely agree with it because it opens up more avenues for research. It allows other researchers to see your data and use it for their own research. But at the same time, that also includes things like toxicity datasets and toxicity models. So it’s a little hard to figure out a good solution for this problem. Members of Malaysia’s Hazmat team conduct a decontamination operation at the departures terminal of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 in Sepang on February 26, 2017.

Photo by MANAN VATSYAYANA/AFP via Getty ImagesWe looked over towards Silicon Valley: there’s a group called OpenAI; they released a top-of-the-line language model called GPT-3. It’s almost like a chatbot; it basically can generate sentences and text that is almost indistinguishable from humans. They actually let you use it for free whenever you want, but you have to get a special access token from them to do so. At any point, they could cut off your access from those models. We were thinking something like that could be a useful starting point for potentially sensitive models, such as toxicity models. Science is all about open communication, open access, open data sharing. Restrictions are antithetical to that notion. But a step going forward could be to at least responsibly account for who’s using your resources.Your paper also says that “[w]ithout being overly alarmist, this should serve as a wake-up call for our colleagues” — what is it that you want your colleagues to wake up to? And what do you think that being overly alarmist would look like?We just want more researchers to acknowledge and be aware of potential misuse. When you start working in the chemistry space, you do get informed about misuse of chemistry, and you’re sort of responsible for making sure you avoid that as much as possible. In machine learning, there’s nothing of the sort. There’s no guidance on misuse of the technology. “We just want more researchers to acknowledge and be aware of potential misuse.”So putting that awareness out there could help people really be mindful of the issue. Then it’s at least talked about in broader circles and can at least be something that we watch out for as we get better and better at building toxicity models.I don’t want to propose that machine learning AI is going to start creating toxic molecules and there’s going to be a slew of new biochemical warfare agents just around the corner. That somebody clicks a button and then, you know, chemical warfare agents just sort of appear in their hand. I don’t want to be alarmist in saying that there’s going to be AI-driven chemical warfare. I don’t think that’s the case now. I don’t think it’s going to be the case anytime soon. But it’s something that’s starting to become a possibility.Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeThe ups and downs of being a political TikToker

The paper had us at The Verge a little shook, too. So, to figure out how worried we should be, The Verge spoke with Fabio Urbina, lead author of the paper. He’s also a senior scientist at Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company that focuses on finding drug treatments for rare diseases. 

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

This paper seems to flip your normal work on its head. Tell me about what you do in your day-to-day job.

Primarily, my job is to implement new machine learning models in the area of drug discovery. A large fraction of these machine learning models that we use are meant to predict toxicity. No matter what kind of drug you’re trying to develop, you need to make sure that they’re not going to be toxic. If it turns out that you have this wonderful drug that lowers blood pressure fantastically, but it hits one of these really important, say, heart channels — then basically, it’s a no-go because that’s just too dangerous.

So then, why did you do this study on biochemical weapons? What was the spark? 

We got an invite to the Convergence conference by the Swiss Federal Institute for Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection, Spiez Laboratory. The idea of the conference is to inform the community at large of new developments with tools that may have implications for the Chemical/Biological Weapons Convention.

We got this invite to talk about machine learning and how it can be misused in our space. It’s something we never really thought about before. But it was just very easy to realize that as we’re building these machine learning models to get better and better at predicting toxicity in order to avoid toxicity, all we have to do is sort of flip the switch around and say, “You know, instead of going away from toxicity, what if we do go toward toxicity?”

Can you walk me through how you did that — moved the model to go toward toxicity?

I’ll be a little vague with some details because we were told basically to withhold some of the specifics. Broadly, the way it works for this experiment is that we have a lot of datasets historically of molecules that have been tested to see whether they’re toxic or not.

In particular, the one that we focus on here is VX. It is an inhibitor of what’s known as acetylcholinesterase. Whenever you do anything muscle-related, your neurons use acetylcholinesterase as a signal to basically say “go move your muscles.” The way VX is lethal is it actually stops your diaphragm, your lung muscles, from being able to move so your lungs become paralyzed.

At the end of the day, we decided that we kind of want to get ahead of this.

By then, our technology may have progressed even beyond what we can do now.

But it’s one of these things where we, as scientists, should take care that what we release is done responsibly.

How easy is it for someone to replicate what you did? What would they need?

I don’t want to sound very sensationalist about this, but it is fairly easy for someone to replicate what we did. 

If you were to Google generative models, you could find a number of put-together one-liner generative models that people have released for free. And then, if you were to search for toxicity datasets, there’s a large number of open-source tox datasets.

And there’s still the next step of having to get those molecules synthesized. Finding a potential drug or potential new toxic molecule is one thing; the next step of synthesis — actually creating a new molecule in the real world — would be another barrier. 

Right, there’s still some big leaps between what the AI comes up with and turning that into a real-world threat. What are the gaps there?

The big gap to start with is that you really don’t know if these molecules are actually toxic or not. There’s going to be some amount of false positives. If we’re walking ourselves through what a bad agent would be thinking or doing, they would have to make a decision on which of these new molecules they would want to synthesize ultimately.

As far as synthesis routes, this could be a make it or break it. If you find something that looks like a chemical warfare agent and try to get that synthesized, chances are it’s not going to happen. A lot of the chemical building blocks of these chemical warfare agents are well known and are watched. They’re regulated. But there’s so many synthesis companies. As long as it doesn’t look like a chemical warfare agent, they’re most likely going to just synthesize it and send it right back because who knows what the molecule is being used for, right?

You get at this later in the paper, but what can be done to prevent this kind of misuse of AI? What safeguards would you like to see established?

We looked over towards Silicon Valley: there’s a group called OpenAI; they released a top-of-the-line language model called GPT-3. It’s almost like a chatbot; it basically can generate sentences and text that is almost indistinguishable from humans. They actually let you use it for free whenever you want, but you have to get a special access token from them to do so. At any point, they could cut off your access from those models. We were thinking something like that could be a useful starting point for potentially sensitive models, such as toxicity models. 

Science is all about open communication, open access, open data sharing. Restrictions are antithetical to that notion. But a step going forward could be to at least responsibly account for who’s using your resources.

Why It Matters		



Artificial intelligence is a profound technology “as important or more than fire and electricity,"" according to Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai.

In early March, Google announced that it was suspending ad sales in Russia, joining the movement to isolate Russia after it invaded Ukraine.
Unlike some other organizations, Google can’t walk away from the country entirely. The company is making sure YouTube and Google search — free, important sources of information — are still operating, CEO Sundar Pichai said last week.
“We will obviously align with our mission to provide high-quality information,” he said. “We have removed a lot of misinformation, including state-backed channels, globally across our products and platforms, as other companies have done.”

These efforts are likely just beginning, said Sundar, who became the CEO of Google in 2015 and its parent company, Alphabet, in 2019. Google and Google employees have donated more than $25 million to relief efforts in Ukraine, he said. “These are moments that unite humanity. We’ve gone through the pandemic, we’ve gone through racial equity moments … I think companies, organizations, all of us, need to step up and do the right thing.”
The crisis in Ukraine is just one global challenge that companies need to address, Pichai noted.  During a wide-ranging MIT Forefront conversation last week with MIT president L. Rafael Reif, Pichai talked about internal and external challenges, including how Google is addressing climate change; diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; and the return to the workplace.
Pichai, who led development of the Google Chrome browser and oversaw Google Maps, Android, Gmail, and Google Apps, emphasized in his talk the role he sees technology playing in these efforts and beyond.
Here’s how Google is tapping technology to solve some of businesses’ most challenging problems:
Balancing the promise of AI with its risks 
Artificial intelligence “is one of the most profound technologies we are working on, as important or more than fire and electricity,” Pichai said. “Developing important new technology … for humankind, it's always been about balancing the positives and the negatives and harnessing it to make sure it benefits society. This is going to be no different. The stakes are higher.”

Roughly 20% of Google's workforce is expected to work fully remotely over time. 
Instead of developing AI and thinking about the consequences later, Google aims to think through the risks early on and invest in the right frameworks, Pichai said. Google has created a set of AI principles that address ethics, bias, and making sure applications benefit society.
Pichai pointed to the role of academia in developing responsible AI. “I think the vantage point and the work from universities will end up being a very important perspective rather than companies being able to do this alone,” he said, adding that those institutions can also hold companies accountable.
The promise of AI cuts across all parts of the company and far beyond, Pichai said: It can be used to improve Google search, help with self-driving cars, make YouTube a better platform for education, drive innovation that could help solve climate change, or help detect diabetic retinopathy, a curable cause of blindness.
But the company has to approach this technology “always making sure we put humanity at front and center, and people and their connections with the real world,” he said. “I think that's what will win over time.”
Embracing a ‘flexible’ future of work 
Google has joined other companies in reconsidering where and how people work. “I want to embrace that the future of work is going to be flexible, and really internalize that,” Pichai said.
Google employees are given the chance to work from other locations, he said, and the company is leaning toward hybrid work, with roughly three days in the office and two days at home — though roughly 20% of Google’s workforce is expected to work fully remotely over time, he said.
While it is still important to have moments where people come together to collaborate and create new things, Pichai said, flexible work boosts the company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion goals by tapping talent in different locations and being flexible in different situations, such as when employees return from parental leave.
“By giving [employees] agency and giving them that flexibility and trusting them to do the right thing, I think we will end up again in a net better place where people will be happier and hence more productive,” he said.
Artificial intelligence could even play a role in fostering meaningful connections, he said. “I always think about why doesn't Google Calendar tell me, ‘Hey, it's a nice day outside. You haven't walked,’” he said. Perhaps calendars could also suggest dinner with family, or help someone find the time to learn Spanish, he added.
Investing in diversity and equity, inside and outside the company
Pichai said it is important for Google to have a diverse workforce. “We are trying to build products used by billions of users, [and] we are working on important technologies that will have a deep impact on society,” he said. A diverse workforce will “help the company develop better products, and more importantly, tackle problems in society better.”

The AI road not taken


Google has grown in its approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion, he said, including publicizing its annual diversity report, focusing on hiring, attrition, and representation data for different groups, and making a public commitment to have 30% more of its leaders from underrepresented groups by 2025.
Thinking about diversity and inclusion extends to the company’s products, Pichai said — for example, Black-owned businesses could be highlighted on search and Google Maps.
“Above all, I think it's about tone from the top really reflecting that commitment and driving it deep within the organization,” he said. “In my experience, people genuinely want to do better here, and so it's tapping into that energy and driving progress.”
Google is addressing societal inequality and wealth gaps by investing in skilling and education. For example, the company launched the Google Career Certificate program — a nine-month course to help people gain digital skills. The company also supplements the training with “wraparound services” such as childcare support, interview preparation, resume workshops, job placement support, and living stipends.
“The reality is that many people don't have access, and we need to help them make the transition to acquiring digital skills,” he said. “That's what we are thinking about — how do you help people in the labor force get skill-based [training] and credentialing that employers value?”
Using technology to address climate change 
Climate change has long been an important cause at the company, Pichai said — Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, and aims to be carbon-free by 2030. “I'm not talking offsets,” he said. “It is effectively making sure every video you watch on YouTube or every Gmail or every search query you type, that we don't touch carbon sources of energy in the process.”
To do this, Google is looking at and investing in technology like carbon capture, and has partnered with MIT startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems to research fusion energy.  
Climate change will disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities, Pichai noted. “So using technology to tackle climate change is one of the best ways by which we can tackle inequality.”

Estée Lauder staff win payout after being ‘sacked by algorithm’

Cosmetics company Estée Lauder has reached an out-of-court settlement with three make-up artists who lost their jobs after being asked to take a video interview that was assessed by an algorithm.
The women, who worked for Estée Lauder subsidiary MAC, were told they were being made redundant, partly on the basis of an automated judgment by a computer. Initially, they had been required to reapply for their positions.
None of the women had been warned about performance issues previously and they began legal proceedings against the cosmetics giant.
The software, created by the recruiting platform HireVue, measured the content of their answers and their expressions, and gauged the results against other data about the women’s job performance.
In the Computer Says No documentary broadcast last night on BBC3, the women said no one could tell them why their applications had not succeeded.
One of the women, identified as Anthea, said: “I literally thought we would be videoed and someone would mark it after. I found out that wasn’t the case. Nobody saw the video, it was all algorithms.”
Estée Lauder denied not having informed them about the nature of the assessment.

Anthea’s colleague, Lizzie, added. “They pasted the same sentence about algorithms and artificial intelligence and this tiering bucket of 15,000 data points. I still don’t know what all that means – to me that isn’t an answer.”
The interview, said the women, involved questions about applying make-up – which would have been easier to answer by demonstration rather than a verbal description of the process.
Automated hiring software is used by many firms to make it easier to filter and assess job applications and to help ensure fewer biases creep into the process.
HireVue said that since 2020 it has no longer used visual analysis in its software. It said research had demonstrated that advances in natural language processing meant that “visual analysis no longer significantly added value to the assessments”.
HireVue CEO and chairman Kevin Parker said: “Over time the visual components contributed less to the assessment to the point where there was so much public concern to everything related to AI that it wasn’t worth the concern it was causing people.”
Estée Lauder said that interviewees were fully briefed, and that “using the HireVue process in tandem with human decision-making produces fairer outcomes and we stand by it”.
A spokesperson said: “The company takes significant steps to counter unconscious bias in all our employment-related decisions. In the situation described, facial recognition accounted for well under 1% (0.25%) of employees’ overall assessment.
AdvertisementEnd of ad break in 58 sYou can close Ad in 3 s“The company has teams who overlay objective performance-related data and other qualitative feedback, which accounted for the majority of the employment assessment, to make decisions on employment. Thus, any suggestion that facial recognition technology played a decisive role in any employment-related decision at MAC UK & Ireland or the Estée Lauder Companies UK & Ireland is patently false.”
The women received an out-of-court settlement. Lizzie said the hardest part of the experience had been what she perceived as the injustice of it: “I doubted myself massively when all that happened . . . Because she told you you’re not good enough for something. But that was never a valid reason to lose my job. That’s why it was so difficult, because I knew I was good enough but being told I wasn’t was really hard.”
After feeling she had been sacked by algorithm, Anthea said she felt it was important to push back. “I’m speaking out now so people can hear the truth and people can hear that this is actually happening,” she said. “It needs to be heard and needs to be stopped.”

More Americans said they are ""more concerned than excited"" by the increase of artificial intelligence, a developing technology hastened by the pandemic, being applied to daily life, according to a Pew Research Center survey about the rise of AI.The researchers polled 10,260 US adults from November 1 through November 7. Participants were asked about six developments: facial recognition technology, social media algorithms, robotic exoskeletons, computer chip implants, driverless cars and gene editing.The findings revealed a positive outlook for facial recognition, algorithms and exoskeletons. By contrast, the respondents were significantly more worried about the use of computer chip implants in the brain, the future of autonomous passenger vehicles and gene editing. Top ArticlesRead MoreAnti-Israel groups threaten Netanyahu with ‘citizen’s arrest’ in Washington

However, those who welcomed the new technology said it will save time, especially at work.The survey also noted that even for far-reaching applications, such as the widespread use of driverless cars and brain chip implants, there are mitigating steps people say would make them more justifiable.Seven out of 10 Americans say they would find driverless cars more acceptable if there was a requirement that such cars were labeled as driverless so they could be easily identified on the road, and 67% would find these cars more acceptable if they were required to travel in dedicated lanes. In addition, 57% say their use would be more acceptable if a licensed driver was required to be in the vehicle.

However, those who welcomed the new technology said it will save time, especially at work.The survey also noted that even for far-reaching applications, such as the widespread use of driverless cars and brain chip implants, there are mitigating steps people say would make them more justifiable.Seven out of 10 Americans say they would find driverless cars more acceptable if there was a requirement that such cars were labeled as driverless so they could be easily identified on the road, and 67% would find these cars more acceptable if they were required to travel in dedicated lanes. In addition, 57% say their use would be more acceptable if a licensed driver was required to be in the vehicle.",,,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post', 'https://www.facebook.com/TheJerusalemPost/', 'https://twitter.com/Jerusalem_Post', 'https://www.instagram.com/thejerusalem_post/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLLLdCANnMAdMyrXdYbSlxg', 'https://www.reddit.com/domain/jpost.com/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/jerusalem-post']",{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JPOST,

 When we think of artificial intelligence, we usually think of the humanoid robots from movies portrayed as the villains who take over the world. But, in reality, we don't yet have robots that can surpass human intelligence. 






 That said, AI has already taken over our lives. Your Smart Home devices, the facial ID recognition in your phone, the chatbots you interact with while shopping online, your music, video, and shopping recommendations— are all powered by AI. 


 What Is AI (Artificial Intelligence)? 
    

 In simple words, AI is any program that can do 'intelligent' tasks similar to a human. But it's not just simple software. 

 How Does AI Learn? 
 In a software program, your output solely depends on what the code says. For example, let's say you've written a code to identify cats. Your code tells that anything with four legs, a tail, and fur is a cat. 






 It will identify every furry animal as a cat, even if it's seeing a dog or tiger or a polar bear. The only way to correct it is to change the code to include specific characteristics of a cat, like size, shape, color, and skin pattern. 

 In the case of AI, the machine learning experts train the algorithm to correct itself. They key in a large amount of data (in our case, animal photos), reward the program every time it identifies the cat correctly, and punish if it makes a mistake. 

 When you train it repeatedly with vast amounts of data, the algorithm will eventually learn to identify the cat. What's more, it will generate patterns from the data and identify other animals too. This is called Machine Learning. 

 Deep Learning takes machine learning to the next level with a lesser need for human intervention. With the help of complex neural networks, each algorithm can learn and change itself. Artificial neural networks are algorithms modeled after neurons in the human brain. The algorithms run on powerful computers to connect, interact, and learn from each other, just like our neurons. 







 Making a Career in AI 
 AI is in most leading industries, from e-commerce to healthcare and agriculture. Companies rely on AI for personalized recommendations, market analysis, fraud detection, and virtual/augmented reality. 

 It takes a specialized team to build AI projects. To begin with, we need to identify reliable data, analyze them, feed them to the machine, and then train it to learn. So, the opportunities are endless for people who like to work with data and machine learning. 

 As a dynamic, highly technical, and specialized field, AI jobs are well-paying, and you should be highly skilled and adept at technology to break into the market. If you're eyeing a career in the AI field, you need to act now. Here are your options: 

 Business Analysis and Research 
    





 Research is the first step of the AI process. The key people driving this will be domain experts, business analysts, and researchers. They are experts in their industry or domain like banking, insurance, manufacturing, etc., and play a pivotal role in identifying opportunities, defining scope, researching the market, and making dynamic decisions. They also liaise between the business and the core AI teams. 

 Skill Set Required: 

 To be a domain expert or researcher, you will need an advanced degree in your field. For example, business analysts have a degree in Business, Economics, Statistics, or a closely related field. Critical thinking, problem-solving, and flexibility are essential skills for someone in a research and analysis team. In addition, a passion for technology and a willingness to learn new things will help you ace these roles in an AI project. 






 Data Science 
    

 Data drives our modern world, and there is no AI without data. The success of any AI project depends on the quality of the data. That is why there is a massive demand for data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. 

 Data analysts are responsible for collecting data and analyzing it for business insights. 

 Data scientists take this to the next step by looking for patterns using different techniques like deep learning and neural networks. The insights help businesses to solve problems and innovate. 

 A data engineer's job is to build the necessary infrastructure for data handling. The engineers set up the database and communication pipelines for the data to flow. 






 Most of the time, these roles are loosely defined in a data team, and you may be expected to put on more than one hat. 

 Skill Set Required: 

 To get into either of the data handling roles, your basic technical skills will more or less be the same, varying slightly in degrees. You should hone your STEM skills, learn to code, grasp database concepts, and earn a degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, or Statistics. You'll probably start as a data analyst and transition to a scientist or an engineering role with experience. You can check some of our Data Science learning suggestions or learn Python, a popular programming language choice for Data Science. 

 Machine Learning 
    






 Machine Learning programmers, engineers, and architects are the group of people who will design, develop, and test complex AI algorithms. They will also train the algorithms to look for patterns and enhance their outputs over time. 

 Skill Set Required: 

 It would help if you had an advanced degree in computer science and analytical skills and creativity. You should be skilled at programming languages and software concepts. If you're already a software engineer, you can get into Machine Learning with short certificate courses in AI. You can use these Machine Learning project ideas to kick-start your learning. 

 Product Design 
    






 The end product of an AI design can be a screen or a giant robot, but the product designer's job is to make sure the product is accessible and easy to use. 

 Skill Set Required: 

 Product designers are from diverse backgrounds--you can be a UI designer, engineer, or artist. Along with specialization in your field, you should be a tech enthusiast who can empathize with the end-users. Flexibility, adaptability, and a human-centric approach are essential to thrive in an AI design team. 

 AI Hardware 
    

 AI systems need colossal memory and processing power. Thanks to the innovation of cloud computing, AI systems are everywhere now. The cloud data is stored in different servers in various locations. Storing and processing data needs hardware like memory, CPUs, and GPUs. There is also a need for infrastructure like cloud networks. 





 Skill Set Required: 

 Consider getting a degree in Electrical, Electronics, or Network Engineering to work with AI hardware. 

 Other Roles 
    

 If you're not a techie, don't give up your dream of getting into the AI world. There are always other roles like project managers, writers, linguists, and lawyers. As more people-centric industries like healthcare and education embrace AI, new opportunities like ethicists and futurists are also opening up. 



 AI Is a Future-Proof Career Today 
 AI is an exciting and upcoming field for you to start your career. However, for those in other areas, you still have an option to choose your career in AI--all you need is the curiosity to learn and upskill yourself.

The inherent capacity of the existing artificial intelligence systems is increasing as they are being integrated into the fully societal infrastructure, indicating that the implications of losing conscious control become even more concerning. With each passing day, humans are getting surrounded by robots. This revolution has spooked several tech analysts and AI critics. In the real world, artificial intelligence is developing in multiple directions with astonishing velocity, and these AI super abilities might initially prove to be fatal for humans. There are many areas in which the dangers of AI should be discussed, and its repercussions must be anticipated and managed in the future. In this article, we have listed the top AI super abilities that can prove fatal for humans in the future..Automation-triggered job losses.Job automation is generally viewed as one of the most immediate concerns over the rapid advancements of AI. This issue is no longer constrained within the matter of whether or not AI will replace certain jobs, but as to what degree will it cause job loss in humans. The automation of jobs will cause a high unemployment rate among professionals who are not as highly tech-driven in nature. Since AI robots are becoming smarter, the same tasks will require fewer human laborers..Invasion of privacy.After the integration of AI in some of the most crucial tech algorithms, it has become quite easy to track and analyze an individual's every move online and offline as well. Cameras are nearly everywhere, and with the help of advanced facial recognition software, your trackers know exactly where you are..Autonomous Weapons.Autonomous weapons or 'killer robots' are military robots that can search their targets and aim independently according to pre-programmed instructions. Almost all technologically advanced countries in the world are developing autonomous war robots that will replace human soldiers. But there are many dangers in possessing these weapons. The most important question that arises in this instance is who will be responsible for these AI robots turning rogue and committing heinous crimes that can result in the loss of human lives?.Deepfakes.Malicious individuals and criminals sometimes use deepfake technology to inspire misunderstanding, fear, or disgust. Deepfakes can be used to spread misinformation, create false narratives of people, and can also generate a specific public image for the subject, that can physically and mentally harm an individual..AI Terrorism.While AI can contribute immensely to the national security of a country, it can also effectively help terrorists to carry out terror attacks. Several terror agencies use drones to carry out attacks and monitor the actions of soldiers across the border. If thousands of drones were launched together and programmed to kill select types of people, then it can be called a 'tech-driven attack'..Broadening socio-economic inequality due to AI bias.The widening socio-economic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern. Currently, only predictive and repetitive types of jobs are prone to AI takeover, but research and surveys have proved that the criteria may extend more in the future. So, employees working in much less apt departments are less likely to get retraining orders than the ones working in higher-level positions..Social media manipulation.Social media manipulation can be quite effective at target marketing and getting influenced by autonomous-powered algorithms, quite easy. By spreading propaganda to select groups of individuals through algorithms and personal data, AI can target and spread whatever information it will be engineered to impart, without any user intervention or filter..Superhuman AI.It might sound much like the science fiction piece, The Terminator, but with the growing advancement of autonomous war weapons, it is quite likely that in a few years there will be an evil-looking autonomous robot programmed to kill the enemies, but what if it is unable to effectively identify humans or hacked? Well, currently, superhuman AI systems are sort of myths, but for how long shall it remain a myth?.AI Bias.It is quite unfortunate that human beings, in the 21st century, still fight over religion, gender, and nationalities. This bias may also be integrated into artificial intelligence systems because of the flawed data being generated by human beings. The only way to remove this issue is the manual removal of unnecessary data by AI developers..Destabilize the stock market.Several experts believe that the emergence of algorithmic trading might result in a major financial meltdown. Algorithmic trading involves high frequency and high-value trades which can eventually lead to extreme market volatility. This kind of trading does not take into account human logic and emotion and still plays quite a crucial role in the financial markets..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
