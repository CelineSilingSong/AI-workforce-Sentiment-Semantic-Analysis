When Oxford University Professor Nick Bostrom’s New York Times best-seller, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies was first published in 2014, it struck a nerve at the heart of this debate with its focus on all the things that could go wrong. However, in my recent conversation with Bostrom, he also acknowledged there’s an enormous upside to artificial intelligence technology.

You can see the full video of our conversation here:

PROMOTED
Since the writing of Bostrom's book in 2014, progress has been very rapid in artificial intelligence and machine and deep learning. Artificial intelligence is in the public discourse, and most governments have some sort of strategy or road map to address AI. In his book, he talked about AI being a little bit like children playing with a bomb that could go off at any time.

Bostrom explained, ""There's a mismatch between our level of maturity in terms of our wisdom, our ability to cooperate as a species on the one hand and on the other hand our instrumental ability to use technology to make big changes in the world. It seems like we've grown stronger faster than we've grown wiser.""

There are all kinds of exciting AI tools and applications that are beginning to affect the economy in many ways. These shouldn’t be overshadowed by the overhype on the hypothetical future point where you get AIs with the same general learning and planning abilities that humans have as well as superintelligent machines. These are two different contexts that require attention.

Today, the more imminent threat isn't from a superintelligence, but the useful—yet potentially dangerous—applications AI is used for presently.
How is AI dangerous?

If we focus on what’s possible today with AI, here are some of the potential negative impacts of artificial intelligence that we should consider and plan for:
Change the jobs humans do/job automation: AI will change the workplace and the jobs that humans do. Some jobs will be lost to AI technology, so humans will need to embrace the change and find new activities that will provide them the social and mental benefits their job provided.
Political, legal, and social ramifications: As Bostrom advises, rather than avoid pursuing AI innovation, ""Our focus should be on putting ourselves in the best possible position so that when all the pieces fall into place, we've done our homework. We've developed scalable AI control methods, we've thought hard about the ethics and the governments, etc. And then proceed further and then hopefully have an extremely good outcome from that."" If our governments and business institutions don't spend time now formulating rules, regulations, and responsibilities, there could be significant negative ramifications as AI continues to mature.
AI-enabled terrorism: Artificial intelligence will change the way conflicts are fought from autonomous drones, robotic swarms, and remote and nanorobot attacks. In addition to being concerned with a nuclear arms race, we'll need to monitor the global autonomous weapons race.
Social manipulation and AI bias: So far, AI is still at risk for being biased by the humans that build it. If there is bias in the data sets the AI is trained from, that bias will affect AI action. In the wrong hands, AI can be used, as it was in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, for social manipulation and to amplify misinformation.
AI surveillance: AI’s face recognition capabilities give us conveniences such as being able to unlock phones and gain access to a building without keys, but it also launched what many civil liberties groups believe is alarming surveillance of the public. In China and other countries, the police and government are invading public privacy by using face recognition technology. Bostrom explains that AI's ability to monitor the global information systems from surveillance data, cameras, and mining social network communication has great potential for good and for bad.
Deepfakes: AI technology makes it very easy to create ""fake"" videos of real people. These can be used without an individual's permission to spread fake news, create porn in a person's likeness who actually isn't acting in it, and more to not only damage an individual's reputation but livelihood. The technology is getting so good the possibility for people to be duped by it is high.
As Nick Bostrom explained, “The biggest threat is the longer-term problem introducing something radical that’s super intelligent and failing to align it with human values and intentions. This is a big technical problem. We’d succeed at solving the capability problem before we succeed at solving the safety and alignment problem.”
Today, Nick describes himself as a “frightful optimist” that is very excited about what AI can do if we get it right. He said, “The near-term effects are just overwhelmingly positive. The longer-term effect is more of an open question and is very hard to predict. If we do our homework and the more we get our act together as a world and a species in whatever time we have available, the better we are prepared for this, the better the odds for a favorable outcome. In that case, it could be extremely favorable.”

Open Access NewsTechnology News Can artificial intelligence solve our societal issues?

March 3, 2020 









James Lloyd-Townshend, CEO of Jefferson Frank, discusses how artificial intelligence can be used to address societal issues from healthcare to climate change and much more
There are, largely speaking, two camps when it comes to artificial intelligence. On one hand, there’s those who are wary of the negatives that have been reported on in the press and worry that the future isn’t as bright as we’d hoped for. Then there’s those who see the remarkable opportunity it offers and are working hard to mine its advantages.
Undeniably, AI will shape society, it’s unavoidable; history’s not exactly littered with examples of technological advancements that have simply been rejected. While the tightrope of personal intrusion needs to be very carefully walked, it would be remiss of us to reject its benefits outright.
Facial recognition may be a step too far for many, and understandably so, but does that mean such a huge leap of progress in technology should be rejected, regardless of the many positives it can bring? Not wanting to feel like a shopping centre is spying on you is undeniably different to potentially revolutionising medicine, for example.
The government recently announced that it would be investing £250 million in AI technology, and the ramifications of this will be fascinating to watch as an outsider. If we can detect and combat disease, making people happier and healthier, it could truly help to break down barriers when it comes to the public’s perceptions over artificial intelligence.
Employment
Another huge factor which will help are the jobs it will create. Facebook, for example, recently announced it would be creating 1,000 jobs to help the company moderate content via AI. At a time when people are fearing the impact that technology may have on employment prospects, it’s clear that the digital age will be a positive for those looking for work.
According to research by IBM, the number of businesses using AI is set to increase by up to 90% in the next two years. That’s going to require a huge workforce to develop and maintain. This technology isn’t taking jobs away from people, it’s simply shifting the opportunities to a different sector. Regardless of economic factors, companies are increasingly looking to digital solutions, meaning that it’s an area of work that is entirely futureproofed, at the very least in our lifetimes.
There’s already been a boom in tech professionals in the last few years to facilitate a huge number of advances. Since 2015, there’s been an 80% increase in the number of vacancies for data roles, and the need for AI specialists will mean that rise continues in the foreseeable future. According to a recent survey by IBM, 40% of businesses now use AI. This could grow by up to 90% within the next two years, which again underlines just how many opportunities this area of work will create.
Put simply—this isn’t taking jobs away from people, it’s creating a new area of work that will provide a lucrative career path for many, for years to come.
Environmental issues
Aside from our livelihoods and wellbeing, the very world we live in also relies on this technology. There’s no doubting the importance we all place on fighting climate change right now, with a holistic approach being taken towards it all the way from large corporations to individuals. Everybody wants to do their bit, and AI is already being used to help.
Carbon Tracker are one such organisation. They’re an independent think-tank whose aim is to help the UN in preventing new coal plants from being built. Artificial intelligence forms a key part of their operation, as they use it to monitor emissions from coal plants and measuring their impact on air pollution. The UN’s Emissions Gap Report has already pointed towards the need for innovation when it comes to the fight towards climate change.
As the technology is exploited further, there’s no doubt that it’s uses could help to save the very planet that we live on. And for all the bad that be attributed towards AI, that’s one benefit that is close to impossible to ignore.
AI’s future
Artificial intelligence is already here, whether people like it or not. Nearly half of businesses already use it, and many more will join them as they see the tangible benefits it brings to their organisation. There’s much to be done to bridge the gap between the technology and public perception of it. Some of this will be a natural occurrence, but it partly comes down to debunking a lot of myths around it that are simply untrue.
The tech industry will also play its part in this. IBM have acknowledged that the approach to AI needs to be taken from a sound ethical platform, and there really is no shortcut to gaining the trust of the general public on this one. But as long as those creating it and those using it both approach it sensibly, then there’s no denying the benefits available to us if we’re willing to embrace it.

Don’t forget to consider GDPR when using artificial intelligence in the workplace


While references to artificial intelligence in the workplace may conjure up images of future-gazing movies, the use of AI and people analytics by employers is already present at all stages of the employment lifecycle

When applying for a new job, candidates may well find that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools is involved at some point in the recruitment process. New recruitment businesses and technology are entering the market, setting up entirely automated initial conversations with candidates to help them find the right vacancy for their skill set, saving time for applicant and recruiter alike.







CV screening is also becoming more prevalent, with AI screening and tracking tools being used to quickly analyse CVs to ascertain whether the individual has the qualifications and experience necessary for the role – for example, burger chain Five Guys is said to be utilising such technology.
Unilever recently hit the headlines when it announced that, instead of human recruiters, it uses an AI system to analyse video interviews. Candidates record interviews on their phone or laptop, and the system scans candidates’ language, tone and facial expressions from the videos, assessing their performance against traits that are considered to indicate job success at Unilever.
But it is not just the recruitment stage where AI and people analytics are being used by businesses – performance management is another targeted area. Amazon is leading this charge – the company was issued with two patents in the US for a wristband for tracking the performance of workers in their warehouse, which would mean that staff receive a little “buzz” if they place a product near or in the wrong inventory location.
It is also alleged that Amazon uses a computer system to automatically generate warnings or terminations to employees, when their productivity (or lack of) warrants it.
The benefits of such technology for employers are countless and clear, including costs savings, efficiency, and the purported removal of human unconscious bias and prejudice. However, the use of AI in the workplace has come under scrutiny and has posed serious ethical and legal questions, including whether AI itself could in fact be biased.
Another important aspect when implementing AI in the workplace is its relationship with data protection laws such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). So, what data protection considerations should an employer make when considering the introduction of AI technology?

Has a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) been carried out?
The use of AI for processing personal data will usually meet the legal requirement for completing a DPIA.
A DPIA enables the business to analyse how the AI plans will affect individuals’ privacy, and ensures the company can assess the necessity and proportionality of its technology.

As the UK Information Commissioner’s guidance confirms, the deployment of an AI system to process personal data needs to be driven by the proven ability of that system to fulfil a specific and legitimate purpose, not just by the availability of the technology.
The DPIA should demonstrate that the applicable purposes the AI is being used for could not be accomplished in another reasonable way. In doing so, organisations need to think about and document any detriment to data subjects that could follow from bias or inaccuracy in the algorithms and data sets being used.


What is the lawful basis to process the data in this way?
A business cannot simply process personal data because it wishes to do so – data can only be processed where one of the legitimate grounds or conditions of processing has been met. There are various bases, including performance of a contract, compliance with a legal obligation, consent and legitimate business interests. For the processing of sensitive personal data (such as health data), the bases are even more limited.
Before using AI or people analytics in the workplace, employers will first need to consider what data is being processed by such activity and second what legal basis can be relied upon in processing the data in that way. If they do not have a legal basis, the data cannot be processed.


Does the privacy notice adequately inform workers?
One of the key principles of GDPR is transparency, requiring businesses to provide individuals with mandatory information about the processing of their personal data, including the reason why it is being processed, the legal basis, who it will be shared with and how long it will be retained. Employers will need to update their privacy notices to ensure anyone subject to the AI technology is made aware of its use. 
The privacy notice needs to be concise and intelligible, using clear and plain language – this will be particularly difficult when including a complex AI system, as businesses will need to provide a meaningful explanation of the technology to meet the transparency principle of GDPR. Opaque or complex descriptions of the tech may result in contention or pushback from the employees and candidates affected.


Remember to consider the specific rules for automated decision-making
GDPR prohibits instances of “computer says no” and contains the right for data subjects not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, which has a legal or similarly significant impact on them. Its aim is to protect individuals against the risk that a potentially damaging decision is taken without human intervention, and will therefore likely capture a recruitment result made without any human input.
There are specific exceptions when automated decision-making is permitted, including where explicit consent was given, contractual necessity, or where authorised by law. Where such an exception is being relied upon, such as with the consent of a candidate, the business must still implement further safeguarding measures, including permitting the individual to request human intervention or to contest the decision. 
Employers will need to ensure that their automated technology is being lawfully used, before relying on its output.

How artificial intelligence is helping to improve people’s quality of life

 6 March 202030 May 2022 Business  Business Matters 





Artificial intelligence is no longer something that provides high-concept drama in sci-fi movies, but it is something that is having tangible benefits in everyday life.

Movies such as 2004’s I, Robot may have attached scarier connotations to the idea of AI, but the reality is that AI is much more subtle (and much more useful) than a bunch of robots running around causing havoc.
We are already seeing the positive effects of AI in key areas such as business, healthcare, and transportation. Here are some examples of how AI is improving the quality of life around the world, with a look at the potential for further AI integration.

Business
askSpoke
 lists 21 ways that AI has transformed the workplace; this includes transcribing meetings, assisting with internal communications, and translating video calls in real time. AI solutions are not designed to replace office workers. Instead, they help staff better manage their workload, allowing them to focus on the most important aspects of their job.
AI is changing the way that businesses provide customer service, with carefully designed bots able to respond to a range of online queries. This enables companies to provide 24/7 customer service, as the bot can operate at all hours to cater to customers in different time zones or on different schedules. In the future, expect AI-driven customer service to be able to respond effectively to unique customer queries or complaints, rather than answering a predetermined range of questions.

Healthcare

AI could potentially play a transformational role in tackling some of the world’s biggest health challenges. Tej Kohlibelieves that biotech solutions and AI can dramatically improve human life, with the use of AI in organ transplantation giving credence to that belief. Algorithms are used to match suitable patients and donor, with AI so far assisting with setting up around 6000 kidney transplants.
That number will increase significantly if AI can be given more patient data to work with, with doctors able to not only identify organ matches but also establish which patient requires more urgent treatment. AI can also enhance existing methods of disease detection, with new AI tech deployed on premature babies to identify those at risk of going blind. Human identification of this eye disease was flawed and contentious, but AI’s ability to process vast quantities of data allows for a more informed decision.

Transportation

When we think about AI in transportation, it is only natural that the mind is drawn to one concept in particular: self-driving cars. Some may find this idea to be unfathomable, while others may relish the notion of relinquishing driving to AI. Self-driven taxis have already been trialled in Tokyo, while ATBS has explored the progress towards autonomous trucks in the United States.
The most significant consequence of AI in transportation for most people may be more discreet than a self-driven vehicle. AI could revolutionize the way that authorities approach traffic management, with the ability to process large swathes of data again making the difference. By analysing big data, AI can help authorities to control the flow of traffic and can inform drivers of potential congestion or alternative routes.
There has already been considerable progress in the development of AI, but, given its proven ability to improve people’s quality of life, that progress is not about to slow down. From its streamlining of office routines and traffic management to its literally life-changing potential in healthcare, AI is providing a future that should be embraced.

When I visited in late January, a gallery two doors down was hosting a reproductive rights-themed show with works listed for upwards of $30,000. Across the street, four floors of the windowless New Museum were taken over by a retrospective of artist Hans Haacke, which included a demographic survey, a portrait of Ronald Reagan and a grass-covered mound of dirt. The seventh floor was occupied by a “mixed reality pop-up,” sponsored by Ruinart champagne, in which visitors could wander about in augmented reality glasses. Minders politely asked those without reservations to “step away from the experience.”Technology and late capitalism similarly intersect in Kurant’s work, though perhaps with a greater degree of self-awareness. A conceptual artist, she explores modern questions over data rights, online labor exploitation and the power of big corporations. With growing public awareness of issues like the commodification of “big data” and the ever-increasing power of artificial intelligence (AI), she’s part of a new generation of artists and curators who are trying to represent the nature of these new technologies, and the ways we are being transformed by them.“To talk about any kind of new media or new technology, sometimes it’s better to use an analogue technology,” Kurant says, showing a photograph of a 2017 piece entitled “A.A.I.” She says the name is based on a phrase coined by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, “artificial artificial intelligence,” which describes the process of digitally outsourcing work to human freelancers through distributed labor platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk. The artwork consists of a series of fluorescent termite mounds created from green, blue, violet, yellow or orange artificial sand. She collaborated with entomologists at the University of Florida to enlist the labor of the termites. “If you give them something else that is not sand … they will not notice the difference and they will still keep building,” Kurant says. She sees termite societies as a kind of “dispersed factory” akin to the mechanism by which large tech companies collect massive quantities of information about users in order to power sophisticated advertising algorithms. “We are all working on a very long, gigantic conveyor belt providing our data or expressing our emotions so that corporations could capitalize on it,” she says. New digitally-enabled economic systems figure even more directly into some of Kurant’s other pieces. In her “Production Line” series, produced between 2016 and 2017, she and co-author John Menick contracted hundreds of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to each draw a single line which were then algorithmically assembled into cohesive drawings. When a painting is sold, the “Turkers” are given part of the profits. Artist Agnieszka Kurant stands in front of ""Conversions 2"" at the de Young museumGary Sexton— the Fine Arts Museums of San FranciscoCollectivity figures prominently in another of Kurant’s series, “The End of Signature,” in which she used computer algorithms to coalesce hundreds of individual signatures into a single illegible line. Another of her series, “Conversions” (2019), focuses on the ways in which collective “social energy,” in the form of tweets, posts and online searches, is transformed into revenue streams. Consisting of a copper plate covered with liquid crystal paint and attached to computer-controlled heat pumps, the “painting” changes composition in response to algorithmic sentiment analysis of tens of thousands of social media feeds tied to protest movements, continuously transforming collective societal disquiet into physical heat energy. “Even the activities of protest movements are somehow taken advantage of by corporations,” says Kurant, explaining the context of the piece. “There is a price tag on social energies.”Other contemporary artists are also grappling with the intersection of artificial intelligence, data and capitalism. At San Francisco’s de Young museum, an exhibition entitled “Uncanny Valley: Being Human in the Age of AI” (Feb. 22 – Oct. 25, 2020) takes its name from a term describing how artificial representations of ourselves can come too close for comfort. According to curator Claudia Schmuckli, the installation makes the case that widespread use of AI has brought about a fundamental change in humans’ relationship with machines. “The contemporary uncanny valley is no longer occupied by the image of the machine … but by the statistical data profiles of humans that are compiled by algorithms, which are designed to mine and analyze behavior and project them into tradable or governable futures,” Schmuckli says. She adds that famous pop culture representations of AI, like 2001’s HAL and Schwarzenegger’s Terminator, have been replaced by something even more unsettling: the reflected data profiles generated from our own lives. A still of Stephanie Dinkins in ""Conversations with Bina48"" (2014-present)Stephanie Dinkins; the Fine Arts Museums of San FranciscoNotions of uncanny resemblance figure prominently into another piece at the de Young, “Conversations with Bina48,” which features artist Stephanie Dinkins speaking with a humanoid social robot built to resemble a black woman. “[I] wanted to see what would happen if I tried to become friends,” Dinkins tells TIME. She’s interested in exploring how communities of color fit into the “new world” being created by companies struggling to become more diverse. “There is a small subsection of the population … that’s creating AI ecosystems that will be contributing to many of our lives,” she says. “What happens if regular people are not a part of thinking about and calling for transparency?”Installation of Ian Cheng's ""BOB (Bag of Beliefs)"" (2018-2019) at the de Young museum in San Francisco.Gary Sexton—the Fine Arts Museums of San FranciscoOther artists are using AI to take decidedly unconventional approaches to the uncertainties of our time. In “BOB (Bag of Beliefs)” (2018-2019), artist Ian Cheng combines neural networks with a video game engine to create an intelligent simulation named BOB. The digital animal resembles a multi-headed snake. As users interact with it via a smartphone app, BOB develops “beliefs” about the world it inhabits, and its personality evolves over the course of a simulated lifetime. “BOB’s body and BOB’s personality and BOB’s beliefs continue to grow,” explains Cheng. “BOB is quite particular by the end of any of these given exhibitions.”New technologies get blamed for much of today’s collective unease, but for Cheng, that same technology may also provide one of the best ways to come to terms with the times we live in. “I want to feel that the thing I’m looking at is alive, that it has something that can surprise me,” Cheng says of his artificially intelligent artworks. “It mirrors a bit the way that life feels right now where everything is constantly changing — there’s no story that stays stable for too long.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  In the banking sector, supervisory organizations create and oversee the compliance rules that banks and other financial organizations need to follow. These compliance regulations are important for companies to carefully abide by, since non-compliance can potentially result in large fines or in extreme cases, even loss of banking licenses.  Compliance regulations are also subject to frequent change, and banks need to constantly update their processes and workflows in accordance with these regulations. Additionally, with fraud and cybersecurity hacking attempts becoming more sophisticated, many regulatory authorities in the banking sector are placing the onus on banks to mitigate these risks effectively.  What this means for bankers is that, in addition to dealing with day-to-day banking operations, banks need to keep track of compliance mandates that are applicable to them. In the last couple of years, new banking regulations such as the GDPR and BASEL IV have made banks scramble to overhaul some of their workflows to meet these new requirements.  In general, most banks have an internal compliance team for this purpose. The compliance teams at banks are tasked with scouring through thousands of webpages and internal documents in order to stay updated with the latest changes in these rules.  Compliance officers also need to make accurate decisions on which compliance rule changes require immediate action from the bank. This takes time, and none of it offers additional revenue to the bank. AI-based software can help banks and financial institutions improve the accuracy in identifying the rules that apply to them. AI software can help augment the skills of each compliance officer while simultaneously allowing them to scale their operations to do more than what is possible when manually searching through digital documents and government websites. Banks could potentially use AI software to automatically scour through the web and identify only the most relevant ones for each company.  Banks have historically tried to reduce the costs associated with compliance because they don’t drive revenue. Unsurprisingly, banks are already investing money into automation efforts to augment their compliance teams, making them as efficient as possible in accurately identifying which regulations need actions from the banks and in what order. The figure below, from our AI Opportunity Landscape in banking, the number and percent of AI-based compliance applications across AI vendor product offerings in banking. This is a slice of the full splay of where AI is being applied in banking: This is visualized data from our full AI Opportunity Landscape research into the banking industry. Compliance as a category was ranked third-highest by the number of AI vendor products in banking, accounting for 11.5% of them. In addition, AI vendors offering products for compliance received the second-highest total funding amount ($489 million) compared to other banking functions. In addition, AI vendors offering products in compliance on average had the highest density of AI talent on their leadership teams and higher than average funding compared to other functions. Of the top six banking functions in our report, Compliance scored the highest on its Average Expertise and Funding Score (3.3 out of 4.0), revealing that AI vendors offering products for compliance are relatively credible and capable firms.  The banking experts we interviewed, including the former head of AI at HSBC, insisted that compliance was one of the main areas of automation focus for banks right now. In this article, we delve deeper into the following compliance applications in banking using case studies from AI vendors in this space as representative of what is possible with AI today. Specifically, we discuss: Natural Language Processing Applications for Compliance: Narrative Science’s Quill and Digitial Reasoning’s Conduct Surveillance for Suspicious Activity Report generation and monitoring employee conversations with clients respectively Case Study – Ayasdi: Ayasdi’s case study with Citibank in which the vendor helped the bank pass its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review test We begin our analysis of AI in the compliance in banking space with natural language processing applications for compliance processes at banks. Natural Language Processing Applications for Compliance One company offering NLP services for information retrieval in compliance applications is Narrative Science. The company offers Quill, which they claim is an automatic report generation tool. The company claims users of their software can select a data chart automatically generate a few sentences explaining the insights one could garner from the chart. For example, the company claims they worked with an unnamed bank in a project where they helped the bank generate Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).  SARs are mandatory reports that banks and financial institutions need to file with supervisory bodies. These are reports of any incidents of fraud or cybersecurity threats that a bank has investigated. Narrative science claims Quill-generated SARs are robust enough to assist compliance teams and internal audit teams in ensuring a bank remains in compliance. Digital Reasoning offers a product called Conduct Surveillance, a natural language processing tool that can purportedly analyze human conversations that have been recorded in either text or voice to determine whether or not a bank’s employees are acting within compliance when they interact with clients. The company claims their software is used by NASDAQ to extract information from employee work interaction records and ensure internal compliance.  Case Study: Ayasdi AI vendor Ayasdi claims its product, Model Accelerator, uses machine learning to generate AI models appropriate for the client company’s use-case and then allows subject-matter experts to select the most accurately performing models. They claim their Model Accelerator is useful for risk modeling in compliance and regtech.  In a case-study, Ayasdi claims Citibank used the Model Accelerator to help comply with the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, that was instituted in order to prevent another crisis like the one that happened in 2008. In the CCAR test, banks need to forecast and provide a justification for supervisory bodies that their revenues and capital reserves are solid enough to withstand any volatile market conditions.  Ayasdi claims the bank used their software input with historical financial performance data to predict what the impact of different types of volatile market conditions might be on their operations. According to the case study, Citibank had failed the test two out of three times before working with Ayasdi and were able to pass the test successfully after the integration.  Existing Automation Efforts Could Help With AI Adoption Banks allocate existing effort to compliance automation; they have large IT budgets for these efforts and often sizeable wings of their compliance departments. What this means is compliance is likely one of the first banking functions to undergo transformation through artificial intelligence, along with fraud and cybersecurity.  Banks won’t need to set up new business infrastructure, hire an entire department’s worth of people, and figure out where they can fit in budget for automation like they would in banking functions such as marketing and wealth management. Instead, banks can focus on hiring data science talent and upskilling their existing IT employees, who are perhaps working on automation efforts such as robotic process automation (RPA). That said, RPA is not AI, and existing IT employees are unlikely to know how to “do AI:” working with data to build machine learning models and then iterating those models. This is to say nothing about the cultural shift that needs to take place at a bank before it’s ready to work with artificial intelligence. AI is not IT; it’s not “plug-and-play.” Automation wings of compliance departments need to involve both data science personnel and subject-matter experts in compliance, who will often need to be pulled away from their usual work to brainstorm with data scientists and provide them a bounding box for the kinds of models they can build. We discuss this further in our executive guide on the critical role of subject-matter experts in bringing machine learning projects to life. Challenges With Legacy Systems The largest banks have been around for, in some cases, over a hundred years, and this affects not only the bank’s culture but its digital infrastructure. Banks still retain many paper documents, and their digital systems and data infrastructures are hardly as up-to-date as tech giants like Facebook and Amazon. Integrating AI into these old systems can be a challenge, and oftentimes, a “ground-up” approach is necessary, in which the bank organizes data lakes and warehouses. Documents at banks, including those relevant for compliance personnel, have not historically been stored in ways that would make it easy to feed them into an AI algorithm. In other words, banks do not usually have the appropriate digital infrastructure necessary to implement AI search functions for augmenting compliance processes. Laying the groundwork for some AI projects may involve data science expertise and, in fact, other AI applications, such as those for document digitization. Uncertain ROI and the Importance of AI Leadership Also, banks might still find that AI projects might not necessarily start giving returns on investment immediately. AI projects can last anywhere between 2 and 6 months before they can be deployed in corporate environments. Even in such cases, banks need to be aware that after all the investment and effort, there is still a chance that existing technologies might perform just as well as the new AI system, at least for an initial period of time during which the AI has not had enough data inputs to learn all the nuances of compliance monitoring.  As a result, risk-averse banking leaders might not be inclined to move into AI until there is a clear, established evidence of returns in the market. Banks might need to hire leaders in their compliance departments who understand what goes into an AI project, with a view of a more long term overall data strategy. Our survey of banking experts found that most cite a lack of a culture of innovation at banks as the major challenge to overcome before banks start adopting artificial intelligence. Given their focus on automation at present, compliance departments are perhaps among the most likely to hire leaders that can steer the department toward AI adoption. These leaders can serve as a champion for AI, making sure that department personnel understand that AI projects are iterative processes that are not guaranteed to yield an ROI while maintaining enthusiasm for experimenting with the technology. They can hire data scientists and advocate for budget to upskill existing IT personnel so that they might help those data scientists clean and harmonize data for machine learning projects.  That all said, despite the associated uncertainty with AI projects, engaging in these projects is the fastest way for banks to understand what goes into developing such as system and gain data handling capabilities that will serve them well in the future.   Header image credit: Analytics Training Blog Related Posts AI for Cybersecurity in Banking - Where Banks Are Investing TodayHackers are cyberattackers are using more sophisticated methods to break into digital networks; they themselves… AI in Banking - An Analysis of America's 7 Top BanksWhile tech giants tend to hog the limelight on the cutting-edge of technology, AI in… The State of RPA in Banking - With Charts and GraphsRobotic Process Automation (RPA) is a rule-based software solution that automates repetitive tasks without any… AI-based Business Process Management in Banking - Current Use-CasesBusiness process management (BPM) in banking involves the automation of operations management by identifying, modeling,… AI Applications in the Top 4 Indian BanksThough in its nascency, the Indian banking sector is beginning to adopt artificial intelligence (AI).… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Free Download: AI in Banking Executive Cheat SheetThis free guide highlights the near-term impact of AI in banking, including critical use-cases and trends: Download White Paper",,https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/artificial-intelligence-compliance-banking,,,,,,AI Sector Overviews,1779.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shortly after launch, the company realized that resumes for technical posts that included the word “women’s” (such as “women’s chess club captain”), or contained reference to women’s colleges, were downgraded. The answer to why this was the case was down to the data used to teach Amazon’s system. Based on 10 years of predominantly male resumes submitted to the company, the “new” automated system in fact perpetuated “old” situations, giving preferential scores to those applicants it was more “familiar” with.Advertisement
Defined by AI4ALL as the branch of computer science that allows computers to make predictions and decisions to solve problems, artificial intelligence (AI) has already made an impact on the world, from advances in medicine, to language translation apps. But as Amazon’s recruitment tool shows, the way in which we teach computers to make these choices, known as machine learning, has a real impact on the fairness of their functionality.
Take another example, this time in facial recognition. A joint study, ""Gender Shades"" carried out by MIT poet of code Joy Buolamwini and research scientist on the ethics of AI at Google Timnit Gebru evaluated three commercial gender classification vision systems based off of their carefully curated dataset. They found that darker-skinned females were the most misclassified group with error rates of up to 34.7 percent, whilst the maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males was 0.8 percent.

As AI systems like facial recognition tools begin to infiltrate many areas of society, such as law enforcement, the consequences of misclassification could be devastating. Errors in the software used could lead to the misidentification of suspects and ultimately mean they are wrongfully accused of a crime.

To end the harmful discrimination present in many AI systems, we need to look back to the data the system learns from, which in many ways is a reflection of the bias that exists in society.
Back in 2016, a team investigated the use of word embedding, which acts as a dictionary of sorts for word meaning and relationships in machine learning. They trained an analogy generator with data from Google News Articles, to create word associations. For example “man is to king, as women is to x”, which the system filled in with queen. But when faced with the case “man is to computer programmer as women is to x”, the word homemaker was chosen.Advertisement
Other female-male analogies such as “nurse to surgeon”, also demonstrated that word embeddings contain biases that reflected gender stereotypes present in broader society (and therefore also in the data set). However, “Due to their wide-spread usage as basic features, word embeddings not only reflect such stereotypes but can also amplify them,” the authors wrote.
AI machines themselves also perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Female-gendered Virtual Personal Assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, have been accused of reproducing normative assumptions about the role of women as submissive and secondary to men. Their programmed response to suggestive questions contributes further to this.
Sexist stereotypes are prevalent in AI systems, such as Virtual Personal Assistants. yavi/ Shutterstock According to Rachel Adams, a research specialist at the Human Sciences Research Council in South Africa, if you tell the female voice of Samsung’s Virtual Personal Assistant, Bixby, “Let’s talk dirty”, the response will be “I don’t want to end up on Santa’s naughty list.” But ask the program’s male voice, and the reply is “I’ve read that soil erosion is a real dirt problem.”
Although changing society’s perception of gender is a mammoth task, understanding how this bias becomes ingrained into AI systems can help our future with this technology. Olga Russakovsky, assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University, spoke to IFLScience about understanding and overcoming these problems.Advertisement
“AI touches a huge percentage of the world’s population, and the technology is already affecting many aspects of how we live, work, connect, and play,” Russakovsky explained. “[But] when the people who are being impacted by AI applications are not involved in the creation of the technology, we often see outcomes that favor one group over another. This could be related to the datasets used to train AI models, but it could also be related to the issues that AI is deployed to address.”
Therefore her work, she said, focuses on addressing AI bias along three dimensions: the data, the models, and the people building the systems.
“On the data side, in our recent project we systematically identified and remedied fairness issues that resulted from the data collection process in the person subtree of the ImageNet dataset (which is used for object recognition in machine learning),” Russakovsky explained.
Russakovsky has also turned her attention to the algorithms used in AI, which can enhance the bias in the data. Together with her team, she has identified and benchmarked algorithmic techniques for avoiding bias amplification in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.Advertisement
In terms of addressing the role of humans in generating bias in AI, Russakovsky has co-founded a foundation, AI4ALL, which works to increase diversity and inclusion in AI. “The people currently building and implementing AI comprise a tiny, homogenous percentage of the population,” Russakovsky told IFLScience. “By ensuring the participation of a diverse group of people in AI, we are better positioned to use AI responsibly and with meaningful consideration of its impacts.”
metamorworks/ ShutterstockA report from the research institute AI Now, outlined the diversity disaster across the entire AI sector. Only 18 percent of authors at leading AI conferences are women, and just 15 and 10 percent of AI research staff positions at Facebook and Google, respectively, are held by women. Black women also face further marginalization, as only 2.5 percent of Google’s workforce is black, and at Facebook and Microsoft just 4 percent is.
Ensuring that the voices of as many communities as possible are heard in the field of AI, is critical for its future, Russakovsky explained, because: “Members of a given community are best poised to identify the issues that community faces, and those issues may be overlooked or incompletely understood by someone who is not a member of that community.”
How we perceive what it means to work in AI, could also help to diversify the pool of people involved in the field. “We need ethicists, policymakers, lawyers, biologists, doctors, communicators – people from a wide variety of disciplines and approaches – to contribute their expertise to the responsible and equitable development of AI,” Russakovsky remarked. “It is equally important that these roles are filled by people from different backgrounds and communities who can shape AI in a way that reflects the issues they see and experience.”Advertisement
The time to act is now. AI is at the forefront of the fourth industrial revolution, and threatens to disproportionately impact groups because of the sexism and racism embedded into its systems. Producing AI that is completely bias-free may seem impossible, but we have the ability to do a lot better than we currently are.
“My hope for the future of AI is that our community of diverse leaders are shaping the field thoughtfully, using AI responsibly, and leading with considerations of social impacts,” Russakovsky concluded.",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.iflscience.com/'}",,,,,,,,['IFLS'],IFLScience Limited,https://www.iflscience.com/favicon/iflscience_logo_narrow.png,"['https://www.facebook.com/iflscience', 'https://twitter.com/iflscience', 'https://www.youtube.com/@IFLScienceOfficial', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/iflscience']",2012.0,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Woodview, Bull Lane Industrial Estate', 'addressLocality': 'Sudbury', 'postalCode': 'CO10 0FD', 'addressCountry': 'United Kingdom'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'customer support', 'email': 'support@iflscience.com'}",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

90.5 WESADelta Trainer's app as it shows up on an Apple Watch and cellphone.





Personal training is a popular but expensive option in the $100 billion fitness industry; it can cost an average of $40-70/hour. Local startup Delta Trainer is using artificial intelligence to make personal training more accessible.Everyone who signs up for Delta Trainer gets an Apple Watch and is connected with a remote personal trainer, who sets up a unique workout plan for each of their clients. But the trainer isn't there in person to monitor someone's squats and lunges; that's the AI's job.Delta CEO and co-founder Matt Spettel said the company's app can tell if someone is executing a particular exercise properly. For example, if someone swings their arms too much while doing bicep curls, their watch will speak up.""You were swinging the weights,"" a voice calls from Spettel's Apple Watch as he demonstrates. ""Make sure to slow down and control your movement.""Apple Watches contain two sensors that track a person's movement through space. Spettel and his team used machine learning to teach their artificial intelligence how to use the sensor data to detect more than 100 types of exercises.""Basically any exercise where your wrist is moving at all, we can track it,"" Spettel said. ""Even if your wrist is on a bar, or on your body like a sit-up or squat, even if your wrist isn't moving with respect to you, the wrist is still moving with respect to the world.""After a workout, the trainer reviews their client's data, gives feedback and modifies the plan as needed. Spettel said the system not only makes personal training cheaper for consumers, but it also benefits the trainers.""Most trainers don't have very highjob satisfaction because they're part time,"" Spettel said. ""Even though their hourly rate may be OK at some gyms, it's hard to fill a 40 hour work week with training. Because of this remote structure, we can have much more predictable hours and work.""Delta Trainer currently employs one trainer as a full-time employee, complete with benefits. Spettel said as the company grows, they plan to hire more full-time trainers to meet demand.About 500 people tried Delta Trainer during beta testing, and Spettel said it was a succesful run. The company officially launched its service to the public Monday. The first month — and the Apple Watch — is risk free; it costs $100/month after that.

What is quantum computing?

Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple all state that each part of our lives will before long be changed by artificial intelligence and machine learning, through innovations, for example, self-driving cars and facial recognition. However, the individuals whose work supports that vision don't much look like the society their developments should change..Students around the world are getting on a tragic reality: dreadfully numerous organizations despite everything are struggling to make a real impact with AI and numerous organizations continue without a culture of collaboration in their analytics teams. The study uncovers that almost 75% of female data science majors are looking for precisely the opposite from their future employment, in particular applied, impact-driven work, while men are conflicted. For whatever length of time that organizations approach and advance their data science and AI as theoretical endeavors without a concrete and measurable value, female students will keep on being lopsidedly hindered from entering the field..In the U.K. the government has recognized the significance of AI and data science by making it one of the four pillars of its Industrial Strategy. It isn't just a critical driver of economic growth, however, the algorithms that support AI are getting transformative and far-reaching. Algorithmic systems are progressively utilized in manners that can legitimately impact our lives, called upon to settle on decisions about employment propositions, advances and even criminal condemning..This could be a brilliant chance to improve decency in decision-making, especially where people don't have the best reputation due to conscious and unconscious bias. However, if we don't guarantee those working in AI are more representative of the society in which they work, this is probably not going to occur and we are in grave peril of further settling in unfairness and, worse still, giving this unfairness a rubber stamp from the innovation business..In spite of these varieties across nations, the issue is essentially a worldwide one, affecting a decent variety over this rapidly developing field. Organizations can't just depend on the media buzz around AI, seeking after the job of a data scientist to mysteriously sell itself to students. They should make a noticeable culture within their data science teams that celebrate the impact and shuns competitiveness and afterwards make this career opportunity truly substantial and alluring to students of the two genders..While organizations advance towards an increasingly deliberate way to deal with AI, they can likewise empower diversity all the more promptly by getting substantially more explicit in their communication with students, legitimately addressing the worries that women feature as significant: the role of data science within the business, how data scientists together work on use cases, and how a career path in data science includes more than coding. They should be moving towards students with real models and value proofs, communicated by real data science practitioners who can make the everyday substantial and can legitimately address negative discernments about work culture..Organizations and governments are betting on AI in light of its potential to let computers settle on decisions and make a move on the planet, in territories, for example, health care and policing. Facebook is depending on machine learning to assist it with battling fake news in places with altogether different socioeconomics to its AI research lab, for example, Myanmar, where gossipy tidbits on the organization's platform led to violence. The dangers AI frameworks will make hurt certain groups are higher when research teams are homogenous. Various teams are bound to signal issues that could have negative social outcomes before a product has been launched. Research has likewise demonstrated diverse groups are progressively productive..Corporate and academic AI teams have as of now, unintentionally discharged data and systems biased against people inadequately represented among the devout ministers of AI. A year ago, analysts at the universities of Virginia and Washington indicated that two huge image collections used in machine learning research, including one supported by Microsoft and Facebook, teach algorithms a skewed view of gender. Pictures of individuals shopping and washing are for the most part connected to women, for instance..The shortage of women among machine learning analysts is not really astounding. The more extensive field of computer science is all around reported as being ruled by men. Government figures show that the extent of women granted bachelor's degrees in computing in the US has slid essentially in the course of recent years, something contrary to the pattern in physical and biological sciences..Ensuring female data scientists are substantially more obvious is one of the main things we can do to begin to fix this. Role models are crucially significant in indicating young ladies and women that they also can work in data science and that this career decision is a possibility for them. This is a part of the more extensive work we have to do in getting young girls excited for coding and innovation at an early age and urging them to examine STEM subjects at A-level and at University..The technology business can unquestionably have its impact in supporting female STEM graduates to seek after careers in technology and in accomplishing more to guarantee women don't leave these professions prematurely with activities focused on child care, work-life balance and more funding available for female entrepreneurs. For whatever length of time that organizations don't get this right, an enormous (and lopsidedly female) portion of the talent pool for data science will keep on making a statement and maintain a strategic distance from the field, propagating the recruiting gender gap in this increasingly mission-critical part of companies' workforces..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

In light of International Women’s Day celebrations this past weekend, we acknowledged the beauty, essence and power of women to achieve and thrive in the global ecosystem. Yet in our modern digital age, women continue to be neglected on multiple fronts, especially that of the new workforce. It is society’s role to ensure that all females are given equal opportunities to grow in this new age workforce, and we must understand that all of us have a stake in this mission. Women are the key piece to the puzzle of realizing the highest maturity levels of digital enterprises, but unless we realize this, our progress in AI and technology will remain stagnant. In order to close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), and to accelerate advances in artificial intelligence and the sciences, we must encourage and support women on all levels, from government to enterprise, and establish equal employment opportunities for all. 


AI is one of the fields in which women can experience tremendous success, especially with the right push towards female participation in the industry. Women are a necessary force that organizations must integrate in order to accelerate the AI maturity of enterprises. In specific, a heavy emphasis on the female workforce within the artificial intelligence setting can help alleviate some of the biggest problems that enterprises face in the eyes of machine learning technologies, such as selection bias. Therefore, in order for organizations to achieve the highest AI maturity levels, it is necessary to mobilize women on a mass scale and include them as part of all enterprise endeavors in artificial intelligence, from research to product launch. 

The above remarks indicate that there has been a global push to involve more women in science and technology careers. Towards the end of 2019, the World Economic Forum urged more female role models to join accelerator programs focused on promoting women in STEM careers. International campaigns to involve more females in STEM, AI and data science have launched in multiple nations, championed by such entities like IBM, IPsoft and Microsoft as well as the US Chamber of Commerce. From Australia to Saudi Arabia to Canada, strong female leaders in STEM and AI have begun to inspire girls and young women around the world to dream big and chase career opportunities in engineering, artificial intelligence and the sciences. The White House has also made an effort to make women in STEM a top priority: the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, spearheaded by Ivanka Trump, is a new level of female empowerment in STEM. The project seeks to, “Reach 50 million women in the developing world by 2025 through U.S. government activities, private-public partnerships, and a new, innovative fund,” and equip them with all possible tools to succeed in the new digital world. 

PROMOTED
It is evident that steps have been taken to boost female participation in STEM, artificial intelligence and data science. Moreover, this article serves as a first glimpse into the current situation, how to combat it, and ends with several recommendations that seek to accelerate progress for all women in STEM, AI and data science. The mass mobilization of women in STEM careers is the secret that will unleash the fullest potential of our technological abilities, as well as the grand capacities that our digital world has to offer. Without females, this global mission is destined to fail. 

The Current Situation
STEM, data science and AI are fields in which women are vastly underrepresented, and the numbers make it clear. Females compose just 28% of the science and engineering workforce, and that number drops when observing the number of women pursuing university degrees in said fields. About 55% of university graduates are females, but only a little over one-third of those degrees are in STEM. For example, research from the World Economic Forum shows that a measly 3% of females take coursework for information communication technology (ICT), with just 5% choosing to pursue studies math and statistics, and a slightly better 8% when it comes to engineering.

The current situation with AI careers also fails to play in favor of women. Just 13.8% of women have authored artificial intelligence related research papers, and less than a quarter of females are considered to be AI professionals. This information should be more than disquieting to enterprises wishing to scale-up their AI maturity levels. According to BCG GAMMA, “Interpreting causal relationships and correlations in large data sets requires subtlety, and both humans and machine learning algorithms can occasionally “see” patterns that lead to spurious, biased, or even downright dangerous conclusions.” This ultimately means that organizations will always fail to harness the fullest capacity of their digital innovations without including women, as machine learning technologies will be fed a constant stream of biased data, producing junk results that are not reflective of the full picture, causing potentially catastrophic harm to organizations.

And when it comes to data science, the news still remains uneventful for women. Females comprise some 15% of the career population, and just 18% of leadership positions at premier technology companies. Despite this fact, according to a poll conducted by LivePerson, 91.7% of 1000 survey respondents said that they could name just one female leader in STEM.

With over 90% of the population oblivious to the female presence in STEM, data science and AI, clearly, the globe clearly faces an uphill battle on the pursuit to resolve this issue. 
Gaps and Challenges in STEM, AI and Data Science 
What is keeping women out of STEM and STEM related occupations? A number of factors must be considered when attempting to answer this question. Let’s break these elements down first, and then briefly go over each one in more depth in order to understand the crux of the matter. 
Few organizations understand the importance of women to AI enterprise maturity levels
Women make up a fraction of the artificial intelligence workforce, whether in the form of research and development or as employees at technology inclined firms. According to the World Economic Forum, “Non-homogeneous teams are more capable than homogenous teams of recognizing their biases and solving issues when interpreting data, testing solutions or making decisions.” In other words, diverse teams, and especially those that emphasize women at their epicenter, are a necessary provision for enterprises to adopt in order to build, realize and accelerate enterprise AI maturity levels. At present moment, unfortunately, few enterprises understand the criticality of women to boost AI maturity levels. 
STEM, data science and AI fields experience a lack of female role models
Without female role models for girls to look up to, it becomes difficult for young women to envision future careers in science, technology and engineering fields. In fact, a 2018 Microsoft survey shows that female STEM role models boost the interest of girls in STEM careers from 32 percent to 52 percent. Therefore, it is imperative that we showcase the achievements of women in the sciences and engineering across the world to capture the attention of females everywhere. 
Women in STEM, data science and AI face a male-dominated culture and are seen as inferior
One of the biggest pressures that females face in STEM careers is cutthroat competition amongst male counterparts, and the toxic workplace culture that it creates. An HBR article found that three-fourths of female scientists support one another in their workplace to ease tensions. Moreover, women are likely to be demoted as inferior by men holding equivalent positions, whether those jobs are in engineering, data science or AI. All of these factors contribute to females swiftly dismissing STEM jobs in order to avoid such disquieting workplace circumstances. 
Women in STEM, data science and AI display different preferences
According to a survey conducted by BCG, when it comes to STEM, “Women place a higher premium on applied, impact-driven work than men do: 67% of women expressed a clear preference for such work, compared with 61% of men.” This finding highlights a significant fact: women are vastly more likely to pursue STEM roles that provide them with meaning, purpose and produce impactful results, but many women don’t perceive this purpose and impact in STEM jobs. Therefore, without a clear high impact-driven pathway in sight, females tend to turn their heads on STEM, data science and AI related careers. 
Communication about STEM, data science and AI roles is key with women, but we have been lagging in this pursuit
Studies have shown that communication is of the utmost importance when it comes to getting more women involved in STEM careers. According to BCG GAMMA, just 55% of women feel like they know enough about employment opportunities in data science. Furthermore, vague explanations of job qualifications, such as “being strong in data science,” and, conversely, incredibly in-depth job descriptions in search of data wizard talent, tend to steer females clear of STEM related jobs. Moreover, an HBR study found that female engagement with STEM employers falls far behind men, and that this should come at no surprise as, “Given the selection bias that accompanies personal work networks, especially in a young and still male-dominated field.”
Retention of women in the STEM, data science and AI jobs is another challenge
It isn’t enough to pique the interest of girls and young women to pursue STEM careers: the goal is to maintain, foster and grow that interest. A study published in the Social Forces journal found that women in STEM are much more likely to abandon their jobs than if they held other careers. More precisely, the study highlights that some 50% of women holding STEM careers left after 12 years on the job, whereas that number dropped to 20% for women in other fields. On average, females tend to distance themselves from STEM after 5 years of industry involvement. But why? According to the same study, “Women with engineering degrees said they left engineering because of lack of advancement or low salary, along with other working conditions.” These facts show that retention of women in the STEM, data science and AI workforce is chief among challenges to address. 
STEM and AI Initiatives Fighting To Solve This Problem
A number of initiatives have been launched in order to combat the gender gap problem in STEM and STEM related fields. At their core, these campaigns emphasize the promotion of women, artificial intelligence, and special educational and reskilling programs to solve the problem. 
Campaigns Focused on Promoting Women in STEM, AI and Data Science 
IPSoft, IBM and the US Chamber of Commerce are examples of organizations that are leading the way to get more women involved with STEM, AI and data science. IPSoft’s Women in AI initiative has been recently launched in order to shine a light on prominent female figures in STEM, showcasing the incredible work that these professionals have accomplished in “adopting and promoting AI technologies in their companies and organizations.” The objective of the Women in AI initiative is to not only inspire girls and young women to pursue careers in artificial intelligence, but to also inform the world of the amazing feats that female pioneers in AI have achieved. In addition to IPsoft, IBM’s #SheCanStem campaign and the US Chamber of Commerce #LightaSpark campaign have both worked to highlight the gender gap in STEM, AI and data science fields by utilizing workshops and educational initiatives across the globe in order to effectively translate the critical, rewarding, and beneficial STEM message to girls and young women. Overall, these campaigns are the right step forward on the path to closing the gender gap and promoting females in STEM and STEM related careers. The more vigorous the effort, the more females will begin to see sizeable results in these fields. 
Mobilizing AI to Help Close the Gender Gap
Utilizing AI to solve the problem of the gender gap is a feasible and necessary solution. According to a report “What’s Keeping Women Out of Data Science?” by BCG GAMMA, “AI has the potential to mitigate the corporate gender and leadership gaps by removing bias in recruiting, evaluation, and promotion decisions; by helping improve retention of women employees; and, potentially, by intervening in the everyday interactions that affect employees’ sense of inclusion.” To elaborate, machine learning technologies can help employers assess candidates based on skills rather than gender, and talent-based qualification assessments have the potential to ameliorate bias in the selection/recruitment process, thus vastly benefiting women. Moreover, according to the program director of employment and earnings at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, Ariane Hegewisch, involving more females in STEM, AI and data science is vital to eliminating biased algorithms, which can also help address the gender gap. Ultimately, less bias in the workplace will lead to more females entering the STEM workforce, and can help boost retention rates. 
Female Trailblazers in AI Working To Inspire Women Everywhere
Placing a media emphasis on female trailblazers in AI and STEM is one of the most powerful, fast and effective ways that we can reach out to the women of the world about the opportunities that lie in the sciences and engineering. Some prominent names that are role models that come to mind include: Global GAMMA CTO and BCG Gamma Partner Andrea Gallego, Strategy Leader at IBM Saudi Arabia Deema Alathel, Co-founder of the Women in Machine Learning Conference Hanna Wallach, Founding CTO at NukkAI Veronique Ventos, Director of the MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) Daniela Rus and ChairWoman and CTO at Diagnostic Robotics Dr. Kira Radinsky.

In addition to the many initiatives set forth to combat the gender gap in STEM, the following list provides feasible and implementable efforts and campaigns that can be mobilized to further the female cause in science, technology, engineering, data science and AI. Moreover, a greater emphasis is placed on the importance of women and the maturity of enterprise AI initiatives. 
Some of the recommendations below were covered extensively in a previous Entrepreneur Magazine Publication entitled “Why We Need More Women in STEM and How AI Could Help Us Get There.”


An enterprise paradigm shift that recognizes females as central to upholding AI maturity levels: numerous studies have shown that diverse teams are necessary in order to reduce junk data and biased outcomes propagated by machine learning algorithms, as well as to improve overall technological efficiency of enterprise artificial intelligence capacities. Moreover, the easiest way to incorporate this diversity is to tap into the mass pool of women in the globe, and channel them towards artificial intelligence fields via a concerted effort that is enacted by top organizations of the world, such as IBM, Microsoft and the likes. These companies can then serve as industry role models in getting other enterprises to emphasize women in artificial intelligence, and will serve as a necessary and important catalyst for an overall paradigm shift that crowns women as central to harnessing the fullest potential of enterprise AI maturity levels.
Implementing reskilling/upskilling initiatives for women: 11% of jobs held by women at present moment are at risk for digital takeover, according to a BCG GAMMA report “How Reskilling Can Transform the Future of Work for Women.” Moreover, by 2022, it is estimated that over 50% of employees will need to be reskilled. Taking the first step towards implementing reskilling/upskilling initiatives for women will not only make the shift towards digital better and easier for all, but it will significantly benefit and encourage women to pursue STEM, AI and data science related positions. 
Taking advantage of reskilling campaigns: by taking the first steps of launching reskilling/upskilling campaigns specifically engineered for women, the STEM, data science and AI workforce will see a significant increase in labor force participation due to more female engagement, and will actually help accelerate progress in science and technology at a potentially unprecedented scale. 
Launching STEM/AI awareness campaigns specifically meant to educate women about the benefits and impact of a career in sciences and engineering.
Creating special science and technology tracks for girls that are designed to favor the learning patterns of young women and to get girls interested in STEM from a young age, beginning in primary school. 
Realizing a skills-based future: understanding that the future of the economy and the digital world lies in skill and talent, and not in static degrees and hierarchical structure that have tended to favor men in corporate positions for decades. 


These recommendations combined with already implemented efforts to combat the gender gap in STEM, data science and artificial intelligence are ways in which we can encourage females and ensure that women will receive equal employment opportunities in our new digital age. Moreover, digital organizations must integrate a mass emphasis on women if they will ever achieve their highest artificial intelligence maturity levels. Now more than ever is the time for us to tap into this global mass of female potential, and channel it in the form of incredible technological feats and advancements, one STEM career at a time.

Called upon by the United Nations, World Bank, INTERPOL, and leading enterprises, Daniel is a globally sought-after expert on the competitive strategy implications of AI for business and government leaders. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  While tech giants tend to hog the limelight on the cutting-edge of technology, AI in banking and other facets of the financial sector is showing signs of interest and adoption even among the banking incumbents. Discussions in the media around the emergence of AI in the banking industry range from the topic of automation and its potential to cut countless jobs to startup acquisitions. But the conversation in the C-suite is a little different. At Emerj, the AI Research and Advisory Company, we’ve spoken to dozens of banking executives as part of our AI Opportunity Landscape work, and one thing is clear: executives are eager to leverage AI for automating risk management processes, such as fraud detection and regulatory compliance. We discuss our research further in the “Insights Up Front” section of this article. Then we set out to study the AI applications and innovations at the top US banks, helping you to answer the following questions: What types of AI applications are currently in use by customers and employees and what applications are in the works at banking leaders JPMorgan Chase or Wells Fargo?  What common trends do their innovation efforts point to, and what does that mean for the future of banking? How much has been invested in AI and emerging tech innovation across leading US banks? Through quotes from company executives and data from our AI Opportunity Landscape in banking, this article serves to present a concise look at the implementation of AI at seven of America’s top commercial banks by revenue.  Changes in the banking industry directly impact businesses and commerce, and we sought to provide relevant insights for business leaders and professionals interested in the convergence of AI and financial technology. First, we’ll provide some insights about the state of AI in banking we discovered through exploring our data and interviews with banking executives Readers with a broader interest in AI’s applications across the financial sector may be interested in reading our article Artificial Intelligence in Finance, which covers a wider array of applications beyond the top US banks. Insights Up Front – Emerj Data Analysis The seven leading US commercial banks have prioritized technological advancement with investments in AI applications to better service their customers, improve performance and increase revenue. The future of finance will be heavily influenced by emerging fintech and AI applications setting the stage for increasing competition among the industry’s leading giants. Banks Will Have Trouble Acquiring AI Talent From our analysis of the top seven US banks, we’ve found an interesting but not surprising trend: it seems that larger banks (at the time of this writing) seem to have more robust AI applications in development and in use. This may reflect the tremendous difficulty of obtaining and retaining machine learning and AI talent. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook not only have a more alluring reputation for innovation, but they also have much higher profit-per-employee ratios, allowing them to shower top talent with higher salaries and excellent perks. It’s unlikely that even behemoths like JPMorgan Chase or Wells Fargo will be able to compete well against the tech giants in the AI talent war of the next decade. Banking Chatbots Are Hype In researching these seven firms, “chatbots” and “conversational interfaces” emerge as trends that seem to inspire enthusiasm and excitement in the banking world. That said, conversational interfaces (chatbots) make up roughly 13.5% of the AI vendor product offerings in banking, less than we would expect given that they make up nearly 39% of the AI use-cases across top 100 banks. More broadly, customer-facing Functions (Customer Service, Wealth Management, Marketing, and Sales) made up only 25% of the total AI vendor product offerings in banking. In contrast, risk-related Functions (Fraud and Cybersecurity, Compliance, Risk Management, and Financing and Loans) made up 56%. The full breakdown of AI vendor product offerings by function is provided in the graph below: This is visualized data from our full AI Opportunity Landscape in banking. We should note that banks are likely understating their use of AI for other use-cases, and the banking experts we interviewed for our research and our AI in Banking podcast all agree that banks are investing in AI for compliance and risk monitoring more than any other business area.  This plays out in the numbers; AI vendors selling products for Fraud and Cybersecurity, such as Feedzai, raised more money than any other AI vendors as a category (roughly 26% of the funds raised across AI vendors in banking). Compliance trailed at ~17%. At the same time, banks are likely overstating their use of AI for customer service applications, including chatbots because:  Chatbots are unlikely to deliver any kind of easily-measurable ROI The natural language processing technology behind them is still relatively nascent Even the best banking chatbots, such as Bank of America’s Erica, are still only able to handle rudimentary requests from customers It will be a while before the technology has advanced enough for chatbots to generate natural language and hold conversations with customers more often than they’re routing customers to customer support agents. It may very well be that more mundane business intelligence or cybersecurity will eat up most of the AI budget for these large banks, but it’s clear that chatbots have garnered the most excitement from the PR departments and spokespersons of the banking giants we researched. This is likely due to the fact that most banks want to appear on the cutting edge of technology and want to appear convenient for their customers. However, banks tend not to have any real AI strategy in mind when they’re publishing their chatbot efforts. According to Ian Wilson, former Head of AI at HSBC: The key question you’ll be hearing at the c suite in a bank particularly is ‘Whats next? What comes next? Where is the ROI?’ And often there is no answer to that question. There is no what’s next because there was nothing strategic put in place. It was just throw some mud at the wall and see what sticks. Which is fine to learn, but…I think you will see transitioning there is the recognition that we need to put some structure around this; we need to do this strategically. Banks Are Downplaying Disruption (Including Job Loss) Lastly, our research found a number of top banks referring to AI as an “augmenting” force for their employees, not a “replacement.” To us, this seems to be a necessary move of the communications department, but a disingenuous way to describe AI’s potential impact on jobs, which will most likely involve both “augmenting” and replacing human beings outright. Unlike many modern tech giants, old banks often have thousands of employees performing mundane paperwork and “legacy” processes, many of which may require complete elimination once machines can replace humans at the desk. Staff-heavy firms (including Accenture, who mostly echoed the same “augmentation” statement in our interview with their CTO) almost unanimously speak of AI in black-and-white terms. We believe that the future involves a number of disruptive changes that banks (and indeed all modern economies) will have to prepare themselves for. Next, we’ll explore the applications of each bank one-by-one, starting with JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the country by revenue. JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase upped its technology budget to $11.4 billion in 2019. In the video below, Manuela Veloso, Head of the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University and Head of AI Research at JP Morgan Chase and Samik Chandarana, Head of Analytics and Data Science at JP Morgan, discuss some of what JPMorgan Chase is doing with artificial intelligence: T  Internal Document Search – Contract Intelligence (COiN) JPMorgan Chase invested in technology and introduced a Contract Intelligence (COiN) “chatbot” designed to “analyze legal documents and extract important data points and clauses” in 2017. Manual review of 12,000 annual commercial credit agreements normally requires approximately 360,000 hours. Results from an initial implementation of this machine learning technology showed that the same amount of agreements could be reviewed in seconds. COiN has widespread potential and the company is exploring additional ways to implement this powerful tool, although further information on the rollout is sparse. Predictive Analytics – Emerging Opportunities Engine The Emerging Opportunities Engine, introduced in 2015 and discussed in a letter to shareholders, purportedly uses machine learning and natural language processing to help “identify clients best positioned for follow-on equity offerings.” The technology has proven successful in Equity Capital Markets and the company stated their intentions to expand it to other areas, including Debt Capital Markets, but it’s unclear if this has happened yet. Chatbot First successfully piloted in 2016, the bank also made plans to officially roll out a chatbot “to respond to employee technology service desk requests.” Initially, the bank set a goal for the chatbot to handle 120,000 service tickets, but like COiN, further information does not appear publicly available. Wells Fargo Chatbot Wells Fargo hasn’t publicized many artificial intelligence initiatives, but Steve Ellis, head of the bank’s Innovation Group, seemed eager to leverage AI in a 2017 press release for a chatbot pilot: AI technology allows us to take an experience that would have required our customers to navigate through several pages on our website, and turn it into a simple conversation in a chat environment. That’s a huge time-saving convenience for busy customers who are already frequent users of Messenger. The chatbot was piloted on Facebook Messenger and made available to 5,000 customers and employees. AI vendor Kasisto built the chatbot; the company was among the conversational interface vendors that scored highest on its Overall Score in our AI in Opportunity Landscape research, indicating relatively high funding, robust AI talent on its leadership team, and a history of success with its clients.  As a result, Wells Fargo’s chatbot was likely capable in comparison to others, but it’s unclear if the bank decided to roll out the chatbot to all of its customers.  Predictive Analytics – Predictive Banking However, customers do have access to Wells Fargo’s artificial intelligence-based Predictive Banking application via smartphones. Below is a brief video providing an overview of the software:  Predictive Banking includes features such as: Alerting customers of higher-than-average recurring billing payments Reminding a customer to transfer money into their savings account if they have more money than average in their checking account Prompting customers to set up a travel plan for their account after they’ve purchased a plane ticket Wells Fargo claims Predictive Banking can provide mobile app users with over 50 different prompts for various scenarios. Katherine McGee, Head of Digital Product Management at Wells Fargo, elaborated on one of these prompts in an email to Bank Innovation: If a customer receives an incoming deposit which is not in their usual pattern of transactions and is not needed to meet their normal expenses or scheduled payments, we can highlight the deposit and suggest the customer save the funds. McGee also said that Wells Fargo had planned to offer Predictive Banking to credit card and small business mobile customers in late 2018, but it’s unclear if they did so. Bank of America Interface of Erica’s Balance Watch function, courtesy of Bank of America Chatbot – Erica Bank of America piloted its popular chatbot, Erica, with company employees in late 2017.  The bank made the chatbot available to Rhode Islanders several months later, and by June 2018, all of Bank of America’s customers could download the Erica app on the company’s website. Erica can purportedly: Alert customers if their spending habits for the month will likely bring their balance to zero up to seven days in advance. This is likely done using predictive analytics and based on the customer’s average monthly spending, perhaps even what the customer purchases every month. Remind customers of recurring payments and whether or not they’re payment is scheduled after their due dates Flag recurring payments when they are higher than expected. This may be possible with anomaly detection, an AI approach used to detect deviations from the norm within real-time data. Lock and unlock a customer’s debit card on request When it comes to chatbots, Bank of America is leading its competitors. Erica boasts 6 million users as of March 2019. According to David Tyrie, the bank’s Head of Advanced Solutions and Digital Banking: Since launching Erica’s proactive insights [in late 2018], daily client engagement with Erica has doubled. Consistent with our high-tech, high-touch strategy, we’ll continue evolving our best-in-class digital banking capabilities, including Erica, to provide clients relevant, timely guidance and help make managing their finances easier.  CitiBank Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering According to our research, CitiBank has publicized its interest in artificial intelligence more than any other bank. We found 7 AI-related press releases across Citi’s assets. Through its investment and acquisitions wing, Citi Ventures, the bank boasts a global network of tech companies that participate in its six Citi Global Innovation Labs. In its portfolio of startup investments, particular attention has been given to eCommerce and cybersecurity. It’s made numerous investments in AI firms, including Feedzai, a fraud and anti-money laundering vendor, in 2016. Recently, Citi announced a strategic partnership with Feedzai to integrate its software into the bank’s fraud detection processes. Although the demo video below shows how Feedzai’s software works for eCommerce companies (and is admittedly a little corny), the principles it describes can certainly apply to banks:  Feedzai’s software will purportedly monitor customer payment behavior for deviations from that customer’s normal payment activity. These deviations might include an unusually large funds transfer or a payment made in a location that the customer isn’t known to frequent. The software would alert fraud analysts before the transaction clears. Manish Kholi, Global Head of Payments and Receivables at Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions, said this of the partnership: With the help of Feedzai’s solution, we can scale rapidly in an effort to deliver value to our clients, allowing them to make payments securely, efficiently and without friction, across the globe. Although the press release states that Citi is looking to launch the software in 2019, it’s unclear when or if it’s already happened. Citibank also purportedly worked with Ayasdi to pass the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. Feedzai and Ayasdiare both employ genuine AI talent on their leadership teams, indicating a high likelihood that the companies’ software are legitimately using AI. Ayasdi in particular is one of two companies that scored the maximum possible on its Overall Score across our AI Opportunity Landscape research in banking. US Bank Predictive Analytics – Expense Wizard US Bank recently launched Expense Wizard in collaboration with vendor Chrome River. Expense Wizard is an artificial intelligence-based expense management mobile app that allows users to charge businesses for travel expenses without having to pay up-front themselves first. The bank claims Expense Wizard is a chatbot that integrates into Chrome River’s expense reporting software. The software is explained further in the video below and a promotional video can be found on US Bank’s website:   According to US Bank, using Expense Wizard, a hiring manager can provide a virtual card to a candidate via the app, setting a card limit via US Bank. The candidate would then receive access to the card through the Expense Wizard app, allowing them to buy plane tickets and book a hotel. They can also access details about the flight and hotel in the app. The candidate can then use the app to make other travel-related purchases. All of these purchases are recorded and sent to the business for final approval. At the end of the candidate’s trip, they can submit the expense report to the business. Bradley Matthews, Senior Vice President, Head of Product Management and Marketing at US Bank, had this to say about the software: While talking with customers, we found consistent frustration around managing expenses for both non-employees and employees who travel without a corporate card. They needed to eliminate manual processes, make payments easy and control expenses. We worked closely with our innovation team and Chrome River to develop something completely revolutionary that brings mobile wallet technology and AI to the process, creating efficiency in a system that has been largely unchanged for years. PNC Data Infrastructure Overhaul PNC invested $1.2.billion over five years, according to its 2016 annual report, into modernizing its “core infrastructure and build[ing] out key technological and operational capabilities,” with the objective of faster, more secure and more stable operations and services. Still in the early stages of its tech strategy, the company’s initial focus has been on the consolidation of its data centers and a major shift to an “internal cloud environment.” We can presume that the company’s infrastructure upgrades will help them leverage data and implement artificial intelligence and machine learning. PNC seems to have worked with AI vendor Anaconda to start this, working with the vendor to overhaul its data science infrastructure for Python and R. As a result, Anaconda claims PNC is currently able to build machine learning models in-house, and as of summer 2018, the bank was purportedly looking to migrate their infrastructure into Anaconda Enterprise 5.2. It’s unclear if they’ve done so at this time. Bank of NY Mellon Corp Robotic Process Automation The 233-year-old financial institution is banking on “bots,” specifically robotic process automation (RPA), to improve the efficiency of its operations and to reduce costs. Although RPA is not AI, RPA software sometimes integrates artificial intelligence. In addition, contrary to its name, white-collar processes are carried out not by physical robots, but by software applications. These applications, known as web robots or Internet bots, are programmed to process automated tasks. In May 2017, the bank announced that over the past 15 months, the company has rolled out more than 220 bots developed by Blue Prism for handling tasks that are often repetitive in nature and normally handled by staff. Examples include “data requests from external auditors” and “funds transfer bots” which help “correct formatting and data mistakes in requests for dollar funds transfers.” The video below provides an explanation for how Blue Prism’s AI software works:  Former Senior Executive Vice President and Global Head of Client Service Delivery at BNY Mellon Corp, Doug Shulman, said this about the bank’s investment in RPA: If you think about smart automation, robotics is a piece, workflow is a piece, and we’re combining smart forms, optical character recognition, workflow and robotics to get momentum around automating tasks. BNY Mellon reports that the implementation of RPA has led to the following results: 100 percent accuracy in account-closure validations across five systems 88 percent improvement in processing time 66 percent improvement in trade entry turnaround time ¼-second robotic reconciliation of a failed trade vs. 5-10 minutes by a human From a financial perspective, the corporation estimates that the activity of its “funds transfer bots” alone is responsible for $300,000 in annual savings. These bots cut down on the time employees spend processing payments and resolving data errors. In addition to increased efficiency and reduced costs, in their 2016 annual report, industry competition is emphasized as another reason behind the bank’s increased integration of AI technology.

Artificial intelligence (AI) will change the way we learn and work in the near future. Nearly 400 million workers globally will change their occupations in the next 10 years, and business schools are uniquely situated to respond to the shifts coming to the future of work. However, a recent study, “Implications of Artificial Intelligence on Business Schools and Lifelong Learning,” shows that business schools remain cautious in adapting management education to address the changing needs of students, workers and organizations, writes Anne Trumbore in this opinion piece. Trumbore, one of the study’s coauthors, is senior director of Wharton Online, a strategic digital learning initiative at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
In the past few weeks, COVID-19 has moved hundreds of millions of students around the globe from physical to online classes. Some schools in Asia are going a step further to use AI to deliver personalized learning to students. All schools in the UK have access to the technology so that when students do return to school, they will not only have kept up with their studies, but their teachers will also have a full report on their progress. And yet very few business schools are deploying these same technologies at scale, even though their future MBA students are getting a crash course in AI-enabled learning right now. How will business schools remain relevant in the age of AI?
We anticipate AI will change the way we learn and work in the near future. Nearly 400 million workers globally will change their occupations within the next 10 years. Because business schools not only prepare students for the workforce but also create scholarship about business practices, they are uniquely situated to respond to the shifts coming to the future of work. But our recent study, “Implications of Artificial Intelligence on Business Schools and Lifelong Learning,” shows that business schools are mostly cautious in adapting management education to satisfy the coming needs of students, workers and organizations. This circumspect approach begs the question: Will MBAs educated today using methods from the past be employable for the jobs of the future?
Global Study
To gain a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities AI presents for business schools, and to clarify the current state of AI adoption in global business education, we conducted 43 interviews with academic, corporate, and technological leaders around the world. We spoke with 29 deans and other senior academic leaders from business schools in Africa, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, Europe, North America, Asia, Australia and Latin America to get a comprehensive picture of AI adoption today. We also spoke with six global companies deploying AI as part of their talent development and management efforts as well as eight platform providers of AI-facilitated (primarily through curation or “intelligent recommendation”) business education.
Will MBAs educated today using methods from the past be employable for the jobs of the future?
We found that a handful of schools are building AI-enabled platforms to provide personalized educational pathways for lifelong learning, to encourage course success for on-campus students and to increase peer-to-peer interaction, but most schools are experimenting on a lesser scale. Politecnico Milan, for instance, has launched Flexa, an AI-powered, business education recommendation engine to provide continuous, personalized learning to students, alumni and companies.
Schools across the globe are running multiple pilots with different technologies, such as RPA (Robotic Process Automation), chatbots, IBM Watson, and others. A number of schools have created robust cross-collaborations with both corporations — such as Microsoft and IBM — as well as with other schools on campus, particularly engineering and computer science. Yet, U.S. universities face multiple barriers in creating truly personalized learning pathways, including data privacy issues, lack of staff talent, faculty resistance and lack of institutional funding and/or commitment.
Meanwhile, corporations and platform providers are working much faster to invent and adopt new AI technologies to improve and validate skills acquisition and learning. Degreed, Skillsoft, Coursera and others are using data science and machine learning to help customize education, while some corporations are partnering with Microsoft and Google, as well as smaller companies like Filtered to create AI-powered customized learning.
Updating Traditional Curricula
As AI and related technologies displace jobs and workers, traditional business-school curricula will need to be updated to provide students with the skills they need to manage and lead in a rapidly changing world. AI-augmented roles will require workers with stronger skills in areas like ethics, leadership, emotional intelligence, and change management. Our research showed a clear opportunity for business schools to teach these human skills that in-person MBA and executive education programs excel at providing.
While corporations and platform providers work quickly to develop courses in new technologies and business practices, business schools can capitalize on the more sustained attention of their students and their decades of experience in creating programs that offer students the opportunity to thoughtfully consider the ethical, moral and environmental consequences of AI-augmented business practices. Business schools have the privileged position of being able to double down on collaborative, hands-on learning experiences that tackle complex, real world challenges, where the best solution is not necessarily the most profitable one. Courses in ethics, data protection and security, distributed leadership, managing innovation and AI governance will be highly desirable to MBA candidates and executive education clients.
AI-augmented roles will require workers with stronger skills in areas like ethics, leadership, emotional intelligence, and change management.
Ultimately, the greatest threat to business schools from AI is to the relevance of the MBA. The traditional pace of knowledge creation cannot keep up with rate of change AI is bringing to business. As corporations improve at providing their employees targeted, relevant business topics at scale, the value proposition of the MBA comes into question. To maintain the value of the MBA, business schools should focus on the topics and skills that corporations either can’t teach or teach well. In addition, business schools should develop new ways of teaching that incorporate AI to give students more immersive learning experiences with immediate, personalized feedback. Professors should not be afraid of being replaced by robots. As noted education and AI researcher Ryan Baker writes, “…we need stupid tutoring systems and intelligent humans. Business schools should not lose sight of the opportunities afforded by these disruptive technological advances. AI provides the ability to improve the student experience, streamline operations and develop efficiencies of scale. AI technologies can make administration more efficient and improve student experience. Beginning with better identification of potential students, to the ability to create diverse and well-rounded classes, to better academic and career advising, AI has the potential to improve the student experience while cutting operational costs.
Personalizing Learning
To survive and thrive in an AI-enabled world, business schools must be open to the following:

New methods of knowledge creation that speed up the research cycle. Working with industry data and collaborating with industry experts for teaching and research, collaborating with other schools such as engineering, computer science, education or medical schools, and finding alternative, reputable outlets for publication beyond peer reviewed academic journals all promise to make relevant content more quickly.
More data-driven, personalized and effective learning experiences for students. Future MBA candidates will be exposed to AI-enabled education K-12, at university or in the workplace. It is reasonable to assume that they will have similar expectations of business education — and that it will be customizable, adaptive and immersive — and delivered both inside and outside the classroom.
Taking AI technologies seriously and making related investments. Since most business schools will be unable to devote the necessary resources to develop their own AI capabilities, it will be critical to partner with technology vendors to provide personalized learning experiences that support existing students and offer alumni and others relevant lifelong learning.
Immediately addressing AI’s challenges: ethics, privacy, quality of training data, transparency of algorithms and data security. Rather than letting AI’s risks become a barrier to adoption, business schools can take the lead on developing a coalition for shared governance, empowering faculty, talented staff, students, and experts to work together to develop school and university policies and solutions to address these concerns. Creating a coalition of business schools is another option to explore, as is working with government policymakers to develop sustainable and thoughtful solutions.

Taking the steps outlined above can help move business schools into the future and ensure their survival. Avoiding these challenges could very well result in students avoiding their MBA programs. For schools like Politecnico Milan, disruption from the coronavirus allows them to improve their recommendation algorithms and reach new populations of distance learners. Schools without these capabilities, however, will have to provide value to future MBA students in a world where AI-enabled education is more widely used by students than by business schools.

Schools across the globe are running multiple pilots with different technologies, such as RPA (Robotic Process Automation), chatbots, IBM Watson, and others. A number of schools have created robust cross-collaborations with both corporations -- such as Microsoft and IBM -- as well as with other schools on campus, particularly engineering and computer science. Yet, U.S. universities face multiple barriers in creating truly personalized learning pathways, including data privacy issues, lack of staff talent, faculty resistance and lack of institutional funding and/or commitment.

Meanwhile, corporations and platform providers are working much faster to invent and adopt new AI technologies to improve and validate skills acquisition and learning. Degreed, Skillsoft, Coursera and others are using data science and machine learning to help customize education, while some corporations are partnering with Microsoft and Google, as well as smaller companies like Filtered to create AI-powered customized learning.

<strong>Updating Traditional Curricula</strong>

As AI and related technologies displace jobs and workers, traditional business-school curricula will need to be updated to provide students with the skills they need to manage and lead in a rapidly changing world. AI-augmented roles will require workers with stronger skills in areas like ethics, leadership, emotional intelligence, and change management. Our research showed a clear opportunity for business schools to teach these human skills that in-person MBA and executive education programs excel at providing.

While corporations and platform providers work quickly to develop courses in new technologies and business practices, business schools can capitalize on the more sustained attention of their students and their decades of experience in creating programs that offer students the opportunity to thoughtfully consider the ethical, moral and environmental consequences of AI-augmented business practices. Business schools have the privileged position of being able to double down on collaborative, hands-on learning experiences that tackle complex, real world challenges, where the best solution is not necessarily the most profitable one. Courses in ethics, data protection and security, distributed leadership, managing innovation and AI governance will be highly desirable to MBA candidates and executive education clients.
<blockquote>AI-augmented roles will require workers with stronger skills in areas like ethics, leadership, emotional intelligence, and change management.</blockquote>
<em>Ultimately, the greatest threat to business schools from AI is to the relevance of the MBA.</em> The traditional pace of knowledge creation cannot keep up with rate of change AI is bringing to business. As corporations improve at providing their employees targeted, relevant business topics at scale, the value proposition of the MBA comes into question. To maintain the value of the MBA, business schools should focus on the topics and skills that corporations either can’t teach or teach well. In addition, business schools should develop new ways of teaching that incorporate AI to give students more immersive learning experiences with immediate, personalized feedback. Professors should not be afraid of being replaced by robots. As noted education and AI researcher Ryan Baker writes, “…<a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-016-0105-0"">we need stupid tutoring systems and intelligent humans</a>. Business schools should not lose sight of the opportunities afforded by these disruptive technological advances. <em>AI provides the ability to improve the student experience, streamline operations and develop efficiencies of scale</em><em>.</em> AI technologies can make administration more efficient and improve student experience. Beginning with better identification of potential students, to the ability to create diverse and well-rounded classes, to better academic and career advising, AI has the potential to improve the student experience while cutting operational costs.

<strong>Personalizing Learning</strong>

To survive and thrive in an AI-enabled world, business schools must be open to the following:
<ul class=""bullet-list"">
 	<li>New methods of knowledge creation that speed up the research cycle. Working with industry data and collaborating with industry experts for teaching and research, collaborating with other schools such as engineering, computer science, education or medical schools, and finding alternative, reputable outlets for publication beyond peer reviewed academic journals all promise to make relevant content more quickly.</li>
 	<li>More data-driven, personalized and effective learning experiences for students. Future MBA candidates will be exposed to AI-enabled education K-12, at university or in the workplace. It is reasonable to assume that they will have similar expectations of business education -- and that it will be customizable, adaptive and immersive -- and delivered both inside and outside the classroom.</li>
 	<li>Taking AI technologies seriously and making related investments. Since most business schools will be unable to devote the necessary resources to develop their own AI capabilities, it will be critical to partner with technology vendors to provide personalized learning experiences that support existing students and offer alumni and others relevant lifelong learning.</li>
 	<li>Immediately addressing AI’s challenges: ethics, privacy, quality of training data, transparency of algorithms and data security. Rather than letting AI’s risks become a barrier to adoption, business schools can take the lead on developing a coalition for shared governance, empowering faculty, talented staff, students, and experts to work together to develop school and university policies and solutions to address these concerns. Creating a coalition of business schools is another option to explore, as is working with government policymakers to develop sustainable and thoughtful solutions.</li>
</ul>
Taking the steps outlined above can help move business schools into the future and ensure their survival. Avoiding these challenges could very well result in students avoiding their MBA programs. For schools like Politecnico Milan, disruption from the coronavirus allows them to improve their recommendation algorithms and reach new populations of distance learners. Schools without these capabilities, however, will have to provide value to future MBA students in a world where AI-enabled education is more widely used by students than by business schools.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As China initiated its response to the virus, it leaned on its strong technology sector and specifically artificial intelligence (AI), data science, and technology to track and fight the pandemic while tech leaders, including Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei and more accelerated their company's healthcare initiatives. As a result, tech startups are integrally involved with clinicians, academics, and government entities around the world to activate technology as the virus continues to spread to many other countries. Here are 10 ways artificial intelligence, data science, and technology are being used to manage and fight COVID-19.
Coronavirus: How Artificial Intelligence, Data Science And Technology Is Used To Fight The PandemicAdobe Stock

1. AI to identify, track and forecast outbreaks

The better we can track the virus, the better we can fight it. By analyzing news reports, social media platforms, and government documents, AI can learn to detect an outbreak. Tracking infectious disease risks by using AI is exactly the service Canadian startup BlueDot provides. In fact, the BlueDot’s AI warned of the threat several days before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organization issued their public warnings. 

2. AI to help diagnose the virus

Artificial intelligence company Infervision launched a coronavirus AI solution that helps front-line healthcare workers detect and monitor the disease efficiently. Imaging departments in healthcare facilities are being taxed with the increased workload created by the virus. This solution improves CT diagnosis speed. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba also built an AI-powered diagnosis system they claim is 96% accurate at diagnosing the virus in seconds.

3. Process healthcare claims
It’s not only the clinical operations of healthcare systems that are being taxed but also the business and administrative divisions as they deal with the surge of patients. A blockchain platform offered by Ant Financial helps speed up claims processing and reduces the amount of face-to-face interaction between patients and hospital staff.
4. Drones deliver medical supplies
One of the safest and fastest ways to get medical supplies where they need to go during a disease outbreak is with drone delivery. Terra Drone is using its unmanned aerial vehicles to transport medical samples and quarantine material with minimal risk between Xinchang County’s disease control centre and the People’s Hospital. Drones also are used to patrol public spaces, track non-compliance to quarantine mandates, and for thermal imaging.

5. Robots sterilize, deliver food and supplies and perform other tasks
Robots aren’t susceptible to the virus, so they are being deployed to complete many tasks such as cleaning and sterilizing and delivering food and medicine to reduce the amount of human-to-human contact. UVD robots from Blue Ocean Robotics use ultraviolet light to autonomously kill bacteria and viruses. In China, Pudu Technology deployed its robots that are typically used in the catering industry to more than 40 hospitals around the country.

6. Develop drugs
Google’s DeepMind division used its latest AI algorithms and its computing power to understand the proteins that might make up the virus, and published the findings to help others develop treatments.  BenevolentAI uses AI systems to build drugs that can fight the world’s toughest diseases and is now helping support the efforts to treat coronavirus, the first time the company focused its product on infectious diseases. Within weeks of the outbreak, it used its predictive capabilities to propose existing drugs that might be useful.

7. Advanced fabrics offer protection
Companies such as Israeli startup Sonovia hope to arm healthcare systems and others with face masks made from their anti-pathogen, anti-bacterial fabric that relies on metal-oxide nanoparticles.
8. AI to identify non-compliance or infected individuals
While certainly a controversial use of technology and AI, China’s sophisticated surveillance system used facial recognition technology and temperature detection software from SenseTime to identify people who might have a fever and be more likely to have the virus. Similar technology powers ""smart helmets"" used by officials in Sichuan province to identify people with fevers. The Chinese government has also developed a monitoring system called Health Code that uses big data to identify and assesses the risk of each individual based on their travel history, how much time they have spent in virus hotspots, and potential exposure to people carrying the virus. Citizens are assigned a color code (red, yellow, or green), which they can access via the popular apps WeChat or Alipay to indicate if they should be quarantined or allowed in public. 
9. Chatbots to share information
Tencent operates WeChat, and people can access free online health consultation services through it. Chatbots have also been essential communication tools for service providers in the travel and tourism industry to keep travelers updated on the latest travel procedures and disruptions.
10. Supercomputers working on a coronavirus vaccine
The cloud computing resources and supercomputers of several major tech companies such as Tencent, DiDi, and Huawei are being used by researchers to fast-track the development of a cure or vaccine for the virus. The speed these systems can run calculations and model solutions is much faster than standard computer processing.
In a global pandemic such as COVID-19, technology, artificial intelligence, and data science have become critical to helping societies effectively deal with the outbreak.

The technology is proving itself evidently beneficial in revolutionizing the workplace culture as well. AI tends to guide, organize and automate work while improving staff efficiency and productivity. Specifically, when AI is blended with automation, it maximizes the company profits by utilizing the minimum manpower yet in a right and creative manner. The technical improvements brought in by them contribute to the management of several tasks in the office that are achieved effortlessly and employees' work becomes less tiring..Market Analysis by Gartner:.Artificial intelligence (AI) will be widely adopted in office environments in a variety of ways over the next few years as businesses invest in digital workplace initiatives, said Gartner analysts in their 2019 analysis. The trend is expected to gather steam as voice-activated personal assistants that have proved a hit at home begin to make inroads in the office..By 2025, the technology will &quot;certainly be mainstream,&quot; said Matthew Cain, vice president, and distinguished analyst at Gartner – even though privacy and security concerns have limited deployments so far. Cain was among the analysts who spoke at Gartner's Digital Workplace Summit..Gartner has separately predicted that consumer and business spending on smart speakers will pass $3.5 billion in 2021, with 25 percent of digital workers using an AI assistant on a daily basis within the next two years. A number of companies have already deployed the technology, though WeWork reportedly put its Alexa for Business deployment on hold last year..Case Study 1:.The New York Foundling which is a charity that offers child welfare, adoption, and mental health services, was stuck in cut-and-paste hell in 2018. The clinicians and admin staff were spending hours transferring text between different documents and databases to meet varied legal requirements. Arik Hill, the charity's chief information officer, blames the data entry drudgery for an annual staff turnover of 42 percent at the time. &quot;We are not a very glamorous industry,&quot; says Hill. &quot;We are really only just moving on from paper clinical records.&quot;.Since then, the New York Foundling has automated much of this grunt work using what are known as software robots—simple programs hand-crafted to perform dull tasks. Often, the programs are built by recording and mimicking a user's keystrokes, such as copying a field of text from one database and pasting it into another, eliminating hours of repetitive-stress-inducing work. &quot;It was mind-blowing,&quot; says Hill, who says turnover has fallen to 17 percent..To automate the work, the New York Foundling got help from UiPath, a so-called robotic process automation company. That project didn't require any real machine intelligence..But in January, UiPath began upgrading its army of software bots to use powerful new artificial intelligence algorithms. It thinks this will let them take on more complex and challenging tasks, such as transcription or sorting images, across more offices. Ultimately, the company hopes software robots will gradually learn how to automate repetitive work for themselves..In other words, if artificial intelligence is going to disrupt white-collar work, then this may be how it begins..Case Study 2:.When Matt Radwell, a customer support officer for a small local authority in the UK, first started answering queries from the area's residents, it was a frustrating and time-consuming business. If a resident contacted Aylesbury Vale District Council, 40 miles north of London, about an issue like housing benefit in which he lacked expertise, Mr. Radwell might keep the caller waiting as long as 20 minutes. He had to find someone who could give him the relevant information..Over the past two years, however, his job has been transformed. When a resident types a question into the council's online chat facility, an advanced computer system starts reading it..For around 40 percent of inquiries, the system — which has been trained to recognize residents' questions by using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence — presents Mr. Radwell and other customer support officers with a series of potential, pre-written responses. Each is labeled with an estimated probability of its being the correct choice. If one is appropriate, Mr. Radwell clicks on it, satisfying the resident far more quickly and easily than before..The council's machine learning system — provided by Digital Genius, a San Francisco-based specialist in customer service systems — has put it at the forefront of a transformation underway in millions of white-collar jobs worldwide..Experts' Opinions:.Tom Davenport, a professor who studies information technology and management at Babson College says, &quot;When paired with robotic process automation, AI significantly expands the number and types of tasks that software robots can perform.&quot;.He also added, &quot;software robots that use AI could displace more jobs, especially if we head into a recession. Companies will use it for substantial headcount and cost reductions.&quot;.Even if AI does transform robotic process automation, there will be risks involved, says Davenport of Babson College. The trend may feed a natural human tendency to use automation beyond its capabilities, and this could prove especially problematic when using machine learning methods that are difficult to interpret. &quot;You could be using it to make important decisions like issuing a credit or preventing fraud,&quot; he says. &quot;And the algorithms making the decisions in the process may not be transparent to the managers having to make the decision to keep the automated system going.&quot;.Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and the author of several books exploring the impact of technology on the workforce, says &quot;robotic process automation will mostly affect middle-skilled office workers, meaning admin work that requires some training.&quot; But it won't happen overnight. He says it took many years for simple software robots, which are essentially descended from screen-scrapers and simple coding tools, to affect office work. &quot;The lesson is just how long it takes for even a relatively simple technology to have an impact on business, because of the hard work it takes to implement it reliably in complex environments,&quot; Brynjolfsson notes..Wil van der Aalst, a professor at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, who coined the term process mining and has pioneered research on the subject, notes that &quot;the techniques involved are not what people think of today as AI, but older statistical techniques.&quot; He says the machine learning algorithms that make headlines today tend to be best suited for specific tasks such as image or voice recognition..Leslie Willcocks, a professor at the London School of Economics who specializes in business process automation, says the process automation industry has yet to fully take off. Obstacles include siloed data that software robots can't easily access, incompatible infrastructure, and the fact that many offices have never used automation before. But he believes this is how AI will ultimately arrive inside most businesses..Willcocks further added, &quot;I am not seeing strong AI being deployed in the vast majority of businesses globally if you exclude the top technology companies. But there will be a turning point when businesses will deploy these technologies better. It may take five years, [but] it's a slow train coming.&quot;.Guy Kirkwood, the chief evangelist at UiPath, says the vision is for software robots to be a lot more like the AI of science fiction, eventually taking over how they are programmed from start to finish..&quot;The direction of travel—and we're not there yet—is that we'll be able to create self-building robots, where the system just watches what the human does, works out where there's a repeatable activity, and works out what the optimum route is with all the variances and the exceptions,&quot; he says. &quot;That would be pretty cool.&quot;.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The 10 Best Free Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning Courses for 2020Adobe Stock

Today, with the wealth of freely available educational content online, it may not be necessary. There are so many courses, tutorials, and guides available online that it is perfectly possible to gain a thorough grounding in these subjects without paying a penny. What’s more, you can study at your own speed in your own time. Some of these materials are produced by the world’s leading universities, while others are put together by experienced professionals keen to share their knowledge.

These courses are aimed at a range of different audiences – maybe you want to actually learn how to design and code AI algorithms, maybe you want to bolt together the increasing range of “DIY” AI tools and services that are available, or maybe you need to manage AI projects in your organization. Whatever your needs, you are likely to find something here that will expand your horizons.

Elements of AI - Helsinki University

This is an elementary-level class aimed at anyone who wants to understand what AI does, how it might affect them, and what it can be used for, without getting involved in the underlying mathematics and statistics. It demonstrates that in-depth knowledge of those fields isn't necessary to start taking advantage of the opportunities offered by AI and machine learning, and includes practical exercises. Originally available only in Finland (and in Finnish) as part of the government's drive to educate its population on AI, last year, the decision was made to make it available to the world.
Learn with Google AI
This collection of tutorials, guides, and resources has grown considerably since I last highlighted it. As well as basic tutorials covering the fundamentals, it also offers instructions on applying AI and ML to social, environmental and humanitarian challenges, as well information on how to ensure that your AI implementations are both ethical and “people-centric"". This all helps to build a broad understanding of the many factors – technological or otherwise – that are important to consider when considering how AI could work for you.

Machine Learning – Stanford University (Coursera)
Often cited by AI experts as the single most important online resource for anyone wanting to learn AI, this course is led by Andrew Ng, who founded Google’s pioneering Google Brain deep learning program. This course gives a thorough grounding in the mathematical, statistical, and computer science fundamentals that go into developing and deploying automated learning machines.
AI for Everyone – Andrew Ng (Coursera)
Another course from Andrew Ng – this one explicitly aimed at those who don’t need an in-depth technical understanding of the subject but who may want to begin leveraging AI in their organizations or working to roll out AI initiatives while working with non-technical teams. It covers the workflow of running AI projects as well as how to develop a strategy around AI deployments in business.
Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials – Microsoft (EdX)
This course is also listed in my guide to the best free data science courses. Of course, there's a great deal of crossover between the two subjects, as data science is the foundation of all of today's AI. If you're confused about the terminology, then think of machine learning as a technique that leverages data science to work towards achieving what we currently understand as AI. This course gives a great overview as it starts by explaining the core data science concepts before moving on to demonstrate how they are applied in machine learning.
Machine Learning Crash Course - Google
Another Google course, and this one is said to be required reading for everyone whose work is involved with AI at the tech giant. This course covers the basics but also moves onto the theory and practical applications of TensorFlow, Google’s open-source deep-learning library that it uses in many of its own AI-enhanced services and projects.
Learning From Data (Introductory Machine Learning) - Caltech (EdX)
Starting with theoretical principles such as ""what is learning?"" and ""can machines learn?"" this course covers advanced practical applications including creating ML algorithms used to power neural networks. It aims to help those who are set on a career as a data scientist or analyst. Like many of the courses covered here, all of the materials are freely available, but you can pay $50 for official certification at the end.
Artificial Intelligence A-Z: Learn How To Build An AI - Udemy
Another course that takes a slightly different approach, here you are taken through the practical steps necessary to build machines that solve a number of real-world AI problems, such as driving a car or playing a game. It also covers Q-learning, a form of machine learning based on reinforcement learning, that is gaining in popularity in cutting-edge applications.
Creative Applications of Deep Learning With Tensorflow – Kadenze (Class Central)
Deep learning is one of the most advanced fields of AI, and one that is pushing the boundaries of creating machines that can think and learn like humans. This is another course focused on the open-source TensorFlow framework originally created by Google for use in Deep Learning, and is one that has received good reviews for giving an easy-to-follow guide to a complex technical subject.

Technology is one sector that is constantly evolving and finds purpose in every thinkable domain. There is an upward graph for number of innovative technologies and the number of industries adopting the technology. This decade’s most happening topic in the tech industry is the emergence of Artificial Intelligence and it has had a successful entry into HR tech startups. 
Following the other sectors’ lead of replacing predictable and repetitive tasks with AI, HR tech startups are also choosing AI for intelligent and disrupting hiring technologies. 
One major area of HR that faces the maximum pain points is Recruitment. It is a very challenging task as it could make or break your organisation. Identifying the right candidate, engaging with the candidate and then, onboarding them is a long process that could be partly handled by AI. 
Here are 5 HR Tech Startups that are using AI for recruitment and more: 
Trabaajo
Backed by their parent company Xenture, this AI-based application helps in finding the right job or candidate for the suggested profile. By automating the process of matching skill requirements with qualified individuals, the hiring process is faster and easier.
Founded by Sunaina Agarwal and Arun Kumar, the company offers real-time video interviews and is aiming to create a job market across all domains and countries. 
iXceed Solutions
A Talent and Workforce Solutions services company, iXceed is a service provider to Fortune 500 companies and primarily focuses on these domains globally: Technology, IT consulting and Engineering Consulting. 
The company uses Artificial Intelligence-based recruitment solutions to create an in-class experience for both clients and candidates. Some of their clients are- Infosys, HCL, Oracle, Mindtree, NIIT, etc. It is co-founded by Yogita Tulsian, who is also its Director. 
EdGE Networks
The edge in EdGE Networks is its AI-powered products that auto-source, auto-screen and auto-engage the best candidates for the role and along with this, the AI also recommends options for career paths and draws up a personalised learning curve for employees.
The company began operations in 2012 and has developed productivity tools by leveraging AI. These tools help businesses identify pain points in their processes such as talent acquisition, workforce optimization, talent transformation, and workforce planning. 
Arjun Pratap is the CEO and Founder of EdGE Networks. 
Darwinbox
Slightly unconventional to the pain points listed above, Darwinbox is a cloud-based HR solutions firm. The company provides solution for more than recruitment process such as core processes, employee engagement, performance management, employee movement,etc.
Established in 2015, the company’s platform uses AI to pick keywords in job profiles that match the description so the recruiters can draw up a ranking metric. Its clientele includes Paytm, Ekart, Spencer’s, Delhivery, etc. Darwinbox is founded by Rohit Chennamaneni, Chaitanya Peddi, and Jayant Paleti. 
Dockabl
This company focuses more on the ‘after’ recruitment part. It is an employee experience platform that provides organizations with the ability to constantly manage performance. 
The tools provided by the company are tech-enabled and help in structuring goals, tracking progress, real-time feedback and peer recognition. This app aims at benefiting and serving all members of an organization fairly. Samarth Massan and Sanjeev Grover are the co-founders of Dockabl. 
Concluding…
Being a division that deals with human beings, there is bound to be unpredictability. By automating regular and redundant tasks, HR professionals can concentrate more other important processes of planning, execution, and implementation of policies. There will be more time to structure the organization and understand what culture is best suited for it.

Franca Salis-Madinier from the European Economic and Social Committee and French Democratic Confederation of Labour – Professionals and Managers, highlights for us the importance of ensuring that artificial intelligence in the workplace benefits people
Surely nobody would deny that digital and artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now playing a massive part in our daily reality and bringing benefits to everyone’s life. New opportunities for business, for progress in healthcare, for safety in transport and energy, and for combating climate change are presented. At the same time, could anyone fail to see the abuses and the dangerous and perverse uses of these same systems that undermine fundamental values such as dignity, the right not to be discriminated against and the right to privacy?
For Europe’s civil society, which has issued numerous opinions on AI through the European Economic and Social Committee(1), AI is not an end in itself, but a tool that – albeit also entailing risks – can bring about radical change for the better. If it is to benefit as many people as possible, politicians need to steer, govern and regulate it.
Aware of these challenges, in April 2019 the European Commission (EC) published its “Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI”(2), setting out seven core principles. More recently, the EC published a White Paper on Artificial Intelligence, in which(3) it propounded the need to regulate “high-risk” AI – the kind that could encroach on people’s rights. These kinds of AI must be tested and authorised before reaching the Single Market, as is the case with medicines and cosmetics.
Introducing AI in the workplace
We are concentrating here on the questions posed by AI systems when introduced into the workplace. For our purposes, we will consider AI as digital technology used to create systems capable of autonomously reproducing human cognitive functions: voice and facial recognition, grasping data, a form of understanding and adaptation (problem-solving, automatic reasoning and learning).
The use of AI in workplaces poses a number of challenges. In the relationship between the intelligent machine and the worker, the guiding principle behind decisions must be that the technology does not subjugate the human being, but is – on the contrary – the source of work for the human that is emancipating, creative and fulfilling.
For this, a number of conditions need to be met:

Humans in the driving seat: human beings must have the last word and the final decision over the technology.
The principle of transparency and the right to an explanation of any decision taken by the technology, in particular, in the human resources (HR) area of recruitment and assessment.
The right to have privacy respected – through the protection of personal data and workers’ informed consent regarding the quality of the data collected, itsownership and use.
The right to safeguard health and safety at work, which is threatened by the unrestricted monitoring made possible by the technologies used.
The right not to be discriminated against.
The right to benefit, whatever the kind of work, from social protection worthy of the name.

Examples of the use of harmful AI
In health and safety at work, the introduction of AI-based work management systems raises questions about workers’ rights and safety. From Amazon warehouses to Uber cars and Deliveroo riders, power and surveillance are in the hands of employers and this is particularly detrimental to low wage earners (many of whom have a migrant background). This is because productivity targets are set that undermine health and safety and bring about psychological stress and because algorithm-driven, unpredictable wage cuts are made that undermine the economic stability of these workers.
The issue of platform regulation and the recognition of rights for these bogus self-employed workers is at the top of Europe’s agenda.
The European Agency for Health and Safety at Work, OSHA, warns of the use of AI in HR practices and refers to some 600 companies, some of them operating in Europe (such as Unilever and Nokia), that use the HireVue app to recruit on the basis of video interviews which analyse candidates’ facial expressions.
Some recommendations:
Regarding data: the principle of protection of rights and freedoms in relation to data processing must be guaranteed and the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) must be regularly reviewed and adapted.
The use of facial recognition for decisions that have an impact on people’s lives and access to opportunities must be prohibited and should stop using these applications.
Workers must have the right, through their trade unions, to challenge the use of AI systems that jeopardise their right to physical and mental health and safety and to collectively negotiate safe, fair and reliable labour standards.
Regarding non-discrimination and diversity: the AI industry is surprisingly homogeneous, largely due to its treatment of women, people of colour and gender minorities. To start to tackle this problem, more information would need to be shared publicly on wage levels, levels of discrimination and recruitment practices. Inequalities in pay and opportunities must be ended and managers given real incentives to create, promote and safeguard inclusive workplaces.
Regarding social protection: the EU must guarantee access to social protection for all workers, employees and the – real or bogus – self-employed. Health and safety, social protection, diversity, non-discrimination, respect of privacy and dignity at work, are priorities to be pursued in line with the European Pillar of Social Rights.

Seems like everybody’s an artificial intelligence (AI) provider these days. The global enterprise AI market, which garnered $4.68 billion in revenues in 2018, is expected to generate $53.06 billion by 2026, according to a report by Allied Market Research. So it’s little wonder that seemingly every enterprise technology vendor wants to grab a piece of the AI pie.
But not all AI solutions are what they seem. “AI washing” – the practice of touting a technology solution as AI when it may be no more than simple automation or a new marketing spin for an existing application – is a real phenomenon, industry analysts say. “Very few, in my opinion, are using strong AI,” says Wayne Butterfield, director of cognitive automation and innovation at ISG. “What we need to be mindful of is that AI covers over 200 different disciplines, so it’s not uncommon to be using a branch of AI in a tool. Some advanced analytics may now be classed as AI, even a small amount of machine learning. This means that you can be creative as a vendor.”
The explosive growth in the velocity, volume, and variety of data being produced by today’s enterprise, along with increasing computing power and the accessibility of new tools, means more IT organizations are considering or deploying AI solutions to solve business problems. However, as always, it’s important to push back on hype and dig into what a new technology actually has to offer before signing on the dotted line.

What’s the difference between AI and automation?
There is a clear difference between AI (in its various forms, like machine learning, deep learning, or natural language processing) and non-AI automation - both in how they work and what types of outcomes they can produce.
AI uses models and algorithms to autonomously find patterns in the data to provide insights and prescriptions.
“In general, AI relies on models and algorithms to autonomously find patterns in the data (‘inputs’) to provide insights, predictions, and prescriptions (‘outputs’) that could have significant business impact,” says JP Baritugo, director at business transformation and outsourcing consultancy Pace Harmon.
Automation use cases are predominantly task-oriented.
“In contrast, automation is traditionally used for processes where the input data is structured, the rules are defined with manageable exceptions, and interactions with multiple systems are required. Automation use cases are predominantly task-oriented versus a true end-to-end process view.”
An automation solution, for example, might be used to transfer data from emails into an ERP system, execute bulk data uploads and changes, or provision IT assets and resources for a new employee.
AI, by contrast, has broader applications in the business. It can cluster like data to drive business insights, classify data to determine if a customer is a churn risk, or provide predictions or recommendations such as the “next best action” based on a customer’s profile or behavior.

“Generally speaking, automation is applied to rote processes, and AI is ‘smart’ because the applications are trained to improve,” Baritugo says.
Telling the difference can still be hard. “The reality is that it is somewhat difficult to identify even for the relatively well-trained eye, since many of the systems present as black boxes that take in a certain input and present an output, regardless of whether AI is involved or not,” says Anil Vijayan, vice president at Everest Group. Making the environment even more confusing, some of today’s robotic process automation (RPA) providers now integrate cognitive capabilities into their offerings.

6 signs something might not really be AI:
“A good rule of thumb to pressure-test if a solution is truly using AI is to ask how it’s typically deployed and used,” advises Baritugo. Here are some red flags that may indicate you’re dealing with an AI wanna-be:
1. The product requires minimal data for training
If you’re told that you don’t need much normalized data for model training or the data requirement is downplayed, take note. “AI-based solutions generally require a fair bit of data to perform at a desired level of accuracy,” says Vijayan. “It would be useful to consider the sources of data available for the system to learn as well.”
Basic machine learning models require thousands of examples to train on; deep learning demands hundreds of thousands or millions. So a lack of data requirements is a warning sign to beware.
2. The ""AI"" needs business rules in order to work
""If this, then that"" is a telltale sign of a non-AI automation solution.
“If this, then that” is a telltale sign of a non-AI automation solution: “This is the opposite of how AI should work,” Baritugo says.
While AI might be used for automation, rules-based tasks are usually executed by “dumber” systems like RPA, says Vijayan
3. There is a notable lack of case studies
Many companies are touting their AI chops but may be early on in integrating cognitive capabilities into their tools. Use cases are one of the best ways to find out if a product actually leverages AI today. Look for details about data, training models, and outcomes that go beyond increased efficiency or cost savings.
4. The solution does not get better over time
The more data an AI model is exposed to, the better it should perform.
“When vetting a solution for AI-capabilities, it would be useful to ask how the system learns,” Vijayan says. The more data an AI model is exposed to, the better it should perform. If the provider can’t acceptably demonstrate examples of how the solution is deployed in other customers and how the tool has learned and improved over time, Baritugo explains, it’s probably not an AI solution.
5. The vendor's staff is light on AI talent
“If a provider or vendor claims to be delivering AI-based solutions without relying on third-party vendors, it would be instructive to look at their talent model,” says Vijayan. “Developing complex AI-based solutions [requires] ML engineers, data scientists with specialized ML skill sets, and so on.”
6. There's no clarity about how the AI works

The provider should be able to articulate, at least at a high level, the models or algorithms used to power their solution, says Baritugo. “‘What form of AI are you using?’ and ‘What is it doing?’ are the questions I usually start with,” says Butterfield. “When the answer isn’t clear, or the usage isn’t actually useful, it’s often a sign of AI washing.”

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Despite the massive venture investments going into healthcare AI applications, there’s little evidence of hospitals using machine learning in real-world applications. We decided that this topic is worth covering in depth since any changes to the healthcare system directly impact business leaders in multiple facets such as employee insurance coverage or hospital administration policies. Industry analysts estimate that the AI health market is poised to reach $6.6 billion by 2021 and by 2026 can potentially save the U.S. healthcare economy $150 billion in annual savings. However, no sources have taken a comprehensive look at machine learning applications at America’s leading hospitals.  In this article we set out to answer questions that business leaders are asking today: What types of machine learning applications are currently in use and which are in the works at top hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital? Are there any common trends among their innovation efforts – and how could these trends affect the future of healthcare? How much has been invested in machine learning and emerging tech innovation across leading hospitals? This article aims to present a succinct picture of the implementation of machine learning by the five leading hospitals in the U.S. based on the 2016-2017 U.S. News and World Report Best Hospitals Honor Roll rankings. (While a respected industry source, we acknowledge that the Honor Roll ranking methodology may not fully represent the complexities of every hospital, we’re simply using the ranking as a means to finding a representative set of high-performing hospitals). Through facts and figures we aim to provide pertinent insights for business leaders and professionals interested in how these top five US hospitals are being impacted by AI.Before presenting the applications at each of the top five hospitals, we’ll take a look at some common themes that emerged from our research in this sector. Machine learning in Hospitals – Insights Up Front Judging by the current machine learning initiatives of the top five US hospitals, the most popular hospital AI applications appear to be: Predictive analytics – The ability to monitor patients and prevent patient emergencies before they occur, by analyzing data for key indicators (see Cleveland Clinic’s partnership with Microsoft and Johns Hopkins’ partnership with GE below) Chatbots – Automating physician inquiries and routing physicians to the proper specialist, (see UCLA’s “Virtual Interventional Radiologist (VIR)” case below) Predictive health trackers – The ability to monitor patients health status using real-time data collection (see Mayo Clinic’s investment in AliveCor) In the full article below, we’ll explore the AI applications of each hospital individually. It’s important to note that most of the applications of AI at major hospitals are relatively new, and few of them have distinct results on their the improvements or efficiencies that these technologies allowed for. We tried our best to exclude AI use-cases that seemed more like PR stunts than actual genuine applications and initiatives.  In either case, you’ll see in the article below that we’re very clear about which applications have traction, and which have no results to speak of thus far. We’ll begin with the #1 ranked report in the Best Hospitals Honor Roll, the Mayo Clinic. Mayo Clinic  In January 2017, Mayo Clinic’s Center for Individualized Medicine teamed up with Tempus, a health tech startup focused on developing personalized cancer care using a machine learning platform. The partnership involves Tempus conducting “molecular sequencing and analysis for 1,000 Mayo Clinic patients participating in studies relating to immunotherapy” for a number of cancer types including “lung cancer, melanoma, bladder cancer, breast cancer and lymphoma.”  While currently in the R&D phase, the initial goal is to use the results of these analyses to help inform more customized treatment options for Mayo’s cancer patients. Mayo joins a small consortium of healthcare organizations in partnerships with Tempus including University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania and Rush University Medical Center. “The holy grail that we’re looking for, and that Tempus is actively trying to build, is a library of data big enough that these patterns become a therapeutic, meaning you can start to say, ‘People that have this particular mutation shouldn’t take this drug, people that have this particular mutation should take this drug’” -Eric Lefkofsky, Tempus Co-Founder and CEO Tapping into the estimated $13.8 billion DNA sequencing product market, the startup apparently follows two compensation models depending on client type: Tempus charges hospital systems directly for their services and in the case of individuals or patients, the costs are billed to the insurance provider. Tempus CEO, Eric Lefkofsky is also co-founder of eCommerce giant Groupon and a handful of tech companies with analytics software leanings including Uptake Technologies and Mediaocean. According to the CDC, cancer is rivaled only by heart disease which is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and in March 2017, Mayo Clinic in conjunction with medical device maker Omron Healthcare made a $30 million Series D investment in heart health startup AliveCor.   Kardio Pro, designed by AliveCor, is an AI-powered platform designed for clinicians “to monitor patients for the early detection of atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia that leads to a five times greater risk of stroke.” Kardia Mobile, AliveCor’s flagship product, is a mobile-enabled EKG. Results of the Kardio Pro investment have yet to be reported. Cleveland Clinic In September 2016, Microsoft announced a collaboration with Cleveland Clinic to help the medical center “identify potential at-risk patients under ICU care.” Researchers used Cortana, Microsoft’s AI digital assistant, to tap into predictive and advanced analytics.  Used by 126 million Windows 10 users each month, Cortana is part of Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment which increased by 6 percent or $1.3 billion in revenue according to the company’s 2016 annual report.   Cortana is integrated into Cleveland Clinic’s eHospital system, a type of command center first launched in 2014 that currently monitors “100 beds in six ICUs” from 7pm to 7am. While improved patient outcomes have been reported by William Morris, MD, Associate CIO, specific improvement measures have not been released.  The Microsoft-Cleveland Clinic partnership is focused on identifying patients at high risk for cardiac arrest. Vasopressors are a medication administered to patients in the event of a cardiac arrest. While part of a “pulseless sudden cardiac arrest management protocol,” vasopressors also raise blood pressure. Researchers aim to predict whether or not a patient will require vasopressors. Data collected from monitored ICUs is stored in Microsoft’s Azure SQL Database, a cloud-based database designed for app developers. Data collection points such as patient vitals and lab data are also fed into the system. A computer model is built from the data that integrates machine learning for predictive analysis. A simple visual representation of Microsoft’s applications at work at Cleveland Clinic, taken from the Microsoft’s Technet Blog Massachusetts General Hospital Currently in the early stages of its AI strategy, in April 2016 NVIDIA announced its affiliation with the Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Data Science Center as a “founding technology partner.” The Center aims to serve as a hub for AI applications in healthcare for the “detection, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases.”  Officially presented at the 2016 GPU Technology Conference, NVIDIA DGX-1 is described by the company as a “deep learning supercomputer” and was installed at Mass General (readers unfamiliar with GPU technology may be interested in our NVIDIA executive interview titled “What is a GPU?“). The NVIDIA DGX-1 reportedly costs $129,000. With a hospital database comprised of “10 billion medical images” the server will be initially trained on this data for applications in radiology and pathology. The Center aims to later expand to electronic health records (EHRs) and genomics. If NVIDIA DGX-1 delivers on its promises it could mitigate some of the challenges currently facing the field:  “If we can somehow seamlessly capture the relevant data in a highly structured, thorough, repetitive, granular method, we remove that burden from the physician. The physician is happier, we save the patient money and we get the kind of data we need to do the game-changing AI work.” -Will Jack, Co-founder and CEO of Remedy Health  Johns Hopkins Hospital  In March 2016, Johns Hopkins Hospital announced the launch of a hospital command center that uses predictive analytics to support a more efficient operational flow. The hospital teamed up with GE Healthcare Partners to design the Judy Reitz Capacity Command Center which receives “500 messages per minute” and integrates data from “14 different Johns Hopkins IT systems” across 22 high-resolution, touch-screen enabled computer monitors.  A team of 24 command center staff is able to identify and mitigate risk, “prioritize activity for the benefit of all patients, and trigger interventions to accelerate patient flow.” Since the launch of the command center Johns Hopkins reports a 60 percent improvement in the ability to admit patients “with complex medical conditions” from the surrounding region and country at large.  The hospital also reports faster ambulance dispatches, 30 percent faster bed assignments in the emergency department, and a 21 percent increase in patient discharges before noon among other improvements.   Johns Hopkins leaders recently convened in April 2017 for a two day discussion on how to leverage big data and AI in the area of Precision Medicine. Industry analysts estimate the global Precision Medicine market value at $173 billion by 2024 (see our full article on AI applications in medicine for more use-cases in medicine and pharma). While specific details have not been released, a talk on “how artificial intelligence and deep learning are informing patient diagnosis and management” was presented by three speakers including a VP for IBM Watson Health Group, Shahram Ebadollahi, and Sachi Saria, PhD, Assistant Professor of Computer Science.  Saria’s research on machine learning applications to improve patient diagnoses and outcomes was recently presented at the 11th Annual Machine Learning Symposium at the New York Academy of Sciences. UCLA Medical Center In March 2017 in Washington, D.C., UCLA researchers Dr. Edward Lee and Dr. Kevin Seals presented the research behind the design of their Virtual Interventional Radiologist (VIR) at the Society of Interventional Radiology’s annual conference. Essentially a chatbot, the VIR  “automatically communicates with referring clinicians and quickly provides evidence-based answers to frequently asked questions.”  Currently in testing mode, this first VIR prototype is being used by a small team of UCLA health professionals which includes “hospitalists, radiation oncologists and interventional radiologists” (readers with a deeper interest in cancer treatments may want to read our full article about deep learning applications for oncology). The AI-driven application provides the referring physician with the ability to communicate information to the patient such as an overview of an interventional radiology treatment or next steps in a treatment plan, all in real-time.  VIR was built on a foundation of over 2,000 example data points designed to mirror questions that commonly come up during a consultation with an interventional radiologist. Responses are not limited to text in format and may include “websites, infographics, and custom programs.”  The research team integrated VIR with natural language processing ability using the IBM Watson AI system. In the tradition of  customer service chatbots across industries, if VIR cannot provide an adequate response to a particular inquiry the chatbot provides the referring clinician with contact information for a human interventional radiologist.    With increased use the researchers aim to expand the functionality of the application, for “general physicians interfacing with other specialists, such as cardiologists and neurosurgeons.” In March 2016, UCLA university-based researchers, were published in Nature Scientific Reports with a study combining a special microscope with a deep learning computer program “to identify cancer cells with over 95 percent accuracy.”  Photo (see Photonic time stretch microscope): http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/microscope-uses-artificial-intelligence-to-find-cancer-cells-more-efficiently The photonic time stretch microscope, invented by Barham Jalali, the research team’s lead scientist, produces high resolution images and is capable of analyzing 36 million images per second. Deep learning is then used to “distinguish cancer cells from healthy white blood cells.” Blood based-diagnostics are a growing sector and an increasingly competitive space as discussed in a recent Emerj interview with the founder of a leading firm investing in early-stage tech startups: “…Looking at DNA, RNA, proteins, all kinds of biomarker information to diagnose someone as early as possible is definitely a very active area…for example if you look at Grail, the very large spinout from Illumina, they’re very well-funded and they’re trying to use DNA and other information from the blood to be able to detect cancer early.” – Shelley Zhuang, Founder and Managing Partner, Eleven Two Capital Concluding Thoughts on Machine Learning at the Top 5 Hospitals It’s important to note that healthcare machine learning applications (unlike other applications in – say – detecting credit card fraud or optimizing marketing campaigns) struggle with unique constraints. Treating patients is a more delicate procedure than testing an eCommerce up-sell, and with regulatory compliance and a multitude of complex stakeholder relationships (doctors to use the technology, hospital execs to buy it, patients to hopefully benefit from it), we must be somewhat sympathetic with these top hospitals for not having tangible results from AI applications in such a touchy and new field. Our interview with health-tech investor Dr. Steve Gullans covered the unique challenges of hospital AI applications in greater depth. Steve mentioned the overt fear that many specialist physicians feel around AI tools, and the other psychological factors that will likely make hospital adoption slow. When asked how hospitals and healthcare facilities might get around these barriers (assuming the technology will in fact better the lives of patients), he expressed his opinion on where adoptions opportunities may exist: “It is tough, but there’s always a few beachheads that are going to pay off; there are some applications right now where physicians don’t enjoy a particular kind of call or one where having some assistance can actually be a big benefit to everyone involved…I think what you’re going to see is very specific populations within a particular setting, such as calling a stroke in the ER as bleeding or non-bleeding, where there’s a life and death decision that’s very binary…” – Dr. Steve Gullans, Excel Venture Management It’s also important to note that we should remain skeptical of technology applications until quantifiable results can be verified. As in nearly all other AI-infused industries, machine learning in healthcare is resulting in plenty of “technology signaling” (the hyped-up touting of “AI” for the sake of garnering attention and press, and not actually for improving an organizations results). Our Case Study section features real industery use-cases of AI in greater depth – such as this example of Luminoso’s natural language processing work for GlaxoSmithKline It’s mutually advantageous for an AI vendor like NVIDIA or Microsoft to grant a “new and super-fancy” AI technology to a top hospital, and grant the hospital the title of “founding technology partner.” These kinds of events are nearly guaranteed to get press and (probably) reflect favorably upon both parties – whether or not the AI application ever drives results for either the hospital (efficiencies) or patients (better health outcomes). We certainly didn’t compose this article to insult the efforts of any of the hospitals or vendors involved, but we as analysts must remain skeptical until results can be determined. Our aim is to inform business readers (like yourself) of the applications and implications of AI, and we always prefer projects with recorded results rather than “initiatives.” That being said, it’s important for business leaders to understand the common trends of such developments to get a sense of the “pulse” of an industry, and we hope to have done just that in this article. One of the reasons we insist that vendor companies list a client company and quantifiable result in our Emerj AI case studies is because – as with any emerging technology – AI is often used as a signal for the “cutting edge,” a tool for hype and not function. We’re of the belief that some of the hospital AI applications highlighted in this article will in fact make their way to real and ubiquitous use (particularly those which we highlighted in our “insights upfront” section at the beginning of this article). Just when fruitful applications will become commonplace – time will tell.

In the era of value-based healthcare, digital innovation, and big data, clinical decision support systems have become vital for organizations seeking to improve care delivery.







Clinical decision support (CDS) tools have the ability to analyze large volumes of data and suggest next steps for treatment, flagging potential problems and enhancing care team efficiency. 
While these systems can add significant value to the healthcare industry, CDS technologies have also come with substantial challenges. Poorly implemented CDS tools that generate unnecessary alerts often result in alarm fatigue and clinician burnout, trends that can threaten patient safety and lead to worse outcomes.
“Clinical decision support tools have been around for a number of years, but many of them have been somewhat standalone solutions and not well-integrated into the clinical point of care devices that people are using,” Katherine Andriole, director of research strategy and operations at the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS), told HealthITAnalytics.
Vendors, researchers, and developers have worked to overcome these issues, aiming to design solutions that are intuitive, informative, and efficient. At the core of many of these improved CDS tools are technologies that have long occupied the minds of healthcare tech enthusiasts: artificial intelligence and machine learning.

“Clinical decision support tools have been around for a number of years, but many of them have been somewhat standalone solutions and not well-integrated into the clinical point of care devices that people are using.""

“A lot of these mathematical techniques have been around for a long time, but the reason that we're seeing them come to fore now is that things have gone digital,” said Andriole, who is also an associate professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
“We used to do radiology on film. Now we have imaging digitally. We used to have a patient chart that was paper in a folder, now charts are electronic. We have computing that is much faster than what we had, say, 20 years ago, when training machine learning models was very computationally intensive.”
Even with all these advancements, however, the industry still struggles with several foundational problems. Limited data access, a lack of provider education and training, and poor technology integration are all obstacles that many organizations have yet to overcome. 
Applying machine learning and other analytics tools to CDS systems will require stakeholders to address these challenges, leading to more informed decision-making and better patient care.

Improving data quality to build quality algorithms
Machine learning and CDS tools are most effective when they are trained on data that is accurate, clean, and complete. After all, an algorithm’s output is only as good as its input, and in the high-stakes industry of healthcare, the input has to be pretty precise. 



Mark Sendak, Population Health and Data Science Lead, DukeHealth


However, as most healthcare professionals know, medical information isn’t always stored in a standardized way. Data inaccuracies and missing information are all too common, meaning organizations have a lot of work to do before they can even start to develop CDS algorithms. 
“You hear a lot about data quality. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out,” said Mark Sendak, MD, population health and data science lead at the Duke Institute for Health Innovation. 
“Electronic health records and the data within them are not necessarily designed for downstream use in algorithms. The user interfaces and databases are designed with other purposes in mind, so there's a lot we have to do to curate and transform data from its raw format into something that we can use in machine learning algorithms.”
Sendak and his team recently developed a machine learning model to predict adult patients’ risk of in-hospital mortality. Before building the tool, the group spent time gathering data and identifying which settings within which hospitals had better or worse mortality rates. While collecting information, researchers discovered that they were missing come crucial data points.
“People often say that mortality is a ‘hard outcome,’ which is something that you can measure and see clearly. What was a little bit surprising was that we don't actually have complete death data, especially for patients who are discharged from the hospital, and this is true of many institutions,” Sendak noted.
“If someone is deceased or becomes deceased within a healthcare facility that we operate, we tend to have very accurate, comprehensive mortality data. But if someone is discharged and that person dies – whether it's one week or 10 years after being discharged – and they don't die in a healthcare facility, there are a lot of gaps in mortality data.”

“Electronic health records and the data within them are not necessarily designed for downstream use in algorithms.""

These data gaps are a major barrier in the machine learning development process, Andriole stated. 
“One of the biggest challenges in training algorithms for machine learning is gaining access to large amounts of data,” she said. “Because there can be security and privacy issues with patient information, not everyone has a great supply of data they can use to train these models.”
In Sendak’s case, he and his team were able to collaborate with local organizations to fill in the mortality data gaps, with great results.
“We worked with our state health department to get data through the vital statistics office, which you can do as a research institution for different uses, and we were able to get state-level data,” he said. 
“The results showed that the model performed on par with state-of-the-art methods. Our goal is that maybe this model will be able to identify patients who have a gap in care, and then we would recommend that these patients have a goals of care conversation during the admission.”



Ronald Summers, MD, NIH Clinical Center


For other organizations, freely accessible datasets may be a viable resource for developing comprehensive CDS tools. Ronald Summers, MD, PhD, senior investigator of the Imaging Biomarkers and Computer-Aided Diagnostics Laboratory at the NIH Clinical Center, recently conducted a study in which his team aimed to extract information from CT scans that providers could use to gain further insights into patient health.
Researchers used publicly available data to train a deep learning model and found that the model was able to accurately identify and analyze certain biomarkers on CT scans, providing clinicians with more actionable decision-making information.
“We had to use manual assessment for the validation of each of the biomarkers, so that meant somebody had to sit down and either trace the edges of livers on CT scans or trace muscles, which is time-consuming and tedious,” Summers explained. 
“To speed up this process, we used anonymized public data sets of traced organs, and we taught a deep learning algorithm how to find our particular biomarkers of interest on the CT scans.”
As more health systems seek to leverage AI and other analytics technologies to improve their CDS capabilities, public datasets like these will help accelerate the process of algorithm development.
“Academic institutions are talking about whether we can partner and create datasets that people can use to train their models. Because we know that contributing more labeled and preprocessed data will help move the field forward,” Andriole said.


Leveraging AI to develop workflow-friendly tools   
Most of the hype that surrounds machine learning in CDS is caused by expectations of advanced, hyper-intelligent tools that can flawlessly detect tumors, lesions, or any other signs of illness.
Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of AI and other analytics tools to predict kidney disease, identify breast cancer, and accurately forecast leukemia remission rates.
Although it’s easy to get swept up in the excitement about the potential of machine learning in healthcare, organizations should take a more pragmatic stance, Summers said.
“Researchers will continue to identify areas where these tools could be clinically beneficial, but the provider community needs to think about how the information developed by these AI systems can be put into practice in a way that improves care,” he stated.
In reality, most organizations are aiming to use machine learning for more mundane CDS tasks – at least for right now. 
“A lot of people are focused on using AI for diagnostic clinical decision support, where the model would provide additional information to clinicians to help them make their decision,” Andriole said.
“But it’s the workflow and administrative kinds of models – the ones that help with things like patient scheduling or predicting patient no-shows – that are already making an impact. At the center, we focus on a number of things that are not necessarily difficult diagnostic problems, but they are things that might improve the workflow in some way.”



Katherine Andriole, PhD, Center for Clinical Data Science


For example, researchers at CCDS have developed a machine learning algorithm that can detect motion when a patient is undergoing an MRI scan. If a patient moves too much during a scan, the image may be unusable, resulting in a patient having to return to their provider to get another one.
“Our imaging artifact detection tool allows us to fix the problem while the patient is still with us and still in the scanner. We can just go ahead and re-scan them rather than go through the process and cost of having them come back in because their imaging wasn’t adequate,” Andriole explained.
“We're going to see some of these decision support or value-added tools put into the scanners, as well as some of the tools that we use at the point of care and in radiology.”
For Sendak, tools that will optimize providers’ day-to-day job functions are top of mind. Understanding how information moves through the system is critical for improving care decisions, he emphasized.
“In our own system, it's always about workflow. Who is the right person to share this information with, and when? At what time, and what are they going to do with it?” Sendak said.
“We try to think through the associated actions and decisions that people need to make. We ask, ‘Okay, are all patients identified by the model and reviewed by a clinician confirmed to have a goals of care conversation?’”
Including humans in the CDS design and implementation process is also essential for success, he noted. Organizations that rely only on advanced solutions to resolve major CDS pain points probably won’t see the best results.
“There's lots of unhelpful, annoying clinical decision support. Machine learning itself will not solve the problems that clinical decision support already has, but it can make certain parts of clinical decision support more effective,” said Sendak.
“In almost all of our projects, we have a human in the loop. These are clinical decision support systems. They're not driving clinical decisions, and models are wrong sometimes.”


Bigger teams, broader skillsets, better decisions 
When building an algorithm that will help support clinical care decisions, it’s necessary to include individuals from all sectors of the healthcare industry. These tools will impact nearly everyone involved in the care delivery process, from providers and staff to patients themselves. Having a team that trusts these models will increase the chance that these algorithms will improve patient care.
“If an AI technique works well, it doesn't necessarily mean that it will move from the bench to the bedside. There are a lot of factors that affect whether these techniques become available for clinical use. There are different people with different viewpoints and interests, and the process of making these tools available often requires skills outside those of the technology developers,” Summers said.
Collaborating on the best ways to integrate CDS tools with care practices will ensure clinicians can do their jobs successfully.
“Developing machine learning for CDS is a team sport,” said Andriole. 
“You need machine learning experts. You need clinicians. You need to understand the clinical use case. We need to understand oftentimes when a model fails, a clinician can look and understand why. We really feel that having clinicians work alongside data scientists is one way we're going to see advancement in this field.”
Going forward, healthcare organizations also may need to expand their pool of employees to include tech experts, Sendak added.
“You don't typically think of health systems hiring teams of data scientists and data engineers. But the institutions that are leading the way in AI do have those jobs and those functions. It’s not just a technology investment, it’s an investment in people, skills, and capabilities,” he said.

“If an AI technique works well, it doesn't necessarily mean that it will move from the bench to the bedside.""

Education and training will also play a key role, Andriole said.
“When new tools come along, we have to educate people on how to use them and how to assess the outputs. We don’t want clinicians to just blindly accept recommendations, but to analyze them and say, ‘Yeah, okay, this is what this means. I understand enough about how this works,’” she said.
“It's not enough knowledge to build a model on their own, but they’ll understand enough to be able to use the tool.”
In the past, AI adoption in healthcare has been met with some degree of resistance by providers, partly due to valid concerns over the ethical implications of using these tools to deliver care.
However, recent research suggests that the tides may be changing. A global survey from Philips showed that 79 percent of healthcare professionals under 40 are confident that digital health technologies can achieve better patient outcomes, while 74 percent believe these tools will improve the patient experience.
As machine learning and clinical decision support continue to evolve, the next generation of providers will likely be well-equipped to understand and apply these tools in regular care delivery.
“People are very interested in learning about how they can use these methods to solve clinical problems,” Andriole said. “And it’s not just computer scientists and data scientists who are interested, but also a lot of our clinical trainees.” 
In the not-so-distant future, machine learning and AI-fueled CDS tools just may become the healthcare industry’s standard.
“We may be able to start automating healthcare in the same ways that other industries have been automated,” Andriole concluded.

Canadian scientists have developed an innovative new technique that uses artificial intelligence to better define the different sections of the brain in newborns during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam. 
The results of this study -- a collaboration between researchers at Montreal's CHU Sainte-Justine children's hospital and the ÉTS engineering school -- are published today in Frontiers in Neuroscience.
""This is one of the first times that artificial intelligence has been used to better define the different parts of a newborn's brain on an MRI: namely the grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid,"" said Dr. Gregory A. Lodygensky, a neonatologist at CHU Sainte-Justine and professor at Université de Montréal.
""Until today, the tools available were complex, often intermingled and difficult to access,"" he added.
In collaboration with Professor Jose Dolz, an expert in medical image analysis and machine learning at ÉTS, the researchers were able to adapt the tools to the specificities of the neonatal setting and then validate them.
This new technique allows babies' brains to be examined quickly, accurately and reliably. Scientists see it as a major asset for supporting research that not only addresses brain development in neonatal care, but also the effectiveness of neuroprotective strategies.
In evaluating a range of tools available in artificial intelligence, CHU Sainte-Justine researchers found that these tools had limitations, particularly with respect to pediatric research. Today's neuroimaging analysis programs are primarily designed to work on ""adult"" MRIs. The cerebral immaturity of newborns, with an inversion of the contrasts between grey matter and white matter, complicates such analyses.
Inspired by Dolz's most recent work, the researchers proposed an artificial neural network that learns how to efficiently combine information from several MRI sequences. This methodology made it possible to better define the different parts of the brain in the newborn automatically and to establish a new benchmark for this problem.
""We've decided not only to share the results of our study on open source, but also the computer code, so that brain researchers everywhere can take advantage of it, all of which benefits patients,"" said Dolz.
CHU Sainte-Justine is one of the most important players in the Canadian Neonatal Brain Platform and also has one of the largest neonatal units in Canada specializing in neurodevelopment. As part of the platform, research teams are implementing projects like this one with the aim of improving the long-term health of those newborns who are most vulnerable to brain injury.
""In studies to assess the positive and negative impact of different therapies on the maturation of babies' brains, we need to have the ability to quantify brain structures with certainty and reliability,"" Lodygensky said. ""By offering the scientific community the fruits of all our discoveries, we are helping them, while generating an extraordinary benefit for at-risk newborns.""
He added: ""We now want to democratize this tool so that it becomes the benchmark for the study of brain structure in newborns around the world. To this end, we are continuing to work on its generalizability -- that is, its use on MRI data acquired in different hospitals.""

John Deere used technology acquired by Blue River Technology to develop a weed control system that precisely dispenses herbicides to reduce pesticide use and improve environmental quality. (Blue River Technology)
Agriculture is not one of the first markets people connect with fledgling technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). But for agricultural and construction equipment manufacturer John Deere, AI is already starting to help farmers improve crop yield and maintain better control of daily farm tasks.In a phone interview with FierceElectronics earlier this week, Sona Raziabeegum, Strategy Lead, Digital Solutions for John Deere Intelligent Solutions Group, said AI is being adopted as part of high technology solutions the company is implementing for agricultural facilities which must deal with variables such as bad weather, poor soil conditions and the constraints of a short growing season.“There is not a lot of do-over in agriculture,” said Raziabeegum. “We want to convey the message that there is a lot of great technology in agriculture solving real problems. It is not technology looking for a solution.”RELATED: Ethylene-detecting sensor could help prevent food wasteRaziabeegum gave the example of an application where machine learning was used to “train” vision cameras mounted on farm equipment to recognize bad wheat as it is being harvested into a grain bin. A neural mask processes this vision data and instructs the machine to separate the bad grain.In addition, Raziabeegum noted that the neural mask is programmed to spot any debris that may get into the grain bin, which would also adversely affect grain quality.The benefits are better quality of grain and a reduced need for skilled labor. “You’re doing this in real time. Farmers operate on thin margins and are open to the technology’s benefits on their yield and crop quality.”In another application, Raziabeegum said a herbicide sprayer system, called See and Spray, employed vision cameras with a neural net that helps precisely identify where the herbicide should be sprayed. The technology is currently being demonstrated in Mississippi for a cotton field and in a midwestern location for corn, she noted.“We believe the technology in this application can reduce herbicide use by as much as 90%, which helps achieve the goal of using less chemicals in farming.”Because AI has not been used in agriculture previously, Raziabeegum said John Deere invested a lot of time and effort learning to apply the technology in a new use case. It is a different set of parameters than say, automotive, which Raziabeegum said agriculture is often compared to.“In agriculture, it is not just traveling from point A to point B. Once you get there, you need to perform a complicated task. Also, because [of] the unpredictability of agriculture, your AI models have to be a lot more sophisticated in order to apply to crops.”Because agriculture is largely an outdoor application, there’s no enclosed, central onsite facility where one can implement a server and a communications network. Edge computing, with processing onboard the machines doing the work, becomes vitally important.“Connectivity not a given,” Raziabeegum explained. “About 95% of computing on the edge needs inference in real time. Our edge network architecture had to be custom designed.”Because John Deere is largely an equipment manufacturer, it had to acquire some its expertise in AI and machine learning from outside the company. The firm did just that in 2017, when it acquired Blue River Technology, a company specializing in applying machine learning to agriculture, based in Sunnyvale, California. Blue River developed the See and Spray integrated computer vision and machine learning technology for herbicide spraying that John Deere is now implementing.According to Raziabeegum, the average size of the farm John Deere is supporting is 5,000 acres. But she emphasized the company is able to scale technology solutions for facilities that are smaller as well.For the future, Raziabeegum foresees expanding the use of AI and machine learning to develop complete, detailed plant growing and maintenance plans. She also expects AI to be leveraged more for construction applications.

Designing Computer Vision Algorithms to Describe the Visual World to People Who Are Blind or Low Vision







A common goal in computer vision research is to build machines that can replicate the human vision system (for example, detect an object or scene category, describe an object or scene, or locate an object). A natural grand challenge for the artificial intelligence community is to design such technology to assist people who are blind to overcome their real daily visual challenges.
In this webinar with Dr. Danna Gurari, Assistant Professor in the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin, and Dr. Ed Cutrell, Senior Principal Researcher in the Microsoft Research Ability Group, learn how computer vision researchers are working to create vision systems adapted to the needs of those who use them. By creating new dataset challenges, the researchers aim to empower the artificial intelligence community to work on real use cases.
To encourage the larger artificial intelligence community to collaborate on developing methods for assistive technology, we introduce the first dataset challenges with data that originates from people who are blind. Our data comes from over 11,000 people in real-world scenarios who were seeking to learn about the physical world around them. More broadly, this dataset serves as a great catalyst for uncovering hard artificial intelligence challenges that must be addressed to create more robust systems across many contexts and scenarios.
Together, we’ll explore:

Creating tools for people who are blind or have low vision that match their needs and complement their capabilities
Key challenges of teaching computers how to automatically describe pictures taken by people who are blind or low vision
Several potential solutions to make computers more accurately address the needs of people who are blind or low vision

Despite a company-wide mandate, however, the social networking giant had not figured out how to conduct its most sensitive work remotely: removing pornography, terrorism, hate speech and other unwanted content from across its site.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeThe people who do that sensitive work — nearly 15,000 contractors at 20 sites globally — continued to come to the office until last Monday, when public pressure, internal protests and quarantine measures around the world pushed Facebook to make a drastic move to shutter its moderation offices.But Facebook’s decision to place that army of moderators on paid leave paves the way for another challenge, forcing the company to police disinformation, medical hoaxes, Russian trolls and the general ugliness of the Internet without them.As misinformation about the novel coronavirus continues to spread, here are some important tips to keep in mind when consuming news about the outbreak. (Video: The Washington Post)Facebook, Google and Twitter scramble to stop misinformation about coronavirusWhile Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other companies have long touted artificial intelligence and algorithms as the future of policing problematic content, they’ve more recently acknowledged that humans are the most important line of defense. Those contractors, who are paid a fraction of what full-time workers earn, spend hours a day reviewing material flagged as illegal or disturbing, removing posts that cross the line and often suffering psychological harm from the exposure.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementStill, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on a media call Wednesday that Facebook will be forced during the pandemic to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence software to make those judgment calls. The company also will train full-time employees to devote “extra attention” to highly sensitive content, such as any involving suicide, child exploitation and terrorism. Users should expect more mistakes while Facebook triages the process, he said, in part because a fraction of the humans will be involved and because software makes more blunt decisions than humans.💻Follow TechnologyFollowZuckerberg acknowledged the decision could result in “false positives,” including removal of content that should not be taken down.It will “create a trade-off against some other types of content that may not have as imminent physical risks for people.“ Still, he hopes to train more people as quickly as possible because he was “personally quite worried that the isolation from people being at home could potentially lead to more depression or mental health issues, and we want to make sure that we are ahead of that in supporting our community.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementZuckerberg’s admission reflects the complex choices and trade-offs Silicon Valley giants are making in the face of a mounting global health crisis. The companies can protect workers and comply with local stay home orders. But that choice could jeopardize the safety of the billions of users around the world, many of whom are quarantined at home, on the Internet all day and exposed to more potentially disturbing material than before.YouTube also announced temporary plans last week to rely more heavily on automated systems to reduce the number of people in the office, something the company warned could prompt a slower appeals process for video content creators and more unreviewed content barred from search or its homepage. The same day, Twitter said it would do the same. Because the automated systems may cause mistakes, it won’t permanently suspend accounts during this time. It’s also triaging to prioritize policing potentially more harmful violations.Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other social media companies have faced significant past challenges to policing content, from the live video posted during the Christ Church, New Zealand, shooting to disinformation campaigns by Russian trolls during the 2016 presidential election. The decision to send workers home comes during a presidential election year when foreign and domestic users are actively trying to shape public debate using disinformation that might be spotted only by a human eye.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThat pressure is heightened as disinformation regarding the novel coronavirus surges. On Facebook-owned WhatsApp, chat groups are spreading unverified information about flights, hotels and schools in connection with the virus, as well as misinformation about potential government crackdowns and how the disease is spreading. On Facebook, a fake letter circulated about an outbreak in Los Angeles, and there were pervasive posts about fake cures and falsehoods that the U.S. government created coronavirus.It’s not just social media: Some consumers are getting fake texts to their phones warning of a nationwide lockdown.White House asks Silicon Valley for help to combat coronavirus, track its spread and stop misinformationFollowing the 2016 presidential election, Facebook in particular hired thousands of third-party moderators in the Philippines, India, Dublin and the United States to police the site and shore up its reputation. The moderators, who work for outsourcing companies like Accenture and Cognizant, are contractors and typically receive less pay and fewer benefits than actual employees.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe decision to send the humans home and rely more on technology to police the sites concerned some researchers.“They haven’t made enough leaps and bounds in artificial intelligence to take away the best tool we have: human intelligence to do the discernment,” said Mary Gray, senior principal researcher at Microsoft Research and co-author of “Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass.”“This is a mess.”Millions of tweets peddled conspiracy theories about coronavirus in other countries, an unpublished U.S. report says“We’re focused on keeping people safe and informed while making sure they can share information and connect with one another during this crisis,"" said Facebook spokesman Drew Pusateri. ""But as we said in a recent update on our content review, we anticipate that some mistakes will occur as we adjust to a modified workforce with a heavier reliance on automation.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementFacebook is making the change in large part because it considers the work too sensitive for third party moderators to do from home because, among other reasons, it involves reviewing people’s private Facebook accounts. The company also acknowledges it is a traumatic job and workers would receive less support at home. Typically, moderators work in call centers where every movement, from breaks to keystrokes to judgments over content, is heavily managed and monitored.The company says that may change as the coronavirus emergency evolves.Content moderators at YouTube, Facebook and Twitter see the worst of the web — and suffer silentlyFacebook offered more clarity on its plans in a company blog post late Thursday. When users report content for violating policy, they will see a message explaining there are fewer reviews and Facebook is prioritizing content that poses the greatest potential harm.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“This means some reports will not be reviewed as quickly as they used to be and we will not get to some reports at all,” according to the blog post. Reducing the workforce also will alter the appeals process for users who believe their content was removed in error. People can still report they disagree with Facebook’s decision.We’ll ”monitor that feedback to improve our accuracy, but we likely won’t review content a second time,” the company said.Roughly 95 percent of posts involving adult nudity, terrorism, child exploitation, suicide and self-harm that the company ultimately takes down are flagged by algorithms before Facebook users have a chance to report them, according to the company’s latest community standards enforcement report. (The company does not attempt to estimate the total number of problematic posts that appear on the platform, only whether the content that was taken down was reported.)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut for more nuanced categories of speech, the company’s systems often are less effective. Artificial intelligence catches only 16 percent of posts involving bullying and harassment on Facebook, resulting in more than 80 percent of posts reported to the company. Artificial intelligence catches about 80 percent of hate speech.Those numbers have led company officials to realize human judgment still is necessary to monitor more sensitive areas of speech, such as racism and political disinformation.“I think there will always be people” making judgment calls over content, Zuckerberg said in a Washington Post interview last year.Silicon Valley’s two-tiered system for white-collar workers is under pressure as coronavirus spreadsAlready there are signs of potential problems. Early last week, legitimate articles with accurate information about the virus were being removed from Facebook. Zuckerberg said it was caused by a bug in the company’s spam detection system that was unrelated to its triaging of content moderation during the pandemic. “The system is fixed, those posts are back up, and hopefully we won’t have that issue again anytime soon,” he said on the media call last week.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAs Facebook moves to a more technology-driven response to policing content, it will prove a major test for the industry, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity professor and author of “The 26 Words That Created the Internet.”“It will tell us a lot about the state of automated moderation,” Kosseff said. “We don’t really know what exactly tech companies are doing and how effective it is,” although they have been more transparent.UCLA professor Sarah T. Roberts, author of “Behind the Screen: Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media,” said Facebook’s hand may have been forced. In Manila, the Filipino capital where Facebook indirectly employs thousands of content moderators, the government enacted a citywide quarantine.Regardless of Facebook’s motivation, Roberts said the experience will reveal how much human reviewers impact our collective well-being and experience of the Internet. It may even shift the Silicon Valley ideology that places a primacy on problem-solving through engineering.“We actually might not be able to code our way out of coronavirus,” she said.Coronavirus: What you need to knowSummer covid uptick: If you’re hearing about more people testing positive or getting sick, it’s no surprise, because data shows another covid wave forming. Nearly two-thirds of infections are caused by KP variants dubbed FLiRT, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of June 22.Combined covid-flu vaccine: A combined coronavirus-influenza vaccine may be on the horizon after Moderna’s shot produced a higher immune response in older adults than separate vaccines for those viruses administered together. Moderna officials say the earliest that the combined vaccine could hit the market is fall 2025, pending regulatory approval.Covid isolation guidelines: Americans who test positive for the coronavirus no longer need to routinely stay home from work and school for five days under new guidance planned by the CDC. The change has raised concerns among medically vulnerable people.Share72 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Their services in the crisis have simplified the work for many healthcare professionals including doctors. Where doctors are selflessly working 15-18 hours in hospitals, AI-enabled technologies are assisting their line of work with great efficiency to cure patients. For example, a team headquartered at Boston Children's Hospital is implementing machine learning to scour through social posts, news reports, data from official public health channels and information supplied by doctors for warning signs that the virus is taking hold in locations outside of China. Besides, AI coupled with robotics capabilities is working as a mechanical healthcare provider for those suffering from COVID-19 symptoms. However, due to such productivity and enhanced features, many fear that AI could replace doctors..Undeniably, AI has done marvels in the healthcare sector. From radiology to disease detection to drug discovery, the technology has implied that it is poised to stay relevant in the industry with further advancements. However, the advancements do not certainly mean replacing the jobs of medical practitioners. Many experts have agreed that AI is not coming for their jobs, as the world is moving towards a collaborative ecosystem where humans and machines can work in harmony, they believe that the technology may quintessentially assist doctors more proficiently in upcoming years. Some even believe that, even if AI climbs up the ladder of utmost sophistication, it can never match human intelligence and human-level critical/creative thinking..Let's explore what experts have to say about it..Matthew Sappern, CEO at PeriGen.&quot;I think it does things that are really imperative that are not necessarily what nurses can do,&quot; he said. &quot;These tools are not so great where reasoning and empathy are required. You teach them to do something, and they will do it over and over and over again, period. They're good tools to provide perspective, but it's all about the provider or nurse who's making sense of that information.&quot;.He has implied several times that artificial intelligence can aid nurses to focus excessively on the actual job of nursing and abstracts things. According to Mathew, AI possesses the power to enhance the confidence of healthcare professionals while reporting them with exact figures eliminating the vagaries..Dr. John Showalter, Chief Product Officer at Jvion.Dr. John is extremely dismissive of the claims that medical jobs are in jeopardy. According to him, the hype is scary but the reality is not..&quot;There are great benefits that do amazing things for patients. When you come in and improve the scoring for falls, for example, and you understand what needs to be done to prevent falls, that's ready for prime time today.&quot;.&quot;There absolutely places where AI is ready to go today, and then there's a whole bunch of AI hype that's really scary, so sorting out the AI that's ready to help patients and the hype can be really difficult for leadership.&quot;.Eldon Richards, Chief Technology Officer at Recondo Technologies.According to Eldon, AI is now addressing a lot of repetitive tasks that a human might do today..&quot;In reviewing the ethics of a decision, or complex data or one-off decision, AI is not good at those today. AI is very far off when it comes to those capabilities. The mundane, routine things we do, like typing in a word processor, AI is simplifying those things for us, so now we're shifting our focus from these simple tasks to things that require a little more training. I certainly do not see unemployment going up.&quot;.Mary Sun, AI Researcher at First Derm and Medical Student at Mount Sinai Medical Center.&quot;People see it as a job replacement thing and I think that's a pretty flawed way to look at it. In many other industries, like when I was in commercial tech, it's viewed much more as an augmentation, and piece of mind, and double-checking and making sure that you're involving patterns that one doctor cannot possibly see.&quot;.&quot;As one doctor, you can't possibly see a million patients across your lifetime. But medicine, at least diagnosis, is all in the pattern recognition. So I think it's going to be very exciting when we find ways to augment our diagnoses and make them a lot more robust.&quot;.Carlo Perez, CEO of Swift Medical.&quot;What we feel is the doctor will transition into someone who understands how to wield data science, who understands how to use these tools. Hopefully, someone will not need to truly understand AI but will understand their relationship to it. Which is, 'I can utilize these tools, I understand these tools, and I understand how to utilize them in partnership to make better decisions.'&quot;.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

He holds a bachelor's degree in Writing, Literature, and Publishing from Emerson College. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Progressive is one of the largest auto insurers in the US. The company has been experimenting with AI since the middle of the 2010s, with customer-facing applications that update insurance premiums based on driving habits and answer questions in a chat window. In this article, we discuss both of these AI use-cases. More specifically: Snapshot: Progressive’s Snapshot program, which seems to use predictive analytics to adjust a customer’s premiums based on their driving behavior. Flo Chatbot: The company’s customer service chatbot, which could help customers with purchasing a policy or filing a claim. Emerj’s AI Opportunity Landscape research in insurance shows that Progressive’s Snapshot program follows a trend in which auto insurers use predictive analytics applications to determine how risky a customer or insurance applicant is: Approximately 21.6% of AI products in insurance are applications of this type. In contrast, although several of the largest insurance companies in the US have experimented with chatbots, the insurance industry hasn’t prioritized chatbots the way the retail industry has, as chatbots make up only 8% of the AI products in insurance. We begin our exploration of Progressive’s AI initiatives with their AI-enabled Snapshot program for usage based insurance:  Snapshot: Usage-Based Insurance Progressive claims to use a predictive analytics application that uses driving data collected from their clients to offer usage-based insurance (UBI). This means that Progressive could price their customers’ insurance policies based on how well they drive. The program, called Snapshot, requires customer to install a device into their car’s diagnostics port or download an app to their mobile phone. As the customer drives, the device or app records information about the driver’s behavior and feeds it into a predictive analytics algorithm. The algorithm seemingly offers employees at Progressive a recommendation on whether to increase or decrease the customer’s premium payments after the initial 6 month period during which they have the Snapshot device or app installed. The algorithm purportedly factors for: How often a customer drives and for how long at a time. This is one of the most common factors within “pay-as-you-drive” programs like these. How often a customer speeds. Regular speeding may signal that the driver is a greater risk. How forcefully a customer brakes, which could signal that the customer is not braking soon enough. How sharp the customer’s turns are, which, again, may signal that the customer needs to break sooner. Progressive’s Snapshot program is the result of work with AI vendor H2O.ai. Below is a video that explains this work and how AI makes Snapshot possible:  H2O.ai claims that Progressive’s underwriters were able to create and analyze new risk models faster after adopting the vendor’s AI platform. Flo Chatbot Progressive’s Flo Chatbot, which emulates its mascot, courtesy of Katie Stuhldreher. Progressive also worked with Microsoft Azure to create a natural language processing-enabled chatbot that emulates its popular mascot character, Flo. The Flo chatbot is a virtual assistant for customer service that customers could access through the company’s Facebook messenger account. It also references some of the commercials that Flo appears in and purportedly uses Progressive’s knowledge base to identify answers to customer service questions.  The Flo chatbot can purportedly help customers: File a claim Get an auto insurance quote Change premium payment due dates Answer basic questions about auto insurance, such as “What is a deductible?” The company may also be able to leverage social media responses as data to improve the chatbot’s conversational capabilities. For example, some customers may not know about the chatbot and leave their question as a comment on a Facebook post. Progressive could use these comments as a means of further training the chatbot.

However, most leaders are quite excited to implement AI into the company’s business functions to start realizing its extraordinary benefits. While we have no way of knowing all the ways artificial intelligence and machine learning will ultimately impact business functions, here are 10 business functions that are ready to use artificial intelligence. 
10 Business Functions That Are Ready To Use Artificial IntelligenceAdobe Stock

Marketing

If your company isn’t using artificial intelligence in marketing, it's already behind. Not only can AI help to develop marketing strategies, but it's also instrumental in executing them. Already AI sorts customers according to interest or demographic, can target ads to them based on browsing history, powers recommendation engines, and is a critical tool to give customers what they want exactly when they want it. Another way AI is used in marketing is through chatbots. These bots can help solve problems, suggest products or services, and support sales. Artificial intelligence also supports marketers by analyzing data on consumer behavior faster and more accurately than humans. These insights can help businesses make adjustments to marketing campaigns to make them more effective or plan better for the future.

Sales

There is definitely a side of selling products and services that is uniquely human, but artificial intelligence can arm sales professionals with insights that can improve the sales function. AI helps improve sales forecasting, predict customer needs, and improve communication. And intelligent machines can help sales professionals manage their time and identify who they need to follow-up with and when as well as what customers might be ready to convert.
PROMOTED
Research and Development (R&D)
What about artificial intelligence as a tool of innovation? It can help us build a deeper understanding in nearly any industry, including healthcare and pharmaceuticals, financial, automotive, and more, while collecting and analyzing tremendous amounts of information efficiently and accurately. This and machine learning can help us research problems and develop solutions that we’ve never thought of before. AI can automate many tasks, but it will also open the door to novel discoveries, ways of improving products and services as well as accomplishing tasks. Artificial intelligence helps R&D activities be more strategic and effective.
IT Operations
Also called AIOps, AI for IT operations is often the first experience many organizations have with implementing artificial intelligence internally. Gartner defines the term AIOps as the “application of machine learning and data science to IT operations problems.” AI is commonly used for IT system log file error analysis, with IT systems management functions as well as to automate many routine processes. It can help identify issues so the IT team can proactively fix them before any IT systems go down. As the IT systems to support our businesses become more complex, AIOps helps the IT improve system performance and services.

Human Resources
In a business function with “human” in the name, is there a place for machines? Yes! Artificial intelligence really has the potential to transform many human resources activities from recruitment to talent management. AI can certainly help improve efficiency and save money by automating repetitive tasks, but it can do much more. PepsiCo used a robot, Robot Vera, to phone and interview candidates for open sales positions. Talent is going to expect a personalized experience from their employer just as they have been accustomed to when shopping and for their entertainment. Machine learning and AI solutions can help provide that. In addition, AI can help human resources departments with data-based decision-making and make candidate screening and the recruitment process easier. Chatbots can also be used to answer many common questions about company policies and benefits.

Contact Centers
The contact center of an organization is another business area where artificial intelligence is already in use. Organizations that use AI technology to enhance rather than replace humans with these tasks are the ones that are incorporating artificial intelligence in the right way. These centers collect a tremendous amount of data that can be used to learn more about customers, predict customer intent, and improve the ""next best action"" for the customer for better customer engagement. The unstructured data collected from contact centers can also be analyzed by machine learning to uncover customer trends and then improve products and services.

Building Maintenance
Another way AI is already at work in businesses today is helping facilities managers optimize energy use and the comfort of occupants. Building automation, the use of artificial intelligence to help manage buildings and control lighting and heating/cooling systems, uses internet-of-things devices and sensors as well as computer vision to monitor buildings. Based upon the data that is collected, the AI system can adjust the building's systems to accommodate for the number of occupants, time of day, and more. AI helps facilities managers improve energy efficiency of the building. An additional component of many of these systems is building security as well.
Manufacturing
Heineken, along with many other companies, uses data analytics at every stage of the manufacturing process from the supply chain to tracking inventory on store shelves. Predictive intelligence can not only anticipate demand and ramp production up or down, but sensors on equipment can predict maintenance needs. AI helps flag areas of concern in the manufacturing process before costly issues erupt. Machine vision can also support the quality control process at manufacturing facilities.
Accounting and Finance
Many organizations are finding the promise of cost reductions and more efficient operations the major appeal for artificial intelligence in the workplace, and according to Accenture Consulting, robotic process automation can produce amazing results in these areas for the accounting and finance industry and departments. Human finance professionals will be freed-up from repetitive tasks to be able to focus on higher-level activities while the use of AI in accounting will reduce errors. AI is also able to provide real-time status of financial matters to organizations because it can monitor communication through natural language processing.
Customer Experience
Another way artificial intelligence technology and big data are used in business today is to improve the customer experience. Luxury fashion brand Burberry uses big data and AI to enhance sales and customer relationships. The company gathers shopper's data through loyalty and reward programs that they then use to offer tailored recommendations whether customers are shopping online or in brick-and-mortar stores. Innovative uses of chatbots during industry events are another way to provide a stellar customer experience.

The superiority of AI: the scam of the century
Artificial intelligence is just an empty shell, right? Denis Fages, President of VideoTelling, warns us to not give this technology virtues that it doesn’t have - and never will.

I hear so many silly things in reference to artificial intelligence. I work in digital learning and a day doesn’t go by without reading nonsense about the brain and memory. They tell us - in the media and then repeated on social media - that computers are going to “think,” “imagine,” and “create.” They tell us that they are going to make humanity obsolete and that we are going to join the other extinct species like the Neanderthals. What if, instead of foretelling tomorrow’s apocalypse, we tried to learn a little

Big DataBot is watching you

1984 is knocking at our door. This will soon be our future... if we let GAFA condition our existence by “predicting our desires in order to make our lives easier.” With all good intentions, it’s bullshit. It’s just a marketing scheme to sell leads to brands by analysing your data. They put us in boxes in order to manage compartmental marketing scenarios.
Those who “don’t know” are enchanted by the strength of computers. In 1968, a super calculator beat the majority of humans in calculations. Fifty years later, in 2018, while autonomous cars drive on the land and the drones fly in our skies, full of cameras and AI, we are still in the same position. Computers may calculate much faster than humans, but they aren’t at all intelligent.

What is intelligence?

Pick up a dictionary and you will see that there are close to a dozen definitions about intelligence. Here are a couple: “ability to comprehend, to not misinterpret the meaning of words, the nature of things and the significance of events”; “voluntary and reflective activity of men practised in a normal manner, as seen from a point of knowledge and against instinct”; “skill and ability, which is, above all, applied to the choice of reason used to obtain a result”; “correspondence, communication between people who understand each other; complicity.” In the definitions, the dictionary suggests creative intelligence, intelligence from the heart, emotional intelligence, practical intelligence...
So, when we talk about artificial intelligence, what do we mean? The Larousse encyclopaedia says that we design AI by “theories and techniques implemented in order to create machines capable of simulating intelligence.” As Deeper Blue beat Garry Kasparov in chess, in May 1997, we forgot one thing. Gary was the only one actually playing. Deeper Blue was calculating. The computer predetermined what he would do. And that’s it. We can simulate learning and intelligence, in the way that we programmed the machine to store data and make decisions with it, but it is only a simulation.

What we do... but in a one thousandth of a second

With a closer look, artificial intelligence is actually stupid. Someone who thinks that a computer can think faster or better is depreciating themselves as a being. I would also add that they don’t know much about themselves. A lot of people identify with their body - they mistake their soul as their brain and think of themselves as machines.
Let’s take the time to really analyse our potential. When we think about complex subjects, like creating a marketing strategy, this is what we do: we analyse dozens of pieces of data; we evaluate them, compare them, and choose them according to their importance; we use thousands of understandings accumulated over the course of our lives, as well as education; we take into account all of our feelings; we evaluate the consequences for each person involved in the short term or long term; we make a prediction of all the possible scenarios, according to their probability; we eliminate all the bad solutions and finally we choose what we think is the best for us, our family, our group, our company, and even our country, humanity, and the planet... We also do this in a microsecond, thousands of times per day, every single time that we make a decision.

        5 ways that robots will be part of British life
      



Do androids dream of electric sheep?

That’s the original title of Philip K. Dick’s novel, that became the movie Blade Runner. And it is a big question. A human being can sing in the rain. They can, despite good sense and logic, paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. They can formulate a philosophy in order to understand life. They are creative during the entire day and a good part of the night. Has someone asked Sophia - the robot citizen of Saudi Arabia - what she thought about Picasso’s paintings or Daft Punk’s sound? The best algorithms in the world could never think as fast and as well as a person of sound mind. And it wouldn’t be able to create anything.
Of course, we can simulate creation. We can programme it. We can rearrange creations and additions according to a random sequence that is skilfully programmed... by its programmer. This creation won’t have anything to do with the motives, intentions, motivations and emotions of a human being, artist or not.
Please understand that artificial intelligence is based on cognitive science. Yet they do have ambition (it doesn’t mean that they achieve it) to model perception, intelligence, reasoning, emotions, and even consciousness. I think about Buddhists who spend their entire lives meditating in order to achieve a higher level of consciousness. I ask myself what an algorithm that aspires to reach a superior state of being would look like.

“Science without conscience...”

I am directly approaching this notion of spiritual consciousness, because one risk with AI is the small minority of materialistic scientists who invoke their small ideas on the nature of man. We will end up believing that we are nothing more than a group of synaptic connections, surrounded by a skeleton and some muscles... Basically that we are nothing more than a machine... And therefore, a very strong machine could beat us!
“Science without conscience ruins the soul,” Rabelais warned us. Propaganda started and is going to intensify: “machines will think better than humans because they don’t have emotions. They make less mistakes. A machine will always make better choices. A machine is better at...” Stop! The real danger that we need to watch out for, and the real challenge of AI and robotics is to avoid scenarios like in The Matrix or Terminator. Of course, we can talk about ethics and the laws of robotics...
However, even deeper than that, there is a rebellion to manage. And it’s not about agreeing with the fact that a machine could become more powerful than man. It’s not about preventing the manufacturing of powerful machines, but about recognising the power that each human has. Because “machines are more powerful than humans” could never become true if a handful of people were able to convince everyone else that they aren’t machines, nor pieces of meat living the rat race.
AI is a trick. All good programmers know it. Intelligence is something associated with life. Something that animates life. Humans can try to make a rough copy, but machines will never take over its master.

The battle of a century

“Big Data Bot versus Buddha,” is the match between the coming of age of machines and a spiritual renaissance for humanity. In other words, one day we might have a philosophy that reconciles science and spirituality. Big Data Bot will win against humans if we let the ones who have already succumbed lie to us about our nature, potential, and past. Personally, I have no intention in letting my actions be dictated by a machine. It’s in labouring hard and strong today that humans are conscious and spiritual beings, and that a machine is nothing more than an inert machine that has no control over our fate.
The prettiest robot in the world that contains the most perfected AI is nothing more than a bit of metal without a soul. It was made to be a perfect tool that allows me to use the intelligence of my own body better. And only if it helps me develop my own skills. It’s incidentally a good thing to be currently developing the cobot (collaborative robot that aims at producing robots to assist humans).
For the love of God, let’s stop believing in all the rubbish about the strength of AI. You are intelligent and have a conscience. You are a creative spirit, deep down. And your potential as a spiritual animal is a thousand times bigger than those bloody machines.

There is increasing awareness that the greatest problems with artificial intelligence are not primarily technical, but rather how to achieve value from the technology. This was a growing problem even in the booming economy of the last several years, but a much more important issue in the current pandemic-driven recessionary economic climate.


Older AI technologies like natural language processing, and newer ones like deep learning, work well for the most part and are capable of providing considerable value to organizations that implement them. The challenges are with large-scale implementation and deployment of AI, which are necessary to achieve value. There is substantial evidence of this in surveys.

In an MIT Sloan Management Review/BCG survey, “seven out of 10 companies surveyed report minimal or no impact from AI so far. Among the 90% of companies that have made some investment in AI, fewer than 2 out of 5 report business gains from AI in the past three years. This number improves to 3 out of 5 when we include companies that have made significant investments in AI. Even so, this means 40% of organizations making significant investments in AI do not report business gains from AI.”

PROMOTED
NewVantage Partners 2019 Big Data and AI Executive survey—Firms report ongoing interest and an active embrace of AI technologies and solutions, with 91.5% of firms reporting ongoing investment in AI. But only 14.6% of firms report that they have deployed AI capabilities into widespread production. Perhaps as a result, the percentage of respondents agreeing that their pace of investment in AI and big data was accelerating fell from 92% in 2018 to 52% in 2019.

Deloitte 2018 “State of Enterprise AI” survey—The top 3 challenges with AI were implementation issues, integrating AI into the company’s roles and functions, and data issues—all factors involved in large-scale deployment.

In short, AI has not yet achieved much return on investment. It has yet to substantially improve the lives of workers, the productivity and performance of organizations, or the effective functions of societies. It is capable of doing all these things, but is being held back from its potential impact by a series of factors I will describe below.

What’s Holding AI Back
I’ll describe the factors that are preventing AI from having a substantial return in terms of the letters of our new organization: the ROAI Institute. Although it primarily stands for “return on artificial intelligence,” it also works to describe the missing or critical ingredients for a successful return:


Reengineering
Organization and Culture
Algorithms and Data
Investment


Reengineering—The business process reengineering movement of the 1980s and early 90s, in which I wrote the first article and book (admittedly by only a few weeks in both cases) described an opportunity for substantial change in broad business processes based on the capabilities of information technology. Then the technology catalyst was enterprise systems and the Internet; now it’s artificial intelligence and business analytics.
There is a great opportunity—thus far only rarely pursued—to redesign business processes and tasks around AI. Since AI thus far is a relatively narrow technology, task redesign is more feasible now, and essential if organizations are to derive value from AI. Process and task design has become a question of what machines will do vs. what tasks are best suited to humans.
We are not condemned to narrow task redesign forever, however. Combinations of multiple AI technologies can lead to change in entire “end to end” processes—new product and service development, customer service, order management, “procure to pay,” and the like.
Organizations need to embrace this new form of reengineering while avoiding the problems that derailed the movement in the past; I called it “The Fad that Forgot People.” Forgetting people, and their interactions with AI, would also lead to the derailing of AI technology as a vehicle for positive change.
Organization and Culture—AI is the child of big data and analytics, and is likely to be subject to the same organization and culture issues as the parent. Unfortunately, there are plenty of survey results suggesting that firms are struggling to achieve data-driven cultures.
The 2019 NewVantage Partners survey of large U.S. firms I cite above found that only 31.0% of companies say they are data-driven. This number has declined from 37.1% in 2017 and 32.4% in 2018. 28% said in 2019 that they have a “data culture.” 77% reported that business adoption of big data and AI initiatives remains a major challenge. Executives cited multiple factors (organizational alignment, agility, resistance), with 95% stemming from cultural challenges (people and process), and only 5% relating to technology.
A 2019 Deloitte survey of US executives on their perspectives on analytical insights found that most executives—63%—do not believe their companies are analytics-driven. 37% say their companies are either “analytical competitors” (10%) or “analytical companies” (27%). 67% of executives say they are not comfortable accessing or using data from their tools and resources; even 37% of companies with strong data-driven cultures express discomfort.
The absence of a data-driven culture affects AI as much as any technology. It means that the company and its leaders are unlikely to be motivated or knowledgeable about AI, and hence unlikely to build the necessary AI capabilities to succeed. Even if AI applications are successfully developed, they may not be broadly implemented or adopted by users. In addition to culture, AI systems may be a poor fit with an organization for reasons of organizational structure, strategy, or badly-executed change management. In short, the organizational and cultural dimension is critical for any firm seeking to achieve return on AI.
Algorithms and Data—Algorithms are, of course, the key technical feature of most AI systems—at least those based on machine learning. And it’s impossible to separate data from algorithms, since machine learning algorithms learn from data. In fact, the greatest impediment to effective algorithms is insufficient, poor quality, or unlabeled data. Other algorithm-related challenges for AI implementation include:


Transparency—many machine learning algorithms are not transparent or understandable to human observers. This is particularly true for deep learning algorithms, which may have thousands of abstract features or variables. Lack of transparency may mean lack of trust—by users, executive sponsors, regulators, consumers, and other stakeholders.
Bias—algorithms can be biased against particular groups or individuals. Algorithmic bias is most often derived from biased datasets or samples.
Algorithms may simply be poorly designed, i.e., they don’t fit the data well, they overfit the data, they violate assumptions of statistical distributions, and so forth.
Algorithms may be poorly managed, i.e., it may not clear by whom or for what purpose they were created, they may have drifted (lost fit to the data) over time without being updated, etc.


Investment—One key driver of lack of return from AI is the simple failure to invest enough. Survey data suggest most companies don’t invest much yet, and I mentioned one above suggesting that investment levels have peaked in many large firms. And the issue is not just the level of investment, but also how the investments are being managed. Few companies are demanding ROI analysis both before and after implementation; they apparently view AI as experimental, even though the most common version of it (supervised machine learning) has been available for over fifty years. The same companies may not plan for increased investment at the deployment stage—typically one or two orders of magnitude more than a pilot—only focusing on pre-deployment AI applications.
Of course, with any technology it can be difficult to attribute revenue or profit gains to the application. Smart companies seek intermediate measures of effectiveness, including user behavior changes, task performance, process changes, and so forth—that would precede improvements in financial outcomes. But it’s rare for these to be measured by companies either.
A Program of Research and Structured Action
Along with several other veterans of big data and AI, I am forming the Return on AI Institute, which will carry out programs of research and structured action, including surveys, case studies, workshops, methodologies, and guidelines for projects and programs. The ROAI Institute is a benefit corporation that will be supported by companies and organizations who desire to get more value out of their AI investments
Our focus will be less on AI technology—-though technological breakthroughs and trends will be considered for their potential to improve returns—and more on the factors defined in this article that improve deployment, organizational change, and financial and social returns. We will focus on the important social dimension of AI in our work as well—is it improving work or the quality of life, solving social or healthcare problems, or making government bodies more responsive? Those types of benefits will be described in our work in addition to the financial ones.
Our research and recommendations will address topics such as:


What is the most feasible way to evaluate AI investments?
How should companies address potential job losses from AI?
When companies have achieved substantial financial returns from AI, how have they gone about it?
How can companies create a pipeline for AI projects that increases the likelihood of production deployment?
What are some approaches to making deep learning algorithms more transparent?
What steps have organizations taken to make their cultures more receptive to AI?


Please contact me at tdavenport@babson.edu if you care about these issues with regard to your own organization and are interested in approaches to them. AI is a powerful and potentially beneficial technology, but its benefits won’t be realized without considerable attention to ROAI.

From its epicenter in China, the novel coronavirus has spread to infect 414,179 people and cause no less than 18,440 deaths in at least 160 countries across a three-month span from January 2020 till date. These figures are according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Situation report as of March 25th. Accompanying the tragic loss of life that the virus has caused is the impact to the global economy, which has reeled from the effects of the pandemic.Due to the lockdown measures imposed by several governments, economic activity has slowed around the world, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has stated that the global economy could be hit by its worst growth rate since 2009. The OECD have alerted that the growth rate could be as slow as 2.4%, potentially dragging many countries into recession. COVID-19 has, in a short period of time, emerged as one of the biggest challenges to face the 21st century world. Further complicating the response to this challenge are the grey areas surrounding the virus itself, in terms of its spread and how to treat it.Related: We're In This Together: Business Resources, Offers, And More For MENA Entrepreneurs To Get Through The Coronavirus Pandemic



As research details emerge, the data pool grows exponentially, beyond the capacity of human intelligence alone to handle. Artificial intelligence (AI) is adept at identifying patterns from big data, and this piece will elucidate how it has become one of humanity's ace cards in handling this crisis. Using China as a case-study, China's success with AI as a crisis management tool demonstrates its utility, and justifies the financial investment the technology has required to evolve over the last few years.Advancements in AI application such as natural language processing, speech recognition, data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and others such as chatbots and facial recognition have not only been utilized for diagnosis but also for contact tracing and vaccine development. AI has no doubt aided the control of the COVID-19 pandemic and helped to curb its worst effects.


Related: Here's What Your Business Should Focus On As It Navigates The Coronavirus PandemicSpurred by China's gains in this area, other nations can unite to share expertise in order to expand AI's current capability and ensure that AI can replicate its role in helping China deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic. AI has been deployed in several ways so far, and the following are just seven of the ways in which AI has been applied as a measure to solve the pandemic:1. DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AI With an infectious disease like COVID-19, surveillance is crucial. Human activity -especially migration- has been responsible for the spread of the virus around the world. Canada based BlueDot has leveraged machine learning and natural language processing to track, recognize, and report the spread of the virus quicker than the World Health Organization and the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the near and distant future, technology like this may be used to predict zoonotic infection risk to humans considering variables such as climate change and human activity. The combined analysis of personal, clinical, travel and social data including family history and lifestyle habits obtained from sources like social media would enable more accurate and precise predictions of individual risk profiles and healthcare results. While concerns may exist about the potential infringement to civil liberties of individuals, policy regulations that other AI applications have faced will ensure that this technology is used responsibly.2. VIRTUAL HEALTHCARE ASSISTANTS (CHATBOTS) The number of COVID-19 cases has shown that healthcare systems and response measures can be overwhelmed. Canada-based Stallion.AI has leveraged its natural language processing capabilities to build a multi-lingual virtual healthcare agent that can answer questions related to COVID-19, provide reliable information and clear guidelines, recommend protection measures, check and monitor symptoms, and advise individuals whether they need hospital screening or self-isolation at their homes.

DIAGNOSTIC AI Immediate diagnosis means that response measures such as quarantine can be employed quickly to curb further spread of the infection. An impediment to rapid diagnosis is the relative shortage of clinical expertise required to interpret diagnostic results due to the volume of cases. AI has improved diagnostic time in the COVID-19 crisis through technology such as that developed by LinkingMed, a Beijing-based oncology data platform and medical data analysis company. Pneumonia, a common complication of COVID-19 infection, can now be diagnosed from analysis of a CT scan in less than sixty seconds with accuracy as high as 92% and a recall rate of 97% on test data sets. This was made possible by an open-source AI model that analyzed CT images and not only identified lesions but also quantified in terms of number, volume and proportion. This platform, novel in China, was powered by Paddle Paddle, Baidu's open-source deep learning platform.4. FACIAL RECOGNITION AND FEVER DETECTOR AI Thermal cameras have been used for some time now for detecting people with fever. The drawback to the technology is the need for a human operator. Now, however, cameras possessing AI-based multisensory technology have been deployed in airports, hospitals, nursing homes, etc. The technology automatically detects individuals with fever and tracks their movements, recognize their faces, and detect whether the person is wearing a face mask.5. INTELLIGENT DRONES & ROBOTS The public deployment of drones and robots has been accelerated due to the strict social distancing measures required to contain the virus' spread. To ensure compliance, some drones are used to track individuals not using facemasks in public, while others are used to broadcast information to larger audiences and also disinfect public spaces. MicroMultiCopter, a Shenzhen-based technology company, has helped to lessen the virus transmission risk involved with city-wide transport of medical samples and quarantine materials through the deployment of their drones. Patient care, without risk to healthcare workers, has also benefited as robots are used for food and medication delivery. The role of room cleaning and sterilization of isolation wards has also been filled by robots. Catering-industry centred Pudu Technology have extended their reach to the healthcare sector by deploying their robots in over 40 hospitals for these purposes. 


Related: How Managers Can Weather The Impact Of The Coronavirus Pandemic On Their Businesses6. CURATIVE RESEARCH AI Part of what has troubled the scientific community is the absence of a definitive cure for the virus. AI can potentially be a game changer as companies such as the British startup, Exscienta, has shown. Earlier this year, they became the first company to present an AI designed drug molecule that has gone to human trials. A year is all it took the algorithm to develop the molecular structure compared with the five-year average time that it takes traditional research methods.In the same vein, AI can lead the charge for the development of antibodies and vaccines for the novel coronavirus, either entirely designed from scratch or through drug repurposing. For instance, using its AlphaFold system, Google's AI company, DeepMind, is creating structure models of proteins that have been linked with the virus in a bid to aid the science world's comprehension of the virus. Although the results have not been experimentally verified, it represents a step in the right direction.7. INFORMATION VERIFICATION AI The uncertainty of the pandemic has unavoidably resulted in the propagation of myths on social media platforms. While no quantitative assessment has been done to evaluate how much misinformation is out there already, it is certainly a significant figure. Technology giants like Google and Facebook are battling to combat the waves of conspiracy theories, phishing, misinformation and malware. A search for coronavirus/COVID-19 yields an alert sign coupled with links to verified sources of information. YouTube, on the other hand, directly links users to the WHO and similar credible organizations for information. Videos that misinform are scoured for and taken down as soon as they are uploaded.


While the world continues to grapple with the effects of COVID-19, positives can be drawn from the expertise and bravery of healthcare workers, as well as the complementary efforts of AI technology to their endeavors in the above listed ways. As the AI world partners with other sectors for solutions, the light at the end of this tunnel shines brighter, creating the much-needed hope the world needs in these uncertain times.

      UNICEF Innovation Fund Graduate: Afinidata
  

      Using artificial intelligence to provide parents with personalized early childhood education activities
  

Andreana Castellanos, CEO, Afinidata





 









UNICEF/UNI281099/Herwig

















31 March 2020







The UNICEF Innovation Fund is proud to see portfolio member, Afinidata, graduate. They’ve come a long way – from numerous product iterations to deep diving into understanding their ecosystem better, strengthening their business model, and gearing up to take their solution to market. They’re now ready to collaborate at a larger scale – as they find new pathways to work with partners, investors, and the open source community. 

Existing early-childhood education options, such as daycare or private tutors, are often expensive and difficult to scale. There is a large gap for effective, easy-to-access educational tools that are inclusive with lower income families. Imagine if each parent had their own virtual tutor for free to help them provide adequate early-childhood education (ECE) to their children. 
Afinidata uses artificial intelligence to provide parents with a personal assistant that guides them with personalized and effortless early-childhood activities, delivered directly into messaging apps they already use to communicate with family and friends and without requiring any new downloads. 
The past twelve months was one the most impactful years in Afinidata history. After receiving investment from the UNICEF Innovation Fund, our company growth was incredible, changing the path for Afinidata and for the families that use our Virtual Tutor ‘Afini’.
To date we have:

Reached 45,000 families in 10 months.
Delivered over 600,000 educational sessions 
Developed a unique machine learning algorithm with 24% higher usage rate compared to similar applications. 
Formed strategic partnerships with academia Harvard, Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute.

Challenges
The biggest challenges our team faced were user growth sustainability, improved support service to retain users and acquire new ones. All this, while simultaneously testing new functionalities and business models. Also, we didn’t know how to track the Virtual Tutor’s impact. We knew we were reaching families, but how do we retain them? Were we really helping them? Were we giving the solution they were looking for?
These problems were real, and we faced them by tracking little flaws until they were solved. We also expanded our team to make sure specialized people were working on specific problems, bringing solutions and innovation to Afinidata.
Tracking Impact
From the beginning of our development process  we decided to focus on how to track impact by creating a three stage plan.
Phase one - Engagement: we knew we had to engage with parents, persuading them to try Afinidata. If that didn’t happen, we lost. We had to create a relevant solution adapted to their lifestyle that kept them connected with us.
For this, we designed multiple interviews and user tests to discover pains and gains, and worked with parents who already used the Virtual Tutor. Through intense user research, we improved on functionalities, created a solution that doesn’t tell parents what to do, but instead strengthened our relationship with them, making them feel heard so we could later use technology to guide them and give them the best recommendation.
After several iterations, our algorithm and user experience has increased up to 24% more usage rate against other solutions that suggest generic content or based only on child's age and not personalized.

Selva, 2, engages in supervised play-based learning at the Torore centre, a UNICEF-supported Early Childhood Development (ECD) programme.











Phase two - Child’s development through self-reporting milestones: we asked parents to report to us the milestones their child had already achieved using this to create better and personalized content suggestions and to track the Virtual Tutor’s impact on child’s development.
The feedback we have received from parents using Afinidata has been particularly encouraging:




“Afinidata gives me the best activities so I can spend time with my baby. I like it because they’re easy and creative.”
Luisa Hernandez, Parent



“Great activities. I can spend time with my baby while stimulating his brain.”
Karilyn Fuente, Parent and Afinidata user

She’s a “digital worker” created by IPsoft, which develops AI-powered enterprise technology designed to automate repetitive tasks and enable companies to scale their customer service operations. IBM defines a digital worker as “software-based labor that can independently execute meaningful parts of complex, end-to-end processes using multiple skills.” When onboarding new employees, for example, Amelia navigates the process using eight different skills, which include the ability to update payroll information, distribute personalized FAQ documents and manage email addresses.
 
Meet Amelia. Photo via IPsoft.“We’re seeing increased integration between human and digital employees in the workplace to drive positive experiences and outcomes for all of an organization’s stakeholders — customers, partners, employees and shareholders alike,” IPsoft CEO and Founder Chetan Dube said in a recent company press release.
Dube has reason to be bullish on the future prospects of digital workers. A recent IDC study estimates that the contributions of digital workers to the global workforce will grow by 50 percent over the next two years. In addition to administrative work, the study also estimates an uptick in digital workers performing tasks that require reasoning, decision-making skills and the evaluation of information.
IPsoft is getting a jump on this expected surge in demand with DigitalWorkforce.ai, a marketplace for digital workers that launched in February. We spoke with Marie Angselius, global head of communications for IPsoft, about the marketplace and the capabilities of its digital workers, which, yes, all go by the name “Amelia.”
 
Will AI Replace Jobs? Yes, but It Will Also Create Them.Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work 
Marie AngseliusCan you talk about the origins of DigitalWorkforce.ai? When did IPsoft decide to build a marketplace for digital workers, and did the project change or evolve over time?
In 2018, IPsoft launched the embryo of a marketplace based on Amelia’s extensive experience. This was the first off-the-shelf marketplace for AI solutions specifically designed for the banking, telecom, hospitality, insurance and healthcare industries. Back then, our marketplace primarily had reusable components that served to help kick-start projects, which meant our customers still had to do additional work. Our marketplace has since evolved into a full-fledged store where users can browse, interview and onboard digital workers.
 
DigitalWorkforce.ai offers two kinds of digital workers: one that fills the role of an IT service-desk engineer and another that serves as an HR coordinator. What can these “employees” do?
The world of work is changing dramatically, and digital employees will play a key role in helping small businesses run smoothly by managing repetitive requests and processes in the background, like collecting expense reports, troubleshooting equipment and configuring devices. In the future, we’ll also see business owners employ digital employees in a variety of vertical roles, and in the next five years the volume and complexity of tasks that digital workers can handle will only become more impressive and more transformational.
 
These digital workers come with a set of skills out of the box, but they also have the ability to learn on the job. How exactly does that work in practice?
Amelia V4 introduces a new level of end-to-end learning. Previously, building new end-to-end skills had several manual steps including back-end integrations. IPsoft defines these end-to-end processes as those that start with an individual requesting assistance and continuing through conversation to a front- or back-office employee, who then accesses one or more applications to resolve the request. Amelia can observe that entire process and synchronize all the parts into a coherent flow to build an automation which can perform this task without any human involvement.
 
In addition to HR and IT digital workers, IPsoft just rolled out a “COVID-19 assistant.” How exactly does this application work?
IPsoft recently announced the launch of a free digital employee to help screen for indicators of the novel coronavirus. This interactive screening solution was released as a service to communities seeking clear, authoritative information on symptoms and risks. While engaged in conversation, Amelia will assess a user based on their current symptoms and potential risk factors, leveraging the latest information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. 
As more American cities restrict movement, the new Amelia aims to provide the general public, as well as vulnerable populations, with accurate and on-demand information about COVID-19 with no risk of exposure. This version of Amelia also aims to relieve the hospitals, clinics, physicians’ offices and medical care centers from fielding non-urgent questions related to COVID-19.
 
Gartner estimates that 25 percent of digital workers will use virtual employee assistants by 2021. How will DigitalWorkforce.ai evolve to meet this increased need?
According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2018, 133 million new roles may emerge that will be adapted to the new division of labor between humans, machines and algorithms. With DigitalWorkforce.ai, the market moves closer to IPsoft’s vision of a symbiotic digital-human workforce, giving companies the ability to fully harness the potential ROI in AI.

A new social music app is pushing the boundaries of music creation by making recording artists out of novices with little to no musical training or traditional talent.
Voisey allows users to choose from a library of beats from around the world, submitted to the Voisey website by producers, and sing their own lyrics and melodies over them. Their vocals are run through in-app vocal effects including auto-tune. The app is designed to make anyone sound like a star.
In 2019 alone, 350,000 original songs were created on Voisey, says co-founder Olly Barnes. Today, the app is live on Apple’s operating system in 22 countries. Producers, singer-songwriters and even average music fans can create professional-sounding, 60-second songs with collaborators from all over the world.
Production and distribution
While Spotify and other streaming platforms allow anyone to share their existing music with the world, Voisey takes it a step further by giving anyone with the app the ability to record and distribute a song on the platform in just minutes.
“I just write the song, I’m like, OK, I put that out … now I’m back to homework,” says Voisey user and Spanish artist, Ana Mancebo, who is currently working towards her bachelor’s degree in business in the United States. “You can pretty much make anyone sound like an artist.”

Making music is innately human and it’s certainly nice for anyone to be able to create it. But these companies aren’t totally altruistic; they are money-making ventures, just like Spotify. 
Voisey doesn’t disclose their user base, but as of January 2020, downloads of the app were growing 60 per cent week on week   — all organic growth, without ads, according to Barnes. The music industry has its eyes and ears on Voisey too   — the producing duo Stargate invested in the app in 2019.
Democratizing pop
Voisey is an app that allows anyone to be a star. The app takes cues from TikTok — users can easily swipe through videos, like, comment and share — but the focus is on writing and producing original music. According to Barnes, 91 per cent of the songs on Voisey are originals. 
Currently, the Voisey app is not monetized — creators are not paid for their content and the company isn’t paid for their service. But a vast catalogue of original music — and people looking for fame — can certainly be lucrative.
And Barnes has big plans for monetization. 
“If we’re where music talent will crystalize for the first time, should we not see if we can help people bypass the traditional machine?” says Barnes. 
He believes that much of the new music created on Voisey will be from first-timers who don’t yet have a music publisher and aren’t yet registered with performing rights organizations (the agencies that collect royalties on broadcast and performed music on behalf of the artists). The company is working on a program to non-exclusively administer music rights for some users on the platform. This means they could potentially take a fee.
Of course, it has been argued that streaming royalties aren’t enough. In the 2010s, streaming services were lauded for democratizing music and bringing back revenue to record labels. Now, as we enter a new decade, it’s becoming clear that this democratization has also created a revenue stream for music streaming services. 
In 2018, Spotify partnered with Distrokid, which charges $19.99 per year per artist to upload unlimited albums and songs to streaming services. And now, Spotify is rolling out paid promotion. There is money to be made from people who want to be artists.
Pay-to-play features
Rights administration is only a small part of Voisey’s monetization strategy. The company is not currently disclosing the model, but Barnes says that it’s inspired by “top-tier mobile games,” and while the core experience will be free, they will charge for an “enhanced” experience. 
Could this include charging creators for certain vocal effects? Or for more than a certain number of songs each month? Or for distribution on streaming platforms? 
Another new music creation technology, Boomy, is already doing some of the things that Voisey might aspire to. 
Boomy helps users make music with artificial intelligence. Users choose from various musical themes and genres, click a button, wait for the artificial intelligence to work its magic and decide if they like what they hear. If they don’t, they can just click “try again” and have something new created for them with the same theme or genre. 
They can also choose to edit, which allows them to make simple changes like drag and drop sections of the song or change the tempo. More than 400,000 tracks have been created using Boomy, according to the counter on its website. 
According to Boomy’s website, with a free account, a user has access to limited downloads, saves and features, and can create and release one single to streaming services. But to unlock more features and increase downloads and saves, a user can sign up for plans from US$2.99 to $9.99 per month.
And 70 per cent of Boomy users have never created a song before using the service, says Alex Mitchell, CEO of Boomy. But for a fee, Boomy will distribute the music they create and help them earn royalties from streams. 



Hundreds of thousands of songs have been recorded and uploaded to music production apps and websites; the ability to monetize this could disrupt the pop music industry.

“There’s an explosion in the streaming music environment, there’s a ton of royalties that are going to be flowing into the music business   …. We want to make sure that you can take advantage of that growth, even if you are somebody who traditionally has not had access to music education, music resources,” says Mitchell. 
Mitchell says that on average, royalties are around US$50 to $100 for the last couple of months.
Not too shabby for the creator, for as little as $2.99 per month and a few clicks-worth of their time. And not too shabby for Boomy, which in addition to upgrades, also takes a percentage of royalties from free users. 
There is certainly still money to be made in the music business, but it remains to be seen if it is for the users of new music technologies, the companies behind those music technologies, traditional music business stakeholders or a combination of these.

[+] seriously. His pioneering work laid the foundation for the fields of digital computing and AI as we know them today.Heritage Images/Getty Images
In the most direct sense, artificial intelligence is an engineering challenge. The mathematics underlying today’s cutting-edge AI algorithms is complex. The amount of computing resources required to train state-of-the-art AI models is formidable. AI is driving a whole new generation of R&D innovation in silicon.


Yet the field of artificial intelligence reaches far beyond engineering. By promising widespread automation, AI prompts fundamental questions about how we want to organize our economy and society. The pursuit of AI brings us face to face with basic, intimate questions about consciousness, intelligence, creativity: in short, what it means to be human.

Anyone hoping to get her arms around what artificial intelligence will mean for the world in the twenty-first century must engage with questions and perspectives from across engineering, psychology, economics, sociology, and philosophy.

PROMOTED
Below we present a selection of quotes on these topics from many of the world’s greatest thinkers. The hope is that these quotes will help illuminate the scope of the field, the contours of the challenges ahead, and the enormity of the stakes.

“The ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life give the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.”

—Attributed to John von Neumann, 1958 (the first known use of the word “singularity” in the context of technological progress)

“For more than 250 years the fundamental drivers of economic growth have been technological innovations. The most important of these are what economists call general-purpose technologies — a category that includes the steam engine, electricity, and the internal combustion engine. The most important general-purpose technology of our era is artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning.”
—Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, 2018

“Nobody phrases it this way, but I think that artificial intelligence is almost a humanities discipline. It is really an attempt to understand human intelligence and human cognition.”
—Sebastian Thrun, 2013

“The hardest problems we have to face do not come from philosophical questions about whether brains are machines or not. There is not the slightest reason to doubt that brains are anything other than machines with enormous numbers of parts that work in perfect accord with physical laws. As far as anyone can tell, our minds are merely complex processes. The serious problems come from our having had so little experience with machines of such complexity that we are not yet prepared to think effectively about them.”
—Marvin Minsky, 1986

“If the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn't.”
—Attributed to Emerson M. Pugh, 1977

“Some people worry that artificial intelligence will make us feel inferior, but then, anybody in his right mind should have an inferiority complex every time he looks at a flower.”
—Alan Kay

“The human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines’ decisions. As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more of their decisions for them, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made ones. Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently. At that stage the machines will be in effective control.”
—Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber), 1995

“In the literal sense, the programmed computer understands what the car or the adding machine understand: namely, exactly nothing.”
—John Searle, 1980

“It is customary to offer a grain of comfort, in the form of a statement that some peculiarly human characteristic could never be imitated by a machine. I cannot offer any such comfort, for I believe that no such bounds can be set.”
—Alan Turing, 1951

“How do you know that when I speak to you, what you call ‘thinking’ is going on inside me? The Turing test is a fantastic probe — something like a particle accelerator in physics. Just as in physics, when you want to understand what is going on at an atomic or subatomic level, since you can’t see it directly, you scatter accelerated particles off the target in question and observe their behavior. From this you infer the internal nature of the target. The Turing test extends this idea to the mind. It treats the mind as a ‘target’ that is not directly visible but whose structure can be deduced more abstractly. By ‘scattering’ questions off a target mind, you learn about its internal workings, just as in physics.”
—Douglas Hofstadter, 1981

“Artificial intelligence is one of the most profound things we're working on as humanity. It is more profound than fire or electricity.”

We are implementing a leading, cutting-edge Facial Recognition system for access control at the campus and student residences. The safety of students and staff is one of our top priorities and we would like to ensure that there are stricter controls at the entrances of the campus to ensure that only authorised members gain access. Over the years, we have had criminal incidences and we aim to reduce these incidences to zero by implementing the facial recognition system. This exciting project was named #YourFaceIsTheKey upon kick-off in 2019. Only each individual’s face will gain them access to the campus and residences. We are not removing the current card reader functionality, but as an additional security measure, individual’s faces will be scanned and validated. If individuals are swiping a card, but the scanned profile does not match the profile of the scanned student or staff card, access will be denied. We will share more information and a demonstration on how the system will work in the coming weeks. The system will apply to all students, service workers, administrative staff and management. We will also accommodate other stakeholders like school learners, some members of the community as well as contractors who enter the campus for once-off or regular project work. We started with student registration earlier this year, along with the issuing of student cards. To date, we have registered just over 12 000 students in preparation for the new system. If you have not registered yet, please visit the registration desk upon your next visit to the campus later in April. All student registrations will be shut down during the COVID-19 21-day lockdown period (26 March – 16 April). We will continue to share updates via email, on our Facebook page and on the website. We also have a radio advert playing on a regular basis, so please tell your fellow staff, students and friends to listen closely for news about the project. We plan to have exciting awareness days where more information about the project, will be shared. Availability of more information on the awareness days will be determined by the progress of the current COVID-19 status. We are very proud of this achievement. The implementation of this project will not only enable us to provide our staff and students at UNIVEN with a safer work and learning environment, but we will also be the first university in Africa to implement Facial Recognition for Access Control. We have the opportunity to be the leaders in technology and to lead fellow universities and institutions by example, and we are extremely proud of this. The success of this project not only depends on the IT, Campus Security and Installation teams, but it also depends on the staff members and students of UNIVEN. We need you to support us in our efforts to create a safe working and learning environment. Safety starts with YOU. Safety starts with ME. For more information, please contact Mr Sam Khoza, Director of the Department of Information and Communication Technology at 015 962 8102 / 072 249 1288 or email to sam.khoza@univen.ac.za Issued by: Department of Communications & Marketing University of Venda Tel: (015) 962 8525 Date: 27 March 2020    Share    Tweet            Share        Messenger         Whatsapp        Email          Print Related:  General Regulations –  Admission, Registration and Examination of Students  Department of Business Information Systems – Faculty of Management, Commerce and Law",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ARTIFICIAL Intelligence (AI) is the wave of the future. This area of computer science emphasising the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans is heavily influencing and taking over the way we get on with daily life.Artificial Intelligence is revolutionising industries and improving the way business is conducted. More importantly, it is revolutionising industries and improving the way business is done, being already widely used in applications including automation, data analytics and natural language processing. On a bigger spectrum, from self-driving cars to voice-initiated mobile phones and computer-controlled robots, the presence of AI is seen and felt almost everywhere. As more industries shift towards embracing the science of incorporating human intelligence in machines so the latter can function, think and work like humans, the demand for human capital with the relevant skill and expertise correspondingly increases.

 As such, the question is, how do engineering students ride this wave and make the most of it? AI has a high learning curve but the rewards of a career in AI far outweigh the investment of time and energy. Unlike most conventional careers, AI is still in its infancy stage although several modern nations have fully embraced the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Taking this into account, UCSI University has taken the initiative to develop the Bachelor of Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) programme. The nation’s best private university for two years in a row, according to the two recent QS World University Rankings exercises, proactively defines its own AI curriculum to offer educational content that can help increase the supply of AI engineers with job-ready graduates and real world experiences. The AI programme at UCSI consists of a number of specialisations and several overlapping disciplines, including mathematical and statistical methods, computer sciences and other AI core subjects to provide a conceptual framework in providing solutions for real-world engineering problems. The first two years covers core theoretical knowledge such as mathematics and statistics, algorithm design and computer programming, as well as electrical and electronics. Students will progress to the AI subfields by selecting the specialisation elective tracks covering emerging areas such as machine learning, decision-making and robotics, perception and language and human-AI interaction, among others.‘We aim to nurture the new generation workforce with the right skills set and knowledge on smart technologies to accelerate Malaysia’s transformation into a smart and modern manufacturing system, ’ says Ang. UCSI Faculty of Engineering, Technology and Built Environment dean Asst Prof Ts Dr Ang Chun Kit pointed out that AI was “unavoidably” the way forward. “We aim to nurture the new generation workforce with the right skills set and knowledge on smart technologies to accelerate Malaysia’s transformation into a smart and modern manufacturing system. “This programme was developed with a vision to provide the foundation for future growth in producing more complex and high-value products for industry sectors in Malaysia, ” he said. Leading the faculty in which 46 of its members have PhDs, Ang emphasised the university focuses on research attachment abroad and has established partnerships with key industry players. The faculty also stands out in terms of receiving grants to advance high impact projects. Students from the faculty are also annually selected for researches at world-renowned universities such as Imperial College London and Tsinghua University. The faculty also strives to give students field experience through internships at various top companies. An example would be Harry Hoon Jian Wen, an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student. He was selected to go to the University of Queensland for a research attachment while also successfully completing his internship at Schneider Electric.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked renewed fears regarding the future of work. One widely discussed solution to this perceived problem is a universal basic income (UBI), provoking debates about the justice, efficiency and political feasibility of such an entitlement, whether such an income should be conditional, and how to ensure that it mitigates rather than exacerbates gender  as well as other inequalities. Leaving aside the question of whether AI will destroy more jobs than it creates, it is important to consider the future of work within the context of the broader struggle over the kind of political and economic settlement that will replace the neo-liberal consensus that has held sway since the 1980s. This model is currently in crisis, having entered what Abby Innes terms its ‘Brezhnevite’ phase of terminal decay, a notable symptom of which is the wave of right-wing nationalism sweeping the globe. If UBI policies are ever implemented they will likely form part of a wider settlement and encompass other transformations such as a green new deal. Since women’s interests are so often confined to the sidelines in such transformations, it is crucial to ensure that UBI proposals are developed using a gender lens.
Two prominent recent basic income proposals illustrate the frequent lack of such a perspective. Thomas Piketty’s Capital and Ideology offers an ambitious new analysis of the drivers of economic development, concluding with a section suggesting ‘elements for a participatory socialism’ – that is, his proposed route beyond the current crisis. In common with radical programmes of the twentieth century (for example, in revolutionary Russia and Germany in 1968), gender inequality and its implications for emancipatory politics are neglected in this analysis. Thus, Piketty’s discussion of the basic income and its potential contribution to securing a more just society does not examine the implications for the gender distribution of unpaid caring and household labour. Indeed, it does not mention gender at all. His basic income appears directed towards a genderless, universal citizen.
Meanwhile, Daniel Susskind’s detailed analysis of the consequences of A World Without Work argues that basic income should be conditional. Susskind displays more interest in gender than Piketty. He acknowledges, for example, that caring and household labour is largely performed on an unpaid basis, predominantly by women, with the combined value of cooking, childcare, laundry and other household chores performed in the UK annually estimated to be approximately £800 billion. Susskind stresses that such work, though crucial to society, is currently undervalued and that a conditional basic income (CBI) would provide “an opportunity to repair this mismatch.” But given that he devotes a whole book to analysing the issue, it is interesting that Susskind does not mention the potential of a basic income to challenge the gendered structures that leave women with the lion’s share of the currently unpaid burden of reproductive labour.
Nevertheless, Susskind’s idea of a conditional basic income does at least potentially address a key question that many analyses of the basic income ignore, that is, as Nancy Folbre asks, does the putative ‘Malibu surfer’ of UBI debates get the same income as the care-worn housewife? (Susskind’s implied answer is that the surfer would have to do some voluntary work as a condition of receiving income). Another solution is provided by Almaz Zelleke who argues that one way of compensating caring labour within the framework of a basic income would be to give it to children as well as adults, as occurs with the cash transfers from the Alaska Permanent Fund. This would provide additional income to those who provide childcare. This does not address all issues, such as the fact that disabled adults and children will likely require a higher level of income. Nevertheless, it highlights the kind of thinking required.
Yet, as is the case with Susskind, discussions of the UBI rarely engage with the potential of such income to challenge the resiliently gendered division of paid and unpaid labour. An exception is Kathy Week’s book The Problem of Work, a feminist analysis of ‘postwork imaginaries,’ which considers the potential of basic incomes to ‘de-centre’ paid work, as well as to disrupt the division of reproductive and productive work and its associated gendered strictures. That is, a basic income offers an opportunity to de-gender breadwinning, domestic labour and care giving by allowing individuals to organise paid work around their lives rather than vice versa. As Weeks stresses, however, such potential can only be realised if feminist perspectives are included in basic income debates.
Such a gendered approach is important for two reasons. First, as Nancy Fraser argues, the current crisis is multi-dimensional: it encompasses ecological, social and economic issues, including skyrocketing inequality. An often-overlooked element is the crisis of care resulting from a shift away from the male breadwinner model which relied on the unpaid caring labour of women. The rise in female employment has brought women vital gains such as economic independence and opportunities for personal development, but since there has been neither a gender redistribution of caring labour nor a socialisation of care work, it has created a ‘care gap’ that manifests itself in rising stress, as well as divisions between those who can afford to pay for care and those who cannot. As noted above, designed in the right way a basic income could begin to address this.
Second, in the current period of crisis gender politics are frequently ‘weaponised’ by right-wing nationalists who construct feminists as alien ‘others’ with interests antithetical to those of the ‘people,’ as if women were not part of that mythical body of homogenous citizens.  Such arguments have found resonance against a background of rising inequality and economic insecurity in which men in dominant ethnic groups fear a loss of status both within the labour market and in the domestic sphere where the challenge to male breadwinning threatens their primacy. Such politics has resulted in attempts to roll back women’s advances in particular through attacks on their reproductive rights. This highlights the need for any new settlement to develop gender solidarity by emphasising the potential gains for both men and women in eschewing constraining gender strictures. Again, a basic income could help to forge such solidarity, as part of a ‘gender new deal.’
Fear is currently trumping hope across much of the world.  It will not be easy to secure a change in political direction. The first step is to provide a positive and compelling vision of the future. It is therefore essential to develop the intellectual basis for a new settlement to address the pressing economic, ecological and social challenges of our troubled era. Debates about the basic income form part of that groundwork and must be informed by a gender perspective.

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), while data science is the discipline of data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. Here's how each works - and how they work together

Machine learning (ML) and data science are often mentioned in the same breath – and for good reason. The two complement each other. However, understanding how they work – and work together – is important.
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to self-learn from data and apply that learning without human intervention. Data science, on the other hand, is the discipline of data cleansing, preparation, and analysis.
[ Check out our quick-scan primer on 10 key artificial intelligence terms for IT and business leaders: Cheat sheet: AI glossary. ]
""At its core, data science is a field of practice and machine learning is a set of tools and methodologies.""
“At its core, data science is a field of practice and machine learning is a set of tools and methodologies,” says JP Baritugo, director at business transformation and outsourcing consultancy Pace Harmon. “Data science uses a broad array of expertise, business knowledge, tools, and methodologies to process big data to generate meaningful insights that drive actions and enable impactful business outcomes.”
Why machine learning demands data science
Effective ML demands good data science. “A data scientist’s expertise is absolutely required to ensure machine learning is used and deployed properly,” Baritugo says. The data scientist may ensure the model is provided with the requisite amount of cleaned and normalized datasets for training and that the right algorithms are used based on the datasets and the business question to be addressed.
""A data scientist’s expertise is absolutely required to ensure machine learning is used and deployed properly."" 
However, data science can be applied outside the realm of machine learning. “Data science is the practical application of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning – along with data preparation – in a business context,” says Ingo Mierswa, founder and president of data science platform RapidMiner.
“While the goal of data science is to extract insights from data, predict future developments, and suggest actions – sometimes even performing those actions automatically – this is achieved with tools like AI and ML,” Mierswa says.
At a basic level, a data scientist gathers and prepares data sets from multiple sources and then applies some capability to extract insight from them. In some cases, they may reach for machine learning. In others, a more basic analysis may make sense. “In my view at least, data science is just the manipulation of data,” says Wayne Butterfield, director of cognitive automation and innovation at ISG.
When to use machine learning
Machine learning excels at extracting data patterns.
When facing a situation in which a solution is hidden in a large volume of data, machine learning is your friend. “ML excels at processing that data, extracting patterns from it in a fraction the time a human would take, and producing otherwise inaccessible insight,” Mierswa says.
For example, machine learning (informed by data science) powers risk analysis, fraud detection, and portfolio management in financial services; GPS-based predictions in travel; and product and content recommendations for Amazon and Netflix.
Machine learning is best matched with problems for which large amounts of well labelled historical data already exist, or for which data can be simulated very quickly. “There isn’t much mileage in using ML if you don’t have enough existing data that it can train on,” says Butterfield.
ML models are only as good as the quality of the data they learn from. “Luckily, there are many types of problems for which lots of data exist,” says Timothy Havens, the William and Gloria Jackson Associate Professor of Computer Systems in the College of Computing at Michigan Technological University and director of the Institute of Computing and Cybersystems
“Certain problems lend themselves to ML very well,” Butterfield explains. Data science (minus machine learning) has been applied to forecasting and planning for years with limited accuracy, for example. “However, now because you can now build complex algorithms that can take into account multiple data sources – such as weather, historic sickness patterns, external events, past demand – you get a much more accurate forecast,” Butterfield says. “And this isn’t just on a daily basis, it can be hourly too.”
In financial services, machine learning and data science can power solutions for fraud prevention.
In financial services, ML and data science can power solutions for underwriting and fraud prevention. In IT, they can improve network management. Healthcare organizations can apply them to improve diagnostic accuracy, determine optimal price and volume mix, or predict patient outcomes. In customer experience management, they come together to improve customer interactions, predict customer lifetime value, and estimate churn. Retailers can tap them to forecast demand, optimize pricing, and segment customers. In manufacturing, data science and ML can be used to automate the supply chain and improve planning.
When data science is enough
With all the excitement around AI, every business problem can start to look like an opportunity to throw a little machine learning at it. However, there remain many instances in which ML may not work – or could be overkill.
Sometimes, data science is enough. “It is difficult to distinctly separate data science and ML since boundaries are blurry. At the end of the day, most of the algorithms use statistical techniques,” says Anil Vijayan, Vice President at Everest Group. “Not every problem requires AI to solve though. In many cases, using “traditional” data science may not just suffice, but also be more efficient.”

Traditional data science techniques (no ML required) may be more effective in scenarios in which the output is dependent on relatively few parameters, and those parameters do not change much over time, Vijayan says. In addition, when the relationship between the output and the parameters are well understood and not likely to shift, Vijayan adds, data science alone will suffice.

Gender balance in AI conference line-ups has been noticeably poor. But women in AI exist and their work is multifaceted and extraordinary.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the hot ticket in tech at the moment. Unfortunately, too many events and conferences delving into the subject, and its related disciplines of machine learning (ML) and data science, feature few women – if at all – among their speakers.
To prove it doesn’t have to be like this, and as a follow-on from International Women’s Day, we at Silicon Republic have found 20 terrific women in AI, ML and data science who we think should be turning up in speaker line-ups across the country (and around the world).

Alessandra Sala
Alessandra Sala is head of analytics research at Nokia Bell Labs and technology advisory board member at CeADAR, Ireland’s Centre for Applied AI. She’s also the chief ambassador of Women in AI Ireland.
Women in AI is a non-profit working towards gender-inclusive AI for the benefit of global society. The group’s most recent Dublin meet-up took place at Trinity Business School and posed challenging questions around ethically driven AI design.

An active, visible and well-connected member of Ireland’s AI community, Sala’s research at Nokia Bell Labs focuses on distributed algorithms and complexity analysis with an emphasis on graph algorithms and privacy issues in large-scale networks.
Gillian Armstrong
Gillian Armstrong is a proven dab hand at tech events, having co-organised AI Con in Belfast in late 2019 as well as ServerlessDays Belfast at the beginning of this year.

— Gillian Armstrong (@virtualgill) January 24, 2020

A solutions architect with Liberty IT where she is helping to bring machine learning and serverless systems to the world of enterprise, Armstrong was recently named a global AWS Machine Learning Hero.
She is most excited by applied AI and exploring how software engineers and data scientists can work closer together with the right tools. She’s also passionate about ethical AI and human-centred design, and eagerly shares what she learns with others online and off.
Sarah Jarvis
Head of data science at Prowler, Sarah Jarvis was named among Re-Work’s 30 influential women advancing AI last year. She spoke last summer at CogX, the festival of AI and emerging technology, about building “a principled decision-based AI system” at the Cambridge-based company.

Prowler is building a platform that allows for complex decision-making in environments such as smart cities, logistics businesses and interconnected financial systems. Jarvis believes the future of tech-enabled decision-making will have to be instantaneous but also scalable and transmittable. She also believes there needs to be trust and, for that to happen, those who build AI need to be able to explain the how and why behind their tech’s decisions.
Jennifer Cruise
Head of data science at the Aon Centre for Innovation and Analytics in Dublin, Jennifer Cruise believes she’s in the “most exciting” industry for delving into data, and it’s true that insurance has deep roots in the history of analytics.

She has performed research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is an honors graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a Master’s candidate in Biotechnology at Johns Hopkins University. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  eCommerce is a bustling segment of the retail industry representing an estimated $102.7 billion or 8.3 percent of total U.S. retail sales in 2016. Total retail trade was approximated at 5.9 percent of the national GDP in 2016. As digital transactions become the standard method of purchasing goods and services, leading eCommerce firms are exploring how AI can enhance brand competitiveness and customer loyalty. To gauge the impact of AI among leading eCommerce firms across the globe, we researched this sector in depth to help answer questions business leaders are asking today, including: What types of AI applications are currently in use by leading eCommerce firms such as Amazon and eBay? What tangible results have been reported on AI applications implemented by leading eCcommerce firms?  Are there any common trends among their innovation efforts – and how could these trends affect the future of eCommerce? This article aims to present a comprehensive look at the four leading eCommerce firms and their use of AI based on 2016 sales revenue sourced from company financial reports. By the time you’re done reading this article, you’ll have a strong sense of clarity about the current and future applications of AI for online shopping. Before we begin exploring each company, we’ll present the common patterns that emerged throughout our research in this sector. Artificial Intelligence in eCommerce – Insights Up Front The most popular AI applications from the top four industry leaders currently using AI appear to be:  Chatbots/AI assistants: Responding to customer inquiries, responding to voice commands for simple tasks and providing product recommendations through interactions using natural language (see Alibaba and eBay below) Smart logistics: Machine learning algorithms are being applied to data to help automate warehouse operations. (see JD.com below). Recommendation engines: Companies are analyzing customer behavior on their websites and using algorithms to predict what products may appeal to customers and provide recommendations. (see Amazon below). In the full article below, we’ll explore the AI applications of each eCommerce firm individually. We will begin with Amazon, the #1 ranking eCommerce firm based on 2016 sales revenue. Amazon Machine learning – Recommendation Engine Alexa, which has become a household name, is one of Amazon’s more visible AI applications. However, one of the company’s most lucrative applications of AI is less apparent and more integral to its operations.  Machine learning drives the algorithms which are core to Amazon’s targeted marketing strategy, allowing the company to predict what products will most likely interest customers and to provide customized recommendations based on customer searches. It has been estimated that Amazon’s recommendation engine drives 35 percent of total sales.  Automation and Robotics – Amazon Robotics and Prime Air Automation also plays a central role in the evolution of the industry leader’s approach to warehouse operations. After Amazon’s estimated $775 million acquisition of warehouse robot manufacturer Kiva Systems, Inc (now Amazon Robotics) back in 2012, to date, the company has a reported 100,000 robots in operation across its warehouse locations worldwide. An emerging application is the company’s Prime Air delivery drones. The effort to improve delivery efficiency and reduce shipping cost is particularly relevant for the leading eCommerce firm. According the company’s 2016 annual report, from 2014 to 2016, Amazon’s net product shipping costs steadily increased from approximately $4.2 billion to $7.2 billion. Shipping costs are categorized under “cost of sales” which represented 70.5 percent and 64.9 percent of total operating expenses, in 2014 and 2016. In December 2016, Prime Air was launched in a private trail in the United Kingdom. Amazon claims the drone successfully delivered its first 5 lbs package within 30 minutes. It is estimated that Amazon once peaked at 26 million online item purchases in a single day.  The pilot started with just two customers and is expected gradually expand to more customers over time in other countries including the U.S. Current government restrictions on the use of drones may pose challenges to deploying Prime Air in the U.S. The company is reportedly in working with regulatory agencies both in the U.S. and other countries to expand Prime Air.    “At Amazon, we’ve been engaged in the practical application of machine learning for many years now. Some of this work is highly visible: our autonomous Prime Air delivery drones; the Amazon Go convenience store that uses machine vision to eliminate checkout lines; and Alexa, our cloud-based AI assistant. But much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface. Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more. Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type – quietly but meaningfully improving core operations.” – Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO, Letter to Shareholders (2016) (For readers with a strong interest in drone applications, refer to our article on drone delivery, and our other article on commercial drone regulations.) Deep learning – Amazon Go Amazon Go is an emerging initiative which is part of the company’s heavier push into the grocery industry, evidenced by the estimated $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market. The company claims that it leverages deep learning combined with computer vision and sensor technologies to track “when products are taken from or returned to the shelves.” Products are tracked in a virtual cart and customers are charged via their Amazon accounts.  This process would eliminate the need for a traditional check-out system. Currently one Amazon Go store is in operation at Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle, Washington which opened in December 2016. However, an innovative initiative of this kind is not without its challenges.  In March 2017 it was reported that the system experienced technical difficulties processing and tracking payments for more than approximately 20 customers at one time. As Amazon works to improve its model, the ideal customer capacity for this technology may require a smaller store design and a certain number of human staff on site to monitor operations and provide tech support.   JD.com Automation and Robotics – Warehouse logistics In 2016, reports circulated that Beijing-based JD.com engaged in a strategic partnership with Siasun Robot & Automation Co Ltd. The purpose of the collaboration was to use automation technology, such as robots, to improve warehouse operations. Ideally, this system would improve the speed and efficiency of product sorting and delivery in warehouses, thereby cutting costs and ultimately increasing revenue.   As of May 2016, JD.com had reportedly established seven logistics centers responsible for operating 209 warehouses throughout China such as its automated logistics and warehouse complex in Gu’an China.  Reports claim that the number of online orders hit a total of 1.26 billion in 2015 (double the amount of orders in 2014) and approximately 85 percent of those orders were delivered within two days.  It is possible that the logistics centers improved the company’s capacity to process orders and product shipment speed, however, this was not specifically confirmed by the aforementioned reports.  In July 2017, Richard Liu, founder and CEO of Beijing-based JD.com, stated that AI is a necessary component of the company’s business strategy going forward. The company reportedly aims to use AI to reduce the number of JD.com employees from approximately 120,000 to 80,000 over a decade and significantly increase its profit margin. According to reports, November 2018 is the company’s target date for the debut of its “first unmanned warehouse” and AI and robots will be responsible for handling jobs related to “parcel sorting, packaging and categorization.” “Why must JD.com use AI and robots today? It is because we have exhausted all traditional technology and methods to improve retail costs and bring efficiency to its maximum potential. This is not because we like to follow a hot trend. This is our only choice to achieve another critical breakthrough in efficiency maximization.” – Richard Liu, CEO (July 2017) AI Assistant – LingLong DingDong Yeah that’s the legit name of the device. Legit. Moving on with the rest of the article now: While the product name may not allude to a bold statement at first glance, JD.com is looking to compete with Amazon Echo with its own home speaker technology. The LingLong DingDong, which essentially performs the same functions as the Echo, currently responds to natural language commands in Mandarin and Cantonese.  Priced at approximately $118 per unit JD.com offers its product at a reduced price point compared to the Echo which averages about $180 per unit. Below is a brief description of JD’s smart speaker, with some context on the Chinese smart speaker market:  Smart home technology in the Chinese market is projected to reach $28.8 billion by 2018. Alibaba AI assistants – Tmall Genie and Ali Assistant In June 2016, it was reported that Alibaba hired former Amazon senior principal scientist Ren Xiaofeng to lead its AI efforts. The move signals a concerted effort to enhance its competitive edge against the leading eCommerce firm. During his four years at Amazon, Xiaofeng states that he played an instrumental role in building the framework for Amazon Go.  The company’s efforts to compete with Amazon are also apparent in the launch of Tmall Genie, a very similar product to the Amazon Echo. The voice activated AI assistant debuted in July 2017 and is sold for less than its U.S. counterparts at 499 yuan (approximately $73.42).  Tmall Genie performs tasks, such as controlling smart-home devices, checking the weather or a user’s daily schedule. Currently the device is only available in China and is programmed to received commands in the Mandarin language. If Tmall Genie is successful, time will tell if and when Alibaba will attempt to expand its market reach beyond China. CNBC reported on Alibaba’s Amazon Echo competitor in July 2017:   Alibaba’s AI assistant technology also found in the Ali Assistant, a customer service chatbot that processes both written and spoken inquiries. The chatbot reportedly processes 95 percent of customer inquiries.  Machine learning – Recommendation engine Alibaba claims that AI algorithms are helping to drive internal and customer service operations including smart product and search recommendations: Alibaba’s software tracks customer browsing and interactions with the website to offer product recommendations. (For more insight on AI algorithms, read our full guide titled ‘Artificial Intelligence Algorithms and Their Business Applications’.) Machine learning – Smart logistics Through the company’s logistics affiliate Cainiao, AI is used to help map the most efficient delivery routes. Alibaba claims that smart logistics have resulted in a 10 percent reduction in vehicle use and a 30 percent reduction in travel distances. In March 2016, Alibaba invested 10 billion yuan (approximately $1.53 billion) in the Cainiao Network for roughly 47 percent equity interest in the company. eBay AI assistant – eBay Shopbot As a successful early competitor in the field of eCommerce, the company is looking to use AI to maintain consumer interest and a competitive edge. The eBay Shopbot, a chatbot accessed through the Facebook messenger platform was first piloted in October 2016.  The bot functions as an AI assistant to help users easily find products of interest using natural language. Users can communicate with the bot via text, voice or using pictures taken with their smartphone of images related to a particular product. A screen shot of eBay’s ShopBot – Source: ebayinc.com There is a lack of published evidence to substantiate whether the chatbot has proven to be a significant driver of revenue for the company. However, there is evidence to suggest that machine learning is an integral component of eBay’s business strategy.  “We apply machine learning techniques to item-to-product matching, price prediction and item categorization tasks on eBay. We also employ them for attribute extraction, generating the proper names of browse nodes, filtering product reviews and more. Machine learning helps us optimize the relevance of shoppers’ search and navigation experiences.” – Selcuk Kopru, eBay Research Scientist (August 2016) Two out of six of eBay’s acquisitions in 2016, Salespredict and Expertmaker, were companies with platforms built using AI.  “What AI is going to do is accelerate the pivot from simple clustering around inventory, to combining intelligence about individuals, behaviors, trends, and context…We recently acquired Expertmaker – a company that has created an advanced AI platform enabling optimization and automation. We currently expect to apply their technology across our platform, to help improve shipping and delivery times, trust, pricing, and more.” – Devin Wenig, eBay President and CEO, May 2016 Concluding Thoughts on Artificial Intelligence in eCommerce AI is emerging in the eCommerce segment of the retail industry and is being applied across multiple areas including processing customer service inquires, product packaging and delivery, and internal operations.  The economic impact of eCommerce must also be considered as some firms anticipate reducing their number of employees in favor of increased efficiency and cost savings. While a certain degree of job losses may be inevitable, research findings published in a 2017 report by the Progressive Policy Institute suggest that from 2007 to 2016 eCommerce produced 355,000 jobs while 51,000 jobs were lost in the general retail sector. Emerj’s research on the retail industry at-large has revealed an important trend that is also applicable in the eCommerce sector: Applications that have the highest likelihood of broader retail adoption are those that have a direct, hard-line return on investment. Therefore, smart logistics and recommendation engines are poised to continue to bring value to to companies investing in these technologies and are proving profitable for industry leaders such as Amazon.com. In Emerj’s interview with eBay’s chief data officer Zoher Karu, Karu suggests that small and mid-sized businesses should organize their data around their customers in order to gain real business value.  Karu posits that the majority of businesses typically organize data in other ways such as by region, country or channel. As a result this often leaves gaps in gaining a thorough understanding of the customer perspective. Examples of customer-centric data include customer type, highest value customers and customer purchasing frequency.  We will continue to monitor how the eCommerce sector evolves as we anticipate the field will continue to be impacted by AI over time.   Header image credit: HerCampus.com Related Posts Big Data Analytics in eCommerce - Data Platforms and Artificial IntelligenceDigitally-native eCommerce businesses are used to working with their customer data in order to write… Artificial Intelligence Initiatives at India’s Top IT Services FirmsTo stay competitive and relevant in the fast-changing world led by digital, India’s leading IT… Artificial Intelligence at the Top Medical Device CompaniesPredictive and prescriptive analytics seem to be the most common types of AI applications at… Artificial Intelligence at the Top 5 US Defense ContractorswikiMany of the pivotal technologies utilized by the public today have their roots in military… Artificial Intelligence at Wells Fargo - A Brief OverviewWells Fargo has begun a number of AI initiatives, some they've created in-house and some… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.

Imagine you run a bakery. So you want to know every morning how much bread to bake. For this, you use historical data, which you collect before, like:Predicting by just date is hardly feasible, but you notice that your demand depends on:weather conditions (in cold or rainy weather, fewer people go outside for purchases)month (in summer, your customers go on holidays)day of the week (as you are closed on Sundays, people buy more before and after)some events in the neighbourhood (imagine your bakery is close to a football stadium)So you add columns with values for every day. You call the column you’re predicting the “target” and the columns you’re using for predictions the “features”.The questionSo you give your data to a guy who calls him/herself a data scientist and ask them to create something for predicting the demand — the data scientist calls this the “model”. You can imagine a model to be a decision tree which will be created by an algorithm using your data. After the model is delivered, you need to know if you can trust it (blindly) and use the predictions in your daily work.To answer this question, we focus on the methodical part and consider the model itself to be a black box. This should give guidance to QA, managers, developers and infrastructure people who need to ensure the quality of software which uses AI. I’m convinced that an understanding of QA and common sense are sufficient prerequisites for this if you learn the playbook of how AI models are developed. You don’t need to take additional classes in math, statistics or deep learning.I also want to provide ideas and best practices for data scientists, as they often have to ensure the quality of the data and models by themselves. Especially if your experience comes primarily from ML classes, research or Kaggle challenges, which cover only a part of the model lifecycle, you may be interested in additional QA techniques needed when working in the industry.AI model lifecycleFrom a lifecycle perspective, AI projects usually involve 3 stages:collecting and preparing datatraining the modeldeploying the model in production for making predictions, monitoring the modelThus, QA performs different checks or reviews depending on stage:Is the data which will be used for model training of sufficient quality? This is the topic of this blog post.Is the built model which goes live of sufficient quality? That will be the topic of the next post.Does the model keep delivering sufficient quality when running in production? I will deal with that in the last post in this series.Some QA steps come down to a check comparing a metric of your data or model to a predefined value or threshold. Others are rather analyses or reviews, requiring time, manual effort, domain knowledge and common sense.On automationThe chance that you won’t need to retrain your model once it is live, even if the approach and the tools stay the same, is close to zero. Apart from technological changes and new requirements, there are some reasons specific to AI:You are likely to get more or higher-quality data later. As data amount and quality is what gives you the main edge in AI, you won’t let this chance slip.If your challenge is about predictions, you need data from today/this week/this month to predict something for tomorrow/next week/next month. So you need to retrain the model with recent data.As time goes by, the world changes, and with it the reality your model used to reflect well a time ago. Think about estimating house prices and the changing real estate market.Users of your system will most likely find conditions under which your model makes wrong decisions. Especially if your system is worth cheating (such as the automatic processing of insurance claims), expect bad guys who will try it. So you need to adapt your model to eliminate or at least reduce the impact.The frequency of model updating depends on the use case and may range from hours to years. This frequency has a heavy impact on the level of automation you need for the flow from raw data to the new production-stage model. You can implement this automation in different ways which is a separate topic not considered here. But, in any case, you must provide the same level of automation for QA checks. This way, you make QA an unavoidable step properly integrated in the model development process.Imagine you have a nightly running script flow which collects data from different sources, starts the model training, builds the service with the new model and replaces the old version of this service. In this case, checks for data and model quality must be scripts running as part of your flow and raising a red flag if defined conditions are not met.Detecting data collection errorsIn very rare cases like our small bakery, all the data used in a model may come from a single source. For companies which are at least middle-sized, the data which is useful for predictions may be spread over multiple systems. In an average e-commerce company, the CRM knows about customer’s demographic data, the payment system about their buying behaviour, the web tracking system knows what they search for, the inventory system knows about the product you offer, and in addition, you want to use weather data from an external service. So most of the data takes a non-trivial multistep path before data science touches it. Whether that path involves manual operations or is fully automated with ETL tools — something can go wrong. And source systems may contain errors as well. So we need a set of “entrance checks” before training the model.Let us assume the data collection run is complete (we consider it to be a black box, leaving the details to data engineers) and you have a freshly updated table with customers or a folder with images.The easiest types of checks are statistics-based. Once the data collection process is implemented, verify the correctness of final results manually, i.e. by tracking selected entries in the source and target system (if your data engineering colleagues already did this, you’re lucky). Once that is verified, count entities which are important for model training (accounts, images, customer reviews, audio files). Introduce thresholds as to how many of them must be available to assume that data collection worked without major errors.Consider calculating further statistics which should not change significantly for your data in the long term: how your accounts are distributed by gender, what is the average review length, what is the most frequent image type, etc. For every statistic, define a threshold or range which will be validated before model training.You may want to know how many records (at least as an order of magnitude) are sufficient to train a good enough model. It’s hardly possible to get this number just out of problem description and data. Let’s judge the accuracy of the model after training; we will address that in the next blog post.Detecting data quality issuesAs next step think if you really want to use all available records in your model. Entries you will most likely fix or get rid of before training the model are:duplicatesentries created for testingentries with a wrong date entered unintentionally (like a birth year 1897, instead of 1987)entries covering use cases your model should not serve (like corporate accounts if you want a model for personal accounts only)Perform some exploratory data analysis. For every column/feature used in your model, you should know what exactly it means and what values it can take. Maybe a piece of documentation will be around, maybe it will be up-to-date. But don’t assume everything to be correct and aligned with documentation.For numeric columns like “age”, build a histogram. For categorical columns like “education”, list all possible values. To discover duplicates, check the uniqueness of technical keys and maybe also of some set of features (like the name and address for a customer).Another, more advanced way to discover strange records is “anomaly detection.” Imagine a customer who is 21 years old, has a PhD and 10 years of work experience. All the 3 data points are fine in themselves, but their combination is very unlikely; we can assume somebody just entered the wrong age. Discovering anomalies like this is a pure machine learning topic with a lot of great papers about it.Searching for explanationIf your data landscape is old enough, you likely discover a lot of issues. For some of them the explanation will be easy to find or obvious — but most likely not for all the issues. A lot of questions like “a record with this date looks strange, should I fix it or filter it out or leave it as it is?” will remain, and the only way I know is to get up from your chair and go ask some questions. Good candidates to ask are:colleagues who work with edge cases: customer support, operationscolleagues with a good knowledge of how the system will be used: customer support (again), QAcolleagues who just have been in the company for a long timeFixing data quality issuesWe just briefly touch upon this topic as it is mostly about data science and less about QA. Once you discover an issue, consider addressing it at its origin — a duplicate user record should be fixed directly in the CRM, a wrong aggregation of payments must be repaired in the ETL part. But you still should assume upstream systems as having data issues (one will be fixed but another will arise by implementing a new feature), and have checks and/or fixes for them.If the issue has an explanation but is not repairable (in the short term), which is often the case, you should fix it in order to prevent an impact of wrong data on your model. The fix is usually aboutfiltering out the record: you can e.g. remove duplicates by IDenriching missing data points from another source: e.g., missing gender can be guessed by looking up the first name in a dictionaryimputing missing data point: i.e. if age is missing use median age of the data setIn any case, cleaning every data issue is not mandatory for proceeding; a subset of your data may do for training as well. So fix first the issues which are (1) about important features (2) occur frequently and (3) easy to fix — and then train your model candidate. If it won’t show sufficient quality, you can go after harder issues.What’s nextNow we’re done with QA for the dataset and can proceed with building a model. QA for models will be the topic of our next post.Image from Biodiversity Heritage Library",,https://towardsdatascience.com/quality-assurance-for-artificial-intelligence-d935fc6b238,,,2020-03-08T22:57:35.119Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,d935fc6b238,['Michael Perlin'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's How Including Artificial Intelligence in a Business Can Bolster the Productivity of a Team (infographic)

Artificial Intelligence, AI, is rapidly growing; especially in a working environment. However, the current state of our AI means that we can work alongside it in harmony.

AI is often seen in sci-fi movies. We’re watching these movies on our screens thinking “that is such a lifetime away from us, I won’t be around to see robots and hovercrafts” when in reality, it’s amongst us now. But, with how fast technology is growing, is that really a shock?

The question that you’re all asking yourself is “will AI replace my job?” and the answer is no. As it currently stands, AI has been formed in order to improve your life, rather than hinder it. What we’re seeing in current releases, is AI that will boost productivity and help you to effectively manage a workforce and the day-to-day running of your business.

By implementing AI into your business, you’ll improve the mental health of your staff, and give your workforce more space to breathe which, without AI, they wouldn’t have. It’s ironic but by introducing AI into your business, you actually make it more human.

As it stands, only 23% of businesses have incorporated AI into their day-to-day working life. Over the next 5 years, Forbes has estimated that AI in the workplace is expected to grow by a massive 50%.

Adzooma understands the importance of a healthy workforce and wants to demonstrate how including AI in a business can bolster the productivity of a team. They have done some extensive research into AI within the workplace and have created the visual below to show you how AI can be utilized.

How AI Will Improve Your Recruitment Process
Artificial Intelligence can be implemented into your recruitment process to take the long-winded initial stages out of your hands. When you begin your recruitment process, one of your first major tasks is to whittle down your list of potential candidates. If you’re doing this yourself, you’ll lose a lot of time that you could have spent doing something else. Or, if you’re working with a recruitment agency, they’ll do this for you. The downside to this is that recruitment agencies aren’t cheap.

AI tools such as Pymetrics assess candidates based on their emotional and cognitive characteristics and pair them up to your business and your current employees. While finding a knowledgeable candidate is essential, you also want them to fit into your business and become a great part of the workforce.

By implementing Pymetrics into your recruitment strategy, it’s estimated that your staff retention will increase by 50%, and it’ll take 75% less of your time to recruit someone.

Give AI Your Long, Boring Jobs
We all have tasks to do that we really don’t want to. Not because they’re difficult, but because they’re boring and time-consuming. And, when we don’t want to do something, our productivity takes a deep dive. We put it off and put it off until we can no longer get away with not doing it. Or, we push through it with paying little attention; this is often where mistakes will be made.

The main area where AI will improve your team’s productivity is by taking over your admin tasks. We understand how scary this sounds for Administrators, but actually, it’s known that by 2030, job growth will soar and those Administrators will be transitioned into a higher-skilled role.

There are many benefits to implementing AI into your workforce:

The accuracy of the work will vastly improve as no human errors will occur.
If an employee is doing a mundane task, they’ll get bored. This means that the task will take longer to complete as their productivity will freefall. A machine won’t get bored.
AI can carry out numerous tasks and make millions of decisions all at the same time. This means the speed of execution will skyrocket.
We all like to think that we’re not biased, but the majority of humans will cast judgement at some point in their working life. A machine has no thoughts or feelings and can, therefore, carry out tasks unbiased.
As humans, if we overwork ourselves, we’ll burn out. With a machine, burn out is eliminated. Not to mention they don’t need to take breaks or nip off to have lunch.


So, what jobs should succumb to AI?
We aren’t suggesting that you should fire everybody and hand over all your work to an AI system. We’re saying that maybe you should think about improving the productivity in your workforce by implementing an AI system that’ll take away boring daily tasks. It’s both productive and profitable.

As an example, here are some tasks that would benefit from having an AI system in place:

Data Analysing
Data analysing is a very long-winded task that consists of gathering and analysing large quantities of data. This data is used to spot trends and highlight opportunities where a business can target its customers to improve the turnover of their business.

Since 2010, there has been a 344% increase in the need for data scientists within a business; what with all the eCommerce websites and social media accounts. However, a data scientist can set a company back a tremendous amount of money. On average, the salary of a data scientist is $130,000 per year.

Deloitte’s LaborWise is an AI system that does your data analysing for you. It collects data from your website and uses analytics to identify trends, roadblocks, areas in the business that are spending a lot of money, and departments within the business that are understaffed.

Demand Forecasting
Demand forecasting is an integral part of an eCommerce business. In order to maintain correct stock levels, monitor supply disruptions, and predict changes in product demand, forecasting needs to be done effectively; incorrect forecasting can have disastrous outcomes.

Implementing an AI system to handle forecasting for the business is estimated to reduce errors within the supply chain by 50%.

Administration
An AI system to carry out administrative tasks is a great place to start if you’re thinking about implementing AI in the workplace. Again, this isn’t to replace Administrators, it’s simply to lighten the workload and remove any long-winded tasks; opening up your Administrators to carry out more important tasks.

Here are a few AI tools that will help lighten the load:

X.ai - This AI tool collates all of your calendars and figures out when the best time is for you to conduct, or be a part of, a meeting. Whether that’s with your work colleagues or a client.

Otter.ai - An AI tool that takes away the task of minute writing. Otter.ai has a microphone which listens to voices and creates detailed notes. It’s great for meetings, interviews and board meetings, where you wouldn’t want to miss out on any important details.

Spoke - Spoke is a very clever AI system that is incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to every HR-related. By asking the system a HR-related question, Spoke will produce the answer quickly. Users can ask Spoke questions across multiple channels such as text, email, Slack or web browser. If it can’t find the appropriate answer, the AI system will send the question off to the most appropriate person within your team, such as the HR manager.

Skype Translator - This is probably the most known form of AI systems - a real-time translator. Skype Translator has a microphone and speaker system, where users can speak or type their sentence into the tool, and Skype Translator will then translate the text into the desired language. It’s great for worldwide communications.

MobileMonkey - MobileMonkey is another AI system that you may be familiar with. MobileMonkey is a tool that’s plugged into your website. It’s essentially a trained chatbot that will answer customer queries. If the chatbot can’t find the correct answer, the message will automatically be fed through to a human.

Marketing
The main market for AI systems is digital marketing. Advances in technology mean that digital marketing agencies can personalise their products, offers, and services and target consumers more effectively than ever before.

Google recently launched machine learning algorithms which embrace artificial intelligence. Google’s algorithms consist of NLP or Natural Language Processing for SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) and Smart Bidding for paid advertising.

Training with AI
There are a handful of AI systems that have developed in recent years that help businesses train their staff. Whether staff need a refresher course in a specific tool or you’re teaching new staff the general rules and guidelines of the business. Here are two of our favourite on-site AI training systems:

Chorus - is a great tool for sales representatives. This AI system is plugged into your phone lines and listens and records calls. Chorus also offers its users tips during their calls, and in real-time. This piece of technology is sure to remove the need for training and allows the employees to learn at their own pace.

Cogito - is a similar phone system, however, it listens out for your tone, the words that you’re using and your approach with the person that you’re talking to. It’s all about mindfulness with this system. Cogito will listen to your phone conversations and give you tips as you’re talking, telling you to slow down if nerves have got the better of you and you’re speaking too quickly.

The Future of AI
We understand the concerns of implementing AI in the workplace. As humans, we want to be needed, and having our jobs taken from us by a robot, is all but slightly embarrassing. With how our technology is forming, the future of AI is set to ensure that staff are efficient, productive and are putting their time to better use. Who knows what career paths this could open for us?

Artificial intelligence would detect hate speech and offensive words on social media and then encourage users to reconsider their posts as part of a new system that gives two Daniel High School students a chance to work alongside Clemson University researchers.
The system, HateDefender, is in its early stages, but the idea is to prevent the spread of hate speech on social media without resorting to censorship.
Roger Hu is a Daniel High School student who is working with Clemson University professors and graduate students to detect hate speech on social media.
Researchers are wrapping up the first version of their system as the run-up to the U.S. presidential election inspires a fresh wave of venomous attacks. About four in 10 Americans have personally experienced online harassment and 63% consider it a major problem, according to a 2017 report from the Pew Research Center.
Once HateDefender is up and running, a social-media user who posts objectionable material would receive a warning that points out which words were potentially insulting. It would be up to users to decide whether to edit their comments.
“Too much censorship is not generally acceptable by users,” said Nishant Vishwamitra, a Ph.D. student who is working on the project. “Sometimes we need to explain the problem and at the same time give social networks the freedom to continue operating.”
If adopted, HateDefender would be embedded on social media sites. Users wouldn’t have to download an additional app or plug-in for it to function.
The team found that HateDefender accurately detects hate speech 90.82% of the time and offensive language 89.1% of the time.
Feng Luo is overseeing the creation of HateDefender.
The team has developed a new way of detecting hate speech and offensive language based on pronunciation. Researchers found that much of the speech they were targeting contained spelling and lexical errors that created “noise,” making it harder for the computer to detect.
What also makes HateDefender stand out is the educational opportunity it presents to Daniel High students, which includes Roger Hu, who is working alongside professors and graduate students to create the system.
Hu, a junior, said he helped write papers, made graphs with data sets, labeled hate words and helped write code. It’s a unique experience that he plans to use throughout life.
“When I go to college, I want to major in computer science,” he said. “Because I’m interested in AI, I want to learn more advanced techniques in such an emerging area.”
The project is overseen by Professor Feng Luo from Clemson’s School of Computing.
The idea to focus on hate speech came from Matthew Costello, an assistant professor of sociology at Clemson.  He approached Luo after conducting research into the online habits that lead people to come into contact with hate and become targets of hate. He also researched how people respond to hate. 
“I had the idea that it would be great to auto-detect hate speech and then potentially block it, if people were interested in trying to block it,” Costello said. “Dr. Luo has the skills to do that.”
Amy Apon, the C. Tycho Howle Director of the School of Computing, said the project underscores the growing role of computing in a wide range of research, including in the social sciences. 
“Working across disciplines and departments is becoming increasingly important,” she said. “Artificial intelligence and other advanced techniques are opening new doors for scientific discovery and helping create new products and services. HateDefender is a great example of a team effort that addresses a real-world problem while creating a unique educational experience.”
HateDefender and the method for detecting hate speech are detailed in two papers the team plans to present at an Association for Computing Machinery workshop and conference. Co-authors on both papers are Hu, Dorris, Vishwamitra, Luo, and Costello.
“I think it’s a huge experience for high school students,” Luo said. “They are learning what research is about and how to write a meaningful paper for publication. It helps establish an interest in research and gives them confidence that they can do it.”
The names of the papers are, “Towards Automatic Detection and Explanation of Hate Speech and Offensive Language” and “On the Impact of Word Representation in Hate Speech and Offensive Language Detection and Explanation.” 
HateDefender is the latest artificial intelligence research to come from Luo, who invites about two or three high school students to work as interns each summer.
Luo’s team has applied some of the same artificial intelligence techniques to create BullyDefender, an app designed to counteract visual cyberbullying.

  Our summer article talked about the judgment of the Beijing Film Law Firm v Baidu Network Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter Film and Baidu) made by Beijing Internet Court and discussed in detail whether AI-created works are copyrightable or not. In the judgment, it was held that, only when a piece of work possessed ingenuity in itself and was created by a natural person, could it be deemed as a ""work"" in the sense of the Copyright Law and be protected as such. Since the figures in the article involved in the case were created by AI software instead of a natural person, they could not be protected under the Copyright Law; however, the text portion of the article could be protected. 
  Recently, the Shenzhen Nanshan District Court (hereinafter Nanshan Court) issued a new judgment for the copyright infringement dispute between Shenzhen Tencent Computer System Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Tencent Corporation) and Shanghai Yingxun Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter Yingxun Corporation). In this judgment, Nanshan Court advanced the judgment of the Beijing Internet Court and determined copyright infringement for AI-created works. This judgment provided new thought around copyright protection of AI-created works. 
  Dreamwriter was an intelligent writing assistance system based on big data and algorithms, and was developed by Tencent. Tencent had used the Dreamwriter intelligent writing assistant to create about 300,000 articles per year. One of the articles created by the Dreamwriter was a financial report (hereinafter involved article) entitled Noon Review: Shanghai Index Slightly Rise by 0.11% and Closed at 2691.93 points, Leading Sectors including Telecommunication Operation, Oil Exploration, etc. The involved article was first published on the ""finance-stock"" website of Tencent, with the signature ""this article was automatically written by Tencent Robot Dreamwriter"" at the end of the article. Yingxun Corporation copied the involved article and re-published it on its website the Home of Internet Loan, without the permission of Tencent Company. 
  Based on the above facts, the Nanshan Court pinpointed two focuses of dispute: firstly, whether AI-related works could be works under the Copyright Law and secondly, whether Tencent Corporation, which hosts the creation of the involved article, is entitled to be a copyright owner. 
  Regarding the first issue, the Nanshan Court held that the involved article was generated by the staff of the Tencent team using Dreamwriter software, and met the formality requirements for a piece of literary work. Its content reflected the selection, analysis and judgment of relevant stock market information and data the morning of that day. The article possessed ingenuity in view of its structure and expression. The involved article should come from the personal choices and arrangements of the creators, and the Dreamwriter software was a tool used by the creators during the creation. It satisfied the protection requirements for literary works under the Copyright Law, and thus should be protected as such. 
  Regarding the second issue, the Nanshan Court held that the involved article was created by the Tencent team with intelligence and labour. It reflected the demand and intention of Tencent Corporation for finance-stock review articles, and thus it was a piece of legal-person-created work of Tencent Corporation. 
  This judgment was the first one which explicitly confirmed the protection of AI-created works under the Copyright Law. This judgment acknowledged the contribution of human intellectual labour in the process of generating AI-created works, and protected some AI-related works which met certain requirements of the Copyright Law. It will definitely encourage people to create AI-related works and urge the dissemination of AI-related works. 
  However, some copyright issues connected to AI-related works are still left open in the judgment. 
  Firstly, the judgment fails to provide a standard for determining copyrightable AI-created works. 
  Specifically, this judgment acknowledged the ingenuity of the ""involved article"", and deemed that it originated from the personal choices and arrangements of the creators. Therefore, the judgment held the involved article was copyrightable. The judgment tried to provide copyright protection for some AI-related works involving human participation in the generation of the AI-created works, but failed to discuss how to determine such human participation. For example, what will happen if the human participation occurs in the process of designing or developing AI software, such as in the process of collecting data or materials for the learning of machines, or creating AI models or constructing knowledge graphs? What will happen if the human participation occurs in the process of using an AI software, such as entering keywords to generate works using AI tools as in the case of Film v Baidu? 
  AI technologies are increasingly involved in applications and significantly reduce human participation. It should be clarified to what degree human participation can make a piece of AI-created work still eligible for copyright protection. 
  In addition, the judgment left a blank as to how to determine a copyright owner of AI-created works. In this case, Tencent Corporation was not only the designer of the AI system but also its user. It is therefore easy to determine that Tencent Corporation was the copyright owner. However, in most cases, a designer of the AI system and a user of such an AI system will be different. The user uses the AI system as a tool to generate a piece of work. It will be hard to tell who contributes more to the ingenuity of the final work. As such, it will be difficult to determine the copyright owner of such works. 
  Since the courts have not reached consensus on the copyright issues relating to AI-created works and the criteria for them is still unclear, we recommend that AI users and designers avoid tagging their works as ""Automatically Generated by AI system"" when they use an AI system to generate works. In circumstances where that tagging is necessary, the work should at least be tagged as ""Under Assistance of AI system"". Furthermore, it is better if an entity which creates a piece of work by using an AI tool could mark itself on the work. 
  This judgment from Nanshan Court provided a new perspective on AI protection. It supported the idea of copyright protection for works created by a human being with the help of an AI system. It can be seen from this case and the previous case that the China courts are willing to give protection to AI-created works, and the only question is how to give such protection. The China courts and IP practitioners will continue to consider proper ways of protecting the AI industry. Our firm will keep an eye on this issue and report its latest developments.

He holds a bachelor's degree in Writing, Literature, and Publishing from Emerson College. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  The top 100 global banks, including Goldman Sachs, are beginning to take AI strategies very seriously. Most banks are focusing their efforts on AI-enabled applications for risk mitigation, particular fraud detection and cybersecurity systems. These applications have a proven history of ROI in the financial services industry. According to our AI Opportunity Landscape research in financial services, fraud and cybersecurity applications account for more than 26% of the AI-related venture funding raised in financial services, a total of $757 million, more than any other individual area of financial services. It’s clear that banks and venture capital firms are eager to fund anomaly detection vendors with products that can combat payment fraud and security breaches that threaten the privacy of financial services customers. Goldman Sachs seems to be no exception. But as an investment bank, Goldman Sachs may have more niche AI needs than many retail and commercial banks; their foray into AI for equity trading highlights this. In this article, we break down two of Goldman Sachs’ publicized AI initiatives: AI for Wealth and Asset Management: The bank’s AI-enabled investment trust, its work with H20.ai, and its interest in leveraging AI for trading and making the best investments for its clients. AI for Cybersecurity: The bank’s data mining initiative to combat cyber attacks. We begin our discussion of Goldman Sachs’ current AI initiatives with their recent investment in the machine learning startup platform H2O.ai.  AI  for Wealth and Asset Management AI-Enabled Investment Trust Goldman Sachs tested its investment trust, which it claimed makes decisions using AI, in Japan in 2017. The software purportedly runs on natural language processing, a type of artificial intelligence that can discern the meaning within digital text. The software seems to run through analyst reports and news reports (over 26 million as of the 2017 press release) in order to determine the best investments for clients. Goldman Sachs claims the software can help user wealth and asset managers in the following ways: Predicting the Best Investments: he bank also claims its application analyzes data on new investment targets and determines how promising they are based on historical investment data. This indicates the software has some predictive power, likely generated via predictive analytics. Identifying Undervalued Shares: Data about potential investment targets can reveal if a company’s shares are undervalued and possibly worth buying. Determining Profitability: The application can purportedly judge how profitable a company is by analyzing their financial data in comparison with previous investment targets. According to Goldman Sachs, the software generated a return of 28.% between 2014 and 2017. Investment in H2O.ai In 2019, Goldman Sachs led a $72.5 million investment round in the AI startup, H2O.ai. The bank’s Vice President of Venture Capital and Growth, Jade Mandel, also joined the AI company’s board of directors. She said of the decision: H2O.ai’s focus on machine learning transparency and model interpretability facilitates adoption across our industry, and we are delighted to continue to invest in H2O.ai and to further deepen our partnership. This gets to a key problem with adopting AI in finance: AI is in large part a black box, meaning it’s sometimes impossible to figure out why an AI model made the decision it did to buy or sell stocks, approve a loan applicant, and more crucial decisions. For more on this problem, read our full article, AI Transparency in Finance – Understanding the Black Box. The bank claims they are also interested in further adopting H2O’s machine learning platform to help with market making, or providing liquidity to the bank to endorse more trades.  AI for Cybersecurity Goldman Sachs claims to use data mining and machine learning to combat cyber attacks, but it’s unclear exactly which techniques they use to do this. The same resource mentions the bank’s exploration with anomaly detection technology, a type of machine learning that can identify changes within normal patterns. Anomaly detection is well-regarded in use-cases like crybersecurity and fraud detection. Many banks have been leveraging it since the early 2010s, working with companies like Darktrace. Below is a an overview of Darktrace from CNBC:  Anomaly detection software works by first establishing a sense for a normal digital environment. To do this, it often needs to run within a digital ecosystem for several months. Then, once the software “learns” what constitutes a normal environment, it can begin to flag events that deviate from that norm. This allows cyber security specialists to have a better gauge of which events to focus on and which to ignore as normal activity. The bank claims it is looking to expand their AI staff in both cybersecurity and financial modelling.  Emerj for Financial Services Companies There are several key players in the AI-enabled cybersecurity space. Global banks and financial institutions use Emerj AI Opportunity Landscapes to find the nuances between them and determine which vendor is the right fit for their needs. They work with Emerj to develop strategies for investing in high ROI AI opportunities and find out what their competitors are doing. Learn more about our research services.

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has issued a call to action for experts to build artificial intelligence tools that can be applied to a new COVID-19 dataset.







For more coronavirus updates, visit our resource page, updated twice daily by Xtelligent Healthcare Media.
Requested by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the dataset represents the most extensive machine-readable coronavirus literature collection available for data mining to date. The dataset includes over 29,000 articles, more than 13,000 of which have full text.
The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) was put together by researchers from the Allen Institute for AI, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CHI), Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET), Microsoft, and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at NIH.
“Decisive action from America’s science and technology enterprise is critical to prevent, detect, treat, and develop solutions to COVID-19. The White House will continue to be a strong partner in this all hands-on-deck approach,” said Michael Kratsios, US Chief Technology Officer, the White House.
“We thank each institution for voluntarily lending its expertise and innovation to this collaborative effort, and call on the United States research community to put artificial intelligence technologies to work in answering key scientific questions about the novel coronavirus.”
To build the dataset, researchers used Microsoft’s web-scale literature curation tools to identify and gather worldwide scientific efforts and results. CZI provided access to pre-publication content, NLM provided access to literature content, and the Allen AI team transformed this content into a machine-readable form, making the data ready for analysis and study.
“It’s all-hands on deck as we face the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Eric Horvitz, chief scientific officer at Microsoft.
“We need to come together as companies, governments, and scientists and work to bring our best technologies to bear across biomedicine, epidemiology, AI, and other sciences. The COVID-19 literature resource and challenge will stimulate efforts that can accelerate the path to solutions on COVID-19.”
The CORD-19 resource will continue to be updated as new research is published in archival services and peer-reviewed publications. Researchers interested in submitting the text and data mining tools they develop can do so via the Kaggle platform, a machine learning and data science community owned by Google Cloud. Through Kaggle, these tools will be made available to researchers around the world.
“It’s difficult for people to manually go through more than 20,000 articles and synthesize their findings. Recent advances in technology can be helpful here. We’re putting machine readable versions of these articles in front of our community of more than 4 million data scientists. Our hope is that AI can be used to help find answers to a key set of questions about COVID-19,” said Anthony Goldbloom, co-Founder and chief executive officer at Kaggle.
To better inform the call to action, researchers collaborated with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats and the World Health Organization to develop key scientific questions related to COVID-19.
The questions aim to discover what is known about COVID-19 transmission, risk factors, origin, diagnostics, and other critical information.
“Sharing vital information across scientific and medical communities is key to accelerating our ability to respond to the coronavirus pandemic,” said Dr. Cori Bargmann, head of science at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. “The new COVID-19 Open Research Dataset will help researchers worldwide to access important information faster.”
Kaggle is sponsoring a $1,000 per task award to the winner whose submission best meets the evaluation criteria. The winner may choose to receive this award as a monetary payment or as a charitable donation to COVID-19 research efforts.
With the development of this dataset, researchers expect to advance their understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on patient populations.
“One of the most immediate and impactful applications of AI is in the ability to help scientists, academics, and technologists find the right information in a sea of scientific papers to move research faster. We applaud the OSTP, WHO, NIH and all organizations that are taking a proactive approach to use the most advanced technology in the fight against COVID-19,” said Dr. Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for AI. 
“The Allen Institute for AI, and particularly the Semantic Scholar team, is committed to updating and improving this important resource and the associated AI methods the community will be using to tackle this crucial problem.”
New AI tools will help accelerate COVID-19 research and relief, paving the way for medicine in the future.
“This valuable new resource is the fruit of unselfish collaboration and now offers the opportunity to find answers to important questions about COVID-19,” said Dr. Dewey Murdick, Director of Data Science at CSET, who coordinated the cross-team effort. “Once the crisis has passed, we hope this project will inspire new ways to use machine learning to advance scientific research.”

The Army Will Soon Be Able to Command Robot Tanks With Artificial Intelligence
How would it work?

by Kris Osborn



 


(Washington, D.C.) The Army Research Laboratory is exploring new applications of AI designed to better enable forward operating robot “tanks” to acquire targets, discern and organize war-crucial information, surveil combat zones and even fire weapons when directed by a human.

“For the first time the Army will deploy manned tanks that are capable of controlling robotic vehicles able to adapt to the environment and act semi-independently. Manned vehicles will control a number of combat vehicles, not small ones but large ones. In the future we are going to be incorporating robotic systems that are larger, more like the size of a tanks,” Dr. Brandon Perelman, Scientist and Engineer, Army Research Laboratory, Combat Capabilities Development Command, Army Futures Command, told Warrior in an interview, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. 

The concept is aligned with ongoing research into new generations of AI being engineered to not only gather and organize information for human decision makers but also advance networking between humans and machines. Drawing upon advanced algorithms, computer technology can organize, and disseminate otherwise dis-aggregated pools of data in seconds -- or even milliseconds. AI-empowered sensors can bounce incoming images, video or data off a seemingly limitless existing database to assess comparisons, differences and perform near real-time analytics.
At the speed of the most advanced computer processing, various AI systems can simultaneously organize and share information, perform analyses and solve certain problems otherwise impossible for human address within any kind of comparable timeframe. At the same time, there are many key attributes, faculties and problem solving abilities unique to human cognition. The optimal approach is, according to Perelman, to simultaneously leverage the best of both.





“We will use the power of human intelligence and the speed of AI to get novel interactions,” Perelman added.

This blending, or synthesis of attributes between mind and machine is expected to evolve quickly in coming years, increasingly giving warzone commanders combat-sensitive information much faster and more efficiently. For instance, a forward operating robotic “wingman” vehicle could identify a target that might otherwise escape detection, and instantly analyze the data in relation to terrain, navigational details, previous missions in the area or a database of known threats.
“You have an AI system that is not better than a human but different than a human. It might be faster and it might be more efficient at processing certain kinds of data. It will deal with threats in concert with human teammates that are completely different than the way we do things today,” Perelman said.

With these goals in mind, the ARL is now working on mock up interfaces intended to go into the services’ emerging family of Next Generation Combat Vehicles. Smaller robots such as IED-clearing PackBots have been in existence for more than a decade; many of them have integrated software packages enabling various levels of “semi-autonomy,” able to increasingly perform a range of tasks without needing human intervention. Current ARL efforts now venture way beyond these advances to engineer much greater levels of autonomy and also engineer larger robots themselves… such as those the size of “tanks.”
Army Research Lab Mock Up of Next-Gen Combat Vehicle AI-Enabled System
Bringing this kind of manned-unmanned teaming to fruition introduces new strategic and tactical nuances to combat, enabling war commanders a wider and more immediate sphere of options.
“Commanders will be able to view a target through vehicle sensor packages, or if there is an aided target recognition technology or some kind of AI to spot targets, they might see battlespace target icons pop up on the map indicating the location of that target,” Perelman said.
AI-oriented autonomous platforms can greatly shorten sensor-to-shooter time and enable war commanders to quickly respond to, and attack, fast emerging moving targets or incoming enemy fire.
“Everything that a soldier does today…. Shooting, moving, communicating.. Will be different in the future because you do not just have human to human teammates, you have humans working with AI-teammates,” Perelman said.
Enabling robots to understand and properly analyze humans is yet another challenging element of this complex equation. “When you have two humans, they know when the other is cold and tired, but when you bring in an AI system you don’t necessarily have that shared understanding,” Perelman said.
Various kinds of advanced autonomy, naturally, already exists, such as self-guiding aerial drones and the Navy’s emerging “ghost fleet” of coordinated unmanned surface vessels operating in tandem. Most kinds of air and sea autonomous vehicles confront fewer operational challenges when compared to ground autonomy. Ground warfare is of course known to incorporate many fast-changing variables, terrain and maneuvering enemy forces - at times to a greater degree than air and sea conditions - fostering a need for even more advanced algorithms in some cases. Nevertheless, the concepts and developmental trajectory between air, land and ground autonomy have distinct similarities; they are engineered to operate as part of a coordinated group of platforms able to share sensor information, gather targeting data and forward-position weapons -- all while remaining networked with human decision makers.
“You can take risks you would never do with a manned platform. A robotic system with weapons does not need to account for crew protection,” Perelman said.
Interestingly, the Army Research Lab current efforts with human-machine interface are reinforced by an interesting 2015 essay in the “International Journal of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence,” which points to networking, command and control and an ability to integrate with existing technologies as key to drone-human warfare.
“They (drones) should effectively interact with manned components of the systems and operate within existing command and control infrastructures, to be integral parts of the system,” in Military Robotics: Latest Trends and Spatial Grasp Solutions, by Peter Simon Sapaty - Institute of Mathematical Machines and Systems, National Academy of Sciences.
Increased use of networked drone warfare not only lowers risks to soldiers but also brings the decided advantage of being able to operate in more of a dis-aggregated, or less condensed formation, with each drone and soldier system operating as a “node” in a larger integrated network. Dispersed forces can not only enable longer-range connectivity and improved attack options but also reduce force vulnerability to enemy fire by virtue of being less aggregated.
“Despite the diversity of sizes, shapes, and orientations, they (drones and humans) should all be capable of operating in distributed, often large, physical spaces, thus falling into the category of distributed systems,” Sapaty writes in the essay.
Also of great significance, Army thinkers explain, is that greater integration of drone attack assets can streamline a mission, thereby lessening the amount of soldiers needed for certain high-risk operations.
“When you are calling in artillery or air support, there is a minimum distance from where you are able to do that as a human being. You don’t have the same restrictions with robotic systems, so it allows you to take certain risks,” Perelman.
A paper in an Army University Press publication explains how drones can “expand” the battlefield. By utilizing drone systems for combat…”fewer warfighters are needed for a given mission, and the efficacy of each warfighter is greater. Next, advocates credit autonomous weapons systems with expanding the battlefield, allowing combat to reach into areas that were previously inaccessible,” the essay states.

The New Zealand Government plans to regulate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms by progressively incorporating AI controls into existing regulations and legislation as they are amended and updated, rather than having any specific regulation to control the use of AI.
Last month, the AI Forum of New Zealand — representing organisations from across New Zealand’s artificial intelligence ecosystem —published a set of principles designed to help build public trust in the development and use of AI in New Zealand. It marked a new development in a long-running debate in New Zealand about the regulation of AI.
In response to questions from Computerworld on this latest development, a spokesperson for the Department of Internal Affairs said, “AI informs a number of government services and processes and is covered off by a multitude of existing regulations or legislation. As acts are updated and amended, AI and algorithm use will be incorporated into those bills. At this stage, the Government has not made any decisions to explicitly regulate the use of AI.”











 
 
 
The NZ Government’s strategy for AI
These initiatives will form part of the NZ Government’s Strategy for a Digital Public Service, released in November 2019 and described as “a call to action for the public service to operate in the digital world in a more modern and efficient way — delivering the outcomes that … New Zealand needs.”

The spokesperson said: “The strategy for a Digital Public Service identifies the need to establish strong digital foundations that can be used across the public sector. This includes, for example, determining appropriate policy and regulatory requirements for emerging technologies, such as AI. This will ensure new technologies are adopted lawfully, safely, transparently, and with the continued support of the public.
“The strategy … confirms that our government will ensure the human rights that apply offline continue to be recognised and protected in the digital environment.”











 
 
 
The current round of activity around controlling the use of AI algorithms started in April 2018 when the University of Otago called for government use of AI analytics to be regulated. Then, in May 2019, the New Zealand Law Foundation warned against the unregulated user of artificial intelligence algorithms by government. In response, in November 2019, the Government announced it would examine regulation of AI with the World Economic Forum (WEF).
WEF collaboration on AI
The spokesperson said the NZ Government had been invited to work with the WEF’s San Francisco-based Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution on the development of new and agile regulatory approaches for Al.
“As a small country, New Zealand is seen by WEF as being an ideal test bed for this kind of agile thinking,” the spokesperson said. “We have a small, stable democracy, with a government that can move quickly. We are well-connected, both internally, across our government and wider society, and we have strong relationships with other countries. We are seen as a leading digital nation.”











 
 
 
Lofred Madzou, WEF’s project lead for artificial intelligence, tells Computerworld, “A draft roadmap for policymakers to help shape thinking when regulating AI has been developed by the project team. This roadmap includes a tools and approaches section that suggests policymakers look at a range of soft and hard regulatory tools and levers. Work is underway within the New Zealand government on identifying options for the regulation of government algorithms. This work, while a New Zealand government piece, will provide a useful case study to the project as it will be testing elements of this high level roadmap. Work with the global community since the creation of the roadmap has further refined the scoping and the emphasis has moved from the high-level roadmap to being about the gathering of evidence and development of tools. The community workshops held by the project team have recommended that the innovative approaches and tools should concentrate on the areas of national conversations about AI ethics and values, assessment and options for a centre of excellence.”
Algorithm charter coming
In another Government AI development, Statistics New Zealand has released a draft algorithm charter that it says, “commits government agencies to use algorithms in a fair, ethical, and transparent way.”
The charter would apply to ‘operational algorithms’ as defined in Statistics NZ’s Algorithm assessment report, released in October 2018: “These impact significantly on individuals or groups. … [They] interpret or evaluate information (often using large or complex data sets) that result in, or materially inform, decisions that impact significantly on individuals or groups…[and] may use personal information about the individuals or groups concerned, but do not need to do so exclusively.”











 
 
 
The charter is expected to be finalised in the second half of 2020. Public submissions on the draft closed on 31 December 2019; Statistics NZ has published a summary of these and provides updates on the project’s progress on its website.
Questions on private sector AI use
The Law Foundation’s warnings on AI were contained in a report prepared by the University of Otago’s Artificial Intelligence and Law in New Zealand Project (AILNZP).
The report’s co-author, associate professor Alistair Knott, told Computerworld that the same issues existed in the private sector, but the report had chosen to focus only on government use because the question of regulation was easier to answer in this narrower context.











 
 
 
“The same questions arise for private sector on uses of decision systems or classifiers. How accurate are they? Do they perform the same way for all different groups in society? In other words, is there any bias? There are other questions of interest. Are the people using these machines actually in charge? Or are the machines on some form of autopilot? You might have the illusion that a person is in the loop when in fact they’re just taking the recommendation of the system, especially when the system gets sufficiently good. So are there protocols for making sure that people are awake to the system making mistakes?”
The university is now working on Phase 2 of the Law Foundation project with the results due out later in 2020.
Knott said it would focus on the employment issues thrown up by the use of AI. “How will human work change? Which jobs might be lost? How might new jobs be created? What effects there will be on whole professions possibly, of widespread introduction of AI? What aspect of those professions be at risk of being lost if there’s widespread automation?”

Whether on the big screen or on the small screen, we have all witnessed the plot unfold as the AI-driven robotic overlords slowly, surely and ruthlessly take over the human race. However, in the movies, the human race always wins. We are not yet sure about the outcome of the AI takeover if it happens in real life!The topic of the AI revolution is pretty debatable. While some have nothing but amazing things to say on the AI revolution, there are many AI experts who have openly spoken out about the kind of negative effect AI can have on the society and requested the researchers to look into the societal effects of Artificial Intelligence.The omniscient, omnipresent and almost omnipotent power of AI has been put to question time and time again. The future possibilities of this technology can easily be compared to the myth of Pandora’s Box. However, we know what pandora’s box contained, the future of AI, on the other hand, remains quite foggy, which justifies the question that we are faced with again and again, and that is- will AI replace us human beings?AI Takeover: The Beginning Of The EndToday the AI technology is being used to perform tasks that range from trivial to monumental. Whether it’s enhancing mobile photography with AI cameras or financial asset management, AI has some truly amazing applications in various fields of human life.But as the applications of AI increases, more and more people are starting to wonder if it is going to erase the importance of human skills and experiences in different tasks. What happens to the skills and experiences of a veteran photographer when all the person holding an enhanced AI camera needs to do is to point the camera and click? What happens to the skills and intuitions of an experienced stockbroker when AI is trained to predict stocks and help people make decisions based on that?Source: Photo by Franck V. on UnsplashSome will argue that AI only helps the users to reap the benefits of having years of experience without having to struggle for years to gain that experience. But what happens to the fundamental human values when that experience gaining process is removed entirely, and nothing stands between the user and gaining the optimal results?If you keep all these questions in mind, then the entire “AI will replace human beings” premise does not seem that ridiculous. However, to confirm, or reject that thought, we really have to get to the bottom of the visibly positive and negative effects of AI on society.AI Automation: Different Sides Of The Same CoinEverything has its positive and negative effects, that much is evident. Artificial Intelligence is not an exception. The effects of AI automation ranges from extremely good to severely bad. And these effects need to be observed and analyzed closely before making any assumptions about the long term effect of AI in society.The Positive Side Of The CoinThere are many facets of the positive sides of AI- from speeding up mundane tasks to enhancing the inner workings of bigger industries. The analytical and predictive power of AI has proven to be a valuable asset for many industries. Whether it is predicting the weather or stock market, the accuracy of AI technology’s predictive power is affecting many industries in a positive manner. Not only data analysis and making predictions based on that, but AI is also being used for more dangerous tasks such as space explorations, sea exploration and many more.The next positive is definitely enhancing the diagnostic and monitoring procedures in the medical industry. With wearable integration, doctors today are better equipped to diagnose a patient and monitor their situation, which leads to better and accurate treatment. The AI effect not only enhances the medical procedures, but it is also reducing the cost of medical treatment across the world drastically.Source: https://www.pexels.com/photo/gray-and-white-robot-73910/Thanks to the increase in smart home automation development, AI has also entered our homes and turned it into a smarter household. The AI-based smart home systems, often called the “Phantom Load” or “Vampire energy” is working wonders when it comes to reducing power consumption and controlling the carbon footprints of a household. The AI-based facial recognition systems are also helping the authorities to deal with criminals in an advanced manner.There are many, many other positive uses of Artificial Intelligence. But in short, we can definitely say that the positive sides of AI do not only span across different industries but also affects the individual lives of everyone attached to those industries.The Negative Side Of The CoinSince there’s a positive side, there is bound to be a negative side of AI as well. Starting from AI bias to social media manipulation, AI is affecting society in ways that were previously unimaginable.The introduction of AI automation has brought about a serious shift in the modern human lifestyle. The tasks that once required manual labor, can be done without having to live a finger today. This means that users today have more free time and they are looking for new experiences to fill that void. However, this search for new experiences is easier for some people than others, which has some serious social and psychological impact on society.Source: https://www.harvard.co.uk/6-things-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/One of the most glaring examples of the negative effects of AI would be the incident involving a racist medical AI system putting millions of lives in danger. The racial bias of human society entered the AI through data sets used to train that AI system. This led to millions of black people suffering from their illness due to not receiving good enough treatment.Besides these, there are far more sinister impacts, such as social media manipulation, that is changing our point of view, the lack of privacy and security as is evident from China’s social credit system, etc. The main problem with all these negative effects of AI is that we don’t even think about these effects until they are right in front of us. The negative effects of AI seem superficial when really it is working on a deeper level, changing the fabric of society as we know it.Can AI Penetrate All Industries And Fields?Until now we have this understanding that AI can be used in a wide range of industries. But can it be used in all of them?Even though AI IS disrupting multiple fields of studies and works, there are many other areas where AI is not exactly that effective. Be it the Human Resource manager of an organization, PR manager or an artist, there are fields that require a greater amount of human sympathy, experience, and skills.Source: Photo by Franck V. on UnsplashDespite all its possibilities, Artificial Intelligence is still believed to be at its very first stage of development. All that we are seeing today is just a precursor to a much smarter and intelligent version that is yet to come. And that’s why we can rest assured, as today’s AI still has not achieved the kind of skills needed to accomplish a lot of jobs.Jobs such as writing and editing, graphic designing, teaching are yet to be automated, all because these jobs need the human touch. Sure with AI-based systems, these jobs can be made easy. But AI can not completely take over these tasks, not yet. Academic fields too are exempt from the AI automation trends. Tasks such as grading papers can be assigned to the AI system, but when it comes to teaching or researching, the field still requires human influence.Where Do They Differ- AI Vs HumansIf we are to finally answer the question of whether human beings are to be replaced by AI systems, we would need to understand that there are fundamental differences between the human psyche and an Artificial Intelligence system.Source: Photo by Andy Kelly on UnsplashWhile both work with cognitive functions such as problem-solving, memorizing, planning, reasoning, and perception gathering, a human mind is far more capable of performing these simple tasks. The human brain is able to integrate their emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and human experience into these tasks and give it a flare that is unique to every individual. The AI system, on the other hand, is still not developed enough to learn on its own. It still needs to be trained using data sets by human beings so that they can perform different tasks.At the end of the day, AI is an invention of the human mind. The complete automation of various tasks today is possible because of Human imagination. Even though the question persists whether we are going to be replaced by AI or not, we can rest assured that for the time being, the AI system is not at all close to achieving the kind of technical maturity to take over the human race.ConclusionThere might not be any conclusive answer to the question of AI replacing human beings in various industries. What we only have are predictions and observations. And here are the top three observations that we can consider when wondering about the AI takeover-Human beings have created AI, and even though greater attempts are being made to replicate human intelligence through AI systems, we still have a long way to go in order to create an intelligent system that can overpower us.AI will replace human beings in some jobs and industries and that much is inevitable. Many jobs that require manual labor will be automated in the future. This is, however, not the first step of AI domination. Something similar happened when computers became mainstream, but we are not yet its slaves. (despite our obsession with computers and smartphones)With enough regulation and limitation, we can be prepared if an AI takeover ever comes into play. Even now there needs to be proper regulatory laws in the AI industry, that include laws about how AI is trained, used and how it affects the users.The rapid expansion of AI technology needs constant regulation and observation before the negative effects of it become too much. With proper laws guarding the users, AI takeover will only be limited to the entertaining plots of dystopian movies and fictional worlds.",,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-matter-of-ai-takeover-will-artificial-intelligence-replace-human-beings-79d2c788f358,,,2020-03-19T06:46:23.809Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,79d2c788f358,['Jessica Bennett — Tech Enthusiast and Marketer'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

STEM jobs change the world. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) enable the discovery of more efficient energy sources and the development of new materials to optimize energy storage, advance our artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing capabilities, and enhance our understanding of the building blocks of matter – to name just a few of the things we work on at the Department of Energy (DOE).  When I was appointed as the inaugural Director of DOE’s Artificial Intelligence & Technology Office (AITO), which was established to help address national challenges, it was humbling to say the least.  How exciting to contribute to the direction and success of this new office at the dawn of the Age of AI! Without diversity of gender, race, backgrounds, and ideas, we won’t be able to sufficiently capitalize on critical and creative solutions to our nation’s most urgent challenges. This commitment to diversity is shared across the Administration with the goal of advocating for and advancing achievements in the STEM fields to benefit the American people.It’s a truly awesome responsibility to work with the best and brightest minds overseeing hundreds of AI projects at DOE and our world-leading National Laboratories making profound differences. Earlier this month, I had a pleasure of visiting Oak Ridge National Lab where I was able to take a look at Summit, the world’s fastest supercomputer. Our supercomputers have allowed us to expedite testing enabling us to find treatments for deadly diseases. All of our 17 National Laboratories are working to advance AI and I want to help highlight their successes.With so much to discover and improve in our world, I hope these exciting fields inspire more women and girls to pursue STEM education and careers. Indeed, the Department of Energy specifically has benefited from the contributions of the many female STEM pioneers and advocates including former Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary, the nation’s first and only female and African American Secretary of Energy. Today at DOE, I am proud to work alongside female leaders such as Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty, the first woman to serve as the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security and Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration; Rita Baranwal, the first woman and woman of color to serve as Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy; and Melissa Burnison, the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs. I know the appreciation for diversity is increasing.  Yet, women only currently make up around 28 percent of the STEM workforce overall and even less – 13 percent – of the engineering workforce.We must do better. Changes to the STEM pipeline must be made at several points. We see attrition starting in middle school, as kids begin to picture themselves pursuing various careers, then again during critical periods, such as when students are deciding to take Advanced Placement courses and enter honors programs in STEM, when parents select programs for their kids, when Hollywood casts leads and write scripts to portray people in STEM, and when applicants are screened for internships, positions, leadership and awards.STEM skills are at the heartbeat of DOE. More than 40 percent of federal DOE employees are in STEM careers, and many more are contractors at our 17 National Laboratories.I’m particularly proud to work at DOE during a time in which leadership is implementing a multipronged outreach effort to further promote STEM literacy through education and workforce outreach, enhance engagement with the communities around our labs, plants and sites, and help ensure the future includes a diverse STEM workforce.  March is Women’s History Month.  In recognition, I highly encourage women and girls visit energy.gov/STEM to learn about the Department’s exhaustive effort – including programs supporting more than 250,000 students and educators, from K-12 to postdoctoral researchers, national lab internships, fellowships and research experiences, local science fairs, career days, STEM conferences, clubs, and afterschool learning - just to name but a few.But it’s not just the government’s role to ensure American competitiveness by helping to encourage and train more women and girls to join the STEM workforce. This next generation of scientists and engineers will drive discovery and innovation, and the world will be a safer and better place for it.We must never stop innovating ways to interest a more diverse body of students in STEM activities and lighting that STEM spark across all demographics and backgrounds.Our future depends upon it.

Stevens Institute of Technology researchers have developed an AI-powered, smart insole that instantly turns any shoe into a portable gait-analysis laboratory. (Stevens Institute of Technology)
Taking one step might be trivial for most people, but Stevens Institute of Technology researchers believe that analyzing how someone walks can tell a lot for people who have trouble moving or have injuries.According to research published in IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, the scientists have developed an AI-powered, smart insole that instantly turns any shoe into a portable gait-analysis laboratory. The work could give clinical researchers a new way to precisely measure walking function in patients with movement disorders or musculoskeletal injuries, in their living environments. The technology could also help athletes improve their running technique. “From a practical standpoint, that’s invaluable,” said Damiano Zanotto, lead author and director of Stevens Wearable Robotic Systems Lab. “We’re now able to accurately analyze a person’s gait in real time, in real-world environments.”RELATED: Bargain-hunting engineers say sensors still too costlyCapturing reliable information about a person’s gait in real-life environments remains challenging for researchers. Standard gait-analysis technologies, such as camera-based motion-capture systems and force plates, are expensive and can only be used inside laboratories, so they offer few insights into how people walk around in the real world. Emerging wearable technologies such as smart shoes, pods, and insoles can potentially overcome this limitation, but the existing products cannot provide accurate gait data.In their work, Zanotto and his team show that their smart insole can deliver real-time data on the length, speed, and power of a wearer’s stride with better accuracy than existing foot-worn technologies—and at a fraction of the cost of traditional laboratory equipment.The team’s SportSole technology uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to monitor its own movement and orientation in space and an array of force sensors to detect plantar pressure, allowing it to capture 500 readings per second—around a fivefold improvement over smart pedometers and other wearable gait-analysis tools. Because wearable motion sensors are inherently noisy, Zanotto processes those 500 measurements per second down to just a few key features, then feeds the results into an AI algorithm that can rapidly extract gait parameters that are accurate to within a couple of percentage points.The smart sole works regardless of whether the wearer is walking or running and generates accurate results without requiring calibration or customization for individual users. Preliminary testing suggests the SportSole even works with children as young as three years of age and elderly users with vestibular disorders, whose gait patterns are very different from those of healthy adults. Noteworthy in the smart insole is the use of off-the-shelf sensors that will ultimately make the technology easier to scale. According to the researchers, the sensors used cost around $100, accompanied by AI to extract reliable data. “We’re achieving the same or better results at a far lower cost, and that’s a big deal when it comes to scaling this technology,” said Zanotto.The team is currently focusing on testing the SportSole for clinical use.

It may even have a list of predefined, possible responses that a human will respond within a given situation, they said.However, when an AI system or machine only has a few clues or partial observations to go on, its responses can sometimes be a little, noted the researchers.“What we’re doing in these early phases is to help machines learn to act like humans based on our daily interactions and the actions that are influenced by our own judgment and expectations — so that they can be better placed to predict our intentions,” said Lina Yao, a lecturer at UNSW. “This may even lead to new actions and decisions of our own, so that we establish a cooperative relationship,” Yao said.The researchers want to see awareness of less obvious examples of human behaviour integrated into AI systems to improve intent prediction. However, doing so is a tall order, as humans themselves are not infallible when trying to predict the intention of another person, the researchers said.“Sometimes people may take some actions that deviate from their own regular habits, which may have been triggered by the external environment or the influence of another person’s actions,” she said.Yao and her team are developing a prototype humanmachine interface system designed to capture the intent behind human movement.“We can learn and predict what a human would like to do when they’re wearing an EEG (electroencephalogram) device,” Yao said. “While wearing one of these devices, whenever the person makes a movement, their brainwaves are collected which we can then analyse,” she said.Yao said recording this data has the potential to help people unable to move or communicate freely due to disability or illness.“Someone in an intensive care unit may not have the ability to communicate, but if they were wearing an EEG device, the pattern in their brainwaves could be interpreted to say they were in pain, for example,” Yao explained.Yao noted the ultimate goal in developing AI systems and machines that assist humans is for them to be seen not merely as tools, but as partners.",,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/74722957'}"

Are our schools ready for Artificial Intelligence?
The CBSE had announced the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an optional subject at Class 9 from the Session 2019-2020 onward and has been conducting training for teachers on how to use AI in the classroom. A training video was also to be prepared to amalgamate AI as a multi-disciplinary integrated pedagogical approach to further enhance teaching and learning. Idea was to make India’s next-generation ‘AI ready’. But are we really ready for the big launch? A report by BHARAT HITESHI

It is only on February 27, 2020, that NITI Aayog joined hands with NASSCOM to roll out artificial intelligence modules in Indian schools. Mind it 2019-2020 academic session is almost over now when the NITI Aayog and NASSCOM have joined hands to roll out the AI in schools. A statement issued after the event said that with an imperative to empower the youngest minds of the country with the latest technologies, NITI Aayog, Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) in collaboration with the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) on February 27 launched an AI-based Module rolled out for students in Indian schools.
The AI-Base Module has been introduced with an objective for students to leverage the full potential of AIM’s Atal Tinkering Lab (ATL) and further empowers them to innovate and create valuable solutions benefiting societies at large. The module contains activities, videos and experiments that enable students to work through and learn the various concepts of AI.
Sharing his thoughts, CEO, NITI Aayog Amitabh Kant says that India could add 1.3 per cent to its GDP on an annual basis through the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. “Indians can find solutions to the challenges of a shared connected zero-emission world, improving learning outcomes, disease like tuberculosis, cancer, etc. If we are able to find solutions to these challenges for the 1.3 billion people of India, we can find solutions for the 7.5 billion people of the world too,” he says. The AI module is so critical, in the sense that it will start teaching young children from a very young age then Indians will become major players in AI, as it has been done in the past for robots, 3D printing, IoT. “This is path-breaking, it combines playing and academics and our job is to make things very interesting. We want to make artificial intelligence a great fun so that children can enjoy it, they can evolve and learn and take India forward.”
CBSE for ‘AI ready’ next gen
Significantly, the CBSE had issued a Circular No 14/ 2019-dated 09-03-2019 and had clearly communicated that: “Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being widely recognized to be the power that will fuel the future global digital economy. AI in the past few years has gained geo-strategic importance and a large number of countries are striving hard to stay ahead with their policy initiatives to get their country ready. 
India’s own AI Strategy identifies AI as an opportunity and solution provider for inclusive economic growth and social development. The report also identifies the importance of skills-based education (as opposed to knowledge-intensive education), and the value of project-related work in order to “effectively harness the potential of AI in a sustainable manner” and to make India’s next generation to be ‘AI ready’.

Technology innovation over the last decade was breathtakingly fast as industries got intertwined with emerging technologies like never before. It has been estimated that by 2030, the global market in AI is likely to be in the range of 15 to 15.5 trillion dollars, out of which India’s share will be close to a trillion. Mission Director Atal Innovation Mission, NITI Aayog R Ramanan says that AI is going to be an integral part of the new 21st century innovations and we are proud to introduce the Learn-It-Yourself module in all our 5000 Atal Tinkering Labs with over 2.5 million students having access to it. “This is the first-ever industry-government academia initiative on such a scale to keep the school students abreast of the latest technologies.”
For India to lead and remain relevant in this new ‘tech-driven decade’, especially in emerging technologies like AI, and the ubiquity of AI in society, it is critical for the government and academia to collaborate and introduce AI learning at schools and prepare young minds for the AI-led Digital future.
About the collaboration, Debjani Ghosh, President, NASSCOM, says, “AI has become a strategic lever for economic growth across nations and will continue to be one of the most crucial technologies of the future. Given its impact, it is an embracing step taken by NITI Aayog to introduce the resources for students to learn AI. This will create the right foundations for students, especially the K-12 segment, to onboard onto future technologies and prepare them fully for the digital and AI era. The partnership is a crucial step in building citizens and a workforce that is aware of AI and can work with AI.”
The hands-on AI module has been designed considering academic, co-scholastic and other ATL programs at school and is formulated to encourage young students to contribute to the journey of nation-building. The module will be a catalyst for the youth to explore, ideate and learn the latest technologies and build a generation of innovators at the grassroots level.
Atal Innovation Mission housed at NITI Aayog is the Government of India’s flagship initiative to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. At the school level, AIM is establishing ATLs in all districts across India. As of today, AIM has selected a total of 14,916 schools across the country spread across 33 different states and union territories, for the establishment of ATLs.
NASSCOM acknowledges the role played by AI and other emerging technologies, as an imperative to build a digitally powered tomorrow. By inculcating AI and a ‘learning by doing’ culture in schools, huge opportunities are bound to arise for the overall industries at a global scale. To achieve this, NASSCOM and AIM have worked in collaboration with industry members and universities to develop the special modules on Artificial Intelligence learning.
Promoting digital talent for the nation building has been one of the consistent efforts laid out by the IT-ITeS Sector Skills Council, NASSCOM. For this important initiative and many such programs, the IT-ITeS Sector Skills Council has been a key pillar for NASSCOM to catalyze the skill development ecosystem in the country and build industry-ready talent for the IT sector in India. The AI Base Module is ready to be introduced to the ATL students. Additionally, an AI Step-up Module is under development, which will be the next step, that builds on the base module.
Artificial Intelligence explained
World Economic Forum Artificial intelligence (AI) is the software engine that drives the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Its impact can already be seen in homes, businesses and political processes. In its embodied form of robots, it will soon be driving cars, stocking warehouses and caring for the young and elderly. It holds the promise of solving some of the most pressing issues facing society but also presents challenges such as inscrutable “black box” algorithms, unethical use of data and potential job displacement. As rapid advances in machine learning (ML) increase the scope and scale of AI’s deployment across all aspects of daily life, and as the technology itself can learn and change on its own, multi-stakeholder collaboration is required to optimize accountability, transparency, privacy, and impartiality to create trust.
Artificial Intelligence is a Cognitive Science and the history of its evolution suggests that it has grown out of the knowledge derived from disciplines such as Science, Mathematics, Philosophy, Sociology, computing and others. Hence, it is fair for any education system to recognize the importance of integrating AI Readiness to maximize learning across other disciplines. AI is being widely recognized to be the power that will fuel the future global digital economy; and has gained geo-strategic importance. A large number of countries are striving hard to stay ahead with their policy initiatives to get their youth ready to function in an environment driven by AI and other emerging technologies. India’s own AI Strategy identifies AI as an opportunity and solution provider for inclusive economic growth and social development.
Artificial Intelligence refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem-solving and decision making; it is inspired by the ways people use their brains to perceive, learn, reason out and decide the action.
Initially conceived as a technology that could mimic human intelligence, AI has evolved in ways that far exceed its original conception. With incredible advances made in data collection, processing and computation power, intelligent systems can now be deployed to take over a variety of tasks, enable connectivity and enhance productivity.
CBSE initiatives for AI
What is CBSE’s new initiative encompassing Artificial Education? Making school students ‘AI Aware’ or forging ‘AI Readiness’ among students is the primary task. Central Board of Secondary Education under the guidance of Ministry of Human Resource Development has taken a ‘twin initiative’ in this regard. The first is to introduce AI as an elective subject in classes 8,9 and 10. To begin with, schools have to apply to CBSE and be approved to run this course. AI curriculum for classes 8 and 9 has been chalked out and a Facilitators’ Handbook has been produced. CBSE is also supporting extensive teacher training for the teaching of AI in schools.
The second part of the CBSE initiative deals with the premise that AI is a Cognitive Science that can be linked to various subjects that concern themselves with cognition and reasoning. Almost every one of the school subjects would fall into this domain. Be it — Mathematics, Computing, Neuro-Sciences, Psychology, Physics, Economics, Sociology, Philosophy, Languages and some others. It is, therefore, mandated by CBSE that all its schools would begin to integrate AI with other disciplines from classes 1 -12.
AI integrated learning would help to develop Key Competencies for Lifelong Learning, some of which are:
◆ Acquiring the subject knowledge using AI as a tool
◆ Learning problem-solving
◆ Innovativeness and taking initiative
◆ Application across key disciplines
◆ Developing interaction and Learning
◆ Assuming social responsibilities and applications
◆ Learning Vocational ethics
◆ Applying Communication skills.
The future of higher education is intrinsically linked with developments on new technologies and computing capacities of the new intelligent machines. In this field, advances in artificial intelligence open to new possibilities and challenges for teaching and learning in higher education, with the potential to fundamentally change governance and the internal architecture of institutions of higher education.
India to lead in AI
Home to one-sixth of the world’s population, India is bound to play a leading role in determining the global success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By 2030, India will have the largest number of young people in the globe, a population size which will be a boon only if these young people are skilled enough to join the workforce.
Recently, Niti Aayog published a paper “Indian Education Sector is ripe for disruption by Artificial Intelligence” authored by Abhijay Arora which said that the recently launched SDG Index 2019-2020 by Niti Aayog assigned a composite score of 58 to India under the SDG on Quality Education, with only 12 states and UTs having a score of more than 64.
The current government expenditure on education is less than 3 per cent of the GDP and the pupil-teacher ratio for elementary school stands at 24:1, lower than that of comparable countries such as Brazil and China.
Further, with the rapidly increasing population and dwindling resources, it would not be possible to match the demand for teachers.
There is a need for a bottom up approach — the SDGs will have to be localized at the grass root level. As we enter the last decade to achieve the targets set by the UN, there is a need to propel the progress towards these goals and a key step to achieve the same would be monitoring their indicators on a real time basis. The ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ programme has shown how monitoring and tracking the targets to rank the districts can promote healthy competition among the districts, encouraging each of them to achieve the set mandates. The momentum needed to accelerate the progress towards these goals will be provided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) that will be a gamechanger in converting these aspirations into achievements.
The unprecedented availability of data points in the second-most populous country of the world coupled with access to heavy computational power could potentially make India one of the strongest beneficiaries of the AI wave. Once initiated and operationalized, the AI-powered systems are only going to get better as they learn more and more data is available.
One of the targets under the agenda of Quality Education says that by 2030, our nation must substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers. While it may not be possible to fill the large demand-supply gap that exists, it is possible that the teachers be made more efficient.
What AI can do?
Real-time text to speech and text translation systems can be used to disseminate information seamlessly in the regional language, in line with the Draft National Education Policy 2019 that has encouraged learning of mother-tongue languages. These translation systems can be integrated with DISKHA, Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing, the digital infrastructure that has been set up by MHRD or with e-PATHSHALA, (initiatives under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan). For example, if a textbook on E-PATHSHALA is available only in Hindi, text translation services can make it available in other regional languages and make it more accessible. Because of these language translation systems, the language barrier could be removed and the inter-operability of teachers across states can be achieved, helping meet the demand better than previously.
Biometric authentication
Mundane and support tasks of the teacher — attendance and other administrative tasks-can be taken over by AI. For example, biometric authentication for the students can be introduced and integrated with UDISE+ (Unified District Information System for Education) — an application that is one of the largest Management Information Systems on School Education. The biometric attendance records could also be used as a proxy for inclusiveness of the education in the district, state and block and can be easily tracked, helping monitor the national indicators such as participation rate of youth and adults and proportion of male-female enrolled in higher education, technical and vocational education. This can help monitor the quality of education in the school.
Chatbots & Grading
In a country as diverse as India, integration of chatbots in the digital infrastructure or availability via IVRS system education domain could be transformational — they could be trained on subject matter and a good percentage of doubts of the students could be answered instantly, thereby reducing current workload of teachers who could focus on more creative tasks. Mobile penetration would not be a hindrance here as it is being driven by rural India, the number of internet users in Rural India is expected to reach 290 million by the end of 2019.
With Draft National Education Policy prioritizing online learning in its agenda, machine learning methods such as Natural Language Processing could be used for automated grading of assessments on a large scale on platforms such as DIKSHA, E-PATHSHALA and SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) — not just objective questions but subjective ones as well. Automated creation of content is another field where AI can intervene — given large sources of information on the internet, NLP techniques will be able to use Automatic Text Summarization to create crisp content and publish them on these e-learning websites.
The standard unified curriculum created by ML-based methods will be in line with the nationally defined learning outcomes (MHRD has designed a 70 indicators-based matrix called Performance Grading Index (PGI) to grade the states and UTs) and will objectively help evaluate indicators on the percentage of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level.
Personalized e-learning
When such content is in place on these e-learning platforms, personalized feedback and recommendations at a large scale could be possible: Currently, it is not possible to provide individual attention to every student. However, when content is created and graded by AI, it would ensure personalized avenues of learning for the children by identifying pain points for the students and providing recommendations accordingly. Essentially, educational infrastructure powered by AI would give each student of India a personalized tutor.
In an age where technology is shrinking the world, it is also making quality education more accessible to a larger population in the form of smart content. With advanced applications of AI, educators are setting content as per the local needs of the students in different parts of the country. They often offer education through virtual content like video conferencing, lectures, etc. Now even the textbooks would be transformed as AI systems are now being used to create digital textbooks for specific topics and subjects. This is helping engage students of all academic grades and ages.
Reduced drop-outs
When AI systems provide personalized feedback, we can curb the all India drop-out rates that stand at 4 per cent at the primary level but rise to 20 per cent in higher education. As these personalized tutors continue to collect data points at each juncture in the child’s education journey, classification ML models could be used to predict the children at risk of dropping out and proper redressal mechanisms can be put in place. A culmination of these activities would help a higher education enrolment ratio and make sure a substantial proportion of adults achieve literacy, mandates in line with targets under this SDG.
AI for inclusiveness
Targets revolving around elimination of gender disparities in education and inclusion of persons with disabilities can be influenced positively with the use of AI — not only are Apple’s Siri and Amazon’ Alexa becoming pronounced among the urban section of the society, allowing the visually impaired users to be more participative, but near real-time text to speech systems are allowing the mute to have active information exchange.
To support Inclusive Education for Children with Special Needs (CWSN) Children under the Samagra Shiksha program of MHRD, children affected with autism, Parkinson’s disease or any other disease that results in a speech disorder could benefit by integration of machine learning models in the e-learning websites that detect speech patterns, augment the speech by correcting mispronunciations or broken words and then output the same in an audio or a text format. Additionally, in today’s system, certain educational institutions may have inherent implicit biases, knowingly or otherwise, such as selecting more students of one gender or having policies inhibiting equal opportunities for certain indigenous groups.
The digital learning and AI learning algorithms can be set up to aid and monitor enrolment and be explicitly programmed to get rid of such biases. For example, selection criteria for jobs can involve a screening by such AI systems to ensure the process is just, a system that will become a precursor to inclusive education. Building on the neurosciences of learning, which shows that parts of the brain can be ‘wired’ or ‘trained’ in intellectual as well as emotional intelligence, the whole-brain approach to learning and harnesses the power of digital technologies to enable innovative pedagogies.
Dr Anantha Duraiappah, Director, UNESCO, Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development (MGIEP) sums up “It is imperative for education systems to go beyond merely applying AI to reinforce existing teaching methodologies. We should explore transformative pedagogical approaches that apply the technology to build cognitive and emotional intelligence of learners”.
