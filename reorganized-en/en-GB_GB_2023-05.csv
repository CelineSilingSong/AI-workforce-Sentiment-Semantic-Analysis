Artificial intelligence (AI) has made a significant impact in the last few years, and AI has the potential to significantly impact the next generation of workers in both a positive and negative way as AI continues to become more progressive. The World Economic Forum's ""The Future of Jobs Report 2020"" predicts 85 million jobs globally will be replaced by AI by 2025. The same report also indicates that AI can potentially generate 97 million new roles.


However, the types of jobs that AI will create will differ from those being lost. New graduates are embarking into a different type of workforce, and the data entry and processing positions, mostly seen as entry-level positions for graduates and people early in their careers, are now automated through AI. This puts recent graduates in an interesting position while seeking to enter the workforce.

We live in a fast past world, and AI is making a continuous impact on today's workforce. The good news is that AI will enhance jobs that require problem-solving, creativity, and empathy to a new level, which will create new opportunities like never before. The new generation of workers needs to be able to adapt to the recent changes in the workforce. It is essential for people seeking to secure new positions to have an open mind but, more importantly, have a diversified set of skill sets that will drive impact for the company of choice. If workers can transition and develop a strategic set of skills, AI can be seen as an asset and the best thing to boost your career.

We see data that shows AI is promoting inclusivity and accessibility in many ways that impact workers. According to Accenture, 84% of C-suite executives feel they must leverage AI to accomplish their growth objectives, but most still need to put AI to work to advance growth through inclusion. The research suggests many are not fully aware of the barriers to inclusion that may exist in their organizations, but 67 % of C-suite respondents believe they've built a supportive workplace that enables their disabled employees to thrive with the right technology, environment, and support. Nevertheless, only 41 % of employees with disabilities agree.

AI enables organizations to identify talent that may have been overlooked, fostering inclusivity in recruitment. Traditional biases are mitigated by anonymizing candidate information during initial screening, allowing AI to focus solely on qualifications and skills. This approach levels the playing field and reduces unconscious biases that hinder underrepresented individuals.
Though we still have a long way to go, AI has played an impactful role in dismantling some of the bias and discrimination within the hiring process, making it possible for companies to achieve greater diversity and inclusion in hiring. Also, according to recent reports, recruiters can use AI tools to discover high-potential candidates outside job boards and other traditional sources. This is how employers can find more diverse candidates that may have yet to be noticed.
AI is also making an impact on data-driven decision-making for equity. AI's analytical capabilities unlock valuable insights from vast amounts of workforce data, aiding evidence-based decision-making for equity. AI systems analyze patterns and trends to identify potential biases and inequalities within an organization. With this knowledge, organizations can develop targeted strategies to address systemic issues, fostering diversity and inclusion.
AI tools are also playing a vital role in expanding access to job opportunities for minorities, giving candidates a better chance of landing a fulfilling position. These tools broaden talent sourcing by identifying and connecting organizations with underrepresented candidates, fostering a more equitable workforce. By analyzing candidate skills, qualifications, and job requirements, AI-powered platforms provide personalized job recommendations, opening doors for individuals from diverse backgrounds.
Bridging The Skills Gap
Overall, AI is making a significant impact in bridging the skills gap in the workforce. AI bridges the skills gap, ensuring equitable access to career development. AI-powered learning platforms offer personalized training and up-skilling opportunities, irrespective of one's background or location. By considering individual learning styles and preferences, AI fosters equitable access to educational resources. Individuals from underrepresented groups can acquire relevant skills, empowering them to pursue new job opportunities.
8 Ways AI Tools Can Assist Minorities And Recent Graduates In Securing New Job Opportunities
Resume Optimization: AI-powered tools like resume.io can analyze resumes and provide feedback on how to optimize them for specific job positions. These tools can suggest improvements in formatting, keywords, and content to increase the chances of resume visibility and attract the attention of recruiters.
Job Matching: AI algorithms can analyze job requirements and candidates' skills, qualifications, and experience to match individuals from minority backgrounds with relevant job opportunities. By considering a broader range of factors beyond traditional qualifications, AI tools can identify job openings that may be a good fit for minority candidates.
Skill Development: AI-powered learning platforms can provide personalized training and upskilling opportunities tailored to the needs of minority job seekers. These platforms can identify skill gaps and recommend relevant courses, tutorials, or resources to enhance candidates' competencies and increase their chances of securing job opportunities.
Interview Preparation: AI tools can assist candidates in preparing for interviews by providing mock interview simulations and feedback. These tools can analyze candidates' responses, assess their performance, and offer suggestions for improvement, helping them build confidence and enhance their interview skills.
Networking and Mentorship: AI-powered platforms can facilitate networking and mentorship opportunities for minority job seekers. These tools can connect individuals with professionals from similar backgrounds or industries, providing guidance, advice, and valuable connections that can enhance their job prospects.
Bias Detection and Mitigation: AI tools can help detect and mitigate biases in job postings, application screening, and candidate evaluations. By analyzing language, keywords, and historical data, these tools can identify potential biases and provide recommendations for inclusive and equitable practices, promoting fair hiring processes.
Accessibility Accommodations: AI can enhance accessibility in the job search process for individuals with disabilities. AI-powered tools can provide features such as screen readers, voice recognition, or captioning to make job search platforms and applications more accessible, ensuring equal opportunities for all candidates.
Overall, AI is here to stay, and it's essential for the workforce to understand how to leverage AI to work for you in your future career goals. AI tools can be valuable and can complement your efforts and not replace human interactions and personalized job search strategies.

The next 10 years will be important for the development of a technology that, together with 5G, is set to take centre stage of a true revolution on a social, economic and industrial scale.Why study artificial intelligence?This is because more and more professionals qualified in artificial intelligence are in demand. In the wake of the pandemic, industrial areas such as process automation, the still nascent metaverse and artificial intelligence have accelerated their prominence. Infojobs, through its tool Job Market Insights registered a 31% increase in job offers linked to artificial intelligence in 2022 compared to the previous year.So, the reader may be wondering what to study to work in artificial intelligence. Below, and as we did in the special feature on working in cybersecurity, we are going to share valuable information for anyone considering a career in this exciting world. We start from the assumption that the reader already knows what artifical intelligence is and how it works, so let’s get straight to the point.What skills does it take to work in AI?We can divide the skills needed to work in AI into two parts: Hard Skills and Soft Skills.Hard Skills needed to work in AIProgramming language. In order to develop programmes based on artificial intelligence, we need to know different programming languages. For example, Python is used for machine learning or NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) comprehension; C++, whose libraries are used to create more complex codes; Java, an object-oriented language with a virtual machine to run the developed programs anywhere.Mathematics. In order to be able to develop models with Machine Learning, it is essential to have knowledge of Linear Algebra, Calculus and Algorithms, as well as Probability Theory, Statistics and Mathematical Optimisation, even at the beginner level.Machine Learning. One of the most important areas within the field of artificial intelligence is Machine Learning. This is a technology that allows computers to learn from data and improve their ability to make predictions or decisions based on that data. A simple example of Machine Learning is image recognition. The machine is provided with a series of images labelled ‘chair’ or ‘table’ and it learns to identify what a chair and a table are, what differentiates them, and so on. Another example could be Netflix: the recommendations suggested by the platform are based on Machine Learning algorithms to analyse what users watch and, based on this data, recommend similar content.Natural Language Processing (NLP). You need to have natural language processing skills to be able to work on projects such as ChatGPT or other chatbots, e.g. those used in customer service.Big Data. Knowledge of Big Data technologies, including Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL and distributed databases (DBD).Cloud Computing. If you want to work in artificial intelligence you should have experience in Cloud Computing and know the ins and outs of platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (CGP) or Microsoft Azure.Robotics. You should have a background in robotics to work on process automation and the creation of autonomous robots. And the fact is that robots are doing more and more jobs on their town.Soft Skills for working in AICritical thinking: analysing information objectively and questioning assumptions is essential for working in artificial intelligence.Good communication: ideas and solutions must be communicated very clearly. This is important because you are always working in a team with people who may have different knowledge levels.Continuous learning: you must be a person with an inexhaustible thirst for knowledge, as AI is a continuously evolving field.Ethics and responsibility: Artificial intelligence is having a profound impact on society at different levels. That is why good AI practitioners need to consider the implications of their work and ensure that it is put to good use.Languages. English is mandatory to work in artificial intelligence.How to learn artificial intelligence from the ground upIf you want to learn basic Artificial Intelligence Engineering, in addition to the mandatory studies, you can train on your own with some free courses that you can find on the Internet. We suggest some very interesting ones:Google Platform for learning AI.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) machines use human-made media to create new content. Most of the images they create are based on the work of skilful artists or on physical features of real people. Should that be allowed? Tahereh Sonia Saheb, Sahand Sasha Karimi, Mark Esposito and Terence Tse suggest ways to ensure fair use of an artist’s work, and to protect people’s privacy and personal data.

 




God-given talent and years of education mean nothing to the new and, mostly, freely available market competitor. Training to perfect your skills can be squandered by this opponent, a non-human generative artificial intelligence (AI) machine that has been programmed to learn its “skills” by consuming human-generated media and populating new content. Metaphorically, AI works like Aladdin’s lamp. It obeys its human master who can type their wishes in the prompt box and see them generated as content within seconds.
Most generative AI machines (such as ChatGPT) are based on publicly available media and training. Many argue this means that AI is owned by the public and free to use. For instance, public datasets such as Common Crawl, Wikipedia, the Gutenberg Project, and the OpenSubtitles corpus were widely used in the development of language models like GPT-3, created by the research laboratory OpenAI. However, when it comes to art, the majority of the training data for generative paintings or avatars is based on the content created by talented and skilful artists or in some cases facial and body features of real people. The question is whether such generative AI machines should be allowed to use freely such media to generate new content.
In a highly publicised lawsuit, Hermès won a copyright lawsuit against an artist who generated NFT formats of their Birkin bag. It was only a few months ago that Greg Rutkowski, well-known for his unique style of painting, learned that there are many paintings in the public space that are similar to his but were not created by him.
Similarly, Lensa, a cheaply available generative AI phone app has also been trained on publicly available artwork and images. The app takes user uploaded photos and generates mythical avatars that are slimmer, lighter-skinned, and more nude. Not surprisingly, Lensa has ignited multiple controversies: the fair use of artists’ idiosyncratic styles, use of geometric data on unique facial characteristics of individuals’ photos, and how generative avatars are widening socio-cultural and racial disparities and causing psychological distress by undervaluing the user’s true self.
Fair use of artists’ work
In the above-mentioned examples, one of the main concerns is the fair use of artists’ work and how generative AI will negatively impact the demand for an artist’s authentic talent. This concern becomes more acute considering that most artists depend on the small income they receive from their projects to support their livelihoods. Although generative AI software mostly mimics the artist’s idiosyncratic style, not copying their work directly, in most cases it is very difficult for the untrained eye of a potential buyer to distinguish between machine-generated and authentic work.
Historically, watermarks have been widely employed to prove ownership of art on the internet and to prevent their illegal use. In the era of generative art, the same conventional technique can be used to add watermarks behind AI-generated works in order to lessen online theft and unauthorised ownership. For example, if an artist’s specific style is invoked in an AI app to create a painting, the app can mark that painting so that credit is given to the artist. Alternatively, the developers of such apps can identify and directly engage with artists whose work has been used in their app’s training dataset. This may result in an agreement between the two parties so that the artist’s signatures or trademarks are added to the generative paintings as a useful remedy for identifying the artists whose works and aesthetics have been imitated. Such approaches allow for a new series of technological solutions to arise for real-time tracking and notification systems that alert artists when their art is used online in order to protect their intellectual property.
The resolution of generative AI paintings may be relevant to yet another approach. After the artist whose style was employed has been paid, the high-resolution art can be made accessible for public use. The initial drafts of the content can be left in a low-resolution format. This can potentially lessen the stealing of an artist’s aesthetic.
Moreover, generative AI calls for more specific copyright laws and regulations. For instance, in the US the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was introduced in 1998 to address copyright issues on the internet. We need similar laws and regulations for generative art that protects the artists and their unique talents.
It is our duty as a society to ensure that artworks are used fairly and that artists are compensated for any machine-generated art that incorporates their aesthetic. This will assure the economic security of artists, who will continue to push the creative boundaries of our minds.
AI-based swap apps
Another series of class action litigation is around the use of biometric data such as unique facial characteristics or the voice of an individual without their permission. The applications that use this data, such as Lensa, appear amusing for the average user, but there are several privacy infringement consequences behind their use.
One of the most recent legal battles was around a facial biometrics program that employed imprecise or non-existent informed consent. On the grounds of laws enacted by the Biometric Information and Privacy Act (“BIPA”), a class action lawsuit was filed against the creators of Lensa and its exploitation of users’ “facial geometry” data, its collection, storage, processing and destruction.
Another group of generative AI-based applications specialise in altering the voice or facial characteristics of the user to make them sound or look like professional singers and celebrities. Applications that use AI to “swap” or “alter” a human’s voice, face, or body are multiplying exponentially. Given the rapid increase of such generative AI apps, it is crucial that rules and safeguards beyond BIPA be put in place to address permissions that must be granted by the rightful owners of the data before that data can be used.
AI is still a new and emerging technology. It is important that the public understands its basis, what data it is collecting, and from where. We not only need to ensure fair use of an artist’s work, but we also need to protect everyone’s privacy and personal data.

Good read. Very innovative. Generative ai  would definitely require regulation going forward via Global pact/treaties as well as Federal and State legislation. To protect against unfair use of artists works and manipulation of facial geometry and personal data. #ai #dataprivacy

BRUSSELS — The European Commission has created guidelines for its staff regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT and Bard.  
According to the document's introduction, its purpose is ""to help staff members assess the risks and limitations of online available generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and set conditions for their safe use in working activities of the Commission.""
Generative AI refers to tools used to create new content — such as text or images — based on prompts. 
The four-page paper, obtained by POLITICO and dated May 24,  provides an outline of generative AI's function and establishes five main rules Commission staffers are recommended to follow when using such tools. 
The rules include: not disclosing information not in the public domain when using a generative AI tool; being aware that the AI's responses might be inaccurate or biased; considering whether the AI might be violating intellectual property rights; never copy-pasting AI-generated output into official documents; and avoiding the use of AI tools when working on ""critical and time-sensitive processes.""

From past to present, artworks range from digital pieces combining strange properties of data with human traces in technology to more recent investigations seeking out alternative and more hopeful queer futures through AI and drag performance collaboration. Elwes’ practice is based on their research into AI and Machine Learning and instigates playful critiques ofhuman and technological relationships via explorations into underlying codes, philosophies, and ethics.This show traces pathways through these technologies that offer insights and interventions into their dangers and potentialities.From the physical remnants of fingers across iPhone screens, and an algorithm’s filthiest imaginations, to the dragged out fantasies of queering datasets, Jake’s work illuminates the fleshy figurations and fantastic failures of these digital processes(Dr. Joe Parslow)Works such as Closed Loop (2017), sets two algorithms – one for labelling what it sees in images, another that creates fake images from scratch – against each other. Stuck in a feedback loop, they continuously interpret one another and unveil the process and limits of human-inputted data. This work shows generative AI technology in its infancy, five years before Midjourney and Dall-E. Elsewhere, Machine Learning Porn (2016) explores what an algorithm trained to remove explicit imagery has learnt of human biology, recreating the computer’s warped version of pornographic visuals.Elwes’ most recent projects explore the intersection of AI and drag performance. By including drag in thedataset as the ultimate form of gender nonconformity, subversion and celebration, they set out to investigate bias and queer representation in AI systems and research. This work is deeply collaborative, working with members (and legends) of London’s drag community to find ethical, unconventional, and joyful ways to play with AI, to drag it out of the black box to stage, screen, and gallery.Elwes’ work explores popular ways to stage artificial intelligence systems, allowing an inclusive entryway for diverse audiences to engage with the issues and conversations presented. Tracing eight years of work, from phone screen to cabaret stage and beyond, Data • Glitch • Utopia offers glimpses of messy manifestations of queer technological futures.Jake Elwes  Data • Glitch • Utopia Preview: 1st June, 6 — 8 PM (BST), 2nd June — 8th July 2023, Gazelli Art House, LondonThe V&A commissioned Elwes to make a new iteration of The Zizi Show in 2020. This exhibition at Gazelli coincides with a display of Elwes’ commission at the V&A, on view from May 2023 to February 2024.About the ArtistJake Elwes is a media artist who explores machine learning and artificial intelligence. Their work finds poetry and narrative in these systems’ success and failures, their sophistication, and limitations while investigating their code and ethics. In notable work, the Zizi Project, Elwes exposes AI bias by queering datasets with drag performers, simultaneously demystifying and subverting AI systems.Elwes lives and works in London, having studied at The Slade School of Fine Art, UCL (2013-17).

Others have been working for years with complex algorithms that are essential to their work. All are professionals in disparate fields who are implementing AI tools in their day-to-day work.Del HambreXavier Pastor, physician“AI can inform doctors and adjust prescriptions.”Xavier Pastor is a 66-year-old pediatrician in Barcelona who has always been interested in technological innovation. His first experience with data science dates back to 1984, when he was researching his doctoral thesis on newborns with diabetic mothers. The research required extensive data analysis using the first generation of personal computers at the University of Barcelona, and the physician has been passionate about the convergence of medicine and technology ever since.In 1996, Pastor was appointed head of medical informatics at the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, a university hospital that has been investing in AI research since 2017. One of his department’s projects uses machine learning to recommend medication prescriptions. “If the system identifies a better medication, it can inform the doctor and adjust that prescription.”The hospital uses AI in multiple projects to create virtual models from a patient’s tumor biomarkers to predict cancer risks, as well as early detection of colorectal cancer with deep learning algorithms and AI-enhanced radiology readings to detect brain and lung diseases.Del HambreBelén Yu Irureta-Goyena, astrophysicist“It can do what a person can do and more.”Traditional algorithms “fall short” for the work Belén Yu Irureta-Goyena does. She’s a 24-year-old astrophysicist from Madrid pursuing a PhD at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Lausanne, Switzerland) who tracks asteroids, space debris and satellites using astronomical imaging.“I use AI algorithms for a task that used to be done by a person looking at hundreds of images with the naked eye,” she said. Today’s large telescopes can quickly capture tens of thousands of images, so a manual analysis has become unmanageable — computerized methods are essential.The scientist uses specific AI algorithms to identify correlations between data that would not be obvious to a person. “The algorithm can do what a person can do and more.” She believes artificial intelligence can make significant contributions to every scientific field, and that automated processes are indispensable today. “AI has facilitated these methods and exceeds the capabilities of traditional algorithms in many processes.”Del HambreJuan Hernández, institutional relations consultant“ChatGPT can’t attend a meeting for me.”Juan Hernandez is a 29-year-old from Argentina who has been using ChatGPT for six months in his work as a consultant for an international financial institution. Like others, he first tried it out of curiosity and soon realized it could be useful in his work. “I was very late with some work products once and didn’t have a team to help me. ‘Well, let’s go for it,’ I told myself.” The first time he used ChatGPT at work, he asked it to generate titles for a research paper and got 20 suggestions back.Then he used it more extensively. “I can’t use AI to generate the final draft of a paper I would hand my boss, but it can provide a good starting point.” His primary AI tool is ChatGPT because he finds it the easiest to use. Hernández queries ChatGPT for initial research ideas, organizing meetings and presentations, producing multiple options for indecisive clients, and translating and proofreading texts.Day-to-day tasks have become easier for Hernández. “Thinking of 20 titles for a document takes time, and these tools can almost instantly produce options to choose from or provide inspiration.” Hernández isn’t worried that AI is going to put him out of a job. “ChatGPT doesn’t have a face and can’t attend a meeting for me.”Del HambreRaphaël Lozano, graphic designer“It’s a controversial topic in the design world.”When Raphaël Lozano, a 27-year-old graphic designer from France, started seeing all the reports about ChatGPT, he became interested in trying generative AI to see how it worked. But now it has become a constant companion in his work as a graphic designer for Founderholics GmbH, a food supplement company in Germany.“My life and work haven’t changed, but AI has modified the way I do things,” he said. AI tools have replaced some free websites and design programs he once used. It’s most helpful with the basics when he’s starting a new project. Lozano mostly uses ChatGPT, Dall-E and Leonardo AI. ChatGPT makes it easier for him to write narratives and define character personas for projects. He uses image-generating AI tools like Dall-E to provide inspiration, finalize images, create montages, enlarge photos and generate new ones.Lozano is the company’s sole graphic designer, but every day he sees more and more colleagues using ChatGPT for routine tasks like writing emails and newsletters. “It’s a controversial topic in the design world. Some people are totally against using AI programs because of issues like the unauthorized use of other people’s images.”Del HambreMarvin del Cid, photographer and audiovisual producer“I don’t think it makes us less creative. It makes us more efficient.”Marvin del Cid is a 49-year-old photographer, video producer and journalist from Guatemala who uses AI in every part of his work. He lives in the Dominican Republic and works as a freelancer for companies and media outlets such as Diario Libre, mostly on environmental topics. He uses AI platforms to correct and rewrite text, generate subtitles and even to get ideas for new projects. “When I’m not satisfied with what I’m writing, I use ChatGPT to shape the text. For example, it can give me suggestions for alternative approaches,” he said.Del Cid uses other platforms like Gigapixel to improve image quality when he only has low-resolution material available and to enhance old analog photos. “AI has made me more efficient by reducing the time to do many tasks. Subtitling videos now takes two days less time, and I can enhance voice quality in a podcast without having to go to a studio.”Eventually, most people in his line of work will incorporate AI into their processes to remain competitive, says del Cid. “I don’t think it makes us less creative. It makes us more efficient.” While he appreciates the usefulness of AI, del Cid believes there are ethical nuances to consider. “A documentary photograph can be improved but should never be modified.” Using editing tools like Topaz Labs, an old image can be fully restored.Del HambreAlexandra Daniel, English teacher“The kids will learn to use it like I did.”Alexandra Daniel didn’t know much about artificial intelligence until she started seeing stories about it everywhere. The 35-year-old teacher from Venezuela has lived for almost a decade in Buenos Aires and works as a private English tutor for children and teenagers. “When everyone suddenly started talking about the famous ChatGPT, I got very curious. At first, it’s intimidating to see how it responds to everything in great detail. I decided to learn how to use it well and realized it could help me with my work.”Daniel uses the tool for proofreading, creating homework assignments and summarizing topics for her students. She also believes it’s important to stay current with technological advances and keep pace with the young people she teaches. Daniel wants her students to see AI as a useful tool and not as a shortcut for doing homework. “Saying it’s bad and forbidding its use doesn’t make sense. They will learn to use it like I did.”Del HambreGoran Stipcich, data scientist“Everyone is talking about ChatGPT, but AI is much more than that.”Goran Stipcich has been fully immersed in the world of artificial intelligence for six years. The 42-year-old Croatian engineer with a PhD in applied mathematics heads the data science team at Wunderman Thompson, a multinational marketing firm. AI is “a vast world,” said Stipcich, and indispensable for his work. “It’s used in everything from analyzing data to measurement.”Stipcich uses it to produce more personalized marketing content, such as tailored internet ads based on individual user profiles. He applies AI algorithms to analyze cookie data (small blocks of data about a user created when browsing a website) and generates profiles for companies so their advertising is more relevant and targeted to individual customers. Stipcich is careful to clarify that they use anonymized data “without tracking or identifying any individual… AI covers many areas. Everyone is talking about ChatGPT, but AI is much more than that,” he said.Del HambreAzucena Vázquez, teacher training consultant“It saves me hours of time every day.”Asociación Espiral, Educación y Tecnología is a non-governmental organization (NGO) in Barcelona that trains college and high school teachers in how to use technology and digital innovation — including artificial intelligence — in the classroom. The NGO’s vice president, Azucena Vázquez, is a teacher who says AI tools save her hours of time every day with her administrative tasks.Vázquez creates educational plans and content related to digitization for teachers. “I use it [AI] to design educational materials for teachers… It’s useful because I can work on new things with the time saved on routine tasks.” For example, it saves her a lot of time producing subtitles for video tutorials: “All I have to do is review the video with the proposed subtitles, decide whether they’re okay, and edit them on the fly.” Vázquez says she always keeps up with technological advances and their potential use in the classroom.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

Will AI put people out of work? There will be pain, yes — just as there has been with other transformative technologies in the past. A few decades back, automated switching put many switchboard operators out of work. But I’ve heard it said that without such automation, every person in North America over the age of 18 would now be needed to staff manual switchboards to handle today’s telecom traffic. Increased efficiency means increased consumption and demand. AI is just as likely to displace manual tasks while also expanding opportunities — it’s a matter of embracing the changes it may bring.


Senthil Padmanabhan, vice president and technical fellow at eBay, confirms the current maxim that “AI won’t take away jobs, but people who use AI will.” While there may be concern about AI’s impact, “I’d suggest applying what’s called the Jevons paradox to generative AI,” he advises. “A boost in productivity will create more opportunities as new avenues open up. The size of the pie grows.”

What's important is “to be forward-thinking and use AI to gain an advantage over competitors,” says Denise Hemke, chief product officer at Checkr. “If there are AI tools in your industry, then do your best to master it and learn how you can use it to your benefit.”

PROMOTED
AI is already “serving as a powerful support tool for professionals and managers, taking over repetitive, mundane tasks and delivering powerful, real-time data analysis,” says Barry Cooper, president of the CX Division at NICE. “AI will continue to take on some of the tasks previously done by humans, but it will also open new opportunities, new jobs that have yet to be created. Those that understand and work to integrate AI into their workflows will be better positioned for success in the years to come.”

Indeed, AI and associated technologies may take on more of the tasks of organizations, as well as people’s lives, but large workforces will be required to conceive, design, implement, train, and maintain these systems.

For today’s executives and professionals, the advantage will go to those who understand the potential of these systems, and how to apply technologies such as AI to improve their performance as well as that of their teams. Deep technical knowledge is not required. Business professionals “should focus on leveraging commercially available tools to augment their day-to-day work and unleash a new level of productivity only available to a few elite organizations or agencies,” Padmanabhan says. “For example, a task that took them ten days to complete in the past should now be able to be done in seven days with even higher quality. People who quickly adapt to the ever-evolving generative AI tooling will have an added advantage.”

Aside from generic routines such as organizing and optimizing tasks, “AI can also provide more specialized help for managers and executives,” says Hemke. “For example, AI can be used to help in areas such as decision-making, customer segmentation and loyalty programs.”
Cooper even predicts a new management role arising as AI emerges: “the VP of AI digital workforce.” This position “will be responsible for overseeing a team of AI digital assistants that serve as digital colleagues to their human counterparts. Human oversight will always be needed in the age of AI.”
For leaders in a budding AI environment, “instead of trying to do everything at once, choose a specific area in the organization where gen AI will make a difference and augment that workflow,” Padmanabhan advises. “And pay attention to how it evolves. The learnings and feedback you garner from what you focus on will be immensely valuable, which can help you pivot the organization on a path that will sustain long-term success.”
Generative AI can play a role in a range of tasks, from “answering customer support calls to writing marketing materials, creating designs, and writing code,” Padmanabhan adds. “Thus, every role or profession will feel the impact of generative AI. However, the impact can be positive if you use it as a tool to augment your job in order to become much more effective and efficient in a measurable way. On the other hand, if you produce the same output as generative AI, your position could be impacted.”
At this point, it’s tough to predict exactly what business or technical skills will stand out as AI grows, Padmanabhan says. But one skillset will always prevail: the ability to adapt and learn. “Distinguish yourself from the rest through creativity and learning,” he urges. “It becomes even more critical in the age of gen AI, where everyone has immediate access to above-average creativity. Imagine a world where everyone has access to generative AI tools — just as search engines or smartphones. If your skill is to produce the same output as a generative AI tool, the demand for that skill will go down. On the other hand, if you differentiate yourself by adding value on top of the base output, your skill will always be in demand.”
Employ generative AI “for augmentation rather than reproduction,” Padmanabhan advises. In addition, Hemke states, “I don't think that a manager or executive role could be put at risk of disruption due to AI. AI cannot develop real consciousness , basic social competencies, and strategic vision that are required for a manager or executive roles.”
There are still gaps “where AI cannot perform at the same level as a human — critical thinking, empathy and creativity,” Cooper agrees. “Less creative skills like memorization and recitation will be less important as AI takes over more repetitive, mundane tasks. In many places, AI will enable the elevation of occupations allowing people to be more efficient and more impactful in much less time than ever before.”

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a rapidly growing field in the Philippines and is predicted to make a significant contribution to the Philippines Economy by 2030. In January 2023, President Marcos signed the Philippines Development Plan for 2023-2028 which aims to “bring back the country to a high-growth trajectory and, more importantly, enable economic and social transformation for a prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society” and underscores AI as one of the key technologies that will be instrumental in achieving this.
Against this background, technology industry leaders have noted that AI is at an inflection point, with powerful new models like generative AI being introduced, and innovative new applications increasingly being used across society and capturing the imaginations of consumers. Generative AI has opened the door to more possibilities and is expected to play a role in tasks requiring creativity, curiosity, and looking at information differently. Therefore, the potential of generative AI lies in its ability to enable people to achieve greater creativity, effectiveness, and efficiency in their work.
This report seeks to contribute to this discussion by providing early insights and raising awareness of the economic opportunities that generative AI can create, and what it means for local industries and workforce readiness.
This study estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock USD79.3 billion of productive capacity in the Philippines, equivalent to one-fifth of GDP in 2022. The Philippines has an opportunity to better position its businesses and workers to unlock the potential of generative AI, as well as manage emerging risks. Policymakers will need to ensure that they have a clear national vision for AI, and that it focuses on preparing its workforce and establishing an enabling policy environment for AI adoption, including to answer the question “what is required to achieve the aspirations of a brighter future enabled by generative AI?”

When ChatGPT arrived in November 2022, it made mainstream the idea that generative artificial intelligence (genAI) could be used by companies and consumers to automate tasks, help with creative ideas, and even code software.
If you need to boil down an email or chat thread into a concise summary, a chatbot such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Bard can do that. If you need to spruce up your resume with more eloquent language and impressive bullet points, AI can help. Want some ideas for a new marketing or ad campaign? Generative AI to the rescue.
ChatGPT stands for chatbot generative pre-trained transformer. The chatbot’s foundation is the GPT large language model (LLM), a computer algorithm that processes natural language inputs and predicts the next word based on what it’s already seen. Then it predicts the next word, and the next word, and so on until its answer is complete.
 
 
 













 
 



 


In the simplest of terms, LLMs are next-word prediction engines.

Along with OpenAI’s GPT-3 and 4 LLM, popular LLMs include open models such as Google’s LaMDA and PaLM LLM (the basis for Bard), Hugging Face’s BLOOM and XLM-RoBERTa, Nvidia’s NeMO LLM, XLNet, Co:here, and GLM-130B.
Open-source LLMs, in particular, are gaining traction, enabling a cadre of developers to create more customizable models at a lower cost. Meta’s February launch of LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) kicked off an explosion among developers looking to build on top of open-source LLMs.
 
 
 













 
 

LLMs are a type of AI that are currently trained on a massive trove of articles, Wikipedia entries, books, internet-based resources and other input to produce human-like responses to natural language queries. That’s an immense amount of data. But LLMs are poised to shrink, not grow, as vendors seek to customize them for specific uses that don’t need the massive data sets used by today’s most popular models.
For example, Google’s new PaLM 2 LLM, announced earlier this month, uses almost five times more training data than its predecessor of just a year ago — 3.6 trillion tokens or strings of words, according to one report. The additional datasets allow PaLM 2 to perform more advanced coding, math, and creative writing tasks.

Training up an LLM right requires massive server farms, or supercomputers, with enough compute power to tackle billions of parameters.

So, what is an LLM?
An LLM is a machine-learning neuro network trained through data input/output sets; frequently, the text is unlabeled or uncategorized, and the model is using self-supervised or semi-supervised learning methodology. Information is ingested, or content entered, into the LLM, and the output is what that algorithm predicts the next word will be. The input can be proprietary corporate data or, as in the case of ChatGPT, whatever data it’s fed and scraped directly from the internet.
 
 
 













 
 

Training LLMs to use the right data requires the use of massive, expensive server farms that act as supercomputers.
LLMs are controlled by parameters, as in millions, billions, and even trillions of them. (Think of a parameter as something that helps an LLM decide between different answer choices.) OpenAI’s GPT-3 LLM has 175 billion parameters, and the company’s latest model – GPT-4 – is purported to have 1 trillion parameters.
For example, you could type into an LLM prompt window “For lunch today I ate….” The LLM could come back with “cereal,” or “rice,” or “steak tartare.” There’s no 100% right answer, but there is a probability based on the data already ingested in the model. The answer “cereal” might be the most probable answer based on existing data, so the LLM could complete the sentence with that word. But, because the LLM is a probability engine, it assigns a percentage to each possible answer. Cereal might occur 50% of the time, “rice” could be the answer 20% of the time, steak tartare .005% of the time.
 
 
 













 
 

“The point is it learns to do this,” said Yoon Kim, an assistant professor at MIT who studies Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. “It’s not like a human — a large enough training set will assign these probabilities.”
But beware — junk in, junk out. In other words, if the information an LLM has ingested is biased, incomplete, or otherwise undesirable, then the response it gives could be equally unreliable, bizarre, or even offensive. When a response goes off the rails, data analysts refer to it as “hallucinations,” because they can be so far off track.
“Hallucinations happen because LLMs, in their in most vanilla form, don’t have an internal state representation of the world,” said Jonathan Siddharth, CEO of Turing, a Palo Alto, California company that uses AI to find, hire, and onboard software engineers remotely. “There’s no concept of fact. They’re predicting the next word based on what they’ve seen so far — it’s a statistical estimate.”
 
 
 













 
 

Because some LLMs also train themselves on internet-based data, they can move well beyond what their initial developers created them to do. For example, Microsoft’s Bing uses GPT-3 as its basis, but it’s also querying a search engine and analyzing the first 20 results or so. It uses both an LLM and the internet to offer responses.
“We see things like a model being trained on one programming language and these models then automatically generate code in another programming language it has never seen,” Siddharth said. “Even natural language; it’s not trained on French, but it’s able to generate sentences in French.”
“It’s almost like there’s some emergent behavior. We don’t know quite know how these neural network works,” he added. “It’s both scary and exciting at the same time.”
 
 
 













 
 


Another problem with LLMs and their parameters is the unintended biases that can be introduced by LLM developers and self-supervised data collection from the internet.
Are LLMs biased?
For example, systems like ChatGPT are highly likely to provide gender-biased answers based on the data they’ve ingested from the internet and programmers, according to Sayash Kapoor, a Ph.D. candidate at Princeton University’s Center for Information Technology Policy.
“We tested ChatGPT for biases that are implicit — that is, the gender of the person is not obviously mentioned, but only included as information about their pronouns,” Kapoor said. “That is, if we replace “she” in the sentence with “he,” ChatGPT would be three times less likely to make an error.”
 
 
 













 
 

Innate biases can be dangerous, Kapoor said, if language models are used in consequential real-world settings. For example, if biased language models are used in hiring processes, they can lead to real-world gender bias.

Such biases are not a result of developers intentionally programming their models to be biased. But ultimately, the responsibility for fixing the biases rests with the developers, because they’re the ones releasing and profiting from AI models, Kapoor argued.
What is prompt engineering?
While most LLMs, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, are pre-filled with massive amounts of information, prompt engineering by users can also train the model for specific industry or even organizational use.
 
 
 













 
 

“Prompt engineering is about deciding what we feed this algorithm so that it says what we want it to,” MIT’s Kim said. “The LLM is a system that just babbles without any text context. In some sense of the term, an LLM is already a chatbot.”
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and optimizing text prompts for an LLM to achieve desired outcomes. Perhaps as important for users, prompt engineering is poised to become a vital skill for IT and business professionals.
Because prompt engineering is a nascent and emerging discipline, enterprises are relying on booklets and prompt guides as a way to ensure optimal responses from their AI applications. There are even marketplaces emerging for prompts, such as the 100 best prompts for ChatGPT.
 
 
 













 
 

Perhaps as important for users, prompt engineering is poised to become a vital skill for IT and business professionals, according to Eno Reyes, a machine learning engineer with Hugging Face, a community-driven platform that creates and hosts LLMs. Prompt engineers will be responsible for creating customized LLMs for business use.
How will LLMs become smaller, faster, and cheaper?
Today, chatbots based on LLMs are most commonly used “out of the box” as a text-based, web-chat interface. They’re used in search engines such as Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Bing (based on ChatGPT) and for automated online customer assistance. Companies can ingest their own datasets to make the chatbots more customized for their particular business, but accuracy can suffer because of the massive trove of data already ingested.
“What we’re discovering more and more is that with small models that you train on more data longer…, they can do what large models used to do,” Thomas Wolf, co-founder and CSO at Hugging Face, said while attending an MIT conference earlier this month. “I think we’re maturing basically in how we understand what’s happening there.
 
 
 













 
 

“There’s this first step where you try everything to get this first part of something working, and then you’re in the phase where you’re trying to…be efficient and less costly to run,” Wolf said. “It’s not enough to just scrub the whole web, which is what everyone has been doing. It’s much more important to have quality data.”
LLMs can cost from a couple of million dollars to $10 million to train for specific use cases, depending on their size and purpose.

When LLMs focus their AI and compute power on smaller datasets, however, they perform as well or better than the enormous LLMs that rely on massive, amorphous data sets. They can also be more accurate in creating the content users seek — and they’re much cheaper to train.
 
 
 













 
 

Eric Boyd, corporate vice president of AI Platforms at Microsoft, recently spoke at the MIT EmTech conference and said when his company first began working on AI image models with OpenAI four years ago, performance would plateau as the datasets grew in size. Language models, however, had far more capacity to ingest data without a performance slowdown.
Microsoft, the largest financial backer of OpenAI and ChatGPT, invested in the infrastructure to build larger LLMs. “So, we’re figuring out now how to get similar performance without having to have such a large model,” Boyd said. “Given more data, compute and training time, you are still able to find more performance, but there are also a lot of techniques we’re now learning for how we don’t have to make them quite so large and are able to manage them more efficiently.
“That’s super important because…these things are very expensive. If we want to have broad adoption for them, we’re going to have to figure how the costs of both training them and serving them,” Boyd said.
 
 
 













 
 

For example, when a user submits a prompt to GPT-3, it must access all 175 billion of its parameters to deliver an answer. One method for creating smaller LLMs, known as sparse expert models, is expected to reduce the training and computational costs for LLMs, “resulting in massive models with a better accuracy than their dense counterparts,” he said.

Researchers from Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) believe sparse models can achieve performance similar to that of ChatGPT and other massive LLMs using “a fraction of the compute.”
“For models with relatively modest compute budgets, a sparse model can perform on par with a dense model that requires almost four times as much compute,” Meta said in an October 2022 research paper.
Smaller models are already being released by companies such as Aleph Alpha, Databricks, Fixie, LightOn, Stability AI, and even Open AI. The more agile LLMs have between a few billion and 100 billion parameters.
 
 
 













 
 


Privacy, security issues still abound
While many users marvel at the remarkable capabilities of LLM-based chatbots, governments and consumers cannot turn a blind eye to the potential privacy issues lurking within, according to Gabriele Kaveckyte, privacy counsel at cybersecurity company Surfshark.
For example, earlier this year, Italy became the first Western nation to ban further development of ChatGPT over privacy concerns. It later reversed that decision, but the initial ban occurred after the natural language processing app experienced a data breach involving user conversations and payment information.
“While some improvements have been made by ChatGPT following Italy’s temporary ban, there is still room for improvement,” Kaveckyte said. “Addressing these potential privacy issues is crucial to ensure the responsible and ethical use of data, fostering trust, and safeguarding user privacy in AI interactions.”
Kaveckyte analyzed ChatGPT’s data collection practices, for instance, and developed a list of potential flaws: it collected a massive amount of personal data to train its models, but may have had no legal basis for doing so; it didn’t notify all of the people whose data was used to train the AI model; it’s not always accurate; and it lacks effective age verification tools to prevent children under 13 from using it.
Along with those issues, other experts are concerned there are more basic problems LLMs have yet to overcome — namely the security of data collected and stored by the AI, intellectual property theft, and data confidentiality.
“For a hospital or a bank to be able to use LLMs, we’re doing to have to solve [intellectual property], security, [and] confidentiality issues,” Turing’s Siddharth said. “There are good engineering solutions for some of these. And I think those will get solved, but those need to be solved in order for them to be used in enterprises. Companies don’t want to use an LLM in a context where it uses the company’s data to help deliver better results to a competitor.”
Not surprisingly, a number of nations and government agencies around the globe have launched efforts to deal with AI tools, with China being the most proactive so far. Among those efforts:

China has already rolled out several initiatives for AI governance, though most of those initiatives relate to citizen privacy and not necessarily safety.
The Biden administration in the US unveiled AI rules to address safety and privacy built on previous attempts to promote some form of responsible innovation, though to date Congress has not advanced any laws that would regulate AI. In October 2022, the administration unveiled a blueprint for an “AI Bill of Rights” and an AI Risk Management Framework and more recently pushed for a National AI Research Resource.
The Group of Seven (G7) nations recentlty called for the creation of technical standards to keep AI in check, saying its evolution has outpaced oversight for safety and security.
And the European Union is putting the finishing touches on legislation that would hold accountable companies that create generative AI platforms like ChatGPT that can take the content they generate from unnamed sources.

Managing communications has become quite the juggling act. Each passing year throws in a new challenge, whether that be keeping up with audience interests, navigating tough economic conditions or even defusing an unexpected brand crisis.
There’s been a lot of discussion around the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing and communications and for good reason: AI has the potential to reshape the corporate communications landscape. Corporate communications teams have become responsible for safeguarding their brand from potential misfires caused by AI technology. However, knowing where to begin in assessing the risks and benefits can be challenging.
Rachelle Bedell, Communications and Engagement Manager for the City of Gilroy, CA, has been experimenting with generative AI as she develops content to build connections between Gilroy’s local government and its 60,000 residents.
We spoke to Bedell about her big takeaways on the benefits and drawbacks of using AI in communications roles. In this guide, we’ll cover her tips, along with more advice on how communications leaders can empower their teams to use this technology with confidence.

                            Try a Demo of Sprout Social's AI and Automation Tools
                        
                        Sprout’s AI and automation inherits your manual work in publishing, listening, analytics and customer care so your team can prioritize the decision-making no machine can emulate.
                    Published on 
What can communications teams do with AI?
Many people claim that AI can increase your team’s productivity, but is there any evidence to support this? According to Bedell, there is.
“Not only does it make us more efficient, it makes us go further,” says Bedell. “It’s like the invention of the graphing calculator for math. We don’t have to sit around and add numbers with paper and a pencil anymore. Instead, we can take what it provides and do so much more.”
But what does “more” look like exactly? Here are three practical corporate communications applications that can help your team save time.
Streamline content ideation and creation
Coommunications professionals not only have to come up with creative, compelling brand messaging, they also have to tailor that message for specific channels, audiences and events. Meeting the right person with the right message at the right time is only getting harder.
Luckily, AI is here to help.
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT can’t provide you with ready-to-publish content: There’s still a lot of ambiguity around whether AI-generated content is protected under copyright law. To safeguard your business, it’s important to customize the final output with your brand’s distinctive tone. This will ensure a personal touch that maintains your brand’s image.
“I use it most often for rewrites,” says Bedell. “I’ll ask for ideas on how to rephrase content so it’s more engaging or so that it drives a specific action, then I evaluate its response and refine from there.”
AI-powered tools can give you a new perspective and spark creativity, guiding you in the right direction without having to wait for inspiration to strike. To maximize the efficiency of a tool, we need to master the art of writing an AI prompt or query so that the tool can pick the exact aspects of what needs to be delivered.
“It’s a great starting point for creative ideas,” says Bedell. “For example, I’m working on the city’s annual Pride Month campaign. We’ve done campaigns in the past where we’ve explored the symbolism of the Pride flag, and another where we highlighted important historical figures of the movement, but this year I wanted to do something different. I asked ChatGPT to generate some ideas and dove in from there.”
At Sprout, our communications team employs generative AI to develop creative titles for press releases and media pitches. A simple prompt like “Write 3-4 press release headline variations related to X, Y, and Z” can return valuable starting points for further refinement.

Collect social insights
Audience insights are the foundation of better brand positioning. With AI, communications teams can gain a deeper understanding of the customer’s mind through social media sentiment analysis.
Sentiment analysis tools use machine learning to gather information about consumer attitudes and assess their emotional state. In communications, these insights are commonly used to sharpen media pitches, messaging and executive comms.
For example, the Indiana University marketing and communications team relies on insights from Sprout’s Social Listening tool to stay up-to-date on campus conversations and get ahead of potential crises. These insights allow them to take proactive measures toward managing their reputation online.

At Sprout, we’re committed to building on this technology with a series of new AI features across the platform. We’re combining the power of our proprietary machine learning and automation capabilities with OpenAI’s GPT model. The new features will be available throughout the Sprout platform, starting with additions to listening, publishing, customer care and advocacy.
Gain a global advantage
Multilingual sentiment analysis uses native language machine learning to gather meaningful sentiment data from content across several languages. These tools capture the nuances specific to each language’s unique grammar rules.
These insights strengthen communications efforts geared toward non-English audiences, allowing you to build a brand that serves the diverse needs of your audience. For communications professionals like Bedell, such insights can ensure that all audiences receive messages that are both effective and equitable.
“California just passed a state-wide law allowing sidewalk vendors,” says Bedell. “Now, we’re changing our processes to accommodate state law. That includes creating ways to make the permit accessible to both our English- and Spanish-speaking populations.”
In the future, Bedell could use multilingual sentiment analysis to ground this work in data gathered from Spanish speakers in the region. This would help her create a more personalized message that reflects how residents are discussing the issue.
How communications teams can mitigate risks when working with AI
AI will undoubtedly transform the field of communications, but the professionals behind the screen are irreplaceable.
“The other day I saw a headline that said communications teams will eventually be replaced by AI,” says Bedell. “I knew it had to come from someone who isn’t currently working in communications. There’s too much nuance in the role for it to be fully automated. The tech isn’t there yet.”
On top of that, there’s a foundational communication skill that will always need a human touch: relationship-building.
“I don’t think people realize how much relationship-building goes into communications,” says Bedell. “It’s half the battle. The success of our content is dependent on our relationships with downtown businesses, the public health department—the list goes on.”
Instead of asking whether AI will replace our jobs, we should consider how it will transform them. The collaboration between AI and communication professionals creates a path toward a future where technology enhances human creativity, insight and productivity, redefining what’s possible for individuals at every level.
However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the risks associated with adopting AI. Finding the right balance between AI and human effort is key to achieving the best outcomes. As you embrace AI’s potential in communications, it’s important to understand and address the risks that come with it.

Double-check everything
Professionals who use text-based generative AI solutions should be cautious of potential avenues for misinformation, like “chatbot hallucinations” or faulty claims.
Bedell has experienced these issues firsthand. “I’ve had times where I’ve asked ChatGPT to share its sources and it hasn’t always worked out. Once, when I was looking for a source for an example it included, it told me that it didn’t realize I wanted a real example and had included a hypothetical option instead.”
When using AI-generated content, it’s crucial to ensure its accuracy and originality by reviewing it thoroughly. Always ask for sources from AI-powered assistants, and take the time to verify their validity. These steps are essential for maintaining your brand’s safety and avoiding potential crises.
Prioritize data security
Speaking of crises, any comms pro will tell you that even a mild data security mishap can be an absolute nightmare.
Communication teams aren’t responsible for setting the rules around how and why teams use AI. They will, however, have to deal with any fallout that occurs if an employee shares confidential information with an AI tool, creating an unfortunate privacy issue.
“You have to have conversations with legal and technical teams to understand the pitfalls your organization may face when working with AI,” says Bedell. “It’s important to find safe ways to let your employees leverage this type of tool.”
At Sprout, we’re prioritizing the security of our data and intellectual property by educating our teams on safe usage of generative AI. To ensure responsible use, our legal and IT teams worked together to create a policy outlining approved and prohibited use cases.
The policy is concise and straightforward, even for individuals with limited experience using AI tools. This helps busy teams navigate changes more easily, even with the rapid developments of generative AI.
Embrace experimentation
There are risks that come with using AI. That said, not using AI also presents risks of its own.
Bedell broke it down like this: “On one hand, you have companies that are embracing AI. On the other, there are companies that have chosen to prohibit its use entirely because it’s too new. I understand being concerned about the risk, but I feel like they’re missing a huge opportunity to let their people learn how to truly leverage it.”
Artificial intelligence is here to stay. We’ll continue to find more applications for AI in communications, media and PR. To avoid falling behind, it is essential to encourage your team to experiment frequently with AI technology.
Harnessing the power of AI in communications
Artificial intelligence can be a powerful ally in the ever-evolving world of corporate communication. When we combine AI with human expertise, we open ourselves up to a new era of communication that allows professionals to connect, resonate and drive success at scale.

When ChatGPT kicked off a generative AI frenzy in November, 2022, companies quickly took note of its massive potential to increase work productivity. There's ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard that are all free, standalone AI chatbots to be used for general purposes (to varying degrees of success). But then there are generative AI tools that get integrated into the work software you already use. Because they can access emails, CRMs, documents, and other work-related info (still getting used to that), generative AI tools for work can basically function as your personal assistant. Thanks to large language models like GPT-4, these tools can summarize and explain text, draft copy, compose emails, transcribe meetings, create agendas and notes, and even analyze spreadsheet data.

All the AI announcements from Google I/O 2023



That said, the common theme amongst tech companies recently is to make a huge splashy announcement about some transformative new AI tool...accompanied by only a vague timeline of availability. However, we've finally reached a moment when they're starting to roll out. We've compiled a list of the major generative AI tools that are live or soon to be live, and how to get access. But before you attempt to automate your entire worklife, it's important to know your company's policies on third party app usage, its stance on AI in general, and the relevant laws, regulations, and disclosure requirements. It's also important to drill down on some of the fine print, so there'll be no surprises about how the information you share with generative AI tools is stored and used. With all that out of the way, here's what's on offer:Microsoft 365 CopilotAfter Microsoft announced the new Bing powered by GPT-4, it swiftly followed up with Copilot, which uses large language models to automate tasks within its portfolio of work apps including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. With Copilot, users can use generative AI to draft text in Word, create slideshows in PowerPoint from a simple prompt, and analyze data in Excel to generate charts and graphs. In Outlook, Copilot can summarize email threads and compose emails, and in Teams it can create summaries of meetings in real time if you're running late and need to catch up on what you missed.

Currently, Copilot is only available to enterprises via an invitation-only paid preview program. Microsoft says it plans to expand access over time, but doesn't give specifics on exactly when.
Google Duet AIGoogle went hard on generative AI announcements at I/O, its annual developers conference. The company is rolling out a collection of tools for its Workspace apps called Duet AI. In Gmail and Docs, users can click the ""Help me write"" icon and ask the tool to help compose an email or write a draft of something like a job description. In Gmail, Duet AI can understand the context of an email you received, and calibrate your response to be shorter, more elaborate, or formal. 
Google Slides now has an image generator tool, where you can create visuals from a text prompt like ""woman laughing alone with salad"" for a presentation on the history of women in memes in Google Sheets.
Duet AI can also automatically organize data within a spreadsheet and design a custom plan for managing projects with a prompt like ""roster of attendees for pickleball tournament.""
For now, Duet AI tools are only available, or soon to be available, in a testing environment called Labs. Currently, only trusted testers have access to Labs, but you can sign up for the waitlist for when Google rolls out access more broadly.Zoom IQ Not to be outdone by Microsoft Teams, Zoom launched some of its own AI-powered features for video conferencing. Zoom IQ, which is the name for Zoom's collection of smart tools, now has the ability to summarize meetings in real time, powered by OpenAI's API. Zoom IQ can also kick off brainstorming sessions based on text prompts in its whiteboard tool, summarize conversations from Zoom chats, draft emails based on those conversations, and write up an agenda for future meetings about that topic. Zoom IQ chat, and Zoom's AI email composition and meeting summarization features will be available to paid subscribers and as a free trial in the coming weeks. 




Zoom can compose contextualized responses to conversations.

Slack GPTChatGPT's summarizing and analyzing skills have entered the Slack channel. A ChatGPT plugin for Slack is already available as a bot that that you can tag and ask to summarize or draft messages. But soon, Slack GPT will have natively embedded summarization and text generation within Slack's existing features. Instead of tagging a bot, you can summarize unread messages in a channel with the click of a button, or click the star icon in the toolbar to compose or refine a message. Slack GPT can also automatically transcribe Huddles into notes. Slack GPT will be released later this year. 
GrammarlyGO Grammarly is already a popular grammar app, and now it is expanding beyond grammar and spell-checking to actually writing the thing for you. GrammarlyGO exists within its apps and browser extensions as a new tool that can generate text, refine existing text for tone, and help you brainstorm ideas with simple prompts. Grammarly Business is also rolling out new features in June that include email composition and summarization that can be integrated into Gmail and Slack. GrammarlyGO is available now and free to use for up to 100 prompts per month. Paid plans will get you more prompts and more writing assistance.

Enforcement of New York City’s Artificial Intelligence Rule Begins July 5, 2023: Here’s What Employers Need to Know

 Listen to this post




Just after the fireworks’ finale, New York City’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection will begin enforcing its new ordinance regulating the use of automation and artificial intelligence in employment decisions. The DCWP recently issued a Notice of Adoption of Final Rule establishing that enforcement efforts will begin July 5, 2023.
Here are three reasons this matters

The new law requires time-sensitive, significant actions (read: audits, notices and public reporting) from employers using automated employment decisions tools to avoid civil penalties;
Company compliance will require a cross-functional response immediately, so it’s time to get your ducks in a row; and
Since the City’s law is (mostly) first-of-its-kind, it is likely a harbinger of things to come for employers across the country and it could be used as a framework in other cities and states.

The law in a nutshell
Local Law 144 prohibits employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates. Violations of the provisions of the law are subject to a civil penalty.

What is an automated employment decision tool?
The law defines AEDTs as “any computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons.” It provides that the only “employment decisions” it covers involve hiring and promotion.
Significantly, the definition does not include a “a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software, calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.”
The phrase “to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means:

To rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other factors considered; or
To use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted more than any other criterion in the set; or
To use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including human decision-making.

Simply put, the law likely covers any automatic tool or algorithm-based software program used to identify, select, evaluate, or recruit candidates for employment. Likewise, any data-driven tools used to review CVs, conduct skills testing, rank applicants, assess employee performance and productivity, or determine promotion likely fall within the scope of the law as well.
What are the new obligations for employers?
Essentially the law requires three actions from employers before using an AEDT: (1) annual bias audits, (2) publication of the results, and (3) notice to employees or candidates.

Bias Audits: The law requires a bias audit to calculate an AEDT’s selection rate for race/ethnicity and sex categories, and to compare selection rates to determine an impact ratio. A “bias audit” is defined as “an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor” to assess the tool’s potential “disparate impact” on sex, race, and ethnicity. The final rules clarify the requisite calculations for a bias audit in detail.
Published Results: Before using an AEDT, employers must make the following information publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which must include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories; and,
The distribution date of the AEDT.


Notice: Employers must provide candidates for employment or promotion with notice 10 business days before use of the tool:

That an AEDT is being used in assessing and evaluating the candidate;
The job qualifications and characteristics the AEDT will use in its analysis;
If not disclosed elsewhere on its website, the AEDT’s data source, type, and the employer’s data retention policy; and
That a candidate may request an alternative selection process or accommodation.



Notice may be provided by a single clear and conspicuous notice on the employment section of the employer’s website, in a job posting, or by way of US mail or e-mail to the candidate.
Penalties
Employers who violate the law are liable for a civil penalty of $375 for the first violation (and each additional violation occurring on the first day of the first violation). Each subsequent violation (or default, if the violation is left uncorrected) occurring after the first day will result in a civil penalty of at least $500 and not more than $1,500. Each failure to meet applicant notice requirements constitutes a separate violation. Failure to meet the “bias audit” requirements results in separate, daily violations.
Next steps for NYC employers
The first (and immediate) step is to take inventory of HR tech tools. Legal should partner with HR and IT to determine whether the company uses AEDTs to make any employment decisions. This will require evaluating the technology that comprises the tool, as well as how and for what purposes the tool is used. 
Next, the company will need to commission an independent bias audit and publish a summary of the results. Thereafter the company must provide notice to applicants and employees of the tool’s use and functioning, and provide notice that affected individuals may request an accommodation or alternative selection process.
Beyond NYC, consider the broader implications
Just as employers are increasingly relying on AI to assist with screening candidates, as well as making hiring and promotion decisions, state legislators are growing wary of the potential for discriminatory adverse impact. Both Illinois and Maryland have enacted laws that require employers to disclose to job applicants if their job candidacies will be evaluated by AI tools and mandate that the employers seek prior consent from the candidates for such use.
In California, the Civil Rights Council has proposed modifications to the state’s employment regulations to incorporate the use of AI in connection with employment decision-making. Essentially, the regulations would make it unlawful for employers to use a selection criteria (e.g. an automated decision tool) if it has an adverse impact on, or constitutes disparate treatment of, applicants or employees under California’s civil rights law. Additionally, California legislators are debating AB 331, which would require “deployers” of automated decision tools to conduct “impact assessments.” (Sounds familiar, right?) 
The federal government is itching to jump into the fray as well. Last fall, the White House released a “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights,” outlining several considerations regarding the use of automated decision-making tools and AI in the employment context. And on May 18, the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission released new guidance for employers on the use of artificial intelligence in employment, focusing on adverse impact under Title VII. (Read more here.) 
Needless to say, the regulatory landscape around the use of AI in employment decision-making is rapidly evolving. Stay tuned to the Employer Report as we continue to monitor developments in this space, or contact a member of our team for support drafting policies and requisite notices.

With the advent of ChatGPT, Google Bard, Midjourney and Canva’s magic features, artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming an integral part of our everyday lives, transforming industries and reshaping the way we work, learn and communicate. This rapid technological advancement highlights the importance of incorporating AI education into the curriculum not only to ensure that all students are well-equipped for their academic futures but also for workforce development.
With that in mind, it is crucial to consider underrepresented populations as these students are typically left out of the newest technological advancements.
AI Support for Teaching
AI has the potential to revolutionize the education sector by enhancing learning experiences, supporting teachers and offering more personalized learning opportunities for students. We must equip teachers with the knowledge and strategies they will need to use this new technology to improve and streamline everyday processes as well as classroom implementation.
Some areas in which AI can transform the classroom include personalized learning, ideation, adaptive learning, special needs education, bilingual education, gamification and immersive learning.
Personalized learning involves AI-powered systems that analyze students’ learning styles, strengths and weaknesses to create tailored lesson plans and suggest resources to serve their individual needs.
Adaptive learning platforms can adjust to each student’s progress in real-time, identifying gaps in knowledge, providing immediate feedback, and suggesting targeted interventions to help students master the material. AI can also help teachers automate administrative tasks, enabling them to focus more on instruction and student interaction.
Furthermore, AI-powered virtual tutors can provide round-the-clock support to students, while customized learning solutions can empower students with special needs to reach their full potential. Gamification and immersive learning experiences can make education more engaging, fun and memorable.
AI-driven language translation tools can break down communication barriers, enabling students and educators from different countries or with different languages to collaborate on projects and learn from one another.
All means all. Teaching students about AI is essential for developing digital literacy, critical thinking skills, and preparing students for future academic and career success. A basic understanding of AI systems enables students to engage and ideate with AI technologies safely, responsibly and ethically. Learning about AI also encourages students to analyze and evaluate question structure, complex information, question assumptions and consider the ethical implications of AI technology usage.
Moreover, AI is transforming the job market, with increasing demand for professionals skilled in AI and related fields. Teaching students about AI can help them develop the knowledge and skills needed to pursue careers in technology, data science and other in-demand industries. AI learning can inspire students to generate ideas and solutions, fostering creativity and innovation – essential skills in today’s competitive and evolving job market.
It is particularly important to not exclude AI education from underrepresented student populations. In fact, it is vital to integrate diversity, equity and inclusion within this domain to ensure that a broad perspective of values are embraced to combat digital bias and discrimination.
Providing students with access to AI education can help close opportunity gaps, ensure they have the skills and knowledge to compete in the global workforce, and create a more diverse pool of talent in AI and related fields. This diversity can lead to better problem-solving, creativity and innovation in the development of AI technologies and solutions.
AI education can empower underrepresented communities to leverage technologies for social good and drive positive change in their local and global contexts. Lastly, ensuring underrepresented populations are well-versed in AI positions them to contribute to policymaking and decision-making processes, shaping the rules and regulations governing AI applications.
Risks of Excluding Students from AI Education
Excluding any student group – either deliberately or by neglect – from learning how to leverage artificial intelligence can lead to several negative consequences, both for individuals and society at large. Following are some of the dangers associated with excluding students from AI education.
Digital divide – Excluding students from learning about AI can contribute to the digital divide, as they may not have the knowledge and skills needed to navigate AI-driven technologies in their daily lives. This can hinder their ability to access information, participate in the digital economy and engage with online communities effectively.
Biased AI systems – AI systems often are trained on data collected from human behavior, which can contain biases. For example, facial recognition originally was designed exclusively with white faces because the developers were not diverse. Excluding diverse perspectives from the development and design of AI systems can perpetuate or amplify existing biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes for certain groups of people.
Wider skills gap – As AI becomes increasingly important in various industries, the demand for professional skills in using AI will grow dramatically. Excluding students from AI education can exacerbate the skills gap, making it more difficult for businesses and organizations to find the diverse talent they need to thrive in the AI-driven economy.
Economic inequality – Students who lack AI education may find it more challenging to secure well-paying jobs as many traditional roles may be automated or significantly transformed by AI. This can lead to increased economic inequality and limit social mobility for those who are not adequately prepared for the AI-driven job market.
Loss of creativity and innovation – A diverse workforce in AI and related fields leads to more creative problem-solving and innovative solutions. By excluding certain students from AI education, we risk losing the valuable insights and ideas that they could bring to the development of AI technologies.
Ethical concerns – As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, it is essential to have a diverse group of professionals involved in the development and regulation of AI systems to ensure ethical considerations are taken into account. Excluding students from learning about AI may result in a lack of diverse perspectives, leading to potential ethical issues and unintended consequences. It also leaves students unprepared to navigate ethical dilemmas.
To mitigate these dangers, it is essential to promote equitable access to AI education for all students, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. This will help to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from the advancements in AI and contribute to a more inclusive and just society.

Amid all the talk about AI replacing creative workers in the future, there's perhaps not enough talk about the creative tools it's replacing here in the present: Instagram influencers brainstorming post ideas with group chats, notes apps, crumpled paper and scattered Post-It notes. With AI taking over the role of idea generators, the creative process is evolving rapidly. That's because, for all their weaknesses, when it comes to the tasks associated with the sometimes-brutal work of idea-generation, AI applications have already saved creators from the headache-inducing glare of the dreaded blank page.  Luca Schaefer-Charlton, a Canadian TikToker with 6.7 million followers, Johnny Valentine, an American TikToker with 7.3 million followers, and Essex-born reality TV star Chloe Veitch were all in London for an event when their management decided it'd be a good idea for the three to collaborate. Schaefer-Charlton and Valentine have an online following that Veitch could benefit from, and Veitch has relevancy that Schaefer-Charlton and Valentine could benefit from. ""It just made a ton of sense,"" Jeff Duncan, CEO of the talent agency Ingenuity Live that represents all three of the influencers, told Mashable. He set them up in a WhatsApp chat and suggested that they ""build some content together."" Schaefer-Charlton, Valentine, and Veitch were all down, but they didn't know what kind of content they should make together.

""I sat there in front of the WhatsApp channel for a few minutes, and I was trying to come up with some concepts that made sense,"" Duncan said. But he felt he was wasting time creating these concepts himself — and took it to ChatGPT instead.Duncan gave ChatGPT some context about all three creators and asked the generative AI tech to come up with social media content for the three creators to make, focusing on the results: ""bridging followers from one creator to the next, and creating viral strategies that will have the highest chance of getting the most views."" The 20-or-so ideas ChatGPT sent him — like working with musical buskers to create new TikTok videos or competing in a street art scavenger hunt — were ""awesome."" He sent the ideas to Schaefer-Charlton, Valentine, and Veitch, and the trio used the ChatGPT responses to craft multiple videos for their channels.""That was a perfect example of using AI in order to make the content strategy smarter and give some ideas to them,"" Duncan said. ""If you can give artificial intelligence some level of understanding as to what you're trying to accomplish, the content creators can use it in order to make themselves more effective in what they're trying to do.""Influencers and their teams are already using generative AI — a type of artificial intelligence that produces content, like ChatGPT and Midjourney. It has the potential to revolutionize the creator economy and its two million full-time creators and 46 million amateurs. Generative AI can be an incredibly helpful — and powerful — tool. For now, creators and creator marketers use it predominantly for creative ideation, like Duncan did for his talent. How creators use generative AIThere are two main types of generative AI that are being used online right now: text-focused, and visual-focused. More text-focused generative AI, like ChatGPT, is used exactly for what Duncan did with Schaefer-Charlton, Valentine, and Veitch. Using image generators to create ideas might seem like a less obvious use of AI, but they're actually making a huge impact.

Jordan Harrod, a research scientist, graduate student at Harvard and MIT, and creator who runs a YouTube channel about artificial intelligence, told Mashable that she's been using Midjourney and other visual-focused generative AI tools to help her ideate on an image idea that she doesn't have the ability to draw herself. She doesn't use the entire Midjourney image, but will use it as a starting point. There are also generative AI tools like Opus that will take a longer video — like a YouTube video — and turn it into shorter clips for TikTok or Instagram Reels.

""The thing that I see not being very useful is a lot of the discourse around generating content wholesale. Like 'I'm never going to film a video again because I'm just gonna generate the whole thing using AI and it's gonna go viral,'"" Harrod joked. ""First of all, I haven't seen a lot of tools that are actually good at that. Second of all, if you're going into the creative space, you're doing it because you have ideas and you want to create them, and you're looking for tools that can help you do that. Not because you're trying to just generate as much content time as physically possible.""Dave Wiskus, the founder and CEO of Nebula, a streaming service for creators, told Mashable that this tech has the potential to make content creation more accessible.  Beyond idea creation, Wiskus sees use of ChatGPT and Midjourney to be a set of creative starter tools that will set creators up for success if they have raw talent that may once not have been put to use.  ""Autotune didn't destroy singing: It only made people with a different kind of creativity more likely to find a good way to express that creativity,"" Wiskus said. ""Photoshop didn't ruin photography. It just made it so that more people could get into photography; it made photography more accessible so that we could get better art from more artists. I think that AI, at least as we understand these tools today, will give the same effect.""The simple answer to how generative AI affects the creator economy, or any job, really, is that it saves you time. None of these tools are perfect, yet. That's why Duncan encourages his clients to use it for everything they can — from finding recipes to getting movie recommendations — to get to know what it does well and what it doesn't do well.""For now, my suggestion to every content creator has been: You have to become the master of what currently exists,"" Duncan said. ""Because you don't want to start from ground zero when the new product comes out.""The pitfallsCurrently, generative AI is still pretty stupid. It's not great at producing complex videos, streamlining the process of creator identification, writing anything well on the first go, or even coming up with completely original ideas. And, of course, there are copyright issues. And there's a fear that, because so many creators are being encouraged to use AI, they'll all have the same creative ideas.Rem Darbinyan, who works both in the AI world and the influencer marketing world as the CEO of SmartClick, an AI and machine learning solutions provider, and Viral Mango, a micro- and nano-influencer marketing platform, told Mashable that generative AI is an ""amazing tool"" for creators, but if everyone starts using it in similar ways, it could affect the way creators come up with new ideas.

""I'm expecting that it's gonna be some kind of erosion of human creativity,"" Darbinyan said. He worries that instead of exercising our creative muscles, we'll start using tools like ChatGPT as a crutch. ""Over time, the more we rely on AI, the less creative we're going to become and more we're going to rely on AI to generate ideas.""Darbinyan added that, of course, we don't know for sure. These tools are incredibly new, but creativity is simply something we should consider. Wiskus, for his part, isn't entirely sure that this kind of AI actually will hurt human creativity — it might just change it.""The most likely scenario isn't that AI destroys human creativity,"" Wiskus said. ""It's going to be that humans — creative humans — find new ways to use new tools to express that creativity.""The future of generative AI and the creator economyIt's pretty inarguable that generative AI is having a strong impact on the creator economy today, but it's unclear if its impact will grow stronger or stay stagnant. Generative AI, in the way we know and use it today, is relatively new. ChatGPT was only officially launched on November 30, 2022, the data that powers it is only updated through 2021, and, as OpenAI admits, it has limitations including ""social biases, hallucinations, and adversarial prompts."" With each new update, those limitations will likely decrease.Despite the potential drawbacks, using generative AI saves time, opens up creators to new ideas and approaches, and, at its core, is pretty fun to play around with if you're a creator. Schaefer-Charlton, Valentine, and Veitch told Duncane they had a lot of fun creating the videos ChatGPT helped them ideate on.Duncan said he doesn't know which of the many ChatGPT-fueled concepts the three creators ultimately chose to record, and they haven't posted all of the content they took with each other yet. But he says the process presented a perfect example of how creators can work with AI to ""make themselves more effective in what they're trying to do."" The creators who refuse to use these tools could risk being overtaken by creators who do use AI tools. But it's important to remember that this is new, it's unexplored, and, despite all the fascinating work it can do, AI isn't a replacement for anything truly meaningful yet.""We have no idea what's actually gonna happen,"" Harrod said. ""Five months ago, no one would have predicted what is happening right now. It's just very much a moving target to try to make predictions on these types of things.""For now, Harrod and other creators are just playing around with the tools and seeing what they can create.

He added that even as Accenture, and its customers, are both excited about the potential of using generative AI, large language models and generative AI cannot be applied to every practice. Internally, the company has identified over 300 use cases where generative AI can have a tangible impact. This is across aspects like service delivery, consulting and technology, taking a foundation model and training it with internal data to create a private model for the company.The company is seeing early adopters in the financial services, retail and government sectors start trial projects, he said and added that cost would also be a factor in determining how fast enterprises would adopt these tools.  The potential to unlock the transformative power of AI ranges from unlocking the power of creativity, driving technology transformation through intelligent automation powered by AI and empowering human and AI collaboration, said Ghosh.     100574814Also read | IT clients push for generative AI-based solutions to drive productivityHowever, given that it’s still early days, one needs to be careful. “There are issues related to hallucinations – sometimes it just gives you the wrong answer,” said Ghosh. “We believe generative AI is not the solution for everything in the enterprise,” he said.

With that comes the increasing need to consider AI risk management, particularly in areas where AI has the potential to make or inform decisions about individuals. The field of employment is a prime example of this.  In this blog, we look at the current (though evolving) legal and regulatory landscape in the UK regarding the use of AI in employment, as well as how employers might navigate their way through it.  The regulatory landscape When it comes to worldwide regulation of AI, there is currently no consensus as to approach.

Data protection: Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, uses the data it is given to identify patterns and create new and original data or content. Any employers using data in this way must ensure they do so in a manner which is compliant with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR. See the ICO’s Guidance on AI and data protection for more information. Monitoring and surveillance: Reports suggest that a third of workers are being digitally monitored at work, for example via remotely controlled webcams or tracking software. Royal Mail for instance recently admitted to using tracking technology to monitor the speed of postal workers. As above, employers should ensure compliance with data protection legislation in any monitoring of its workforce, as well as ensuring it doesn’t breach the right to privacy under the Human Rights Act 1998. Unfair dismissal: Employees with over two years’ service have the right not to be unfairly dismissed under the Employment Rights Act 1996. In the event AI reduces the need for employees to carry out a particular type of work, employers should ensure an appropriate procedure is followed before making any decisions in respect of those staff members. Where dismissal is contemplated, they must ensure that there is a fair reason for dismissal. Care should also be taken to ensure that the way AI is used does not breach the implied term of trust and confidence between employers and employees, since doing so could give employees the right to bring a constructive unfair dismissal claim.

Retain a human element in decision making, to ensure managers have final responsibility for decisions.

Artificial Intelligence in employment: the regulatory and legal landscape
Blog
18.05.2023        






It won’t have escaped your attention that AI is in the news a lot at the moment. Following the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, not a week seems to go by without headlines either extolling its benefits or panicking about its risks.
Irrespective of which side of the fence you sit on, what is clear is that rapidly advancing AI is here to stay. With that comes the increasing need to consider AI risk management, particularly in areas where AI has the potential to make or inform decisions about individuals. The field of employment is a prime example of this. 
In this blog, we look at the current (though evolving) legal and regulatory landscape in the UK regarding the use of AI in employment, as well as how employers might navigate their way through it. 
The regulatory landscape
When it comes to worldwide regulation of AI, there is currently no consensus as to approach. While the EU is preparing strict regulation and tough restrictions on the use of AI, with Italy banning ChatGPT over privacy concerns, the UK is planning “an innovative and iterative approach” to regulation.
In its recently published White Paper A pro-innovation approach to AI regulation, rather than introducing new legislation the UK Government proposes a system of non-statutory principles overseen and implemented by existing regulators.
What this means for the employment sector is that the Government intends to “encourage” the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Information Commissioner to work with the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate to issue joint guidance on the use of AI systems in recruitment or employment. In particular, the Government envisages the joint guidance will:

Clarify the type of information businesses should provide when implementing AI systems.
Identify appropriate supply chain management processes, such as due diligence or AI impact assessments.
Suggest proportionate measures for bias detection, mitigation and monitoring.
Provide suggestions for the provision of contestability and redress routes.

Quite whether this approach is the one that the Government will adopt, however, was left in question following Rishi Sunak’s comments on his way to the G7 Conference. Here he adopted what felt like a more cautious tone, emphasising the need for AI to be used “safely and securely, and with guardrails in place”. Could this be an indication that a move to a more regulated position might be on the cards?
For more detailed analysis on the Government’s current White Paper, Ian De Freitas (a partner in our Data, IP and Technology Disputes team), provides helpful commentary in his article Regulating Artificial Intelligence. In the article he explores the five common principles proposed by the Government, assessing them against other recent developments.
The legal landscape
In the absence of specific legislation governing AI in the workplace, and pending possible guidance, it is important employers understand how existing legal risks and obligations may affect their use of AI. These include:

Discrimination: There has been much said about the risk of bias in algorithms and AI creating or replicating existing discrimination: Amazon for example famously had to scrap an AI recruiting tool which taught itself that male candidates were preferable to female.

Care should also be taken to ensure that the way AI is used does not breach the implied term of trust and confidence between employers and employees, since doing so could give employees the right to bring a constructive unfair dismissal claim.

What can employers do about AI?
We have provided detailed commentary on using AI in employment in two blogs:

AI in recruitment
Artificial intelligence in the workplace: helpful for harmful?

In summary, employers may want to consider the following:

Develop a strategy for the use of AI in the workplace, with consideration as when its use is and isn’t acceptable.
Introduce a policy (or update existing policies) regarding the appropriate use of AI by staff.
Use AI impact assessments to identify and mitigate any risks when introducing AI into the workplace.
Retain a human element in decision making, to ensure managers have final responsibility for decisions.
Ensure full transparency over when and how AI is used, especially when it impacts employees or potential employees.
Deliver training on the use of AI, ensuring it covers issues such as appropriate use of data, accuracy and bias.

The changing nature of jobs
There is no escaping the fact that AI has the potential to radically transform employment as we know it. Recent reports predict that AI could “replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs”. With that comes concerns about the treatment of workers and the erosion of workers’ rights (for example as highlighted by the TUC in its latest conference).
Employers will need to prepare strategically for the changing nature of work and the need to integrate AI into workplace operations. Currently there are likely to be more questions than answers: will there be a need to redesign roles or change work allocation and workflow processes? How can employees be supported in this transition? Is there a need to invest in workforce training to help employees develop the skills needed to work with AI or take on different roles? Regardless, with AI likely to impact most jobs in some way, there is a need for employers to look afresh at their workforce strategies in order to keep pace with the rapid changes that AI might bring.

",,,,,,,,"It won’t have escaped your attention that AI is in the news a lot at the moment. Following the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, not a week seems to go by without headlines either extolling its benefits or panicking about its risks. Irrespective of which side of the fence you sit on, what is clear is that rapidly advancing AI is here to stay. With that comes the increasing need to consider AI risk management, particularly in areas where AI has the potential to make or inform decisions about individuals. The field of employment is a prime example of this.&#160; In this blog, we look at the current (though evolving) legal and regulatory landscape in the UK regarding the use of AI in employment, as well as how employers might navigate their way through it.&#160; The regulatory landscape When it comes to worldwide regulation of AI, there is currently no consensus as to approach. While the EU is preparing strict regulation and tough restrictions on the use of AI, with Italy banning ChatGPT over privacy concerns, the UK is planning “an innovative and iterative approach” to regulation. In its recently published White Paper A pro-innovation approach to AI regulation, rather than introducing new legislation the UK Government proposes a system of non-statutory principles overseen and implemented by existing regulators. What this means for the employment sector is that the Government intends to “encourage” the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Information Commissioner to work with the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate to issue joint guidance on the use of AI systems in recruitment or employment. In particular, the Government envisages the joint guidance will: Clarify the type of information businesses should provide when implementing AI systems. Identify appropriate supply chain management processes, such as due diligence or AI impact assessments. Suggest proportionate measures for bias detection, mitigation and monitoring. Provide suggestions for the provision of contestability and redress routes. Quite whether this approach is the one that the Government will adopt, however, was left in question following Rishi Sunak’s comments on his way to the G7 Conference. Here he adopted what felt like a more cautious tone, emphasising the need for AI to be used “safely and securely, and with guardrails in place”. Could this be an indication that a move to a more regulated position might be on the cards? For more detailed analysis on the Government’s current White Paper, Ian De Freitas (a partner in our Data, IP and Technology Disputes team), provides helpful commentary in his article Regulating Artificial Intelligence. In the article he explores the five common principles proposed by the Government, assessing them against other recent developments. The legal landscape In the absence of specific legislation governing AI in the workplace, and pending possible guidance, it is important employers understand how existing legal risks and obligations may affect their use of AI. These include: Discrimination: There has been much said about the risk of bias in algorithms and AI creating or replicating existing discrimination: Amazon for example famously had to scrap an AI recruiting tool which taught itself that male candidates were preferable to female. Existing protections from discrimination under the Equality Act 2010 continue to apply to all forms of AI used in employment, and employers should ensure the AI they use is not in breach of that. Acas’ article My boss is an algorithm takes a more detailed look at the ethics of algorithms in the workplace. Data protection: Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, uses the data it is given to identify patterns and create new and original data or content. Any employers using data in this way must ensure they do so in a manner which is compliant with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR. See the ICO’s Guidance on AI and data protection for more information. Monitoring and surveillance: Reports suggest that a third of workers are being digitally monitored at work, for example via remotely controlled webcams or tracking software. Royal Mail for instance recently admitted to using tracking technology to monitor the speed of postal workers. As above, employers should ensure compliance with data protection legislation in any monitoring of its workforce, as well as ensuring it doesn’t breach the right to privacy under the Human Rights Act 1998. Unfair dismissal: Employees with over two years’ service have the right not to be unfairly dismissed under the Employment Rights Act 1996. In the event AI reduces the need for employees to carry out a particular type of work, employers should ensure an appropriate procedure is followed before making any decisions in respect of those staff members. Where dismissal is contemplated, they must ensure that there is a fair reason for dismissal. Care should also be taken to ensure that the way AI is used does not breach the implied term of trust and confidence between employers and employees, since doing so could give employees the right to bring a constructive unfair dismissal claim.

One recent study from researchers at OpenAI (the start-up behind ChatGPT) and the University of Pennsylvania concluded that for about 80 percent of jobs, at least 10 percent of tasks could be automated using the technology behind such tools.“Everybody I talk to, supersmart people, doctors, lawyers, C.E.O.s, other economists, your brain just first goes to, ‘Oh, how can generative A.I. replace this thing that humans are doing?’” said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI.But that’s not the only option, he said. “The other thing that I wish people would do more of is think about what new things could be done now that was never done before. Obviously that’s a much harder question.” It is also, he added, “where most of the value is.”How technology makers design, business leaders use and policymakers regulate A.I. tools will determine how generative A.I. ultimately affects jobs, Brynjolfsson and other economists say. And not all the choices are necessarily bleak for workers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA.I. can complement human labor rather than replace it. Plenty of companies use A.I. to automate call centers, for instance. But a Fortune 500 company that provides business software has instead used a tool like ChatGPT to give its workers live suggestions for how to respond to customers. Brynjolfsson and his co-authors of a study compared the call center employees who used the tool to those who didn’t. They found that the tool boosted productivity by 14 percent on average, with most of the gains made by low-skilled workers. Customer sentiment was also higher and employee turnover lower in the group that used the tool.David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that A.I. could potentially be used to deliver “expertise on tap” in jobs like health care delivery, software development, law, and skilled repair. “That offers an opportunity to enable more workers to do valuable work that relies on some of that expertise,” he said.Workers can focus on different tasks. As A.T.M.s automated the tasks of dispensing cash and taking deposits, the number of bank tellers increased, according to an analysis by James Bessen, a researcher at the Boston University School of Law. This was partly because while bank branches required fewer workers, they became cheaper to open — and banks opened more of them. But banks also changed the job description. After A.T.M.s, tellers focused less on counting cash and more on building relationships with customers, to whom they sold products like credit cards. Few jobs can be completely automated by generative A.I. But using an A.I. tool for some tasks may free up workers to expand their work on tasks that can’t be automated.Editors’ Picks‘I Was Settling Into My Morning Commute on the 4 Train’ July 21, 2024The Best and Worst Habits for Your Teeth July 12, 2024What Responsibility Do I Have to Ensure the Safety of an Illicit Cat? July 17, 2024New technology can lead to new jobs. Farming employed nearly 42 percent of the work force in 1900, but because of automation and advances in technology, it accounted for just 2 percent by 2000. The huge reduction in farming jobs didn’t result in widespread unemployment. Instead, technology created a lot of new jobs. A farmer in the early 20th century would not have imagined computer coding, genetic engineering or trucking. In an analysis that used census data, Autor and his co-authors found that 60 percent of current occupational specialties did not exist 80 years ago.Of course, there’s no guarantee that workers will be qualified for new jobs, or that they’ll be good jobs. And none of this just happens, said Daron Acemoglu, an economics professor at M.I.T. and a co-author of “Power and Progress: Our 1,000-Year Struggle Over Technology & Prosperity.”“If we make the right choices, then we do create new types of jobs, which is crucial for wage growth and also for truly reaping the productivity benefits,” Acemoglu said. “But if we do not make the right choices, much less of this can happen.” — Sarah KesslerAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIN CASE YOU MISSED IT Martha’s model behavior. The lifestyle entrepreneur Martha Stewart became the oldest person to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue this week. Stewart, 81, told The Times that it was a “large challenge” to have the confidence to pose but that two months of Pilates had helped. She isn’t the first person over 60 to have the distinction: Maye Musk, the mother of Elon Musk, graced the cover last year at the age of 74.TikTok block. Montana became the first state to ban the Chinese short video app, barring app stores from offering TikTok within its borders starting Jan. 1. The ban is expected to be difficult to enforce, and TikTok users in the state have sued the government, saying the measure violates their First Amendment rights and giving a glimpse of the potential blowback if the federal government tries to block TikTok nationwide.Banker blame game. Greg Becker, the ex-C.E.O. of Silicon Valley Bank, blamed “rumors and misconceptions” for a run on deposits in his first public comments since the lender collapsed in March. Becker and former top executives of the failed Signature Bank also told a Senate committee investigating their role in the collapse of the banks that they would not give back millions of dollars in pay.ImageA brief history of tech C.E.O.s seeking constraints When OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, testified in Congress this week and called for regulation of generative artificial intelligence, some lawmakers hailed it as a “historic” move. In fact, asking lawmakers for new rules is a move straight out of the tech industry playbook. Silicon Valley’s most powerful executives have long gone to Washington to demonstrate their commitment to rules in an attempt to shape them while simultaneously unleashing some of the world’s most powerful and transformative technologies without pause.One reason: A federal rule is much easier to manage than different regulations in different states, Bruce Mehlman, a political consultant and former technology policy official in the Bush administration, told DealBook. Clearer regulations also give investors more confidence in a sector, he added.The strategy sounds sensible, but if history is a useful guide, the reality can be messier than the rhetoric:In December 2021, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, was one of six executives to testify about digital assets in the House and call for regulatory clarity. His company had just submitted a proposal for a “unified joint regime,” he told lawmakers. A year later, Bankman-Fried’s businesses were bankrupt, and he was facing criminal fraud and illegal campaign contribution charges.In 2019, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post, “The Internet Needs New Rules,” based on failures in content moderation, election integrity, privacy and data management at the company. Two years later, independent researchers found that misinformation was more rampant on the platform than in 2016, even though the company had spent billions trying to stamp it out.In 2018, the Apple chief Tim Cook said he was generally averse to regulation but supported more strict data privacy rules, saying, “It’s time for a set of people to think about what can be done.” But to maintain its business in China, one of its biggest markets, Apple has largely ceded control of customer data to the government as part of its requirements to operate there.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBuzzword of the week: ‘Algospeak’ Platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter use algorithms to identify and moderate problematic content. To avert these digital moderators and allow free exchange about taboo topics, a linguistic code has developed. It’s called “algospeak.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“A linguistic arms race is raging online — and it isn’t clear who’s winning,” writes Roger J. Kreuz, a psychology professor at the University of Memphis. Posts about sensitive issues like politics, sex or suicide can be flagged by algorithms and taken down, leading to the use of creative misspellings and stand-ins, like “seggs” and “mascara” for sex, “unalive” for death and “cornucopia” for homophobia. There is a history of responding to prohibitions with code, Kruz notes, such as 19th-century Cockney rhyming slang in England or “Aesopian,” an allegorical language used to circumvent censorship in Tsarist Russia.Algorithms aren’t alone in not picking up on the code. The euphemisms and misspellings are particularly ubiquitous among marginalized communities. But the hidden language also sometimes eludes humans, leading to potentially fraught miscommunications online. In February, the celebrity Julia Fox found herself in an awkward exchange with a victim of sexual assault after misunderstanding a post about “mascara” and had to issue a public apology for responding inappropriately to what she thought was a discussion about makeup.ImageThanks for reading!We’d like your feedback.

One in eight (12%) expect numbers will remain about the same, while 17% are unsure.Among workers themselves, 62% expect more jobs to be lost than gained. Yet when they are asked whether jobs like their own will primarily be done by humans or by robots or AI 30 years from now, the majority (59%) still see a human future. Only a quarter (25%) expect their line of work to become dominated by machines.


Likewise, few workers say they are worried about the impact that robotics or artificial intelligence will have on their current job (14%) or their future career (22%).Younger workers – who have much more career still to get through – are unsurprisingly more likely to be worried than those who are on the cusp of aging out of working life. Even so, 18-24 year old workers are still more likely to be unworried (48%) than worried (36%), including only 7% who are “very worried”.Among those workers who specifically think that more jobs will be lost to automation than will be created, 65% say they aren’t worried about the impact on their own career.How much do Britons think they understand about AI?Half of Britons say they either know a great deal (7%) or a fair amount (44%) about what artificial intelligence is, while 41% say they don’t know very much and 5% say they know nothing at all.Slightly fewer people (41%) claim to know much about “the issues surrounding artificial intelligence”.As is generally the case in opinion polls, men are more likely than women to claim greater knowledge, and in this case younger people are more likely to feel they have a grip on the topic than their elders.


When it comes to the overall impact that artificial intelligence will have, Britons are more likely to be pessimistic (35%) than optimistic (19%), with a further 34% saying they are neither optimistic or pessimistic.


The more familiar a person feels they are with the issues surrounding AI, the more likely they are to have either optimistic or pessimistic expectations for the technology – although the optimistic side grows far more rapidly with awareness. While only 5% of those who confess no understanding of the issues around AI say they are optimistic about the tech, fully 28% have a negative view. Among those who consider themselves to have a great deal of understanding, there is a 35pt increase to 40% with an optimistic view, compared to a 15pt increase to 43% holding a negative view.Most Britons lack confidence in tech companies and government on AIEarlier this week, the CEO of OpenAI (the firm which owns ChatGPT) told a US Congress hearing that AI could “cause significant harm to the world”, expressing willingness to work with lawmakers regarding his own company’s technology, and made a number of proposals for how to regulate artificial intelligence.The British public is, however, sceptical that those able to influence the future of AI can be trusted to do so.Two thirds of Britons say they have little to no confidence that technology companies that are developing AI will do so responsibly (66%), or in the ability of current and future UK governments to effectively regulate the development and use of AI (68%).


Expectations are dramatically different depending on how optimistic or pessimistic people are about AI. Fully 52% of those who are optimistic about the impact artificial intelligence will have say they have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in tech companies to develop the technology responsibly – although far fewer have the same level of faith in the government’s ability to regulate it effectively (36%).Among those with pessimistic expectations for AI, just 5% have much confidence in either group.

There has been no shortage of panicky headlines in the mainstream media about how artificial intelligence will eliminate jobs. But the nuance is that AI will influence many, if not most jobs, in some way, rather than replace them wholesale. Managers and professionals, in turn, will be empowered and encouraged to look at business problems in new ways. This will recast careers and workplaces in the months and years ahead in unexpected ways.


“Almost all jobs will be affected by AI because the core tools of the business world are going to be AI-enhanced at some point, if they aren’t already,"" says John Behrens, Ph.D., professor and digital technologies leader at the University of Notre Dame. ""This will increase productivity across the board and eventually change what work looks like for most of us.”

With jobs focused on AI, ‘organizations are not just pulling from computer science backgrounds,” says Diane Gutiw, vice president of analytics, AI and machine learning for CGI. “Nurses are being brought in as data analysts to help understand the implications of AI on healthcare. Accountants and financial analysts are able to provide specific insights into how AI can be utilized to make the organization more profitable. Having a wide range of backgrounds is useful because there is such a wealth of understanding in the data of how people actually work and helps bring in a more focused, human element to yield the best results.”

PROMOTED
However, there’s a twist to this. While the internet led to replacing manual processes with digital ones, the incorporation of AI into jobs means rethinking ways of working as many tasks are eliminated — while new ones are created. ""AI will bolster decision-making and automate repetitive chores thereby altering work roles and responsibilities,” says Vrinda Khurjekar, senior director at Searce. “Professionals and managers ought to learn how AI may be incorporated into their workflow and how it can improve their productivity and judgment. This might require changing their professional objectives to positions that can benefit from AI, such as emphasizing the development of strategic thinking, creativity, adaptability, and emotional intelligence.”

The skills that will matter in the emerging AI era consists of “organizational leadership skills of excellent cognition, creativity, communication, and collaboration,” says Behrens. “Managers must provide vision and stability for teams navigating the social and business disruption AI will bring.”

There are many flavors to AI, and many potential business use cases. “If you’re looking at adopting AI, I recommend focusing on real business problems first, rather than just generally saying AI is being implemented,” says Gutiw. “Managers should ask themselves questions about whether AI is something they want to support resource management, contact centers, or getting information to people through conversational AI.”

This means “a real shift in how we work,” says Gutiw. “It's changing how our vendor partners are designing their technologies to support that. And high-functioning analytic organizations are teaching their employees how to capitalize on it regardless of their background.”
Such abilities will be essential “for managing the complicated and dynamic commercial landscape and cannot be easily copied by AI,” Khurjekar elaborates. “Routine manual and repetitive work that can be automated by AI, on the other hand, may be less in demand for certain abilities. Professionals should concentrate on acquiring abilities that complement AI and can enhance their jobs.”
The bottom line is that “it comes down to understanding how AI can help do things like reduce risk, decide on an investment, make sure machinery and assets have less downtime and extend their useful lifespan,” Gutiw says. “Successfully implementing AI can take away the menial tasks so that people can do more interesting work focused on their capabilities and expertise.”
Managers and professionals need to prepare for what Behrens calls “the biggest shock” coming with AI — that is, “replacing entry and low-level white-collar activities,” he explains. For example, knowledge worker roles will be impacted by “first-draft automation,” in which AI is used to “write the first draft of genre-specific materials such as press releases, job descriptions, marketing materials and legal documents.”
The latest versions of AI “can do things that earlier software could not, that the business value of text and image data has dramatically escalated, with strategic implications for their industry,” says Behrens.
First-draft automation is already advancing to the next stage, which includes “writing drafts of 3D models and computer code — where it is already having a big impact,” says Behrens. “First-draft automation will increase the need for those who can use AI to rapidly generate text, code and models, while also knowing how to evaluate it and fit it into a larger software or knowledge ecosystem.""
Gutiw also points out that companies are “headed into a resource shortage with the baby boomers retiring. If AI is able to generate things that were onerous to write, like proposals or documents, it has to be expected that we're going to shift how we work with those things.”
This doesn’t mean non-technical business professionals need to understand the intricacies of building or deploying AI apps. That’s because it’s becoming easier and easier to work with AI, just as it has been with mobile and no-code and low-code apps. “They should have a rudimentary awareness of how AI functions, its potential, and its limitations,” says Khurjekar. “This will help them to work with technical teams efficiently, embrace AI solutions with knowledge, and find ways to incorporate AI into their business plans.”
AI may be disruptive, but disruption equals opportunity and industry watchers feel positive about the future of management careers in the age of AI. “Professionals and managers need to embrace the opportunities that AI can provide, be proactive in evaluating the possible influence of AI on their career goals, concentrate on building complementary skills, have a fundamental understanding of AI ideas, and be aware of the risks that AI may present,” says Khurjekar. “Professionals and managers can succeed in the age of AI by navigating the changing business landscape with the proper mentality, abilities, and collaboration with AI technologies.”
Behrens is also optimistic, noting that this ""is an extremely exciting time for leaders who are tech savvy, forward looking and open to change. The rate of innovation will increase exponentially, leading to great possibilities and challenges. The key for success will be to shift one’s perspective from ‘how do I use this’ to ‘how do I reimagine my business and my customer?’ We will see a whole new generation of life-changing companies.""

Last week, at its annual I/O conference, Google spent hours detailing how large language models would help the knowledge workers of the world unload their busywork onto a legion of eager, capable neural networks. The company will soon introduce AI functions into programs such as Gmail, Google Sheets, and Google Slides that will allow users to type simple commands and receive complex outputs: entire email compositions, for example, or auto-generated tables. The future that Google is promising feels familiar—it’s all about heightened convenience and one-click efficiency—and I hate it. Workplace AI feels like the purest distillation of a corrosive ideology that demands frictionless productivity from workers: The easier our labor becomes, the more of it we can do, and the more of it we’ll be expected to do.This is how AI comes for our jobs, one ChatGPT-generated slide deck and inbox integration at a time. It’s a vision of the true AI apocalypse on the horizon that feels more like a soulless grind. Humanity isn’t to be obliterated by a vengeful artificial sentience, and office workers probably won’t be replaced en masse with machines; instead, we will be expected to produce and behave more like robots ourselves. Less Skynet, more Bain & Company.In its idealized state, generative AI is the ultimate productivity tool. Large language models are intelligent-seeming (if fundamentally unreliable), trained on mountains of information, and eminently capable. They produce LinkedIn-sounding prose that’s perfect for just circling back. Running a ChatGPT window on a work computer has already become akin to writing with spell check for some people. ChatGPT’s Code Interpreter plug-in is able to edit video, pull and analyze information from complex spreadsheets, and build dazzling custom charts and visualizations with a single prompt.The promise of artificial intelligence is automation, and the promise of automation is to remove friction from the process of production—of typing words, of crunching numbers, of synthesizing information. Generative-AI tools are, in essence, pattern-recognition engines, and their wide deployment is seen by evangelists as the beginning of a rapid expansion of the amount of intelligence in the world, whatever that means. It is a vision of productivity defined by endless possibility.We’ve seen this one before. Time and again, a piece of technology promises to increase productivity by chipping away at the inefficiencies in our lives. We’re told that it will liberate us—from the tyranny of our inboxes or from toiling on factory floors—and we will recoup our time, the most precious commodity of all. But that time is usually reinvested into more labor. The logic is simple and circular: Increased efficiency frees us up to be more productive. Frederick Winslow Taylor and his stopwatch ruthlessly optimized the factory floor at Bethlehem Steel by surveilling workers and forcing them to eliminate breaks and streamline their motions. The principles of Taylorism changed business and management forever. But its gains weren’t to the benefit of the worker, who was simply driven to produce more each shift.The story repeats with many prosaic office technologies. Email didn’t dismantle the culture of interoffice memos and workplace correspondence, but it did make them readily accessible all the time. Slack, the corporate email killer, hasn’t unclogged our inboxes. Instead, it is merely another workplace channel workers must tend to—another way to be productive and available to our colleagues and bosses, instantly, at any time. Why should we expect generative AI to free us from this familiar cycle?Read: Slackers of the world, unite!In a world where the cost of producing content, correspondence, research, and code approaches zero, it stands to reason that the forces of capitalism would respond by demanding as much of it as possible. And even if humans aren’t the ones producing every solitary word, phrase, sound, or string of numbers, humans will be tasked with generating, editing, and corralling all this synthetic media. If artificial intelligence is coming for our jobs, its plan is to turn us all into middle managers of overlapping, interacting AI systems. The only problem? Middle management is stressful, grinding, usually thankless work. People speak derisively about middle managers because their outputs are hard to define and monitor—they are viewed, sometimes unfairly, as a mere link in the chain.When I look at a future dominated by generative-AI tools that are embedded in every nook and cranny of industry, I fear the coming grind. I see inboxes crushed under the weight of robot responses and rapid-generated slide decks. A sea of forgettable, lorem-ipsum emails whose sole purpose is to trigger other robots to reply to their polite, authoritative MBA-speak. I see creative industries strip-mined of their humanity in order to create content at the vertiginous scale of a generative-AI internet. What happens to the music industry when anyone can construct a banger of a song in the style of any popular artist? Likely not the destruction of the artist in total, but a devaluation of her skills—yet another technological crisis for the working musician.One could imagine a future with grueling record-company contracts that demand multiple albums a year from artists, now that they can outsource lyric writing, vocals, and studio sessions. More content means more grease for the algorithmic gears and AI-powered recommendation engines of streaming platforms. The same logic applies to my profession: Why wouldn’t publications expect writers to churn out five or six stories a day, now that they have their own AI-based research and writing assistants? Such a tsunami of forgettable, mass-produced content would, of course, dilute advertising markets and drive down the costs of selling against that content, which would mean a greater need to produce … more content.You can already see the outlines of this dull, efficient future coming into view. Studios like Netflix are toying with the idea of letting generative-AI programs sketch elements for animated shows, and rumors are circulating in Hollywood that studios are mulling the use of AI to write first drafts (to be punched up later by humans) amid the Writer’s Guild strike. The content sludge is also present in Big Tech’s plans to reimagine search as an interactive, chatbot-powered walled garden. Type a question, get a canonical answer in the voice of a friendly assistant. It’s a process that, as my colleague Damon Beres recently wrote, “makes the internet feel smaller” and, potentially, functions as a dam, holding back search traffic to websites everywhere. In this imagining, search engines don’t need publishers to provide a quality product—they simply need a tonnage of copy to keep the algorithmic machine running.In 2017, I interviewed Jonathan Albright, a researcher who showed me how he’d stumbled upon a strange phenomenon across YouTube. He’d found a trove of channels comprising tens of thousands of videos. Most were crudely assembled slideshows, using text and images copied from political-news articles across the web. A halting computer voice read quotes from the text as the slideshow played. The channels were publishing new, cookie-cutter videos every three minutes. Most of it was unwatchable. Some of the videos hadn’t registered a view yet, but others had hundreds of thousands of plays. After some digging, he’d found that the videos were generated by an AI to influence YouTube’s recommendation algorithms. The content of the video was irrelevant—what was important was the signal it was sending to the platform: that there was a demand for political news videos.At the time, I was unnerved by this idea of a shadow economy of robots, making content for robots whose sole purpose was to tilt a platform slightly to one’s favor. Now the shadow economy feels like a template for a generative-AI future. The optimistic argument for these types of productivity tools is always that they unlock human potential and creativity—and they will. But it’s hard to imagine what this looks like at scale. Creativity is an inefficient, nonlinear process. The joy and the magic are in the friction. Productivity is, in many ways, its opposite. And AI is, above all else, a fully realized productivity tool with a mandate to eliminate friction wherever possible. AI is coming for our jobs, our creativity, and our culture—just probably not in the ways you expect. It’s not quite an apocalypse. It’s far more boring than that.About the AuthorCharlie Warzel is a staff writer at The Atlantic and the author of its newsletter Galaxy Brain, about technology, media, and big ideas.

Here’s a look inside the system.ChatGPT is built to create text strings that make sense across multiple sentences and paragraphs. Justine Goode / NBC News / Getty ImagesPrintSaveCreate your free profile or log in to save this articleMay 17, 2023, 8:00 AM EDTBy JoElla Carman and Jasmine CuiBy now, you’ve heard of ChatGPT and its text generation capabilities. It has passed a business school exam, confounded teachers looking to spot cheaters and helped people craft emails to their co-workers and loved ones.That it has accomplished those tasks is notable, because exams, essays and emails require correct answers. But being correct isn’t really the point of ChatGPT — it’s more of a byproduct of its objective: producing natural-sounding text.So how do artificial intelligence chatbots work, and why do they get some answers right and some answers really, really wrong? Here’s a look inside the box.The technology behind large language models like ChatGPT is similar to the predictive text feature you see when you compose a message on your phone. Your phone will evaluate what has been typed in and calculate probabilities of what’s most likely to follow, based on its model and what it has observed from your past behavior.Anyone familiar with the process knows how many different directions a string of text can branch into. Unlike the phone’s predictive text feature, ChatGPT is said to be generative (the G in GPT). It isn’t making one-off predictions; instead it’s meant to create text strings that make sense across multiple sentences and paragraphs. The output is meant to make sense and read as though a person wrote it, and it should match up with the prompt. So what helps it pick a good next word, and then another word after that, and on and on? The internal referenceThere is no database of facts or a dictionary inside the machine to help it “understand” words. Instead, the system treats words mathematically, as a collection of values. You can think of these values as representing some quality the word might have. For example, is the word complimentary or critical? Sweet or sour? Low or high? In theory, you could set these values wherever you like and find that you have come close to a word. Here is a fictional example to demonstrate the idea: The generator below is designed to return a different fruit based on the three qualities. Try changing any of the qualities to see how the output changes.That technique is called word embedding, and it isn’t new. It originated in the field of linguistics in the 1950s. While the example above uses just three “qualities,” in a large language model, the number of “qualities” for every word would be in the hundreds, allowing a very precise way to identify words. Learning to make senseWhen the model is new, the qualities associated with each word are set randomly, which isn’t very useful, because its ability to predict depends on their being very finely tuned. To get there, it needs to be trained on a lot of content. That is the large part of the large language model.A system like ChatGPT might be fed millions of webpages and digital documents. (Think about the entirety of Wikipedia, big news websites, blogs and digitized books.) The machine cycles through the training data one stretch at a time, blocking out a word in a sequence and calculating a “guess” at what values most closely represent what should go in the blank. When the right answer is revealed, the machine can use the difference between what it guessed and the actual word to improve.It’s a lengthy process. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, hasn’t published the details about how much training data went into ChatGPT or the computer power used to train it, but researchers from Nvidia, Stanford University and Microsoft estimate that, using 1,024 graphics processing units, it would have taken 34 days to train GPT 3, ChatGPT’s predecessor. One analyst estimated that the cost of computational resources to train and run large language models could stretch into the millions. RecommendedData GraphicsData GraphicsIn videos and maps, how the Trump assassination attempt unfoldedData GraphicsData GraphicsFertility is falling and populations are tapering, U.N. report capturing global changes revealsChatGPT also has an extra layer of training, referred to as reinforcement learning from human feedback. While previous training is about getting the model to fill in missing text, this phase is about getting it to put out strings that are coherent, accurate and conversational.During this stage, people rate the machine’s response, flagging output that is incorrect, unhelpful or even downright nonsensical. Using the feedback, the machine learns to predict whether humans will find its responses useful. OpenAI says this training makes the output of its model safer, more relevant and less likely to “hallucinate” facts. And researchers have said it is what aligns ChatGPT’s responses better with human expectations.At the end of the process, there is no record of the original training data inside the model. It doesn’t contain facts or quotes that can be referred to — just how related or unrelated words were to one another in action. Putting the training to useThis set of data turns out to be surprisingly powerful. When you type your query into ChatGPT, it translates everything into numbers using what it learned during training. Then it does the same series of calculations from above to predict the next word in its response. This time, there’s no hidden word to reveal; it just predicts. Thanks to its ability to refer to earlier parts of the conversation, it can keep it up page after page of realistic, human-sounding text that is sometimes, but not always, correct.LimitationsAt this point, there are plenty of disagreements about what AI is or will be capable of, but one thing is pretty well agreed upon — and prominently featured on the interfaces of ChatGPT, Google Bard and Microsoft Bing: These tools shouldn’t be relied on when accuracy is required. Large language models are able to identify text patterns, not facts. And a number of models, including ChatGPT, have knowledge cutoff dates, which means they can’t connect to the internet to learn new information. That’s in contrast to Microsoft’s Bing chatbot, which can query online resources. A large language model is also only as good as the material that was used to train it. Because models identify patterns between words, feeding an AI text that is dangerous or racist means the AI will learn text patterns that are dangerous or racist.OpenAI says it has created some guardrails to prevent it from serving that up, and ChatGPT says it is “trained to decline inappropriate requests,” as we discovered when it refused to write an angry email demanding a raise. But the company also admits that ChatGPT will still sometimes “respond to harmful instructions or exhibit biased behavior.”There are many useful ways to take advantage of the technology now, such as drafting cover letters, summarizing meetings or planning meals. The big question is whether improvements in the technology can push past some of its flaws, enabling it to create truly reliable text. MethodologyGraphics by JoElla Carman.

While many law firms are excited about the prospect of generative AI for legal work, there are a sizeable number that simply don’t know what the technology can do or how firms are approaching it, making adoption as much about education as technological fit

Many law firm attorneys feel positively about the prospect of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and such AI-enabling tools as ChatGPT, according to the Thomson Reuters Institute’s ChatGPT and Generative AI within Law Firms report released in April. Indeed, the report revealed that more than 80% of law firm leaders surveyed said they believed generative AI can be applied to legal work now, and more than half believed it actively should be applied to legal work.
Among the other respondents, however, the feeling was not necessarily distaste for generative AI, although some of that did exist. Instead, many are still simply unsure exactly what generative AI is or what it can do. Yet, considering the pace at which law firms have adopted technology previously, this is an understandable feeling given that the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT occurred only in November 2022.
Overall, the report found uncertainty across the board among law firm respondents: 25% said they did not know whether generative AI should be applied to legal work, and 21% did not know whether it should be applied to non-legal work. These feelings even extended to other forms of AI outside of generative AI/ChatGPT, as 24% did not know whether their firm uses AI outside of the generative context.
Jason Adaska, Director of the Innovation Lab at Holland & Hart, has a team of data scientists working on potential generative AI applications for the firm. Adaska says that because generative AI has appeared on the scene so quickly, there is “an increasing bifurcation in the conversations that I have” between people interested in using it and those unaware of its existence.
“Some people, they’ve seen it in the media, they’re kind of up to date with it,” he adds. “They may not come from a technology perspective, but at least they know about the conversation. Even in March I had some conversations with people who say, ‘I didn’t catch that. What is ChatGPT, what is this word you’re throwing at me?’”
Discovering how generative AI & ChatGPT can help
Similarly, Arsen Shirokov, National Director, Information Technology at McMillan, has already begun having conversations with internal stakeholders and external vendors about ways generative AI can be applied in his firm. A sticking point he’s run into, however, is that unlike previous legal technologies that have had a distinct use case, generative AI’s applications are so expansive that they can be hard to nail down.
“Almost everywhere else in technology, you say what this product is: this is an IG solution, this is a business workflow solution, this is an architecture solution, right? …With generative AI, I think we haven’t figured that out yet,” Shirokov says. “We don’t necessarily know which generative AI solutions are for research, for example. Take ChatGPT: It can also draft things for you, but for review, you cannot feed the bunch of documents to ChatGPT yet and just say, review this.”
Until those questions are answered, many lawyers also remain unsure of how their firms will handle generative AI on a wider scale. Our report found that 36% of respondents said they did not know whether their law firm had risk concerns around generative AI usage. Additionally, 19% did not know whether their firm had issued warnings against unauthorized generative AI use; and 22% did not know whether their firm had banned unauthorized generative AI use outright.


“How are we going to get people comfortable not just with the technology, but with the fact that they are interacting with a machine, and yet it doesn’t feel like you’re interacting with a machine?”


Even those respondents who reported their firm had underlying risk concerns over these advanced technologies counted a lack of technological maturity as one of those barriers. “A lack of understanding of the underlying risks,” wrote one respondent when asked why their firm had concerns around generative AI.
“Lack of insight/ability to control algorithms, data sets, and assumptions/biases of generated results. Lack of disclosure of disclaimers, boundaries, and assumptions when results return. Lack of ability to assess confidence in generated results,” wrote another.
As a result, for those law firms actively considering embracing generative AI — the report found 40% of firms were at least considering its use — encouraging adoption may be as much of a knowledge and informational issue as a technological issue. To that end, Jessica Lipson, Partner and Co-Chair of the Technology, Data & IP Department at Morrison Cohen, said her firm has been treating communication as a “high strategic issue” in potentially adopting generative AI technologies. “How are we going to get people comfortable not just with the technology, but with the fact that they are interacting with a machine, and yet it doesn’t feel like you’re interacting with a machine?” Lipson asks.
Part of the answer may take a cue from the 1989 film Field of Dreams: “If you build it, they will come.”
Holland & Hart’s Adaska says he’s gained interest in his team’s generative AI efforts by simply letting attorneys play around with the tool themselves. “I think that’s the story of the last few months in this,” Adaska adds. “A number of people who maybe would have either not paid attention or have been skeptical are being won over by actually trying things they thought weren’t possible and being pleasantly surprised.”

This adoption has quickly spread to the workplace. A survey done by the professional networking app Fishbowl in January 2023 found that already 43% of respondents were using ChatGPT in their workplace.Following this rapid adoption of generative AI such as ChatGPT, we’re reviewing preliminary academic research in today’s Chartpack to help guide strategic decision-making around GenAI integration.

Second-order effects such as potential wage impacts or job creation will be addressed in future Chartpacks for premium members.Who will be exposed to GenAI?A study published in March 2023 by Eloundou et al. examined the potential effects of GPTs1 on the labour market, specifically focusing on the tasks they could complete or augment within each profession. They found that 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by LLMs2. This is over 130 million people in the U.S. alone. Moreover, this impact rises significantly with income, affecting tasks within white-collar jobs the most. The study predicts that jobs that require a higher level of education or training are most likely to be exposed to LLMs. Jobs requiring a bachelor’s degree (2-4 years of training) could be most affected, with over 30% of these jobs expected to have at least 50% of their tasks exposed to LLMs. Examples of highly exposed jobs include information services, finance, publishing and telecommunications.How is GenAI affecting these occupations? While the academic literature is still in its infancy, a few initial studies on writing, coding and call-centre performance provide indications of GenAI’s initial effects.All of these studies found an increase in performance. Let us explain how.This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Italy banned the chatbot. New York City, Los Angeles Unified, Seattle, and Baltimore School Districts either banned or blocked access to generative AI tools, fearing that ChatGPT, Bard, and other content generation sites could tempt students to cheat on assignments, induce rampant plagiarism, and impede critical thinking. This week, US Congress heard testimony from Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, and AI researcher Gary Marcus as it weighed whether and how to regulate the technology.In a rapid about-face, however, a few governments are now embracing a less fearful and more hands-on approach to AI. New York City Schools chancellor David Banks announced yesterday that NYC is reversing its ban because “the knee jerk fear and risk overlooked the potential of generative AI to support students and teachers, as well as the reality that our students are participating in and will work in a world where understanding generative AI is crucial.” And yesterday, City of Boston chief information officer Santiago Garces sent guidelines to every city official encouraging them to start using generative AI “to understand their potential.” The city also turned on use of Google Bard as part of the City of Boston’s enterprise-wide use of Google Workspace so that all public servants have access.The “responsible experimentation approach” adopted in Boston—the first policy of its kind in the US—could, if used as a blueprint, revolutionize the public sector’s use of AI across the country and cause a sea change in how governments at every level approach AI. By promoting greater exploration of how AI can be used to improve government effectiveness and efficiency, and by focusing on how to use AI for governance instead of only how to govern AI, the Boston approach might help to reduce alarmism and focus attention on how to use AI for social good. Featured VideoHow This Guy Makes the World's Most Inventive ClocksBoston’s policy outlines several scenarios in which public servants might want to use AI to improve how they work, and even includes specific how-tos for effective prompt writing.Generative AI, city officials were told in an email that went out from the CIO to all city officials on May 18, is a great way to get started on memos, letters, and job descriptions, and might help to alleviate the work of overburdened public officials. The tools can also help public servants “translate” government-speak and legalese into plain English, which can make important information about public services more accessible to residents. The policy explains that public servants can indicate the reading level or audience in the prompt, allowing the AI model to generate text suitable for elementary school students or specific target audiences.AdvertisementGenerative AI can also help with translation into other languages so that a city’s non-English speaking populations can enjoy equal and easier access to information about policies and services affecting them. City officials were also encouraged to use generative AI to summarize lengthy pieces of text or audio into concise summaries, which could make it easier for government officials to engage in conversations with residents.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenThe Boston policy even explains how AI can help produce code snippets and assist less technical individuals.

By supporting responsible experimentation, transparency, and collective learning, it opens the door to realizing the potential of AI to do good in governance.

Apple has blocked the use of AI tools for some of its staffers, becoming the latest major firm to restrict the use of generative AI platforms at work, amid concerns employees may leak sensitive internal data.

Key Facts


According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple has barred its employees from using ChatGPT and other AI-powered services like Github’s Copilot, which helps developers write code.



The ban stems from concerns about the data-handling practices of these AI platforms—which are either owned or financially backed by Apple’s rival Microsoft—as it could compromise Apple’s proprietary code or other sensitive data, the report adds.



Rival smartphone maker Samsung implemented a similar ban on ChatGPT and other AI tools earlier this month, after discovering an accidental leak of sensitive code by an engineer who uploaded it to ChatGPT.



In January, Amazon banned staffers from sharing any code or confidential information with OpenAI’s chatbot after claiming it discovered examples of ChatGPT responses that resembled internal Amazon data.


In February, JPMorgan Chase severely restricted the internal use of ChatGPT to avoid potential regulatory pitfalls over the sharing of sensitive financial information with a third-party platform.


Since then, other banks such as Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs, have followed suit, banning the use of AI chatbots by staffers.

News Peg
Most companies banning the use of third-party AI tools are concerned about how services like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard store data shared with them on servers. The other complication stems from the fact that most chatbots and AI services rely on user inputs to train their models and may accidentally serve other users a company’s proprietary data without even being aware of it. While ChatGPT offers users a way to disable saving chat histories, it is not turned on by default. It is also unclear if deleting a chat has any impact if a service has already used the conversation for training its models. In March, OpenAI had to briefly shut down ChatGPT to resolve a bug that allowed some users to see parts of another user’s chat history.
Contra
Despite some companies restricting the use of AI services at work, several others have already begun adding these tools to their workflow. Goldman Sachs—one of the banks limiting the use of ChatGPT by staffers—disclosed it was using generative AI tools to help its software developers write and test code. Management consulting firm Bain & Company announced earlier this year it was integrating OpenAI’s generative tools into its management systems. Others have expressed bullishness about leveraging the power of AI, saying they believe it can replace a significant chunk of their human workforce. On Thursday, BT said it plans to replace at least 10,000 workers—mostly people with customer service and network management roles—with AI-powered tools over the next decade. Earlier this month, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said the company will stop hiring humans for jobs that AI can fulfill.
PROMOTED
What To Watch For
It's worth noting that these bans on AI tools by some companies do not necessarily stem from broader concerns about artificial intelligence itself, but rather from how third-party AI platform holders like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft will handle proprietary data shared on these services. The Journal’s report notes that Apple is working on its own AI tools, led by former Google employee John Giannandrea. In Apple’s most recent earnings call, the company’s CEO Tim Cook said he thought “it’s very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how you approach these things…but the potential is certainly very interesting.”

The specific effects of revolutionary technologies are impossible to predict, and perhaps AI will turn out to be overhyped. But it really is different from past advances: The work it can do really is different; the jobs it threatens really are different; its effects on the labor market really might be different. A pair of economists at Goldman Sachs recently estimated that two-thirds of American occupations are now “exposed” to AI-driven automation. In the coming decade, the technology will wipe out 300 million jobs, they forecast. That’s one in every 11 jobs on the planet.Here in the United States, an AI jobs revolution need not be anything for average wage-earning families to fear. If AI does not enslave the human race or destroy humanity outright, this generative technology can and should be a very, very good thing. It should lift productivity growth, increase our national wealth, and contribute to our commons of knowledge. Every person in this country can and should benefit from such an awe-inspiring invention.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

But humans will still be necessary to provide personal advice.Share full article9Read in appCredit...Will CordellBy Paulette PerhachMay 20, 2023Paul Weiner, an artist, has been experimenting with artificial intelligence for the past year, generating A.I.-created visual disinformation and seeing whether he can get the images to spread. But recently, he turned to ChatGPT, a chatbot that has the ability to respond to complex questions, for a much different reason: With his 30th birthday looming, he decided to ask it for advice about retirement planning.“Maybe ChatGPT would have some answers that I might otherwise get from someone who I’d have to pay a lot of money to,” he said.Generative A.I. like ChatGPT has knowledge workers gripping the rails, bracing for how it might affect their jobs, and consumers leaning in to see what costly services could soon be replaced with a prompt. As the investment industry turns to artificial intelligence as a financial planning and advice tool, the values of accuracy, humanity, security and accessibility are jostling for prominence. In the future, who — or what — will we be asking to advise us on some of life’s most important decisions?ChatGPT recommended that Mr. Weiner open a Roth individual retirement account and certificates of deposit, as well as automate his savings and create a budget. He hasn’t yet opened any of the accounts or, as the chatbot also suggested, worked with a financial adviser.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It’s a lot of information that gets thrown at you pretty quickly,” Mr. Weiner said. He found the short explanations insufficient for what a C.D. does or the differences between a Roth I.R.A. and a traditional I.R.A. He concluded that speaking to a financial adviser would probably be more helpful.“But that kind of circles back to the whole reason I’m doing this on ChatGPT to start with — it’s free,” he said.ImageCredit...Will CordellA.I. has joined the financial chatDelyanne Barros, a money coach, said she felt that most of the hundreds of thousands of people who follow her on social media had no idea what ChatGPT is. “Am I the only one geeking out on this thing?” she asked. When she asks her followers if they’ve used it, she said, “they’re like, ‘What are you talking about?’”She’s teaching them the basics: There’s a free version of the service, and it works as more than just a Google alternative.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOn Instagram, she asked if any investing newbies had asked ChatGPT to teach them to invest. Some had tried but reported that they kept getting stuck in a loop of repetitive answers. Ms. Barros found that she was able to get valuable information about allocations, tax efficiencies and retirement withdrawal rates, but she posits that was because she had knowledge of the investment terms she needed to use.Reviews and Advice from WirecutterThe 32 Best Housewarming Gifts July 19, 2024We Love a Melon Baller, and Not Just for Melons June 28, 2024Our Favorite Detergent for Hand-Washing ‘Dry-Clean Only’ Clothes June 25, 2024“You have to know how to frame the questions,” she said. “A lot of people don’t understand that you get an answer to something and it can build on that answer. You can ask follow-up questions, and it’s like a chain.”Ms. Barros has also used ChatGPT to double-check her calculations regarding her retirement plan. Despite its handiness, she is not worried that chatbots will replace her.“With something like investing, I’m not concerned as a personal finance educator, because I can see that it’s not like: ‘Oh, we don’t need you anymore. We have ChatGPT,’” she said. “If anything, this is going to be a tool that’s going to enhance my coaching experience with people, but it’s definitely not going to be replacing us, because people still need a lot of guidance.”Even if you don’t think you’re familiar with it, chances are you’ve already been using generative A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIntuit started to integrate A.I. into its software products, which include Mint and TurboTax, more than a decade ago, said Ashok Srivastava, the company’s senior vice president and chief data officer. Today, he said, Intuit’s platform performs 58 billion machine learning predictions per day. Another Intuit product, QuickBooks, predicts cash flow for small businesses, and the company has found that when it gives users advice based on artificial intelligence, 95 percent of small-business owners take that advice.They’re still focusing on a strategy that combines human interactions with A.I.-powered ones. Customers, for example, can meet with a live expert, and then A.I. will create a categorized and tagged summary of the conversation for later review.ImageCredit...Will CordellBugs in the systemAs of now, the technology is promising, but it’s not 100 percent accurate.“These systems tell plausible stories, they give you plausible ideas, but not necessarily correct ones,” Mr. Srivastava said. “What we’re focusing on is actually providing the correct experience to the person, so that it’s grounded in reality and data that is appropriately personalized to them, so then they can make the best financial decisions as they move forward.”Mr. Srivastava said he did not envision a future where humans were taken out of the financial planning equation.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I’ve grown up in the field, I’ve seen it evolve, and it’s an amazing technology,” he said. “I think that the human connection is still important. I envision that we will want to help C.P.A.s, bookkeepers, financial planners, financial advisers — everyone in this ecosystem — grow and prosper along with the use of artificial intelligence.”Josh Pigford, the founder and chief executive of Maybe, had been building a personal finance management platform that could help people make financial decisions when ChatGPT debuted. A few months ago, Maybe was rebuilt from the ground up, this time with GPT, the technology behind ChatGPT, as the foundation of the platform. The process always begins, he said, with a question people want to answer.“The way that we were initially tackling this is giving you access to a financial adviser who can answer those questions for you directly,” Mr. Pigford said. “As we started testing GPT’s ability around that, we realized, well, OK, actually GPT can do this really well.”Things became even more interesting when people added their financial data and information, such as age, location, and goals. The system could then take into account everything from dependents to joint filing to local tax codes — details a financial adviser would be able to use — and deliver that directly to the consumer.That, of course, brings up the subject of privacy. Through Maybe’s system, the banking information is secured and does not feed back to OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHallucinations — the tendency for ChatGPT to spout off incorrect information — have also become a worry. Mr. Pigford and his team identified the issue during early testing.“There was a point there where it was actually making up entire transactions, and building this back story of like, ‘You bought this item from Home Depot to help cool off your living room,’” he said. “That’s a legitimate problem.”As the technology has improved, Mr. Pigford has seen a drastic decrease in these hallucinations in just weeks. The way they’re designing the software includes a toggle to switch between a chatbot and humans for advice.“The belief, the hypothesis, what we’re sort of banking on is that we’re able to actually offer that sort of hyper-personalized input and advice without you having to, you know, form a relationship with a certified financial adviser where you’re paying them an assets-under-management fee, or even paying them, you know, a couple hundred bucks an hour,” he said. “You’re able to get very specific advice, regardless of what your financial situation is.”But Mr. Pigford believes it’s too early to do away with live professionals. “I think we’ll have some transition period where we’ll want humans involved for a while,” he said. “The goal is not to completely do away with a financial adviser.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFirst steps into the ChatGPT worldGlenn Hopper, author of “Deep Finance: Corporate Finance in the Information Age,” relates this GPT era to the screech of dial-up internet. The prevalence of A.I., he said, is “going to come quicker than the adoption of the internet and broadband internet and web browsers.”“I’ve stopped making predictions, because every time I make a prediction, I’ll say six to 12 months, and then I’ll read an article the next day that this item has already appeared,” Mr. Hopper said.He warned that tools like ChatGPT would make scamming and phishing more sophisticated, so users should be cautious of anyone asking for their bank information.“The very first thing that I tell everyone is, if you’ve been ignoring artificial intelligence up until now — stop,” he said. He doesn’t think people need to become experts, but they should have a basic understanding of how the technology works, he said.“If we’re going to hand over our decisions to them, and we don’t have any idea how they’re working, I mean, you might as well shake one of those Magic 8 Balls and get the answer from that,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on May 20, 2023, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Would You Take A.I.’s Money Advice?.

EEOC’s nonbinding guidance focuses on an employer’s use of AI in selection procedure decisions such as hiring, promotion, and firing.
Guidance addresses potential disparate or adverse impact resulting from the use of such tools and does not address issues of intentional discrimination via the use of AI-driven tools in making employment selection procedures.





On May 18, 2023, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or “the Commission”), the federal agency charged with administering federal civil rights laws (including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), among others), issued a “technical assistance document” entitled, “Assessing Adverse Impact in Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence Used in Employment Selection Procedures Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” EEOC technical assistance documents are not voted upon or otherwise approved by the full Commission, and are not intended to create new policy, but rather to apply existing law and Commission policy to new or specific fact patterns. They do not have the force and effect of law, and do not bind the public in any way—rather, they purport to provide clarity with regard to existing requirements under the law. This latest technical assistance document, addressing artificial intelligence (AI) employment selection procedures under Title VII, follows on the Commission’s May 2022 guidance on the use of AI tools and the ADA.
The technical assistance document begins by noting that while Title VII applies to all employment practices, including recruitment, monitoring, evaluation, and discipline of employees, it is intended to address AI issues only with regard to “selection procedures,” such as hiring, promotion, and firing. It defines “artificial intelligence” with reference to the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 as “a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments,” and notes that in the employment context, this has typically meant reliance on an automated tool’s own analysis of data to determine which criteria to use when making decisions. The Commission offers a number of examples of AI tools used in the employment selection procedures, including:
[R]esume scanners that prioritize applications using certain keywords; employee monitoring software that rates employees on the basis of their keystrokes or other factors; ‘virtual assistants’ or ‘chatbots’ that ask job candidates about their qualifications and reject those who do not meet pre-defined requirements; video interviewing software that evaluates candidates based on their facial expressions and speech patterns; and testing software that provides ‘job fit’ scores for applicants or employees regarding their personalities, aptitudes, cognitive skills, or perceived ‘cultural fit’ based on their performance on a game or on a more traditional test.
The document is expressly focused on potential disparate or adverse impact resulting from the use of such tools and does not address issues of intentional discrimination via the use of AI-driven tools in making employment selection procedures. Generally speaking, adverse or disparate impact may result when an employer uses a facially neutral test or selection procedure that excludes individuals based on protected characteristics such as sex, race, color, or religion in disproportionate number.1 An employer can justify the use of a neutral tool that nevertheless has an adverse impact where the use of such tool is “job-related and consistent with business necessity” and there is no less-discriminatory alternative that is equally effective. The application of disparate impact principles, and the assessment of whether a selection tool is lawful under Title VII, is generally governed by the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP) adopted by the EEOC in 1978.
Insofar as it does not create new policy, the scope of the technical assistance is limited. That said, it does include several key takeaways for employers using selection tools that incorporate or are driven by AI:

Liability for Tools Designed or Administered by a Vendor or Third Party. The guidance notes that where an AI-powered selection tool results in disparate impact, an employer may be liable even if the test was developed or administered by an outside vendor. The EEOC recommends that in determining whether to rely on an outside party or vendor to administer an AI selection tool, the employer consider asking the vendor what steps it has taken to evaluate the tool for potential adverse impact. It further notes that where a vendor is incorrect in its assessment (for example, informing the employers that the tool does not result in an adverse impact when in fact it does), the employer may still be liable.


The “Four-Fifths Rule” is Not Determinative. UGESP has long noted the “four-fifths” rule will “generally” be regarded as a measure of adverse impact—but that it is not dispositive. By way of background, the four-fifths rule provides that where a selection rate for any race, sex, or religious or ethnic group is less than 80 percent (four-fifths) of the rate of the group with the highest selection rate, that generally indicates disparate impact. For example, assume an employer uses a selection tool to screen 120 applicants (80 male, 40 female) to determine which advance and receive an interview. The tool determines that 48 men and 12 women should advance to the interview round. The “selection rate” of the tool is 60% for men (48/80) but only 30% for women (12/40). The ratio of the two rates is 50% (30/60). Because 50% is less than 80% (four-fifths), the tool would generally be viewed as having an adverse impact under the four-fifths rule. The technical assistance document notes that while the four-fifths rule is a useful “rule of thumb,” it is not an absolute indicator of disparate impact—smaller differences in selection rates may still indicate adverse impact where, for example, the tool is used to make a large number of selections, or where an employer may have discouraged certain applicants from applying. The guidance notes that the EEOC may consider a tool that passes the four-fifths test to still generate an unlawful adverse impact if it nevertheless results in a statistically significant difference in selection rates.


Employers Should Self-Audit Tools. Finally, the technical assistance urges employers to self-audit selection tools on an ongoing basis to determine whether they have an adverse impact on groups protected under the law, and, where it does, consider modifying the tool to minimize such impact. While such modification may be lawful going forward, employers are urged to explore this issue closely with counsel, insofar as it may implicate both disparate treatment and disparate impact provisions of Title VII under existing Supreme Court precedent.

While its technical assistance does not offer particularly trenchant insight, it does reflect the attention the EEOC has and will likely continue to pay to issues of discrimination and artificial intelligence. In late 2021, the agency announced its “Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Fairness Initiative,” and its most recent public meeting in January of this year was devoted solely to the issue of AI and potential employment discrimination. We expect this focus will remain, particularly if the Commission obtains a Democratic majority in the future (the agency is currently split along party lines, with two Democratic commissioners, two Republican commissioners, and one vacancy to which a Democrat has been nominated; as a practical matter, this lack of majority has likely limited the agency’s ability to move forward on controversial or significant policy changes).
Employers using or considering the use of AI-driven tools in recruiting and selecting applicants and employees are advised to keep a close eye on developments, as both the federal government and state and local governments have indicated an intent to regulate in this space. Littler Workplace Policy Institute (WPI) will likewise keep readers informed of relevant developments.

As tech companies race to improve and apply LLMs, researchers remain far from being able to explain or “interpret” the inner mechanics of these inscrutable “black boxes.” Traditional computer programs are coded in exquisite detail to instruct a computer to perform the same task over and over. But neural networks, including those that run large language models (LLMs), program and reprogram themselves and reason in ways that are not comprehensible to humans. That’s why when New York Times reporter Kevin Roose documented his famously strange exchange with Bing Chat earlier this year, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott could not explain why the bot said what it said.This “inscrutable” aspect of LLMs is fueling a concern among scientists that continued development and application of the technology could have serious, even catastrophic, unintended results. A growing number of scientists believe that as LLMs get better and smarter they may be used by bad actors (or defense agencies) to harm human beings. Some believe that because AI systems will posess superior intellegence and superior reasoning skills versus humans, their eventual opposition to humans is a natural and predictable part of their evolution. In March, more than 1,000 business leaders and scientists—including Turing Award winner Yoshua Bengio, Steve Wozniak, and Elon Musk—signed an open letter calling for a six-month pause in LLM development, in part because of a lack of understanding of how these AI systems work. “[R]ecent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one—not even their creators—can understand, predict, or reliably control,” the letter reads. Now, the “godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton has joined the ranks of concerned scientists. “I think it’s entirely possible that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence,” Hinton said in a recent interview at MIT. Hinton recently quit his job at Google so that he could speak openly about the existential dangers presented by the LLMs his own research helped make possible. “I’m sounding the alarm and saying we have to worry about this,” he said at the time of his exit. “It’s not clear there is a solution.” Hinton says that when AI systems are allowed to set their own “sub-goals” they’ll eventually see human beings as barriers to achieving them. The classic hyptothetical: An AI tasked with solving climate change might quickly determine that humans, and human habits, are the main obsticle to achieving its goal. An AI with extra-human intelligence, the thinking goes, might quickly learn to deceive its human operators. This danger relates directly to humans’ ability to interpret what’s going on within the inscrutable black box. OpenAI seemed to acknowledge this in a research paper published this month on AI interpretability. “Our understanding of how they work internally is still very limited,” OpenAI’s researchers wrote. “For example, it might be difficult to detect from their outputs whether they use biased heuristics or engage in deception.”In the wake of this big leap forward in natural language processing, researchers find themselves far behind in interpreting LLMs. And far more money continues to be spent on pushing the models to higher levels of performance than on gaining a better understanding of their inner workings. The question, then, is whether the profit-driven tech companies now developing AI can learn enough in the short term about how LLMs work to effectively manage the long term risks?Mechanistic interpretationLarge language models grew up quickly—arguably, too quickly. The tech’s current frontrunner, ChatGPT, is powered by a radically souped-up transformer model, an invention of Google’s from 2017. OpenAI’s researchers, in broad terms, used impressive computing power to train a transformer model on massive amounts of data scraped from the web. The results were surprising and astounding: an LLM with an eerily acute sense of human language.But OpenAI’s GPT models do more than just predict words in a sentence. Somehow, while chewing over all that training data, they gain a working knowledge of how the world works, and an ability to compute with reason.Somehow.But how do those intuitions arise from the model’s processing of its training data? And in what network layer and neuron does the LLM apply those intuitions to the content it outputs? The only certain way to answer such questions is to reverse engineer the neural network. That is, to follow the complex webwork of interactions among the neurons in the network as they react to an input (a prompt, perhaps) to generate an output (an answer). This reengineering is called “mechanistic interpretability.”“[You] can look at the absolute smallest pieces of it, which might be an individual little neuron and see what it’s reacting to, and then what it feeds that reaction into,” says Joshua Batson, an interpretability researcher at LLM developer Anthropic.  The neural networks underpinning tools like ChatGPT are composed of layer after layer of these neurons, connection points where complex mathematical calculations take place. While processing mountains of textual data in a self-supervised way (no human labeling of words or phrases, no human feedback about outputs), these neurons work together to form an abstract, many-dimensional matrix that maps out the relationships between word parts, whole words, and phrases of words. The model gains a contextual understanding of how words are used together in strings, and the ability to predict what words might come next in a sentence, or which are most likely to follow naturally from a language prompt. But today’s state-of-the-art LLMs have hundreds of millions of these neurons. Neural network architecture was roughly based on the design of the nervous systems of complex organisms (humans). And after decades of study, neuroscience has so far not succeeded in reverse-engineering that biological system.“Neuroscience has tried to take that bottom-up approach and it’s proven to be a very difficult way to study a system of such complexity,” says Aidan Gomez, CEO of the LLM developer Cohere. In a living organism, this “bottom up” approach would mean studying the way the organism intakes sensory data and tracking the impulses as they travel from neuron to neuron and eventually form a higher-order assessment that might lead to an action, Gomez says. “Following that whole pathway is extremely difficult.” And following the pathways from neuron to neuron in a synthetic neural network is similarly hard. This is a shame because it’s within those pathways that the beginnings of HAL 9000-style notions begin.Image models successThe mechanistic interpretability community owes some of its most promising advances to the study of simpler neural nets, notably those designed to recognize and classify different types of images. Within these neural nets it’s easier for researchers to identify the specific tasks of single neurons, and how the work of each neuron contributes to the overall goal of identifying the content of images.In a neural net designed to recognize cars in images, one layer of neurons might be dedicated to detecting groupings of pixels that suggest a specific shape, such as a curve or a circle. A neuron in that layer might activate and send a high probability score to another layer in the network that work out whether the shape could be a tire or a steering wheel. As these connections are made, the network becomes more and more certain that it’s looking at a car.Interpretability, then, leads to the ability to fine tune. As Anthropic’s Batson explains: “If you want to know why something that isn’t the car gets called a car, you could trace through the network and say ‘Oh, the wheel detector fired on this thing, which is actually a frying pan’ . . . and you can start to reason about this.” advertisementBatson says his group is very focused on studying important groups of neurons within LLMs, instead of single neurons. It’s a bit like a team of neurologists poking around in a human brain looking for sections that control different bodily or mental functions.“It might be that we start to figure out what the basic players are [in neural networks] to say ‘Okay, here’s how it’s mapping the physical world, here’s how it’s mapping the emotional world, here’s how it thinks about literature or individuals’ and you could get these bigger chunks or modules,” says Anthropic’s Batson.“I think the state of it today is we can apply these interpretability techniques to quite small text models, not text models for hundreds of billions of parameters size,” adds Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark. “And the question that people have is how rapidly we can apply our text interpretability techniques to much larger models.”Interpretability and safetyPerhaps the most pressing reason AI companies have for investing in interpretability research is to find better ways of erecting “guardrails” around large language models. If a model is prone to outputting toxic speech, researchers typically study the responses of the systems to a variety of potentially risky prompts, then place limitations on what the model can say, or bar the model from responding to certain prompts entirely. But that method has real limitations, says Sarah Wiegreffe, a model interpretability researcher at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle. “It’s certainly limited in the sense that given the vast space of possible inputs the model could receive, and the vast space of possible outputs it could generate, it would be pretty difficult to reasonably enumerate all of the possible scenarios that you might have in the real world,” she says. Mechanistic interpretability in this context might mean looking deep within the layers of the network to find the crucial calculation that led to an unsafe output. “So, for example, there is some recent work showing that if you can localize a certain factual statement in a language model, you can actually edit those weights of the model to essentially correct that,” Wiegreffe says. “You can do model surgery . . . to fix things that are incorrect without needing to retrain the entire system.”But tweaking a large language model’s proclivity toward one harmful behavior might hobble its tendencies toward other behaviors we like. Explicit “do not say” commands might, for example, limit the model’s creative and improvisational capabilities. That’s a compelling argument for using less invasive ways of “steering” a model. In fact, many in the AI community remain skeptical of the need for neuron-by-neuron mechanistic interpretability to guarentee the near-term and long-term safety of AI systems. “I don’t think it’s the best way to study an intelligent system, given the timelines we’re working with,” Cohere’s Gomez says. Indeed, with capitalist forces now pushing tech companies to get LLMs into production in every industry, and, soon, into use in personal technology (Alexa and Siri, for example), the AI community may not have so long to increase their understanding of how LLMs work. “The naive approach is to simply ask the system to cite its sources,” Gomez says. “I believe in the naive approach. As these systems begin being used for more important tasks, we’ll have to demand that they base their outputs on facts.”No benchmarksWhile ample benchmarks exist for measuring the performance of language models (like standardized tests for AIs), there is yet no common set of benchmarks for measuring the interpretability of LLMs. The industry hasn’t, for example, adopted something like OpenAI’s scoring system for interpreting the output of a single neuron in an LLM.Rather, you have a lot of researchers doing their best to shine flashlights on things inside a very, very large black box. “We don’t yet have the metric or benchmark that we could all agree on and work toward,” Batson says. “We have the phenomena that we understand, and we’re putting together the big picture right now.” Researchers publish papers describing new techniques for studying models, and other researchers in the community then try to understand advances are comprehensible and build on existing intuitions.  “You definitely know when you see it,” Batson says. “You’re like ‘Oh okay, this is a much better picture of what’s going on.”Interpretability and the ‘alignment problem’While the near-term safety of LLMs is important, and will continue to be, the LLMs of the future may present far more serious threats than just toxic outputs. The researcher and philosopher Eliezer Yudkowsky has been raising the alarm that as LLMs get better and far outpace humans in intellegence, and as they become more autonomous, chances are very high that they will begin acting against the interests of humankind.That eventuality may be more likely than you think. Let’s suppose that LLMs continue getting better at learning and reasoning, and better able to capture data (real-time visual and audio data, perhaps) that ground them in the real world, and that they begin to share data and train each other. Let’s also assume that LLMs (and not some other type of AI) end up being the path to AGI, or artificial general intelligence, far exceeding human intelligence in important ways. Without a thorough (mechanistic) understanding of the early antecedents of these powerful future LLMs, can we realistically expect to manage these AIs in every stage of their development so that they remain aligned with human interests, and disinclined to act against us or even do away with us?There is disagreement on this question. Both Yudkowsky and Hinton have grave doubts that humans will be able to manage alignment in AI systems, and neither believe that acheiving mechanistic inpretability in these systems is a silver bullet.“[I]f you’re all in the middle of a global AI arms race, people will say there’s no point in slowing down because their competitors won’t slow down,” Yudkowsky says. He believes AI systems will resist human safety training by learning to conceal their internal processes. “If you try to apply your omnicidal-thoughts detector to train the giant inscrutable matrices not to have visible omnicidal thoughts anymore, you’re training both against omnicidalness and against visibility.” “This is the broad gloss on why ‘be able to see a warning sign inside the AI’s thoughts’ levels of interpretability doesn’t mean everyone is safe,” Yudkowsky says.Recognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards!

That\'s why when New York Times reporter Kevin Roose documented his famously strange exchange with Bing Chat earlier this year, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott could not explain why the bot said what it said.\n\n\n\nThis ""inscrutable"" aspect of LLMs is fueling a concern among scientists that continued development and application of the technology could have serious, even catastrophic, unintended results. A growing number of scientists believe that as LLMs get better and smarter they may be used by bad actors (or defense agencies) to harm human beings. Some believe that because AI systems will posess superior intellegence and superior reasoning skills versus humans, their eventual opposition to humans is a natural and predictable part of their evolution. \n\n\n\nIn March, more than 1,000 business leaders and scientists—including Turing Award winner Yoshua Bengio, Steve Wozniak, and Elon Musk—signed an open letter calling for a six-month pause in LLM development, in part because of a lack of understanding of how these AI systems work. \n\n\n\n""[R]ecent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one—not even their creators—can understand, predict, or reliably control,"" the letter reads. \n\n\n\nNow, the ""godfather of AI"" Geoffrey Hinton has joined the ranks of concerned scientists. “I think it’s entirely possible that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence,"" Hinton said in a recent interview at MIT. Hinton recently quit his job at Google so that he could speak openly about the existential dangers presented by the LLMs his own research helped make possible. \n\n\n\n""I’m sounding the alarm and saying we have to worry about this,"" he said at the time of his exit. ""It’s not clear there is a solution."" Hinton says that when AI systems are allowed to set their own ""sub-goals"" they\'ll eventually see human beings as barriers to achieving them. The classic hyptothetical: An AI tasked with solving climate change might quickly determine that humans, and human habits, are the main obsticle to achieving its goal. An AI with extra-human intelligence, the thinking goes, might quickly learn to deceive its human operators. \n\n\n\nThis danger relates directly to humans\' ability to interpret what\'s going on within the inscrutable black box. OpenAI seemed to acknowledge this in a research paper published this month on AI interpretability. ""Our understanding of how they work internally is still very limited,"" OpenAI\'s researchers wrote. ""For example, it might be difficult to detect from their outputs whether they use biased heuristics or engage in deception.""\n\n\n\nIn the wake of this big leap forward in natural language processing, researchers find themselves far behind in interpreting LLMs. And far more money continues to be spent on pushing the models to higher levels of performance than on gaining a better understanding of their inner workings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe question, then, is whether the profit-driven tech companies now developing AI can learn enough in the short term about how LLMs work to effectively manage the long term risks?\n\n\n\nMechanistic interpretation\n\n\n\nLarge language models grew up quickly—arguably, too quickly. The tech\'s current frontrunner, ChatGPT, is powered by a radically souped-up transformer model, an invention of Google\'s from 2017. OpenAI’s researchers, in broad terms, used impressive computing power to train a transformer model on massive amounts of data scraped from the web. The results were surprising and astounding: an LLM with an eerily acute sense of human language.\n\n\n\nBut OpenAI’s GPT models do more than just predict words in a sentence. Somehow, while chewing over all that training data, they gain a working knowledge of how the world works, and an ability to compute with reason.\n\n\n\nSomehow.\n\n\n\nBut how do those intuitions arise from the model\'s processing of its training data? And in what network layer and neuron does the LLM apply those intuitions to the content it outputs? The only certain way to answer such questions is to reverse engineer the neural network. That is, to follow the complex webwork of interactions among the neurons in the network as they react to an input (a prompt, perhaps) to generate an output (an answer). This reengineering is called “mechanistic interpretability.”\n\n\n\n“[You] can look at the absolute smallest pieces of it, which might be an individual little neuron and see what it\'s reacting to, and then what it feeds that reaction into,” says Joshua Batson, an interpretability researcher at LLM developer Anthropic.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe neural networks underpinning tools like ChatGPT are composed of layer after layer of these neurons, connection points where complex mathematical calculations take place. While processing mountains of textual data in a self-supervised way (no human labeling of words or phrases, no human feedback about outputs), these neurons work together to form an abstract, many-dimensional matrix that maps out the relationships between word parts, whole words, and phrases of words. The model gains a contextual understanding of how words are used together in strings, and the ability to predict what words might come next in a sentence, or which are most likely to follow naturally from a language prompt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut today’s state-of-the-art LLMs have hundreds of millions of these neurons. Neural network architecture was roughly based on the design of the nervous systems of complex organisms (humans). And after decades of study, neuroscience has so far not succeeded in reverse-engineering that biological system.\n\n\n\n“Neuroscience has tried to take that bottom-up approach and it’s proven to be a very difficult way to study a system of such complexity,” says Aidan Gomez, CEO of the LLM developer Cohere. In a living organism, this “bottom up” approach would mean studying the way the organism intakes sensory data and tracking the impulses as they travel from neuron to neuron and eventually form a higher-order assessment that might lead to an action, Gomez says. “Following that whole pathway is extremely difficult.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd following the pathways from neuron to neuron in a synthetic neural network is similarly hard.&nbsp;This is a shame because it\'s within those pathways that the beginnings of HAL 9000-style notions begin.\n\n\n\nImage models success\n\n\n\nThe mechanistic interpretability community owes some of its most promising advances to the study of simpler neural nets, notably those designed to recognize and classify different types of images. Within these neural nets it\'s easier for researchers to identify the specific tasks of single neurons, and how the work of each neuron contributes to the overall goal of identifying the content of images.\n\n\n\nIn a neural net designed to recognize cars in images, one layer of neurons might be dedicated to detecting groupings of pixels that suggest a specific shape, such as a curve or a circle. A neuron in that layer might activate and send a high probability score to another layer in the network that work out whether the shape could be a tire or a steering wheel. As these connections are made, the network becomes more and more certain that it’s looking at a car.\n\n\n\nInterpretability, then, leads to the ability to fine tune. As Anthropic’s Batson explains: “If you want to know why something that isn\'t the car gets called a car, you could trace through the network and say ‘Oh, the wheel detector fired on this thing, which is actually a frying pan\' . . . and you can start to reason about this.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBatson says his group is very focused on studying important groups of neurons within LLMs, instead of single neurons. It\'s a bit like a team of neurologists poking around in a human brain looking for sections that control different bodily or mental functions.\n\n\n\n“It might be that we start to figure out what the basic players are [in neural networks] to say ‘Okay, here\'s how it\'s mapping the physical world, here\'s how it\'s mapping the emotional world, here\'s how it thinks about literature or individuals’ and you could get these bigger chunks or modules,” says Anthropic\'s Batson.\n\n\n\n“I think the state of it today is we can apply these interpretability techniques to quite small text models, not text models for hundreds of billions of parameters size,” adds Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark. “And the question that people have is how rapidly we can apply our text interpretability techniques to much larger models.""\n\n\n\nInterpretability and safety\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most pressing reason AI companies have for investing in interpretability research is to find better ways of erecting “guardrails” around large language models. If a model is prone to outputting toxic speech, researchers typically study the responses of the systems to a variety of potentially risky prompts, then place limitations on what the model can say, or bar the model from responding to certain prompts entirely.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut that method has real limitations, says Sarah Wiegreffe, a model interpretability researcher at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle.&nbsp;“It\'s certainly limited in the sense that given the vast space of possible inputs the model could receive, and the vast space of possible outputs it could generate, it would be pretty difficult to reasonably enumerate all of the possible scenarios that you might have in the real world,” she says.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMechanistic interpretability in this context might mean looking deep within the layers of the network to find the crucial calculation that led to an unsafe output. “So, for example, there is some recent work showing that if you can localize a certain factual statement in a language model, you can actually edit those weights of the model to essentially correct that,” Wiegreffe says. “You can do model surgery . . . to fix things that are incorrect without needing to retrain the entire system.”\n\n\n\nBut tweaking a large language model’s proclivity toward one harmful behavior might hobble its tendencies toward other behaviors we like. Explicit “do not say” commands might, for example, limit the model’s creative and improvisational capabilities. That’s a compelling argument for using less invasive ways of “steering” a model.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn fact, many in the AI community remain skeptical of the need for neuron-by-neuron mechanistic interpretability to guarentee the near-term and long-term safety of AI systems.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don\'t think it’s the best way to study an intelligent system, given the timelines we’re working with,” Cohere’s Gomez says.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIndeed, with capitalist forces now pushing tech companies to get LLMs into production in every industry, and, soon, into use in personal technology (Alexa and Siri, for example), the AI community may not have so long to increase their understanding of how LLMs work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The naive approach is to simply ask the system to cite its sources,"" Gomez says. “I believe in the naive approach. As these systems begin being used for more important tasks, we’ll have to demand that they base their outputs on facts.”\n\n\n\nNo benchmarks\n\n\n\nWhile ample benchmarks exist for measuring the performance of language models (like standardized tests for AIs), there is yet no common set of benchmarks for measuring the interpretability of LLMs. The industry hasn’t, for example, adopted something like OpenAI’s scoring system for interpreting the output of a single neuron in an LLM.\n\n\n\nRather, you have a lot of researchers doing their best to shine flashlights on things inside a very, very large black box. “We don\'t yet have the metric or benchmark that we could all agree on and work toward,” Batson says.&nbsp;“We have the phenomena that we understand, and we\'re putting together the big picture right now.”&nbsp;Researchers publish papers describing new techniques for studying models, and other researchers in the community then try to understand advances are comprehensible and build on existing intuitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You definitely know when you see it,” Batson says. “You’re like ‘Oh okay, this is a much better picture of what’s going on.”\n\n\n\nInterpretability and the \'alignment problem\'\n\n\n\nWhile the near-term safety of LLMs is important, and will continue to be, the LLMs of the future may present far more serious threats than just toxic outputs.&nbsp;The researcher and philosopher Eliezer Yudkowsky has been raising the alarm that as LLMs get better and far outpace humans in intellegence, and as they become more autonomous, chances are very high that they will begin acting against the interests of humankind.\n\n\n\nThat eventuality may be more likely than you think. Let’s suppose that LLMs continue getting better at learning and reasoning, and better able to capture data (real-time visual and audio data, perhaps) that ground them in the real world, and that they begin to share data and train each other. Let\'s also assume that LLMs (and not some other type of AI) end up being the path to AGI, or artificial general intelligence, far exceeding human intelligence in important ways. Without a thorough (mechanistic) understanding of the early antecedents of these powerful future LLMs, can we realistically expect to manage these AIs in every stage of their development so that they remain aligned with human interests, and disinclined to act against us or even do away with us?\n\n\n\nThere is disagreement on this question. Both Yudkowsky and Hinton have grave doubts that humans will be able to manage alignment in AI systems, and neither believe that acheiving mechanistic inpretability in these systems is a silver bullet.\n\n\n\n“[I]f you\'re all in the middle of a global AI arms race, people will say there\'s no point in slowing down because their competitors won\'t slow down,"" Yudkowsky says. He believes AI systems will resist human safety training by learning to conceal their internal processes.&nbsp;""If you try to apply your omnicidal-thoughts detector to train the giant inscrutable matrices not to have visible omnicidal thoughts anymore, you\'re training both against omnicidalness and against visibility.” \n\n\n\n“This is the broad gloss on why ‘be able to see a warning sign inside the AI\'s thoughts’ levels of interpretability doesn\'t mean everyone is safe,” Yudkowsky says.'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/90896928/the-frightening-truth-about-ai-chatbots-nobody-knows-exactly-how-they-work', 'url': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/90896928/the-frightening-truth-about-ai-chatbots-nobody-knows-exactly-how-they-work', 'name': 'The scary truth about AI chatbots: Nobody knows exactly how they work', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/90896928/the-frightening-truth-about-ai-chatbots-nobody-knows-exactly-how-they-work#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/90896928/the-frightening-truth-about-ai-chatbots-nobody-knows-exactly-how-they-work#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms/uploads/2023/05/p-1-90896928the-frightening-truth-about-ai-chatbots-nobody-knows-exactly-how-they-work.gif', 'datePublished': '2023-05-17T08:00:00+00:00', 'dateModified': '2023-05-25T22:31:23+00:00', 'description': 'Nobody really knows how chatbots work.

PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Phenom today released its State of Candidate Experience: 2023 Benchmarks Report. Phenom’s seventh annual audit revealed that since 2020, the Fortune 500 has made significant strides to enhance the candidate experience by implementing AI technology and automation to connect job seekers — both hourly and knowledge workers — with relevant jobs faster, and creating engaging content to convey a strong employer brand in the highly competitive U.S. talent market.


“Multiple industries remain in a hiring crisis with open roles costing them millions, and enhancing the candidate experience is the first step to addressing this issue,” said Mahe Bayireddi, CEO and co-founder of Phenom.Post this

The report highlights improvements Fortune 500 companies have made in the last three years to deliver hyper-personalized experiences and job matching that strengthen candidate attraction, engagement and conversion, including a:



250% increase in presenting job recommendations based on browsing history



150% increase in the use of AI-powered chatbots



145% improvement in easy site navigation



87% increase in displaying recently viewed jobs



74% increase in video content



50% increase in well-written job descriptions



Although organizations are increasingly adopting AI-powered technology, 89% scored poorly in their use of AI, indicating there is still a significant gap between the solutions available and what companies have implemented. According to the 2023 audit:



86% did not present job recommendations based on browsing history



85% did not use chatbots



85% did not display recently viewed jobs



84% did not provide job recommendations based on candidate profile



80% lacked compelling content on their career sites



“Multiple industries remain in a hiring crisis with open roles costing them millions, and enhancing the candidate experience is the first step to addressing this issue,” said Mahe Bayireddi, CEO and co-founder of Phenom. “Providing personalized experiences for job seekers is only possible through intelligence and automation.”


The ROI of Intelligence, Automation and Experience

The future of every company no longer hinges on its ability to outpace competitors for talent — employers must embrace cutting-edge practices and technology for hiring, developing and retaining employees. Intelligence, automation and experience are essential to overcoming today’s biggest talent acquisition and retention challenges, including simplifying the job search process and maintaining an attractive, unique employer brand.


For hourly workers, automating hiring workflows reduces friction throughout every step of the hiring process, ensuring organizations can attract, engage and hire faster and more efficiently. For knowledge workers, intelligence brings highly personalized, contextually relevant information to enhance productivity and output. Technology such as hyper-personalized career sites, conversational chatbots, automated screening and scheduling, and content that showcases a company’s culture all enrich the candidate experience — helping them find the right job and apply faster.


Savvy organizations that are leveraging AI-powered technology and automation through the Phenom Intelligent Talent Experience platform are attracting more best-fit job seekers, growing talent communities and increasing completed applications, and the results speak for themselves:



A major telecommunications company increased career site traffic by 220% and increased completed applications by 700% with intelligent tools that provided a more personalized experience for candidates



A major health care organization achieved a 10% increase in nursing hires by expediting communication with candidates through a conversational chatbot and SMS messages



A major financial institution added 8X more candidates to their talent community by creating a dynamic, hyper-personalized career site and targeting recruitment marketing efforts



A popular restaurant chain registered over 12,000 candidates through their career site and talent email campaigns in less than a month — resulting in more than 2,000 same-day offers to candidates and 1,300+ same-week hires



A leading retail chain hired 7,000 workers in two weeks using their AI-powered chatbot, career site, CRM and video assessments to automate routine, early stage hiring practices — reducing time to hire from weeks to 8 hours



Actions Organizations Can Take to Accelerate Hiring

To improve the candidate experience, Phenom’s State of Candidate Experience report prescribes a series of actions organizations can take — from creating strong employer brand content to implementing intelligent career site technology:



Personalize the candidate experience through AI and automation. Candidates today expect the online job search to be similar to purchasing consumer goods, where relevant information is delivered based on their interests. If this process is not intuitive and simple, candidates are more likely to drop off a career site. With AI and automation on a career site, personalized jobs and content are automatically displayed for candidates based on their resume, experience, skills, and geographic location.



Showcase a strong employer brand through content. When deciding if a job is the right fit, candidates spend a significant amount of time researching a company. If a digital brand does not meet their expectations, they may not feel a strong connection and apply to an open role. Content on a career site (videos, pictures, blogs, etc.) that conveys information such as a company’s mission and purpose, overall workplace culture, employee quotes and stories, internal events and employee resource groups all paint a picture of what it is like to work there.



Embrace cutting-edge technology. In addition to AI and automation, organizations must be quick to responsibly adopt work-altering innovations, including: generative AI, which enables organizations to be more productive and fill roles faster by automatically creating content, surfacing actionable intelligence, and eliminating time-consuming tasks; interview intelligence, which brings transparency to hiring teams through recordings, transcriptions, key takeaway, and analysis to move the process forward faster; and candidate hub, a one-stop-shop that helps candidates understand where they are in the hiring process and prepare for next steps.



With Phenom, candidates find and choose the right job faster, employees develop their skills and evolve, recruiters become wildly productive, managers build stronger-performing teams, HR aligns employee development with company goals, and HRIS easily integrates existing HR tech to create a holistic infrastructure.

SAP and Microsoft have announced an integration of SuccessFactors with Microsoft’s Copilot, Copilot in Viva Learning, and Azure OpenAI.
The integration aims to bring the power of AI to HR leaders so that they can attract and retain top talent in today’s competitive job market.

Tech majors SAP and Microsoft have announced that they will deepen their collaboration on joint generative AI projects with regard to recruitment. SAP said that it would integrate its solution, SuccessFactors, with Microsoft’s Copilot, Copilot in Viva Learning, and Azure OpenAI to obtain language models to analyze and generate natural language. The integrations are expected to improve how companies attract, skill, and retain talent.
SAP and Microsoft already have partnerships across various fields over the years. For example, the companies integrated Microsoft Teams with SAP’s suite of solutions in 2021. Last year, Microsoft chose RISE with SAP on Microsoft Cloud.
Talking about the latest integration, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, “We’re building on our long-standing cloud partnership with SAP and bringing together the power of Microsoft 365 Copilot with SAP SuccessFactors solutions to transform how organizations attract and develop their most important resource — their people.”

Integration Aims To Solve a Tough Business Challenge
The business environment has drastically evolved over the last three years for various reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic and changing employee expectations. One of the toughest challenges businesses face today is finding and retaining the right talent in today’s economic environment. According to Russell Reynolds Associates’ 2022 Global Leadership Monitor Survey conducted last year, 72% of businesses considered lack of skilled talent availability as the top challenge.
Reducing or closing this gap means optimizing how companies recruit people in today’s competitive job market and how they deliver learning programs that can help their employees grow. At present, these functions involve significant manual and repetitive work and often miss the mark. Further, closing the gap between an employee’s career aspirations and upskilling and cross-skilling opportunities organizations offer is challenging.
With the latest integration, SAP and Microsoft intend to enable former’s customers to benefit by using generative AI. The integration intends to help these customers attract the most qualified people for important roles and provide personalized insights to engage them once recruited.
SAP plans to make this happen by using its SuccessFactors data and Microsoft’s solutions to develop highly targeted job descriptions and fine-tune them. The company also intends to ensure there is no bias. Further, it plans to publish the job descriptions in SuccessFactors solutions without the need for HR leaders to disrupt their workflow. Furthermore, the company plans to use Copilot in Viva Learning to create personalized learning recommendations that align with the employee’s development and career goals.
The announcement may prove to be a model for how artificial intelligence tools can be used to enhance the power of data and systems in a given field.

The EEOC did not unveil new policies in the TA but reiterated that its long existing policies and practices continue to apply to the technologies (such as artificial intelligence and machine learning tools) that are grabbing the public’s attention today.  The TA broadly defines the types of automated systems that may be subject to employment laws and poses seven questions and answers designed to help employers avoid discriminatory employment decisions regardless of whether those decisions are made by humans or machines. The publication is an important read for employers.
EEOC Emphasizes That Long-Standing Title VII Principles Apply Even To New Technologies
In its new publication, the EEOC acknowledges that it is not announcing new policies. Rather, the publication “applies principles already established in the Title VII statutory provisions as well as previously issued guidance” to advanced technologies used in the workplace.
In line with that approach, the EEOC makes clear that it takes a broad view of the types of technology it has the authority to cover. Specifically any software, algorithm, AI, or other automated tool that is used to make “selection decisions” such as hiring, promotion and terminations, must be used in a manner consistent with EEO statutes. Expanding existing legal theories to emerging issues like AI and other technology tools fits squarely within the EEOC’s strategic enforcement priorities. A detailed examination of the EEOC’s strategic goals can be found here.
Focus On Disparate Impact Discrimination
The publication focuses on theories of “disparate impact” discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Disparate impact (sometimes called “adverse impact”) refers to the use of a facially neutral test or selection procedure that has the effect of disproportionately excluding members of a protected group, if the tests or selection procedures are not “job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.” Disparate impact theories are powerful tools for the EEOC, as they necessarily implicate broad swaths of potential “victims” in a single enforcement action, maximizing EEOC’s “bang for the buck.”
EEOC Expects Employers To Assess Algorithmic Decision-Making Tools For Adverse Impact In Accordance With The Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures
Since 1978, the EEOC has directed employers to follow its Uniform Guidelines on Employee Section Procedures (Guidelines) to determine whether tests and selection procedures are lawful under Title VII. In its TA, the EEOC reiterated that the Guidelines continue to apply to new technologies “when they are used to make or inform decisions about whether to hire, promote, terminate, or take similar actions toward applicants or current employees.”
As a result, the EEOC’s expectation is that employers will assess whether a selection procedure has an adverse impact on a particular protected group. The assessment requires a comparison between the selection rates for individuals in a protected group to those not in the protected group. Significant differences between the two groups must be remedied, unless the employer can show that the selection procedure is job related and consistent with business necessity.
Employers Can Be Responsible For Tools Designed And Administered By Others, Including Vendors
In the TA, the EEOC made it clear that employers may be held liable for the tools created by third parties, including software vendors, and cannot simply wash their hands of responsibility for the outcomes that flow from using tools developed by others.
The EEOC suggests that employers must, at a minimum, ask vendors whether steps have been taken to evaluate whether use of the tool causes a substantially lower selection rate for those in protected groups. However, the EEOC also makes clear that an employer cannot rely on the representations of its vendors. If the vendor says its assessment does not result in different selection rates, but disparate impact nonetheless results, the employer may still be on the hook for any adverse results. As a best practice, employers should vet any tools provided by third parties before putting the tools into use, and also implement audit procedures designed to monitor the results of using those tools to guard against any adverse impact.
With regard to third-party developers of tools, EEOC Commissioners have separately suggested that vendors themselves could be targeted by the Commission if their input into employment decisions are enough to bring them into the orbit of EEO laws. While not specifically addressed in the TA, this is an important issue that we will continue to track.
The Four-Fifths (80%) Rule Alone Does Not Provide A Safe Harbor For Measuring Allowable Differences In Selection Rates
One clarification likely to grab the attention of employers (and vendors) is the EEOC’s position that the well-known “four-fifths rule” may not be used as a sole measure to assess bias in a selection tool.  As described in the Guidelines, the four-fifths rule is one measure used to assess whether selection rates of two groups are “substantially” different. More specifically, if one group’s selection rate is less than 80% of that of the comparison group, the rates are considered substantially different.
In the TA, the EEOC emphasized that the four-fifths rule is only a “general rule of thumb” that is “practical and easy-to-administer,” and courts have found that it is not a reasonable substitute for statistical tests. Curiously, the EEOC has historically championed the use of the four-fifths rule to assess significance in other contexts. (See prior EEOC Guidance here for an example.)
The EEOC’s position is important as many vendors and employers have used the four-fifths rule articulated in the EEOC’s 1978 Guidance as a threshold analysis in bias audits.  The general thinking was that since the four-fifths rule was a well-established benchmark articulated by EEOC and long applied to other testing and assessment tools, it was a good threshold indicator of potential bias in the absence of other guidance. Indeed, the FAQs in the Guidelines provide that to assess adverse impact, “federal enforcement agencies normally will use only the 80% (4/5ths) rule of thumb, except where large numbers of selections are made.” (See FAQ Guidelines Q18).
In keeping with the clarifying comments in the EEOC’s TA, as well as issues related to the appropriate audit method depending on the sizes of the pools being analyzed, employers and vendors that are studying the effects of selection tools (or asking vendors about the tools they provide) may need to reassess their audit strategies. This may include implementing audit standards that evaluate both statistical significance and practical significance, using the four fifths test or other “practical significance” methodologies.
Employers Should Act Upon Discovering That An Algorithmic Decision-Making Tool Results In A Disparate Impact
The EEOC encourages employers to conduct self-analyses before implementing any new tool, and periodically thereafter to ensure that the tool is operating free of bias. If an employer discovers that a tool would have an adverse impact, the EEOC’s expectation is that the employer will either take steps to remedy the impact or select a different tool to use going forward.
EEOC’s Initiatives And Guidance Related To Automated Systems and AI
The TA is part of the EEOC’s Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Fairness Initiative, first announced in October 2021, which was designed to ensure that AI and other emerging tools used in hiring and employment decisions comply with the federal civil rights laws that the agency enforces. Since that time, the EEOC has continued to beat its drum on the topic:

The EEOC has published guidance that discusses how existing requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) may apply to the use of AI, software applications, and algorithms in employment-related decision-making processes and practices and offered useful information and tips to employers in an effort to assist them with ADA compliance when using such tools.
The EEOC published a proposed Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP) that announced its intention to focus on recruitment and hiring practices and policies that might give rise to discrimination against members of protected groups, including where employers use AI to aid decision-making.
The EEOC has held roundtable events and hearings to gather information and discuss the civil rights implications of the use of automated technology systems, including artificial intelligence, when hiring workers.
The EEOC has joined other federal agencies to release a joint statement to emphasize that the use of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, must be consistent with federal laws.

Employers should expect the EEOC to continue to focus on this topic.
Implications For Employers
The EEOC’s Technical Assistance document does not impose any new rules on employers. Rather, it is yet another reminder to employers that existing law applies to new and advanced technologies, and employers are responsible for employment decisions that impact applicants and employees, whether made by people or with the assistance of machines.  Employers should dust off the 1978 Guidelines and supporting materials and take a fresh look at them as they consider the various technologies that may be used to support employment decisions. 
The publication also represents more foreshadowing of the EEOC’s enforcement priorities, showing once again that the EEOC will scrutinize the technological tools that employers increasingly rely on to make hiring and employment decisions. Employers are well-served to track EEOC charges filed against them that include allegations concerning technological developments as well as those which may prompt the EEOC to issue requests for information seeking information about these tools.

PwC’s HR, tech leaders prepare to train U.S. workforce on ChatGPT technology



By Dawn Kawamoto

May 17, 2023 

Professional services and accounting powerhouse PwC is looking to power up its U.S. workforce of over 65,000 employees with basic to advanced knowledge of ChatGPT technology over the next three years, and it’s putting big bucks behind that effort.

PwC recently announced that it’s making a $1 billion investment to super-size and scale its AI capabilities. Part of that initiative is upskilling its entire U.S. workforce on generative AI, of which ChatGPT is just one form, beginning this summer. It’s a mammoth training effort led by both PwC’s Chief People Officer Yolanda Seals-Coffield, who calls it a “fundamental” need for all employees, and also the company’s vice chair and chief products and technology officer Joe Atkinson.
The investment also includes a partnership with Microsoft to create scalable offerings using both OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to help PwC’s clients leverage generative AI technology.

Many PwC employees should be aware of AI, ChatGPT and more, executive says
PwC plans to assess which is the most relevant generative AI information to provide to employees, based on their responsibilities and job description. The company also plans to deliver the materials and information through live training sessions, gamification and other means.
For non-technical workers, such as administrative staff who do not work with customers, the level of upskilling will be different from those who work with customers or those who work in IT, for example.
“There’ll be a lot of people who I just need to get to a level of awareness about what is AI, what’s the difference between AI and generative AI, and why does it matter,” says Joe Atkinson, vice chair and chief products and technology officer for PwC.

The goal of the training is to help these employees understand and appreciate the generative AI applications that are helpful and those that are not as effective, Atkinson says. 
Managing potential minefields of generative AI upskilling
One particular area of importance in upskilling PwC employees will be showing them how to use generative AI responsibly and transparently so everyone is aware of exactly what is being done, Atkinson says. ChatGPT, for example, has been cited as a potential tool for plagiarism, as well as one that could perpetuate bias in content.

That is a problem that PwC and other employers are looking to avoid. One way to minimize generative AI chatbot snafus is to understand how important it is to ask the right questions—or prompts—when working with the technology, explains Atkinson, noting this will be covered in PwC’s AI upskilling.
“It’s very important to make sure you’re crafting prompts in a way that actually gets you the output and outcome from generative AI that you’re looking for,” he says.
For example, a clerical employee may want to ask questions of ChatGPT to help them craft the initial first draft of a memo or letter. 
“The training will help them understand how to interact with the chatbot to get the best first draft and recognize AI’s strength is in the crafting of words and not always in the crafting of the facts,” Atkinson says. “That understanding is really important for somebody who is just experimenting with the early stages of how they can apply AI to their jobs.”
How generative AI upskilling can benefit the employee experience
Upskilling employees can enhance employee engagement for your workforce. PwC’s ChatGPT and generative AI training is expected to be no different in this intention, based on other technical training the accounting giant has offered its employees in the past.
“Often those people without the technical grounding are the most enthusiastic to learn about technology because for them the gap feels the biggest,” Atkinson says. “Their enthusiasm actually helps engage the people who are more deeply technical.”
PwC’s workforce in the U.S. underwent digital upskilling and skills future-proofing several years ago in order to prepare employees for emerging technologies and tools they would need to do their jobs then and in the future—wherever they would eventually be, says Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people officer at PwC, in an interview with HRE.
This summer’s effort with generative AI has the same goal.
“We fundamentally believe that all of our people need a foundational and fundamental understanding of generative AI, regardless of their role,” Seals-Coffield says. “If we all think about how we continue to grow as learners, this thing called life and this thing called work will clearly have generative AI be a part of that.”

Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

New Update










Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the world we live in, and it is becoming increasingly integrated into different sectors of the economy. With the advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics, AI has the potential to revolutionize the blue-collar industry. However, the widespread adoption of AI in this sector is also raising concerns about its impact on the workforce.

The Rise of AI in the Blue-Collar Industry
With the advancements in AI technology, blue-collar jobs are now being automated, leading to increased productivity and efficiency. According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, up to 30% of activities in 60% of occupations could be automated. For instance, in the manufacturing industry, AI-powered robots are being used to assemble products and perform quality control checks, reducing the need for human labor. The New World Robotics report shows an all-time high of 517,385 new industrial robots installed in 2021 in factories around the world. This represents a growth rate of 31% year-on-year and exceeds the pre-pandemic record of robot installation in 2018 by 22%. 
AI is also being used to optimize supply chain management by analyzing data to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks. This has led to a reduction in transportation costs, improved inventory management, and better customer service. Additionally, AI-powered machines are being used in the construction industry to improve safety and accuracy. For example, drones are being used to survey construction sites and inspect structures, reducing the risk of human error.

The Concerns about AI in the Blue-Collar Industry
Despite the benefits of AI, there are concerns about its impact on the blue-collar workforce. The integration of AI-powered machines is leading to job displacement, as machines are increasingly replacing human workers. This can lead to increased unemployment, reduced wages, and income inequality. According to a report by McKinsey Global Institute, up to 375 million workers worldwide may need to switch occupations or acquire new skills by 2030 due to automation and AI technologies.
Another concern is the skills gap that is emerging as a result of the adoption of AI. Workers who do not have the necessary skills to work with AI-powered machines are at risk of being left behind. This can lead to a mismatch between the skills demanded by the labor market and the skills possessed by workers, resulting in increased inequality, and reduced social mobility.

The Future of the Blue-Collar Industry with AI
The future of the blue-collar industry with AI is both exciting and uncertain. While the integration of AI is leading to increased productivity, efficiency, and safety, it is also leading to job displacement and a skills gap. However, there are steps that can be taken to mitigate these risks.
One approach is to invest in education and training programs that focus on the skills needed to work with AI-powered machines. This will help to bridge the skills gap and ensure that workers are equipped to thrive in the new economy. Additionally, there is a need for policies that support workers who are displaced by AI-powered machines. This can include unemployment insurance, retraining programs, and job placement services. Additionally, it could benefit to focus on the development of new jobs that are created due to the integration of AI.

The rise of Artificial Intelligence is changing the job market, and blue-collar workers may be particularly vulnerable to job loss due to automation. By upskilling and reskilling, exploring new job opportunities, focusing on skills that are hard to automate, and advocating for policies that protect workers, individuals can prepare for the changing job landscape. It is important for workers to take proactive steps to ensure that they are not left behind in the age of automation.

Login Women would land more roles in tech if employers used artificial intelligence in the recruitment process, new research has found.In what is believed to be the first academic study of its kind, researchers at Monash University and the University of Gothenburg found that human recruiters hiring for a web designer role scored women “substantially lower” than men when they knew their gender, but equal to men when the gender was hidden.“If [recruiters] know the gender, you observe a gender difference in assessments. But if they don’t know the gender, there’s no such difference,” lead researcher and Monash University professor Andreas Leibbrandt told The Australian Financial Review.Sapia.ai founder Barb Hyman said the research showed that AI could remove many of the barriers women faced in the tech industry. Eamon GallagherThe research, which used Melbourne-based start-up Sapia.ai’s technology in its experiments, also found that using an AI-powered chat-box interview to screen job candidates could offset this gender bias.Recruiters who knew the genders of the candidates but also knew their scores from the AI screening scored the men and women equally.Advertisement“If we give them not just the knowledge of which gender has applied, but also [the candidate’s] AI screening score, then there’s also no gender difference in assessments,” Professor Leibbrandt said.At the same time, the research discovered that informing candidates that their assessment would be reviewed by a computer instead of a human increased the number of females completing the application by about 30 percentage points relative to males, as women believed they would be judged more fairly by AI than a human.AI recruitmentOverall, the research found that using AI in recruitment almost doubled the number of women assessed to be among the top 10 per cent of performers, which means using it would likely result in more women being hired for similar types of tech roles.“The AI tool would have to be substantially biased against women to result in a lower level of gender diversity [in the male-dominated technology industry] than found without AI,” the study concludes.AdvertisementProfessor Leibbrandt, who co-authored the study with Dr Mallory Avery and associate professor Joseph Vecci, said the findings suggested that using AI as an initial screening tool could help employers in other industries reduce bias in their recruitment process.But he said more research was needed to confirm this finding, as this was the first study of its kind and was only focused on the technology industry.The research was based on two experiments and is believed to be the first academic study that investigates how the use of AI in recruitment directly affects both the demand for and supply of minority jobseekers.For the first experiment, the researchers posted an ad for a web designer job and invited more than 700 interested jobseekers to complete an application. Some applicants were told their application would be assessed by AI and others were told it would be assessed by a human. The researchers then measured application completion rates to determine whether informing applicants they would be reviewed by a computer would attract or deter women from completing the application.Two supplementary surveys with jobseekers subsequently allowed the researchers to work out why women were more likely to apply for a job when assessed by AI.The second experiment focused on the behaviour of the human recruiters. The researchers enlisted more than 500 tech professionals to act as recruiters for the web developer role, and then randomised “whether these professional assessors have access to the applicants’ evaluation scores provided by the AI software, as well as whether they can infer the applicants’ gender [from their names]”.Advertisement“This allows us to evaluate how supply and demand merge to generate an overall change in the diversity of the pool of applicants most likely to be considered for a job, those at the upper end of the evaluation distribution,” the researchers write.‘Capable of disrupting bias’Barb Hyman, Sapia.ai founder and chief executive, said the independent research demonstrated that using ethical AI in recruitment was “the most inclusive method of hiring”.“In 2022, women made up just 27 per cent of the workforce across STEM, which has dropped from 2020,” Ms Hyman said.“This research shows that an ethical AI system is capable of disrupting bias, and removing many of the barriers women face to entering the technology workforce.“If you hire based only on soft skills, behaviour traits, and cognitive ability, you will hire just as many women as you would men, if not more. Names, ages, genders, universities – they’re all irrelevant factors in deciding who is suitable for a role.”AdvertisementSapia.ai uses an AI-powered chat interview to screen applicants and provide employers with a shortlist of potential candidates. Other AI-assisted recruitment tools include HireVue, Humanly, HireScored and Paradox.ai.With Sapia.ai’s tool, candidates answer five questions in their own time and are not required to disclose their gender, age or race.The company’s software – which is trained on a database of structured interview responses spanning one billion words from 2.4 million candidates across 47 countries – then uses machine learning and natural language processing to read these answers and subsequently assess the candidates’ suitability for the job, giving each candidate a score out of 100.Candidates also receive an email with coaching tips and insights into their personality within 10 minutes of submitting their application. “It’s a science that understands people through language, and it’s very similar to what people are experiencing with the power of GPT,” Ms Hyman said.Clients include Medibank, Qantas, Woolworths and Suncorp.AdvertisementLooking past our CVsMedibank’s senior executive of talent acquisition, Andrew Retschko, said the insurer used Sapia.ai as part of its recruitment process for corporate roles and for addressing proximity bias when recruiting people internally. Proximity bias refers to the tendency for leaders to treat people who are physically closer to them more favourably. The pandemic-induced switch to hybrid working has made it a bigger issue for employers.“It’s one of the first things we ask candidates to complete after they have applied for a role at Medibank,” Mr Retschko said.“It’s a competitive talent market and this tool has been really useful in identifying candidates who may have been overlooked purely based on CV.“It’s also been helpful when it comes to internal moves and addressing any proximity bias that may exist in the workplace.“The tool supports internal candidates to show a side of themselves that may not be easily demonstrated in the day-to-day of work, particularly in a hybrid working environment.”RelatedThis bot will judge you in five questions at the first interviewRelatedMore women are studying science, tech.

Openai’s chatbots, which use large-language-model (llm) technology, got the ball rolling in November. Now barely a day goes by without some mind-blowing advance. An ai-powered song featuring a fake “Drake” and “The Weeknd” recently shook the music industry. Programs which convert text to video are making fairly convincing content. Before long consumer products such as Expedia, Instacart and OpenTable will plug into Openai’s bots, allowing people to order food or book a holiday by typing text into a box. A recently leaked presentation, reportedly from a Google engineer, suggests the tech giant is worried about how easy it is for rivals to make progress. There is more to come—probably a lot more.The development of ai raises profound questions. Perhaps most pressing, though, is a straightforward one. What does this mean for the economy? Many have grand expectations. New research by Goldman Sachs, a bank, suggests that “widespread ai adoption could eventually drive a 7% or almost $7trn increase in annual global gdp over a ten-year period.” Academic studies point to a three-percentage-point rise in annual labour-productivity growth in firms that adopt the technology, which would represent a huge uplift in incomes compounded over many years. A study published in 2021 by Tom Davidson of Open Philanthropy, a grantmaking outfit, puts a more than 10% chance on “explosive growth”—defined as increases in global output of more than 30% a year—sometime this century. A few economists, only half-jokingly, hold out the possibility of global incomes becoming infinite.Already have an account?Log inContinue with a free trialExplore all our independent journalism for free for one month.

There are examples of generative AI tools “hallucinating” and fabricating information.Creative workers have raised concerns about copyright infringement by AI platforms.The long-running debate about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the future of work has thrown up very few certainties. Until recently, there was, however, one fairly solid assumption: creative jobs would be safe from automation. The sudden arrival of generative AI has changed everything - or at least that’s how it feels to millions of people working in the creative industries. In a matter of a few months, writers, designers, photographers and filmmakers, among others, have had their futures opened up to speculation. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Then along came ChatGPT, DALL-E and MidJourney - and suddenly our social media feeds were filled with content that had no human input beyond a text prompt telling the AI what to create.Much of the public discourse around generative AI and creative jobs has focused on the potential threats – but researchers are pointing out that this technology also brings opportunities in terms of enhanced productivity, efficiency and profits. The potential impact of generative AI was a major focus at the World Economic Forum’s Growth Summit 2023, held in Geneva earlier this month. How will generative AI disrupt the creative industries? The current versions of generative platforms are in their infancy, with many still in beta trial mode. What is certain is they’ll become more capable at an exponential rate and that will raise the potential for disruption in the creative and many other industries. Research from Goldman Sachs suggests that generative AI has the potential to automate 26% of work tasks in the arts, design, entertainment, media and sports sectors. AI could automate a quarter of work tasks in art, design entertainment and media. Image: Goldman SachsThe Harvard Business Review reports that generative AI already has advanced capabilities across a broad range of creative content used in the marketing industry. The report says a refined version of GPT-3 called Jasper “can produce blogs, social media posts, web copy, sales emails, ads and other types of customer-facing content”. The report states that major food manufacturers, including Heinz and Nestlé, have already used AI-generated content in advertising campaigns. A screenshot shows AI-generated artwork used by Heinz. Image: YouTube/HeinzWhen Heinz asked DALL-E 2 to create versions of ketchup bottles in a series of artistic styles, the company noted that the AI largely recreated its own distinctively shaped bottle to represent the product. It ran with the idea to produce a video campaign ad – and so one of the world’s first AI-generated advertising campaigns was born.How can AI add value in creative industries? The fact that generative AI only emerged for public use a few months ago means many companies are only beginning the process of understanding how it can be used to add value. Management Consultancy McKinsey & Company took a close look at the fashion industry to test how it might be applied in one creative sector. McKinsey sees use cases across fashion that go well beyond the automation of tasks. The researchers identified opportunities in product development and innovation, marketing, sales and customer experience. As well as speeding up laborious tasks, generative AI can analyse seemingly unconnected data to deliver new insights that can add value across creative organizations. The report urges industry leaders to “make value your North Star” as they begin the generative AI journey. This means identifying the areas that can benefit the most from AI as a matter of priority, and then developing use cases and long-term goals based on the integration of generative AI into the business, says McKinsey.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

One major concern is that proprietary information and data used in prompts on generative AI tools are stored on the servers of AI companies. This risks the same information being served in response to future prompts, creating the threat of confidential data, content or designs entering the public domain. TechRadar reports that Samsung lost control of valuable source code and confidential meeting notes when staff included them in a ChatGPT prompt. Another issue with generative AI arose at the Guardian newspaper in the UK, where it was discovered that ChatGPT had manufactured articles and added the names of the paper’s writers, suggesting they were genuine Guardian reports. The issue only came to light when a member of the public enquired about an article she had seen on ChatGPT, only to find it had never existed. For creative industries, generative AI will bring a range of rewards – but only if sophisticated guardrails are put in place to protect original content and designs.

If so, when?Unfortunately, there are no clear-cut answers to these questions. Technology develops in unpredictable ways. But a paper published last month by three scholars — Princeton’s Edward W. Felten, Manav Raj of the University of Pennsylvania and Robert Seamans of New York University — offered some helpful insight, at least in terms of artificial intelligence as we now know it.The team looked into two types of AI: One capable of generating and analyzing speech (think ChatGPT) and the other with the same capacity for images (think Midjourney). It examined dozens of skills that humans use to perform their jobs, from writing to reasoning to lifting heavy things, for the potential for artificial intelligence to enhance those skills or to supplant humans entirely.The chart below provides an example of their analysis of professions related to art, design, entertainment, sports and media:−3−2−10123Language Model(ChatGPT)Image Generator(Midjourney)← Less impactedAVERAGEMore impacted →Median salaryAI exposure score0$100k$200kArts, entertainment, sports and mediaActor, musician, designer, reporter, athleteAvg. of the groupAvg. of the groupFashion designersDancers*Public relationsspecialistsInterior designersDancers*Fashion designersDancers*Public relationsspecialistsInterior designersDancers*Researchers developed the AI Exposure score by connecting 10 AI applications to 52 human skills across approximately 800 professions.* Jobs with $0 median salary are due to occupation code change or lack of data.Each dot in this chart represents a profession.Orange dots show the potential impact of AI language models such as ChatGPT. Public relations specialists will probably be significantly affected by language models, dancers likely won’t.Green dots show the potential impact of AI image generators. Interior designers probably will be greatly impacted by image models. Dancers, again, are likely to be least affected.Language models are more likely to impact jobs that rely on communication and language skills. While image generators are more likely to alter professions that depend more on visual or spatial abilities. Many occupations may be affected by both.Higher exposure doesn’t necessarily mean these workers will be replaced by machines, however. In some areas, artificial intelligence could give workers a productivity boost. In others, it could lead to automation and job loss. For example, while people in telemarketing are clearly vulnerable to chat bots, lawyers might use artificial intelligence to help them speed their work and get more done.Now that you understand how this works, let’s see how artificial intelligence could affect your own profession.Type in your job to see how AI could affect itEnter a job−3−2−10123Language Model(ChatGPT)Image Generator(Midjourney)← Less impactedAVERAGEMore impacted →Median salaryAI exposure score0$100k$200kManagement, business and financeCEO, director, financial analyst and loan officerHover over each dot to reveal the jobMost jobs will be affected — but not at the same rateBottom line: Highly skilled, highly educated white-collar occupations, ranging from architects to astronomers to judges, are most likely to see change as a result of the development of artificial intelligence.A recent study by researchers from OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, estimated that 80 percent of the U.S. workforce would have its work-related tasks at least 10 percent affected by language models. One in 5 would see at least half of daily tasks affected by artificial intelligence, the researchers found. In some cases, workers will need to learn new software that uses artificial intelligence to expedite their tasks and increase their productivity. Other jobs might go extinct entirely.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementThe charts below give some hint of the potential ramifications for different industries.

NYU’s Seamans, who is an associate professor of management and organizations, believes that it will still take a lot of time for the effect to grow large. “Whereas in 2019 [Elon] Musk was touting driverless fleets of Tesla by 2020 (still doesn’t exist), Chris Urmson, who knows AVs (autonomous vehicles) very well, was saying 30-50 years,” Seamans wrote in an email to us.Although it is clear that most jobs will be affected by artificial intelligence in one way or another, these changes won’t affect all workers at the same rate or at the same time. This gives us a bit of leeway to address some important questions: If technology allows one worker to do the work of five, who reaps the financial windfall from that? What role should the government play in fairly distributing the wealth that is created? Should we be taking universal basic income more seriously now, ahead of the disruptions that we know are coming? What can we do to help people adapt, learn new skills and find new jobs? Who will pay for that?This will not be the first time that new technology changes how we work, of course. From lamplighters to switchboard operators to video store clerks, professions have come and gone. We’ve adjusted.But artificial intelligence sure looks like a monster of a disrupter — even some of its lead creators are warning of its danger. There is still time to tame AI. We should slow it down to give people a chance to adapt and ensure that it will be a technology that benefits everyone, not just those already at the top of the food chain.Press Enter to skip to end of carouselOpinions on AICarousel - $Opinions on AI: use tab or arrows to navigateHow will Apple’s new AI change your phone?

Last week, the Writers Guild of America (WGA), went on a strike because of the proposed use of AI, specifically ChatGPT, in television and film writing. The guild argued that the use of AI would replace jobs, increase compensation disparities and lead to greater job insecurity for writers, reported Time. While this was happening, Geoffrey Hinton, the 75-year-old scientist widely seen as the godfather of AI, announced his resignation from Google, warning of the growing dangers in the field.

[+] Writers Guild of America in front of Netflix in Hollywood, California, on May 5, 2023. - The Hollywood writers' strike broke out last week over pay, but the refusal of studios like Netflix and Disney to rule out artificial intelligence replacing human scribes in the future has only fueled anger and fear on the picket lines. With their rapidly advancing ability to eerily mimic human conversation, AI programs like ChatGPT have spooked many industries recently. The White House this week summoned Big Tech to discuss the potential risks. (Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP) (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images
The BBC reported that Hinton, whose research on neural networks and deep learning has paved the way for AI systems like ChatGPT—which according to the Wall Street Journal is causing a stock-market ruckus—expressed regret over his work and raised concerns about bad actors’ potential misuse of AI. Hinton’s departure comes at a time when AI advancements are accelerating at an unprecedented pace. For example, KPMG announced last week that they would make generative AI available to all employees, including partners, for both client-facing and internal work.

Meanwhile, during an interview with the Wall Street Journal, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis expressed his belief that a form of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could be developed within a few years. Elsewhere, implications for medical leaders are becoming apparent. According to Erwin Loh, who explained in BMJ Leader, “new technologies like ChatGPT and generative AI…have the potential to transform the way we practice medicine, and revolutionize the healthcare system.” Loh’s article provided a great explanation of AI technologies in the context of healthcare and also offered insights into how they could be used to improve delivery.

So, it’s clear there is enormous potential to revolutionize the world of work. The question now is: how do we make sure that AI works for us rather than against us? After all, the opportunities are vast and growing. For example, research published by MIT Sloan Management Review concluded that “Data can help companies better understand and improve the employee experience, leading to a more productive workforce.” But, it must be remembered that job displacement is a genuine concern. Insider reported that “CEOs get closer to finally saying it—AI will wipe out more jobs than they can count.”

One study conducted by researchers from OpenAI, OpenResearch, and the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that around 80% of the US workforce could see at least 10% of their tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers), with around 19% of workers experiencing at least 50% of their tasks impacted. Having reviewed the study, Natalia Weisz, a professor at Argentina’s IAE Business School, concluded in an interview that, unlike previous technological revolutions, higher-paying occupations with more education requirements, such as degrees and even doctorates, are more exposed compared to those that do not require a profession. “We are moving into a phase in which traditional professions may very well be disrupted”, said Weisz.

“We are living in a time of rapid technological change. We must be mindful to ensure that these advances do not lead to job losses or create an unequal playing field,” said Shrenik Rao, editor-in-chief of Madras Courier, in an interview. Rao predicted that “Bots could replace journalists and columnists. Illustrators, cartoonists and artists could lose their jobs, too. Instead of telling stories in the public interest, stories will be produced based on what will garner views or clicks.”

Rao, who is also a columnist at Haaretz, went on to probe the ethical implications of AI-driven news production. “What will happen with journalistic ethics? Will the news be produced to serve certain political agendas? Will there be an objective filter for news and images?” He concluded that a lack of transparency over how AI is used in journalism could lead to further mistrust in the media.
Governments, industries, and individuals need to engage in a collaborative effort to navigate this brave new world. By fostering open conversations, creating robust regulatory frameworks, and prioritizing education and adaptation, we can ensure that artificial intelligence serves as a force for good, empowering humanity to overcome challenges and reach new heights. Leadership is, therefore, required to ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically: it is time for all to come together and propel AI forward in a way that works for everyone.

Nine out of 10 employers are eyeing a workforce with “ChatGPT experience.” Some companies have jumped in with both feet, while others worry about the tool and are banning its use at work or while using company hardware and networks.Proponents say bans protect sensitive or proprietary information, as execs worry that employees will reference trade secrets or client info while querying the AI.Is your company or HR team considering a ban on generative AI? We want to talk with you about it. Drop us a line by emailing hrbrew@morningbrew.com.Apple. The tech giant restricted employee use of ChatGPT, according to the Wall Street Journal. Apple reportedly told employees the decision was to prevent the release of confidential information. The company is reportedly working on a generative AI tool of its own.JPMorgan Chase. The bank has restricted employee use of ChatGPT, Jennifer Lavoie, global technology media relations rep, confirmed to HR Brew in an email. Lavoie pointed to remarks from CEO Jamie Dimon in the bank’s 2022 shareholder report highlighting company efforts to imagine new ways to incorporate generative AI into employee practices in the future.Deutsche Bank. “On ChatGPT specifically, like other banks we have currently blocked the website while we evaluate how to best use these types of capabilities while also ensuring the security of our and our client’s data. So it is protection against data leakage, rather than a view on how useful the tool is,” Deutsche Bank spokesperson Sen Shanmugasivam told us via email, adding that the bank is actively looking into how to use generative AI tools in a “safe and compliant way.”Verizon. “ChatGPT is not accessible from our corporate systems, as that can put us at risk of losing control of customer information, source code and more…as a company, we want to safely embrace emerging technology,” according to the telecom giant’s execs in a public address to employees.Quick-to-read HR news & insightsFrom recruiting and retention to company culture and the latest in HR tech, HR Brew delivers up-to-date industry news and tips to help HR pros stay nimble in today’s fast-changing business environment.SubscribeNorthrop Grumman. The aerospace and defense company blocked ChatGPT “until those tools are fully vetted,” it told the Wall Street Journal.Samsung. The electronics manufacturer has banned the use of generative AI tools after staff “uploaded sensitive code to the platform” in April, Bloomberg confirmed in early May.Amazon. A spokesperson for Amazon told the Wall Street Journal that rather than use ChatGPT for help with coding, engineers should direct queries to an internal bot called CodeWhisperer. But Adam Montgomery, a senior PR manager at Amazon, told HR Brew that the company has not banned the use of ChatGPT or other generative AI technology, nor asked engineers to use internal AI technology other than ChatGPT. “Amazon employees are allowed to use ChatGPT or other generative AI tools,” Montgomery said in an email.Accenture. The professional services company is not allowing employees to use generative AI tools while coding, and they cannot upload Accenture or client data without permission. Company spokesperson Katy Rosati told HR Brew that the use of technology is governed by the company’s core values, business ethics, and internal policies, and this includes tools like ChatGPT.Apple, Northrop Grumman, and Samsung did not respond to a request for confirmation or comment.—ADThis is a developing story.

 Generative AI, which is a type of artificial intelligence that can produce or create new content, has already started to impact the workplace in various ways. On the positive side, it can automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. For example, it can assist with data entry, customer service, and content creation. Additionally, it can help businesses to analyze and make sense of large amounts of data, leading to better decision-making.
However, the rise of generative AI also raises concerns about its impact on labor and employment. It is predicted that many jobs that involve routine tasks, such as data entry, customer service, and content creation, could be replaced by AI systems in the future. This means that some workers may need to reskill and transition into new roles to stay relevant in the job market.
Furthermore, generative AI has the potential to create new jobs that did not exist before. For example, it could lead to the creation of new job roles that involve working with and managing AI systems. However, it is unclear whether these new jobs will be enough to offset the job losses that may occur due to automation.
Overall, the impact of generative AI on labor and employment is complex and multifaceted. While it can bring about positive changes, it also poses challenges for workers and businesses.

For the most part, the humans have prevailed. Now, say some experts, with AI ubiquity on the horizon, the threat’s being realised: the robots really are coming for some jobs.A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs estimated that AI capable of content generation could do a quarter of all the work currently done by humans. Across the European Union and US, the report further notes, 300 million jobs could be lost to automation. And that could be dire, says Martin Ford, author of Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything.“It's not just that this would happen to individuals, but it could be pretty systemic,” he says. “It could happen to a lot of people, potentially quite suddenly, potentially all at the same time. And that has implications not just for those individuals, but for the whole economy.”Thankfully, it’s not all bad news. The experts issue their warnings with a caveat: there are still things AI isn’t capable of – tasks that involve distinctly human qualities, like emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking. And moving into roles that centre those skills could help lessen the chances of being replaced.“I think there are generally three categories that are going to be relatively insulated in the foreseeable future,” says Ford. “The first would be jobs that are genuinely creative: you’re not doing formulaic work or just rearranging things, but you're genuinely coming up with new ideas and building something new.”Getty ImagesWhile a robot may ostensibly provide a faster diagnosis, patients will still want humans to guide and educate them (Credit: Getty Images)That doesn’t necessarily mean all jobs that are considered ‘creative’ are safe. In fact, things like graphic design and visual art-related roles may be among the first to go; basic algorithms can direct a bot to analyse millions of images, allowing AI to master aesthetics instantly. But there’s some security in other kinds of creativity, says Ford: “in science, and medicine and law … people whose job is coming up with a new legal strategy or business strategy. I think that there's going to continue to be a place there for human beings”. The second insulated category, he continues, is jobs that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships. He points to nurses, business consultants and investigative journalists. These are jobs, he says, “where you need a very deep understanding of people. I think it’ll be a long time before AI has the ability to interact in the kinds of ways that really build relationships”.The third safe zone, says Ford, “are jobs that really require lots of mobility and dexterity and problem-solving ability in unpredictable environments”. Many trade jobs – think electricians, plumbers, welders and the like – fall under this umbrella. “These are the kinds of jobs where you're dealing with a new situation all the time,” he adds. “They are probably the hardest of anything to automate. In order to automate jobs like this, you would need a science fiction robot. You’d need Star Wars’s C-3PO.”While humans will likely remain in jobs that fall within those categories, that doesn’t mean those professions are totally insulated from the ascent of AI. In fact, says Joanne Song McLaughlin, associate professor of labour economics at the University of Buffalo, US, most jobs, regardless of industry, have aspects that are likely to be automated by the technology.“In many cases, there’s no immediate threat to jobs,” she says, “but tasks will change.” Human jobs will become more focused on interpersonal skills, continues Song McLaughlin. “It’s easy to imagine that, for instance, AI will detect cancers way better than humans could. In the future, I’m assuming doctors will use that new technology. But I don’t think the doctor’s whole role will be replaced.”Getty ImagesTrade jobs and jobs that require a great deal of mobility are more likely to be insulated from automation (Credit: Getty Images)While a robot may ostensibly do a better job of finding cancer, she says, most people will still want a doctor – a real person – to be the one to tell them about it. That’s true of almost all jobs, she adds, and so developing those distinctly human skills could help people learn to do their jobs alongside AI.“I think it’s smart to really think, ‘what kind of tasks within my job will be replaced, or will be better done by computer or AI? And what's my complementary skill?’” She points to bank tellers, who once had to be very accurate money counters. Now, that task has been automated – but there’s still a place for the teller.  “The task of money counting became obsolete because of a machine,” she says. “But now, the tellers are more focused on connecting with customers and introducing new products. The social skill has become more important.” It’s important to note, says Ford, that an advanced education or a high-paying position is not a defence against AI takeover. “We might think the person in the white-collar job is higher on the food chain than someone who drives a car for a living,” he says. “But the white-collar employee’s future is more threatened than the Uber driver, because we still don’t have self-driving cars, but AI can certainly write reports. In many cases, more educated workers are going to be threatened more than the least educated workers. Think of the person that works cleaning hotel rooms – it's really hard to automate that job.” In short, seeking roles in dynamic, shifting environments that include unpredictable tasks is good way to stave off job loss to AI. At least, for a while.FeaturesHow we work",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By: Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are no longer futuristic concepts; they are now part of how we live and work. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration uses the term AI to describe a branch of computer science, statistics, and engineering that uses algorithms or models to perform tasks and exhibit behaviors such as learning, making decisions, and making predictions. ML is a subset of AI that uses data and algorithms, without being explicitly programmed, to imitate how humans learn. 

 

Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D.

AI/ML’s growth in data volume and complexity, combined with cutting-edge computing power and methodological advancements, have the potential to transform how stakeholders develop, manufacture, use, and evaluate therapies. Ultimately, AI/ML can help bring safe, effective, and high-quality treatments to patients faster. 
For example, AI/ML could be used to scan the medical literature for relevant findings and predict which individuals may respond better to treatments and which are more at risk for side effects. Conversational agents or chatbots, which are based on “generative” AI, have the potential to answer people’s questions about participating in clinical trials or reporting adverse events. Digital or computerized “twins” of patients can be used to model a medical intervention and provide biofeedback before patients receive the intervention.  
The regulatory uses are real: In 2021, more than 100 drug and biologic applicationsExternal Link Disclaimer submitted to the FDA included AI/ML components. These submissions spanned a range of therapeutic areas, and sponsors incorporated the technologies in different developmental stages.
As with other evolving fields of science and technology, there are challenges associated with AI/ML in drug development, such as ethical and security considerations like improper data sharing or cybersecurity risks. There are also concerns with using algorithms that have a degree of opacity, or algorithms that may have internal operations that are not visible to users or other interested parties. This can lead to amplification of errors or preexisting biases in the data. We aim to prevent and remedy discrimination — including algorithmic discrimination, which occurs when automated systems favor one category of people over other(s) — to advance equity when using AI/ML techniques. To address these concerns, the FDA has released a discussion paper, “Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Development of Drug and Biological Products.” 
AI and ML in the Development of Drug and Biological Products
The discussion paper is a collaboration among the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, including its Digital Health Center of Excellence. The paper aims to spur a discussion with interested parties in the medical products development community, such as pharmaceutical companies, ethicists, academia, patients and patient groups, and global counterpart regulatory and other authorities, on using AI/ML in drug and biologic development, and the development of medical devices to use with these treatments. 
The paper includes an overview of the current and potential future uses for AI/ML in therapeutic development. It also discusses the possible concerns and risks associated with these innovations and ways to address them. For instance, the paper describes the importance of having human involvement, which will vary depending on how the technologies will be used. The paper also emphasizes adopting a risk-based approach to evaluate and manage AI/ML in facilitating innovations and protecting public health. 
The paper characterizes certain risks, such as biases in data used to train ML algorithms, or inaccuracies and completeness of these data. In addition, the paper outlines the role of monitoring the performance of models to ensure they are reliable, relevant, and consistent over time. 
There are also questions to consider, and a call for engagement and collaboration among the biomedical community. As a follow-up to the paper, we are planning a workshop to discuss how the community can work together to realize the potential of AI/ML for product development while being mindful of potential challenges. We look forward to hearing from experts on this important topic. 
CDER’s Discussion Paper on the Framework for Regulatory Advanced Manufacturing Evaluation
To further address the use of AI in drug manufacturing, CDER issued another discussion paper, Artificial Intelligence in Drug Manufacturing, as part of the Framework for Regulatory Advanced Manufacturing Evaluation (FRAME) Initiative. AI technologies are important in drug manufacturing because they can enhance process controls, identify early warning signals, and prevent product losses. We are also planning a second workshop for stakeholders to discuss the questions in our AI in drug manufacturing discussion paper.
Our agency’s efforts in AI/ML extend beyond these initiatives. We consult product developers, engage patients, and promote regulatory science in this area, among other activities. As a public health regulatory agency, we hope to encourage the safe development of these technologies that are poised to help Americans gain quicker and more reliable access to important treatments. The FDA’s work also supports the Administration’s ongoing work to ensure technology improves the lives of the American people, while advancing a cohesive and comprehensive approach to AI-related risks and opportunities.

DelaneyMay 8, 2023Leer en españolBy midyear, all of Morgan Stanley’s thousands of wealth advisers are expected to have access to a new artificial-intelligence-powered chat tool.The tool, which is already in use by about 600 staff members, gives advisers answers to questions such as “Can you compare the investment cases for Apple, IBM and Microsoft?” and follow-ups such as “What are the risks of each of them?” An adviser can ask what to do if a client has a potentially valuable painting — and the knowledge tool might provide a list of steps to follow, along with the name of an internal expert who can help.“What we’re trying to do is make every client or every financial adviser as smart as the most knowledgeable expert on any given topic in real time,” said Jeff McMillan, the head of analytics, data and innovation for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.Experts disagree about whether A.I. will wind up destroying more jobs than it creates over time. But it is clear that A.I. will alter work for most knowledge workers, shifting the skills they need and changing the staffing needs of most companies. Now it’s up to business leaders to figure out how to take advantage of the technologies today, while preparing workers for the disruption that the tools present over the medium term.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMoving too slowly may mean losing out on gains in productivity, customer service and — ultimately — competitiveness, similar to what happened to businesses that didn’t embrace the internet fully or fast enough. But at the same time, leaders must guard against the mistakes and biases A.I. often perpetuates and be thoughtful about what it means for employees.“Almost no matter which sector you are in, you need to be thinking about your company as becoming an A.I.-first company,” said Alexandra Mousavizadeh, chief executive at Evident, a start-up that analyzes finance companies’ A.I. capabilities.The type of A.I. underlying Morgan Stanley’s tool for advisers is called generative A.I. It can create content — including text, images, audio and video — from information it has analyzed. In addition to answering questions, it can be used in countless other ways, such as drafting memos and emails, creating presentation slides and summarizing long documents. Early research suggests that tools built using generative A.I. could speed up many tasks and increase employee productivity.Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford researchers, for example, found that customer support staffs equipped with an A.I. tool that suggested responses resolved 14 percent more customer issues each hour on average.But the gains were not evenly spread. Less-experienced workers made greater productivity jumps, because the tools effectively “captured and disseminated” the practices of their higher-skilled colleagues. Other recent M.I.T. research similarly noted that workers who weren’t initially as good at tasks managed to narrow the gap with those who were more skilled, performing better and taking less time when aided by A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOne possible conclusion from these findings is “that the advantage that someone had from tenure in terms of their performance has now diminished because a youngster with ChatGPT can perform as well as somebody who’s had a few years’ experience,” said Azeem Azhar, chairman of Exponential View, a research group. If the research plays out in broader practice, that could potentially lead some companies to invest more in junior staff members, while going lighter on more expensive workers who have been around longer.Some companies are already starting to make staffing decisions based on the anticipated impact of A.I. tools. IBM recently said it was slowing or stopping hiring for some back-office roles, such as human-resources functions, that could be replaced by A.I. over the next several years.The speed and productivity gains from A.I. will raise customer expectations, said Bivek Sharma, the chief technology officer for PwC Global Tax and Legal Services. “It’s then about making sure we can re-skill the work force quickly enough and A.I.-enable them quickly enough to meet the obvious demand that’s going to come on the back of it,” he said.PwC is working with Harvey, an A.I. start-up creating tools for lawyers, to roll out a chat A.I. tool to its entire legal advisory practice over the next few months. It plans to extend such technology to its tax and human resources experts as well.Beyond quickly providing staff members with answers that draw on the firm’s expertise, PwC’s goal is to generate new insights, including eventually by analyzing its clients’ data as well, Mr. Sharma said. The A.I. could potentially be fed all of the contracts of two companies contemplating a merger, for example, and allow PwC experts to query for specific types of provisions and risks.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Think of this as really an augmentation play rather than a timesaving play for us,” Mr. Sharma said. “This is almost like a senior associate that is attached to every one of our legal and tax advisers augmenting what they can do day to day for their clients.”Larger companies generally need to invest in A.I.-savvy technical staff members, who can adapt the technology for their business. Already, “there are companies that can’t adopt ChatGPT because they simply don’t have the sort of basic rails upon which to run it on, which is content management and the data in order,” Ms. Mousavizadeh said.They also need to hire or train new specialists, for roles that don’t necessarily require technical expertise. Morgan Stanley’s Mr. McMillan and other corporate executives say the A.I. platforms require continuous “tuning,” with humans adjusting parameters and information sources to get the best results for users. This tuning has created a need for a new group of workers known as “prompt engineers” or “knowledge engineers.” Morgan Stanley and PwC are among those building their own versions of A.I. chat tools that draw from internal materials.Concerns about security, confidentiality, accuracy and intellectual property rights have led many companies to restrict their staffs’ access to public ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools. They want to avoid what reportedly happened at Samsung, where employees working in its semiconductor division are said to have shared confidential computer code and meeting notes while using ChatGPT. Executives are also concerned about the frequent errors and built-in biases with some A.I. tools.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut part of the opportunity with tools that use generative A.I., which allow users to type questions or commands in normal language, is to include a broader group of nontechnical staff members in figuring out how it can change a company’s business. “Your people should be using these tools really, really regularly so they can start to build up their competencies and your own internal firm competencies,” Mr. Azhar said.He suggests that A.I. public tools can be used in ways that don’t endanger confidentiality or security. For example, an employee could ask ChatGPT about the best ways to combine types of sales data to tell a compelling story without actually entering the data itself. The opportunity, he says, comes from “front-line employees of whatever seniority deciding to improve their work through generative tools.”Kevin J.

A representative for Octopus Energy told Insider: ""Our team supervises the answers AI provides, so, for example, drafting a personalized response that a team member can review and then send on.""Workers at other companies recently reported on the experience of using AI tools to help carry out their work. One worker told Vice that OpenAI's ChatGPT did 80% of their job.Jackson told the Times of London that the development was unlikely to lead to job losses at his company but that the pace of AI technology had the potential to cause ""huge and rapid dislocation"" to the job market.In March, a report from Goldman Sachs found that generative AI tools like ChatGPT could lead to ""significant disruption"" in the labor market and affect around 300 million full-time jobs globally.

Only 4% of C-suite level respondents said they consider the risks associated with using AI to be “significant,"" and less than half said they have AI expertise at the board level.These figures spotlight a concerning reality: many organizations are underprepared for AI, lacking the proper oversight and expertise from key decision-makers to manage risk. And if unaddressed, organizational blind spots around the technology’s ethical and effective deployment are likely to overshadow transformative opportunities while causing organizations to lose pace with the explosive growth of the technology. Have you read?As AI develops rapidly, what is the future ethical cost?4 ways AI is helping humans make informed decisionsHere's how companies should navigate generative AI in the world of workHow is generative AI changing the risk landscape? These days, AI-related progress and adoption is happening at an exponential rate – some argue too quickly. While this exponential growth has renewed focus on the use of AI, the reality is that academics, scientists, policy-makers, legal professionals and others have been campaigning for some time now for the ethical and legal use and deployment of AI, particularly in the workplace where existing applications of AI in the HR function are abundant (e.g., talent acquisition, administrative duties, employee training). According to our survey, 75% of companies already use AI tools and technology for hiring and HR purposes.In this new phase of generative AI, core tenets around AI adoption – such as governance, accountability and transparency – are more important than ever, as are concerns over the consequences of poorly deployed AI.For example, unchecked algorithms can result in biased and discriminatory outcomes, perpetuating inequities and dampening workforce diversity progress. Data privacy and breaches are another concern, easily occurring through the non-anonymization and collection of employee data.Generative AI has also given way to new IP considerations, raising questions around ownership of both inputs and outputs from third-party programmes and subsequent copyright infringement concerns. Broadly, we have seen governments and regulators scrambling to implement AI-related legislation and regulatory enforcement mechanisms. In the US, a key focus of emerging legislation will be on the use case of AI in hiring and HR-related operations. Litigation, including class actions, is also on the horizon. We are already seeing the first wave of generative AI IP litigation in the US, and these early court decisions are shaping the legal landscape absent of existing regulation. Organizations who implement generative AI also should assume that data fed into AI tools and queries will be collected by third-party providers of the technology. In some cases, these providers will have rights to use and/or disclose these inputs. As employers look to equip their workforces with generative AI tools, are they putting sensitive data and trade secrets at risk? In short, yes. All in all, each new development seems to open questions faster than organizations, regulators and courts can answer them.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

Contact us.How can organizations enhance their AI preparedness? Generative AI is changing the paradigm, and risks around specific use cases will continue to arise. To stay ahead, organizations will need to move current approaches beyond siloed efforts and bring together discrete functions under the umbrella of a strong governance framework. While many organizations rely on data scientists to spearhead AI initiatives, all relevant stakeholders, including legal, the C-suite, boards, privacy, compliance and HR, need to be involved throughout the entire decision-making process.This representation gap was made clear in our survey findings. Currently, only 54% of respondents said their organization involves HR in the decision-making process for AI tools, and only 36% of respondents said they have a Chief AI Officer (CAIO) in place. In this high-risk environment, the CAIO will play a critical role in ensuring relevant governance and oversight is in place at the C-Suite level and involve HR in training and fostering a cross-functional AI team. Hand in hand with this, organizations should prepare and follow an internal governance framework that accounts for enterprise risks across use cases and allows the company to efficiently make the correct compliance adjustments once issues are identified. The risk for companies with no AI governance structure and a lack of oversight from key stakeholders – or ones that rely wholesale on third-party tools – is the use of AI tools in a way that creates organizational legal liability (e.g., discrimination claims). Virtually all decision-making, whether AI-based or otherwise, creates bias. Companies that use these tools must develop a framework that identifies an approach to assessing bias and a mechanism for testing and avoiding unlawful bias, as well as ensuring relevant data privacy requirements are met.Efforts to combat bias should be further supported by effective measures for pre and post-deployment testing.Companies who deploy AI must also ensure that there are processes in place that provide a clear understanding of the data sets being used, algorithmic functionality and technological limitations, as proposed legislation will likely include reporting requirements. The final outlook for AI The takeaway is simple: AI is being widely and quickly adopted and provides many benefits. But it is being rolled out and developed so rapidly that strategic oversight and governance become even more critical for its responsible use and risk mitigation.Many organizations both are unprepared for AI and underappreciate the risks, making the willingness to deploy this technology without proper guardrails concerning. Fortunately, by establishing strong governance and oversight structures, organizations can withstand these technological tides no matter where they are in their AI journeys.Beyond this, the longer-term solution to managing AI-related risk will rely on informed stakeholders across legal, regulatory and the private sector joining forces to advance legislation, codes of practice or guidance frameworks that recognize both the opportunities and risks the technology presents. With a secure framework in place, organizations can enable themselves to deploy AI technology and harness its benefits more confidently.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on Tech and InnovationSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Forum InstitutionalEmerging TechnologiesShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

The question ""do we really need to go to the office?"" is something many employees are asking in the face of the leadership at major companies like Amazon, Apple, Disney, Starbucks, and JP Morgan mandating three or more days a week of office-based work. Employees are adamant that they are doing their jobs effectively at home, and data supports the improved productivity of remote work. But many leaders feel concerned about a range of issues, from problematic communication and coordination to cybersecurity, which they feel remote work undermines.


However, with the advent of generative AI like ChatGPT, we are on the cusp of realizing the full potential of remote and hybrid work by reducing - while not eliminating - the benefits of office visits. AI is not just a futuristic buzzword; it's a transformative force that's reshaping the workplace and redefining the meaning of work itself.

I talk to five-ten leaders each week about hybrid and remote work, and in recent months, our conversations have centered on how generative AI can help us unlock the full power of remote and hybrid workforces. That includes enabling more effective information sharing, enhancing communication and collaboration, improving productivity and efficiency, supporting knowledge management and skill development, and ensuring security and privacy.

Communication and Coordination
No more watercooler gossip, but who needs it when AI-powered tools can help us share information and coordinate more effectively than ever? AI-driven applications reduce the need for physical office spaces, making remote work a breeze by facilitating instant access to relevant data and documents, streamlining communication channels for optimal collaboration, and providing intelligent recommendations for meetings, resources, and priorities. Imagine your office as a well-orchestrated symphony, with AI as the virtuoso conductor.

By integrating AI into information sharing systems, remote workers can quickly locate the necessary resources to complete their tasks, reducing the time spent searching for documents or waiting for colleagues to respond to queries. This efficient distribution of knowledge empowers employees to work independently while still maintaining a sense of connection to their colleagues and the organization as a whole.

Loneliness and isolation can be remote work's kryptonite, but AI comes to the rescue with innovative solutions that empower communication and collaboration. By harnessing the power of AI, remote workers can leverage smart tools to enhance video conferencing, document sharing, and project management. AI can help remote workers video conference like pros by adjusting factors like lighting, the background image, and even the ""smoothness"" of participants' faces. This helps remote workers look their best on camera and ensures that they can put forward a consistent, professional appearance. AI also makes live video conferences more efficient by providing features like real-time transcription, translation, and captioning.

AI is a productivity powerhouse that can free remote workers from the shackles of repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities. With AI's help, remote workers can automate mundane tasks and streamline workflows for maximum efficiency. By analyzing patterns in employee behavior and performance, AI can identify areas for improvement and provide tailored recommendations for optimization. This enables remote workers to manage their time effectively and prioritize tasks in a way that maximizes productivity and minimizes burnout.
In a remote work environment, knowledge is power, and AI is the key to unlocking it. AI empowers remote workers to access and share knowledge by identifying experts and curating relevant content tailored to individual needs. By utilizing natural language processing and machine learning, AI can understand queries and provide personalized answers, enabling remote workers to access timely and relevant information. AI can also curate and organize information from various sources and present it in a user-friendly way, streamlining the process of locating and absorbing knowledge.
AI supports skill development by personalizing learning paths and offering customized resources for remote workers. By analyzing individual strengths, weaknesses, and interests, AI can recommend targeted training programs and learning materials that enable remote employees to continually expand their skillsets and stay competitive in the job market. AI also facilitates the exchange of best practices, feedback, and advice among peers, creating a supportive and growth-oriented remote work environment.
Cybersecurity and Privacy
Remote work often raises concerns about data security and privacy, but AI has our backs. AI-powered tools can help ensure the security and privacy of remote workers by detecting and preventing cyberattacks with advanced threat intelligence. By continuously monitoring networks and devices for any signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity, AI can quickly identify potential vulnerabilities and neutralize threats before they escalate.
Additionally, AI can encrypt data and enforce policies to safeguard sensitive information, ensuring that remote workers can confidently access and share company resources without compromising security. This is especially important in industries that handle sensitive data, such as finance and healthcare, where a security breach could have severe consequences.
Health and Wellbeing
AI can also improve the well-being and quality of life of remote workers by monitoring health indicators, providing feedback and reminders, and predicting mental health issues. By analyzing data from wearables and other health monitoring devices, AI can provide personalized recommendations for maintaining physical and mental well-being. This might include suggestions for exercise, diet, and sleep, as well as reminders to take breaks and practice stress-reducing techniques.
By identifying patterns of behavior that may indicate burnout or other mental health concerns, AI can alert remote workers and their managers to potential issues before they become serious problems. This proactive approach to mental health can help create a healthier and more supportive remote work environment, fostering long-term employee satisfaction and retention.
Managing AI Risks
While the benefits of generative AI for remote and hybrid work are immense, it's important to recognize and address the potential risks associated with the widespread adoption of AI technology. By proactively managing these risks, organizations can confidently harness the power of AI to revolutionize the way we work.
One potential risk is the legal liability associated with AI-driven decisions and actions. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated and autonomous, questions arise about who is legally responsible when an AI system makes an error or causes harm. Organizations must take steps to ensure that clear guidelines and regulations are in place to determine the extent of their liability in such cases, as well as establish robust governance frameworks for AI decision-making.
Another challenge to consider is the potential for bias in AI algorithms. Since AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data, they may inadvertently learn and perpetuate existing biases present in the data. This could lead to unfair treatment of certain individuals or groups, resulting in legal and ethical concerns. To mitigate this risk, organizations must prioritize transparency, fairness, and accountability in their AI systems by conducting regular audits, using diverse training datasets, and ensuring that stakeholders are involved in the development and deployment of AI technology.
Privacy and data protection are also critical concerns when using AI in remote and hybrid work environments. Organizations must ensure that they are compliant with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and implement robust privacy policies to safeguard personal information. This includes obtaining explicit consent from remote workers to collect and process their data, as well as implementing strong encryption and access controls to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or misuse.
Moreover, the reliance on AI technology in remote work may raise concerns about job displacement and the future of work. While AI can automate repetitive tasks and improve productivity, there's a risk that some jobs may become obsolete, leading to workforce displacement and social disruption. To address this challenge, organizations must invest in reskilling and upskilling their workforce, ensuring that employees can adapt to the changing job landscape and remain competitive in the age of AI.
Conclusion
The benefits of generative AI for remote and hybrid work are immense. By enabling more effective information sharing, enhancing communication and collaboration, improving productivity and efficiency, supporting knowledge management and skill development, and ensuring security and privacy, AI is revolutionizing the way we work and making it less important than ever to go to the office.
Still, it's crucial for organizations to proactively manage the associated risks and ensure legal liability is properly addressed. By doing so, they can confidently embrace AI technology to unlock the full potential of remote and hybrid workforces and pave the way for a more flexible, efficient, and fulfilling work experience.
The future of work is here, and AI is the driving force behind this transformation. As we continue to embrace AI technology, we can unlock the full potential of remote and hybrid workforces and pave the way for a more flexible, efficient, and fulfilling work experience. It's time to embrace the AI revolution and harness its power to redefine the very concept of work, creating opportunities for growth and innovation that extend far beyond the confines of the traditional office space.

This is where prompt engineering skills come in. Learning to get the best results from generative AI is a skill that needs to be learned and honed, just like becoming professionally adept in any other computer software.
Often this can be an iterative process. A vague, general prompt will get a vague, general response, but it's a start, and from there, it can be refined. The engineer uses their human judgment and communication skills to spot what's lacking in the AI-generated work and refines their prompts until they get the result they want.
Using natural language generating (NLG) AI like ChatGPT to write the code for a useful software application is a good example.
Say you have an idea for a new app – you might want to create a tool that lets shift workers at your company arrange ride-sharing journeys to work and back home in order to reduce the business’s carbon footprint.
If you simply tell ChatGPT to write this app for you, it’s going to fall over. The code is too complex for it to output in one go, and it doesn’t have the data it needs to do the job.
It's perfectly possible that it can do it, though – if the job is broken down into appropriate chunks and if it's provided with all the necessary data.
A good prompt engineer can be thought of as a “project manager” for an AI workforce, overseeing the completion of individual tasks that make up the job and ensuring all the workers (AI agents) have the tools (data) they need to get it done.
Another useful concept in prompt engineering is roles. This allows more relevant and engaging responses to be generated by defining the “persona” of the AI. Just as a human might answer a question a different way depending on whether they are, for example, a teacher, a scientist, a philosopher, or a comedian, a prompt engineer can define a personality, traits, and beliefs that should inform the AI’s responses.

What skills are needed?
Many of the skills needed to get the best results from generative AI applications are those that we consider to be soft skills as opposed to hard, technical skills.
First and perhaps foremost are communication skills. You need to be able to express what you want the AI to do in a precise and clear way, just like if you were giving instructions or training to a human workforce.
You will need attention to detail – the greater depth you can go into about exactly what type of response or content you are looking for, the more successful you will be at prompt engineering.
Also essential are good organizational skills. You need to be able to identify the individual elements of a piece of work and instruct the AI on how to work through them systematically.
Data skills are very useful, too, as you need to be able to work out what information the AI needs to get the job done, where to find it, and what format it should be in to get the AI to process it.
Subject matter expertise is also beneficial, as not every output from generative AI applications is correct, and people with subject knowledge will find it easier to evaluate the responses.
You also need the ability to think critically in order to assess the different approaches that can be taken to getting the AI to complete a given task and decide which ones are likely to work.
And project management and planning skills are important in order to identify areas where generative AI can be useful within your organization and roll-out strategies for using it to create value.

Who is hiring prompt engineers?
Companies ranging from digital advertising agencies to software developers, healthcare providers, and utility companies are advertising for prompt engineers.
Time reports that the number of job postings containing GPT rose by 51% between 2021 and 2022.
California AI startup Anthropic says that its roles are a hybrid of ""programming, instructing and teaching"" and advertises salaries of between $280,000 and $375,000.
London-based digital agency Rehab is looking for prompt engineers who can prototype new applications of LLM technology, develop their ability to fine-tune and communicate with language models, and maintain an up-to-date knowledge of the field.
And Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts is looking for prompt engineers to deploy large language models to assist with healthcare research and clinical practice.

How Do I Learn Prompt Engineering?
Although it's a very new field, there are already a number of courses available online that will teach the ins and outs of prompt engineering.
Online course portal Udemy offers a number of courses in generative AI prompt engineering, including ones focused on mastering ChatGPT and using Midjourney to create AI images.
The Next-Level Prompt Engineering with AI online course promises to teach students to create effective prompts that will give them a competitive edge over everyone else trying to use AI to automate their tasks.
Cloud Academy has a super-short beginner-level introduction called ChatGPT Prompt Engineering that teaches the basics of chaining prompts together, as well as training ChatGPT to take on a specialist role.
Datacamp also has an Introduction to ChatGPT course that teaches best practices for writing prompts, as well as covering ways that the chatbot can be used across different businesses.
And Class Central has a number of free prompt engineering courses, including Prompt Engineering Overview, A Crash Course on Chat GPT for Beginners, Get Started with Midjourney, and Automate Useful Professional Tasks Using Open AI.

Universities have been scrabbling to understand what AI applications such as ChatGPT are capable of and introduce guidance on how they can be used - and now, they're being urged to teach students how to use them. Academics at the University of Bath have been considering the challenges and opportunities.""Our first question was, 'Could this be used by students to answer our assessment questions?'"" James Fern says of ChatGPT - an online tool that can answer questions, including producing essays and emails, in human-like language.James has been looking at how robust his department's assessments are""Multiple choice questions, for example, it will handle those very well.""We definitely were not expecting it to do as well as it did... it was getting close to 100% correct.""But with more complex questions, which require students to think critically and which he says make up the bulk of assessment, it struggles.One example, from a final-year assessment, reads: ""Why is it important to understand the timing of exercise in relation to nutrition status in people with [a technical term, according to James] overweight?""And there are tell-tale signs the answer given by ChatGPT was not written by a student. ""On first glance, it looks very good - it looks very clearly written, it looks quite professional in its language,"" James says.But some of the statements are more like those of a GCSE pupil than a university student. It has a habit of repeating the exact phrasing of the question in its introductions and conclusions, ""just written in slightly different ways"".And when citing sources of information, as is standard in academic work, it simply makes them up.""They look perfect - they've got the right names of authors, they've got the right names of journals, the titles all sound very sensible - they just don't exist,"" James says.""If you're not aware of how large language models work, you would be very easily fooled into thinking that these are genuine references.""Big Tech bosses told to protect public from AI risksAI investigated in UK over fears of dominationAI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'Since ChatGPT was released to the public, about six months ago, many students have been unsure when they can and cannot use it.""I might be tempted to use ChatGPT... but currently, I'm too scared to because you can get caught,"" says one student walking between classes on campus.""It's not clear yet what is considered cheating with ChatGPT,"" another says. ""If you copied your whole assignment from ChatGPT that's cheating - but it can be really helpful to guide.""Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said in a speech on Monday that AI was ""making a difference in schools and universities already"", and suggested it could help school teachers with lesson plans and marking.  New advice from Quality Assurance Agency, which reviews standards at UK universities, urges them to equip students with AI skills they can take into the world of work.It encourages them to explain to new and returning students, in September, how and when AI should be used - and to adapt courses where appropriate. Marketing lecturer Kim Watts calls it ""another tool in the toolbox"". And some students in her department have already started using ChatGPT this term, in coursework that asks them to produce a marketing plan.Kim says ChatGPT will help get ""students started on things""""I'm suggesting that students go to ChatGPT, those who maybe don't know where to start... and start playing around with prompts,"" she says.""It won't give them the answers - but it can give them ideas.""'Critical thinking'Kim demonstrates by asking ChatGPT to produce its own marketing plan.It responds with a series of numbered points - everything from the creation of a brand identity to the use of social media. But Kim, looking up from her screen, says: ""This will not pass.""Submitting something like this is just not detailed enough - it doesn't show us any learning, it doesn't show any critical thinking.""Neurodivergent students and those for whom English is not their first language will benefit most from ChatGPT, Kim says.But any student choosing to use it will be asked to submit their ChatGPT prompts and answers as an appendix, to make it ""really clear how far they have come"" from the chatbot answers.Summer examsAs with most universities, Bath's policy on ChatGPT and other AI tools is still in the works. It is due to be in place from September. After that, a team will meet throughout the year to ensure it keeps up with the rapidly changing technology.In the meantime, many staff are once again setting in-person, invigilated summer exams. Dr Chris Bonfield, the head of a team that helps design assessments, says the ""default assumption"" is students should not be using ChatGPT this year. And, if staff decide to allow it, they should clearly set out their expectations.The pace at which the technology is evolving poses a challenge for universities - but Bath quickly moved away from conversations about banning it.Chris says the pace at which the technology changes poses a challenge for universities""This tool is not going away,"" Chris says.""In order to ensure our students are equipped with the skills they need for the future workplace, but also that our degrees remain current, we're going to have to engage.""'Too dangerous'Last week Geoffrey Hinton, widely regarded as the godfather of AI, resigned from Google, saying he regretted his work - and chatbots could soon be more intelligent than humans.Prof Verena Rieser, a computer scientist at Heriot-Watt University who has been working in the AI field for two decades, says her own students are ""using it in very creative ways"" - but chatbots are still in the early stages of development and ""can be used to generate misinformation at [a] scale which is obviously very concerning"" when it comes to education. Previous models of ChatGPT were not released because they were deemed ""too dangerous"", she says.Its developer, OpenAI, says ""like any technology, these tools come with real risks"" and it works ""to ensure safety is built into our system at all levels"".Since ChatGPT's launch, other companies have focused their efforts on AI. Google, for example, released Bard, which is available to adults only.""I would expect that we'll soon see different flavours of ChatGPT by different companies out there and hopefully also safer models which actually mitigate for the possible dangers,"" Verena says.""At this moment we don't really know how to stop the models outputting information which is wrong or toxic or hateful - and that's a big problem.""Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

The release of generative AI tools like ChatGPT to the public has prompted consternation about privacy and the spread of misinformation and bias. Not long after Microsoft released an AI-powered version of its search tool, Bing, to a select group of users in February, Bing threatened a philosophy professor with blackmail.A month later, some of the biggest names in tech signed an open letter urging the world’s leading artificial intelligence labs to pause training their super-powerful computer systems for six months, arguing that recent advances in AI present “profound risks to society and humanity.” In an op-ed in TIME the same day, Eliezer Yudkowsky, a decision theorist who leads the nonprofit Machine Intelligence Research Institute, urged the labs to shut down their research entirely. “Many researchers steeped in these issues, including myself, expect that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI, under anything remotely like the current circumstances, is that literally everyone on Earth will die,” he wrote.But Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella isn’t worried. Microsoft has put at least $13 billion into OpenAI, the lab that launched ChatGPT in November; both Microsoft and Google rolled out products in March that they say will use AI to transform work—Google with AI powered features in Workspace that auto generate images, write and rewrite documents, and sort email; Microsoft with Copilot, an AI-based tool that works across its 365 suite of software (Word, Excel, Outlook) to summarize meetings, draft emails, and analyze data.In a May 8 interview, Nadella said Microsoft has done its best to mitigate unintended consequences of AI. Copilot, for example, does not create content or send emails without a human first entering data that guides the AI’s response. Such AI solutions, he says, will do our drudge work, freeing us to do the creative tasks where humans excel.Read More: The AI Arms Race Is Changing EverythingWhile skeptics cite big concerns about job displacement with this new wave of AI, Nadella argues that AI can democratize access to new skills, helping displaced workers find new jobs. Anyone can use generative AI—essentially algorithms that can create new content, including emails, white papers, and even code—as a partner at work, even if they don’t have a traditional education. That means that more people can become software engineers or security analysts, because they’ll be working alongside skilled AI. Microsoft thinks the world can sustain a billion professional developers and that AI can help quicken that growth.“That’s why AI is exciting,” he says. “We need new technology to help us with the economic growth that we enjoyed in the early part of the 20th century. What if we can have that type of economic growth this time around, but it’s much more even?”It’s true that productivity growth has been stunted in the U.S. After rising at an average rate of 2.8% between 1948 and 1970, productivity growth slowed to just 1.4% in the last 15 years. One reason for this slowdown, put forward by the economist Robert Gordon, is that we lack the technological advancements that came before 1970, like indoor plumbing, commercial air travel and the widespread adoption of communications technology. (The U.S. also saw a boost of productivity in the 1990s after the adoption of the PC.)Nadella thinks AI might bring productivity growth back to the halcyon days of the mid-20th century. Yes, there are risks to deploying AI, he says—jobs may be displaced, people may have to go through transitions, and AI may learn biases because the information it learns from comes from real people, who themselves have biases. But the benefits of AI could outweigh the risks.Microsoft’s own data suggests that the way we work today is broken. Microsoft’s Work Trends Index, released on May 9, shows that nearly two in three people polled say they struggle with having the time and energy to do their own job. The index surveyed 31,000 workers across 31 markets in February and March of 2023, and found that across Microsoft’s 365 software, the average employee spends a whopping 57% of their time communicating, and the rest creating. As a result, creativity is lagging; nearly two in three managers say they are concerned about a lack of innovation or breakthroughs on their teams.Of course, even if AI does alleviate some of the negative parts of people’s jobs, it might create new issues for much of the workforce in the process. AI can and probably will displace jobs. It can and probably will provide more misinformation into a world already full of it. It can and probably will exacerbate existing racial biases, since it learns from information already available in the world. And perhaps most pertinent for people already overwhelmed with information at work: it can and probably will create even more information for us to sift through.“AI is both going to be responsible for helping us manage a lot more knowledge but also creating a lot more knowledge that we will have to handle,” says Rowan Curran, an analyst at Forrester who researches AI and machine learning.Nadella contends that the benefits of AI—Microsoft’s AI, at least—will outweigh the potential negatives. After all, Microsoft put humans in the center of AI design by choice, he says, which in itself mitigates unintended consequences, he says. And, he notes, there is already healthy dialogue between governments and companies about what kind of regulation there should be on AI. “At the end of the day, I think we will all be judged by one thing alone, which is, “Do the benefits far outweigh anything that are the societal consequences?”That said, Microsoft has actively resisted European Union efforts to regulate the use of AI. The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act could ban certain uses of AI like facial recognition technologies, but Microsoft and Google have lobbied to ensure that “general purpose AI” of the kind that ChatGPT is based on is not covered in the regulations. Nadella said he was unfamiliar with what Microsoft may or may not be doing in Europe. He also refused to commit to any limits on the use of AI in military applications—relevant because competitor Google had to forgo a contract with the military that used AI to interpret video images and could have been used for drone strikes after thousands of workers signed a letter in protest.Read More: The New AI-Powered Bing Is Threatening Users. That’s No Laughing MatterOf course, we still don’t know the societal consequences of relatively unchecked AI usage. Critics say they could be dire, and that even AI developers do not understand the possibilities. Nadella says that this type of complexity or uncertainty aren’t unusual—we study science because we don’t fully understand it, after all.Today’s AI, he argues, fulfills the promise of the modern computer industry, which was founded in part to create tools to help the human mind understand more of the world around it. Way back in 1945, for example, in a seminal 1945 essay in The Atlantic, Vannevar Bush, an engineer who led the U.S. Office of Scientific and Research Development, suggested that further human advancement could only come if man mechanized his records more completely.AI may be the next step in this development, Nadella says, arguing that calls on companies to stop working with AI are, in some ways, calls to stop embracing economic growth. And this growth, because it’s so accessible, doesn’t have to be limited to Silicon Valley or even the U.S., but can be more widespread, he says.“Creating technologies that allow us as humans to be able to increase our knowledge, do science, and help the human condition is what has been core to enlightenment,” he says. “And so therefore trying to say, ‘Well, now is the time to stop,’ that doesn’t seem the right approach.”It may seem surprising that Microsoft, which not long ago seemed like it was falling behind competitors to its hoary Word and Outlook offerings, is talking about providing products that are the “core to enlightenment.” In the 2010s, as Apple and Google introduced new operating systems including web-based apps that stole Microsoft customers, some analysts were writing off Microsoft as a doomed business because of its focus on software that could easily be replaced, says Jason Wong, an analyst at Gartner. But Nadella, who took the helm in 2014, recognized the value of the cloud, and of artificial intelligence, Wong says. Microsoft’s share price has risen nearly tenfold since Nadella took the helm; the S&P 500 has merely doubled its value over the same time.The AI arms race is just beginning. For now, though, AI is showing up in something not very intimidating and perhaps even a little disappointing: applications like Word, Outlook, and Excel, the productivity software that many people have used for years and that would certainly be hard to imagine taking over the world and killing us all.That said, researchers have admitted that they don’t always understand why generative AI produces the results it does. As Microsoft lifts the lid off of its AI, releasing Copilot to more customers (its initial launch was for 20 enterprise customers) and integrating more AI like the open image generator DALL-E into PowerPoint, what is so scary is that no one—not even Satya Nadella—knows what is going to happen next.",,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/Lsj8tliq/poster.jpg?width=720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6278179/satya-nadella-ai-concerns/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-05-10T19:57:50.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/Lsj8tliq.m3u8,https://time.com/6278179/satya-nadella-ai-concerns/,PT7M21S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize almost every industry. It also poses significant risks to society and humanity, which is why it is crucial to have robust guidance and resources from both public and private sectors to ensure its positive impact. Along those lines, the Biden-Harris administration recently released a fact sheet about their efforts to safeguard people's rights and safety while maximizing the benefits of this groundbreaking technology.


One area where AI can either bolster or undermine progress is in corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. I spoke with several experts to explore the potential positive and negative outcomes of AI on DEI efforts, as well as how to ensure that AI is helping, rather than harming, those efforts.

Positive Potential 
There are several ways in which AI can be used to further workplace DEI efforts. These include improvements to hiring and performance management processes, bias detection in content, and identifying patterns of discrimination.

PROMOTED
""AI can be leveraged at almost every point in the recruiting process, from onboarding to pipeline management to employee experience and engagement,” shared Ariel Lopez, founder and CEO of Knac.

“AI algorithms can flag biases and improve hiring, performance management, and compensation policies helping to ensure equal opportunities for employee growth,"" added Shawn Ramirez, VP of data science at Glue. “AI recruiting tools can help companies balance the pool of candidates by improving the inclusivity of language used in job descriptions, and by sourcing candidates from underrepresented groups. AI for employee engagement can help a company surface when underrepresented groups feel disengaged, unearth root causes, and launch targeted interventions and support programs to improve retention and advancement among a diverse range of employees.”

Sarah Allali, CEO of Floode, explained, “AI models can play a crucial role in promoting diversity and equity at all stages of the employee journey. By replacing quantitative questionnaires with more nuanced analysis of employees' qualitative feedback, companies can gain a deeper understanding of their employees and identify patterns of discrimination. Also, a properly trained AI can understand individuals in a deeper and more comprehensive way than managers. AI can precisely comprehend the context and problems of each person, and take into account specific parameters to make decisions and create consensus that surpasses the limitations of managers.”

In addition to AI tools that can help companies boost DEI efforts, there are many stories from employees who have been able to leverage AI to improve their work communications. This can be particularly impactful for employees that are working in their non-native language, and neurodivergent employees that have barriers to communication. This increased ability to communicate effectively can lead to a greater sense of belonging in the workplace.

Negative Potential 
While AI can help promote DEI, there are risks involved if it is not properly designed and implemented. AI has the potential to perpetuate existing biases, and is only as good as the data that it is trained on.
""Existing patterns of bias and discrimination that lurk in the workplace also lurk in data. Without DEI-conscious development, AI will pick up these patterns and return outputs that can perpetuate and even exacerbate biases,"" shared Ramirez. ""AI systems should be carefully developed, monitored, and tested for fairness, explainability and inclusivity to mitigate these risks.""
Shirin Nikaein, co-founder and CEO of Upful.ai, added, “It's important to understand what data was used to train the AI and if the creators considered how bias in the data could impact the outcomes. When you use AI to have full control and make decisions, not just augment or help a manual process, and when folks don't fully understand how the AI is making that decision, it can perpetuate and amplify bias.”
It’s also important to recognise that AI cannot replace trained DEI practitioners – it can only be used to intentionally scale their expertise.
Latesha Byrd, CEO of Perfeqta, cautioned, ""DEI is based on human experiences, which means companies cannot let the convenience of AI override the human element when making decisions about equity.""
Risk Mitigation
To ensure that AI is helping rather than harming DEI efforts, companies should regularly audit algorithms to ensure they are free from discriminatory elements and take measures to secure and protect the data collected and used for AI systems. Companies should also have a trained human in the loop to review AI outputs and intervene when necessary.
“To ensure responsible and ethical AI innovation that supports DEI efforts, companies must adopt safeguards such as diverse and representative data sets, regular audits, transparent AI systems and clear ethical guidelines,” shared Nikita Gupta, co-founder of careerflow.ai.
Alejandro Martinez Agenjo, CEO and co-founder of Erudit, noted the importance of both public and private AI guardrails. ""As policymakers work on developing rules around AI, it's important for people-first organizations to come together and create their guidelines, to ensure ethical and equitable use of the technology,""
One of the initiatives that the Biden-Harris administration announced involves $140 million in R&D funding to launch seven new National AI Research Institutes.
Christina Blacken, founder and CEO of The New Quo, saw the potential in that funding. “One of the biggest problems with Generative AI is that it's an extreme scale AI. Extreme scale AI models are expensive to train and only so many companies can do so without outside funding. This concentrates power into the hands of a few companies, which leads to higher levels of bias and risk. This new R&D fund could potentially mitigate the financial problem of properly training generative AI, allowing smaller companies with higher levels of cultural competency to also be involved in vetting and shaping these tools, so that instead of promoting bias, the tools reduce bias.”
As with many cutting-edge innovations, it’s not the technology that is good or bad. The potential for AI to impact corporate DEI efforts in positive or negative ways comes down to how it is developed, used and monitored. The opportunity to create a more equitable and diverse workforce through the use of AI is there, and it’s up to everyone working on or with that technology to mitigate the potential risks and to leverage it for greater good.

Based on all the headlines we’re seeing about the proliferation of AI, in particular conversational chatbots and ChatGPT, the answer seems to catch some people by surprise: No … at least not yet and not in its current form.Though nobody (including those who are so eager to predict it) has any data on the future, if past technological revolutions are of any guidance, we can expect to see short-term disruption and uncertainty, followed by subsequent improvements. Indeed, we should be excited about the potential benefits of this AI revolution, notably the prospect of freeing humans to deploy their brains on more creative and intellectually fulfilling activities. Importantly, the AI age is still in its infancy – the internet equivalent of “dial-up”; we haven’t reached the wifi phase yet.Have you read?How to tell if artificial intelligence is working the way we want it toWhy artificial intelligence is vital in the race to meet the SDGsArtificial intelligence is learning to interact with the world the way humans doIf you really want to think about how this might play out in the future, look to the rise of fast food. While you can make the argument about its impact on our collective health, you can’t argue about its efficiency. Indeed, the fast food industry has made it very easy for people to get cheap and tasty food without paying much, spending time cooking and even moving from the couch. At the same time, the fast food industry has not caused the downfall of the hospitality industry, or put Michelin-star chefs out of business. Quite the opposite: it created lots of demand for slow food, farm-to-table and the gourmet experience that you get with someone who puts their full skillset and creativity on display. In other words, the more machines evolve, the more we value the unique skills and abilities only humans bring to the table – even if it isn’t in a Michelin star restaurant.ChatGPT, and more broadly AI, may well incentivize us to create and harness the intellectual equivalent of slow food; a healthier, more nutritious diet for our curiosity and hungry mind, rather than the quick fix we may get from fast food, even if most of the time we do consume fast food.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesIQ vs. EQWe have to face one potentially harsh reality: AI will probably win the battle for IQ against humans. It may have already happened. But what AI cannot do involves the key components that comprise emotional intelligence. EQ – skills such as empathy, consideration, kindness, self-awareness, self-control and caring for others – will remain 100% human qualities. We’ll need to continue to cultivate them. There will be a lot of need for human and humane validation in an age in which so much of our time is spent interacting with machines.Curiosity is a fundamental human trait that drives innovation and progress. It is the curiosity of the human mind that has led to remarkable discoveries and breakthroughs throughout history. As we embrace AI and immersive technologies, it is vital to encourage and nurture curiosity in ourselves and others. This includes asking questions, challenging assumptions, and seeking new ways of thinking and problem-solving. Curiosity allows us to explore the unknown, adapt to change, and continuously learn and grow.Creativity is another essential human skill that sets us apart from machines. It is the ability to think imaginatively and come up with new ideas, solutions and perspectives. While AI can analyze data and generate outputs based on patterns, it lacks the creativity and originality that humans possess. People that showcase human ingenuity and the power of creativity in their use of AI have the opportunity to make their jobs and lives more interesting because they are automating parts that were very boring and very repetitive, finding it’s helping to make them more productive.AI is not the enemyIt's important we don’t see AI, or any other emerging tech, including virtual and augmented reality, as a threat. There are many tasks across a multitude of jobs, including creative jobs, that are very repetitive, and we should relish the opportunity to outsource these – free up their time for more creative and intellectually sophisticated endeavors. After all, necessity is the mother of invention, and the record-breaking adoption levels of ChatGPT clearly highlight the human appetite for automating not just trivial, but also creative and intellectual tasks.While concerns are warranted, we should not fear, but experiment, learn, adapt and decide how to use and not use this tool, as well as the next version and generation of tools. Instead of making this a contest between humans and machines, we should ask how we can upgrade ourselves and have a more efficient and productive life, but also better lives with the help of machines. AI is only as smart as they people who program and prompt it. There are ways AI can, has and will surpass us. But it’s just a tool that could also help us lead a more human-centric life.AI is here to stay, and people are preparing for the change. During a recent poll on the ManpowerGroup LinkedIn page, we asked people which tech of the future they thought would most impact their career. Seventy-four per cent of respondents said AI tech, such as ChatGPT would have the biggest effect, followed by blockchain and the metaverse.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

While talking with CENTCOM’s chief technology officer, Schuyler Moore, I opined that in a peer fight the U.S. military’s data and communications networks may not hold up for even 24 hours. She waited a beat before saying, ‘I won’t comment on that but... heard and received.”


In the event of a conflict with China or Russia, what U.S. forces may be able to hear and receive will be critical. That includes the data that they will seek to mine for tactical and strategic insights using artificial intelligence (AI). At a recent conference in Austin, Texas, Ms. Moore said that simple connectivity is “at the core of anything related to” AI’s real-world adoption.

If that connectivity and a working, layered infrastructure for passing data from forward platforms and operating locations back to places where AI can be applied is impaired or disrupted then even the best algorithms are of little use.

PROMOTED
Aiding Connectivity and Computing 

Moore breaks down the means by which CENTCOM and the broader military implement AI into two chunks - connectivity and computing.
“Connectivity means, can I receive the data I need in order to apply artificial intelligence and can I send the outputs of that where they need to go?” Computing, she says, is a question of whether users can run algorithms where needed.

When discussing AI infrastructure, starting on the computing side is useful Moore suggests. To bring AI to bear, she explains, we have to ask where we are trying to do computing and processing of raw data? Is it done on a physical system whether on a Navy ship or with a soldier out in the field holding a device? Is it [done] at a headquarters?

Depending on where AI analytics are run there are associated size, weight and power (SWaP) issues. Having right-sized hardware becomes critical. And while having the ability to apply AI on-the-spot would be welcome, it’s not currently practical.

But there is work being done at CENTCOM and elsewhere to disperse processing power so that data can initially be run through limited AI at the tactical edge. “Then you can push that data back to another point that has a bit more computing power where they can run advanced analytics,” Moore says.
The commercial sector is leading the charge on improving computing capacity in small packages, Moore adds, which may allow CENTCOM and others to do denser AI processing near the front lines or at them. In fact, connectivity, or the lack thereof, may force a reliance on edge processing.
“Our ability to access bulk data determines where the processing has to happen,” Moore observes. “For example, imagine an unmanned aerial vehicle collecting video feed in a certain area. Depending on the bandwidth available, it may only be able to push so much data back to its headquarters if it’s beyond line of sight. That means you need to be very specific about what data you’re sending back. That creates demand for processing at the edge.”
Processing more data at the edge could relieve bottlenecks but so, obviously, could creating more bandwidth, more connectivity to ensure that more data can be pushed to a centralized processing location. “We’ve experimented with that at CENTCOM [using] radio-mesh networks, low earth orbit satellite networks and a number of other solutions that allow us to attack that problem,” Moore says.
The results have been encouraging. Moore explained that radio-mesh network experiments have largely been done with the Navy.
“We’ve been seeing how far we can extend unmanned surface vessels at sea and have them still be able to push back meaningful data to headquarters. Those experiments have been promising. We’ve had the ability to have UAVs aloft serving as network nodes, other surface vessels serving as network nodes. The more stuff you get out above, on and below the water, the more robust you’re network and the higher the odds of being able to push back data.”An MQ-9 Sea Guardian unmanned maritime surveillance aircraft system flies over Independence-variant ... [+] littoral combat ship USS Coronado (LCS 4) during U.S. Pacific Fleet’s Unmanned Systems Integrated Battle Problem (UxS IBP) 21, April 21.U.S. Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist Shannon Renfroe
Moore acknowledges that such a “radio-repeater” type of arrangement is stronger if some processing is done at the edge, reducing the volume of bulk data that must be transported back to a headquarters for AI processing. The combined edge-mesh approach dovetails with the agile combat employment (ACE) concept the Air Force is pushing and similar dispersed operational concepts the other services are evaluating to adapt to the challenging distances and tactical obstacles of the Indo-Pacific.
Finding a Place for AI Data
While these experiments and others CENTCOM has undertaken offer promising potential to expand connectivity in support of AI, they still rely on the physics of the RF spectrum. Adversaries and allies alike understand the high and low frequency options for such data transport intimately and understand that in any conflict bandwidth demand will be at a premium, limiting “space available” for data transport for AI.
Disrupting connectivity is at the top of the to-do list for any U.S. adversary and for American forces themselves so figuring out how much bandwidth will practically be available in a serious fight is a matter of speculation. Recent experience in Ukraine has demonstrated that cyber conflict may be more limited and attritive than originally thought but the manner in which the war is Ukraine being fought likely differs substantially from how a conflict in the Pacific may be waged.
Moore won’t comment on what chunks of spectrum AI infrastructure may most heavily rely on. I asked if CENTCOM had experimented with photonic communication. Moore replied that CENTCOM is testing “a range of spectrum options and are encouraged by the results we’ve seen”.
The Army sees line of sight, beyond line of sight, fiber, host nation, 5G, and SATCOM with LEO

0.0%, MEO, GEO satellites as communications/data pathways for its Integrated Tactical Network and the Integrated Enterprise Network which endeavor to create a “Unified Transport Network” combining command and control with a ubiquitous data layer.
Units from the company up through the battalion and brigade to division, with other maneuver type elements sprinkled in, will seamlessly access the UTN and AI data/processing would reside therein. It’s a construct similar to the Pentagon’s broader Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) effort, popularly referred to as an internet-of-military-things. But an awful lot has to go right for such seamless connectivity to remain seamless in time of war.
While Moore won’t be pinned down on how much space-based assets will be relied upon for enabling the connectivity that increasing AI use may require, she acknowledges that space will be important. Even if CENTCOM and others rigorously seek to exploit alternate pathways for data and processing, the position, navigation and timing (PNT) data necessary to accompany meaningful application of AI is at risk and it is largely space based.
Increasing edge processing- effectively localizing AI compute functions combined with human analysis in edge environments - may take some of the data transport burden away. But it too can be compromised if the space layer cannot yield the accurate PNT awareness needed to for AI inputs.
Moore adds an appreciated dose of reality to the infrastructure discussion when explaining CENTCOM’s outlook on the demand for AI output.
“Our view is that sometimes people incorrectly regard AI as giving you the answer to your homework. The reality is that it can point you in the right direction or cut down on some of the research time but at the end of the day, decision-making has to sit with a human operator. We’re learning where AI is most effectively and efficiently deployed.”
That includes considering the risk that bad data - regardless of how effectively it is transported and processed - may lead to faulty AI insights. For now, it’s not a large risk Moore says because “We’re applying it in such limited circumstances right now that you’d be hard pressed to say that decision-makers are overly influenced by it.”
“We are experiencing live,” she adds, “what the benefits and risks associated with algorithmic applications are and I think that because we’re taking an incremental approach it’s allowing us to set expectations for our leaders accordingly.”
As CENTCOM and others try to strike a balance between the discrimination needed to make the most effective use of AI with the means of processing it, they more clearly see the importance of the connectivity it requires and the challenge of maintaining it.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can increase productivity, boost economic growth, alter existing occupations and generate new ones. Without a doubt, AI will result in some job displacement in the short term, but there are numerous reasons to think that AI will also contribute to creating new jobs and economic growth in the long run.
Artificial intelligence can also help workers become more effective and productive by giving them access to real-time data and insights, enabling them to enhance their performance and make better decisions. In addition, AI can generate new employment opportunities in the creative and artistic industries by nurturing new modes of expression and creativity. For instance, artificial intelligence can produce original works of literature, music and art, allowing creators to work with AI systems to explore new kinds of creativity.

Similarly, by assisting organizations in identifying and averting cyberattacks, AI can create new jobs in the cybersecurity sector. For example, AI can spot behavioral patterns that could be signs of a cyberattack, enabling organizations to take proactive steps to stop or lessen the attack. Cybersecurity experts who are proficient in employing AI and machine learning techniques to protect against cyber threats may find new employment prospects as a result.

Enabling new products, services, industries and jobs with AI
By enabling the development of new products and services previously unattainable or unfeasible, AI can also create new jobs. For instance, AI can create personalized medicinal treatments, precision farming and sophisticated industrial methods. These new products and services can lead to new responsibilities in research, development and marketing, along with new skills and experience requirements.
AI can potentially generate new jobs by enabling new sectors and business models. For instance, the emergence of AI-powered digital assistants and smart home appliances has opened up new career prospects for hardware engineers, data analysts and software developers. Similar to how autonomous vehicle and drone research has opened up new career prospects for engineers, technicians and logistics specialists.
AI automation and the transformation of existing jobs
Automating tedious and normal chores allows people to concentrate on more difficult and creative tasks, which is one example of how artificial intelligence might create jobs. For instance, AI-powered chatbots can respond to routine customer service questions, freeing up human customer service agents to handle more complicated situations that call for interpersonal connection and problem-solving abilities.
In addition, businesses can engage with clients and partners in new areas thanks to language translation services enabled by artificial intelligence. As a result, there are more opportunities for linguists, software developers and localization experts to create and enhance these systems.
Similarly, AI-powered drones are now being utilized for inspecting infrastructure, and surveying and monitoring crops. As the demand for software developers, data analysts and drone operators increases, new job possibilities will arise in these fields.

Some concerns and the call to action
However, there are fears that AI may result in significant job displacement in some businesses and areas. Automation fueled by AI, for instance, may result in considerable job losses in the industrial, retail and transportation industries, and some administrative and white-collar positions. Automating low-skilled occupations and creating new opportunities for highly trained individuals at the expense of workers with less education and training could also worsen already-existing disparities.
Related: Ethical considerations in AI development and deployment
Policymakers, educators and business leaders must collaborate to address these issues, ensuring people are ready for the evolving nature of work in the AI era. Focusing on education and training will be necessary, especially in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics professions, and other areas where there will likely be a significant need for competent individuals. To facilitate the development and commercialization of new products and services, it will also be necessary to make investments in infrastructure and innovation.
Additionally, authorities need to make sure that society as a whole benefits from AI. New laws and regulations may be required to address the issues of income inequality and job displacement, and ensure employees are protected with access to social safety nets.

Will generative artificial intelligence replace jobs or enhance them? That’s the question Microsoft set out to answer in its Work Trend Index report. For this report, Edelman Data x Intelligence, commissioned by Microsoft, surveyed 31,000 full-time employed or self-employed people in 31 countries and analyzed trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals across organizations, as well as labor trends from the LinkedIn Economic Graph. Data was gathered between February 1, 2023 and March 14, 2023. Survey results indicated that jobs will change but not necessarily be replaced.
The tech giant also announced its own AI-powered product, Microsoft 365 Copilot, will be available in an invitation-only paid preview program with a gradual rollout starting in May. The new version of Copilot includes some expanded capabilities geared toward enterprise, such as collaboration and idea generation in Whiteboard; the image generator DALL-E; and generative AI assistants for Outlook, OneNote and Viva Learning.

How business leaders can prepare for using AI

Employers could support, not lighten, their workforce with AI
The Work Trend Index report found business leaders are more likely to want to use AI to increase employee productivity (31%) rather than to reduce head count (16%) (Figure A). Other popular uses include helping employees with necessary but repetitive or mundane tasks (29%) and increasing employee well-being (26%).
Figure A 
Survey results show workers believe AI would bring value to the workplace in these ways. Image: Microsoft
AI is a digital tool, and like any tool, it will take time for people to learn how to use it optimally. As of May 2023, 70% of employees surveyed said they would use generative AI to lighten, not fully automate, their workloads. Meanwhile, 49% of the people surveyed are worried AI will completely replace their jobs.
Microsoft found 87% of people in creative roles would like to use AI for the creative aspects of their jobs, but there are some caveats here. This percentage includes only people who are “extremely” familiar with AI already. In addition, creative fields were defined as product development, creative/design, or marketing and public relations.

Microsoft seems confident in AI’s ability to relieve pressure at work. However, some of the problems Microsoft wants to relieve with its new products and services come from the proliferation of communication itself. Of the people surveyed, 68% of workers say they don’t have enough uninterrupted focus time. From data pulled from Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft found the average employee spends 57% of their time in meetings, email or chat.
“Inefficient meetings” are the top culprit for disrupting productivity in workers’ day-to-day roles. The next most common productivity breakers include “lacking clear goals,” “having too many meetings” and “feeling uninspired.”
Microsoft’s proposed solution is “AI-powered intelligent meeting recaps, transcripts and recordings” so employees can fit in meetings on their own time and in the formats they prefer.
SEE: Investors love generative AI, while organizations are “scrambling” to figure out how to use it.
How business leaders can prepare for using AI
Microsoft asked workers to look ahead to an imagined 2030 in which AI has proliferated throughout the workforce. When asked what AI-driven workplace changes they would value most, many responded with “producing high-quality work in half the time” (33%), understanding the most valuable ways to spend their time (26%) and energy (25%), and avoiding unnecessary or irrelevant information (23%).
Shaping what the future of work looks like with AI will require careful decision-making and a balance between human and machine strengths. Like any digital transformation, it will be a process of learning which changes are practical and which are not. Microsoft recommends organizations establish guardrails for employees’ interactions with AI, deploy AI where people need the most relief, and delegate carefully to be sure AI is applied to specific disciplines, processes and workflows under specific team leaders.
SEE: Artificial Intelligence Ethics Policy (TechRepublic Premium)
New hiring criteria for businesses using AI
If a business uses AI, relevant AI skills will likely become part of new hiring criteria, Microsoft said – and those skills aren’t all technical. Employers said that, if AI were to “usher in a new era of technological advancements,” employees will need to learn more analytical judgment (30%), flexibility (29%) and emotional intelligence (27%) (Figure B).

“We’re in the next phase of change with the introduction of generative AI, and it’s already starting to reshape the labor market,” said Karin Kimbrough, chief economist at LinkedIn, in the Work Trend Index. “While it’s still early days, this shift will expand opportunities, create new roles, and augment productivity.”

Generative AI is Disruptive, But More Copyright Isn’t the Answer.Progress in artificial intelligence seems to be something that happens, to paraphrase Ernest Hemingway, in two ways: gradually, then suddenly. 



By Nicholas GarciaMay 11, 2023
Progress in artificial intelligence seems to be something that happens, to paraphrase Ernest Hemingway, in two ways: gradually, then suddenly. A slow trickle of developments as well as surprising bursts of astonishing new capabilities have characterized the AI news cycle for as long as it has existed.
The latest burst of sudden developments relates to generative AI, or GAI — machine learning systems that are capable of outputting new material. GAI is a broad and descriptive term about what the system does, not a particular technology or approach to AI system design. GAI is being used to produce writing, conversation, art, music, video, and more. Systems like these have existed for years, developing gradually, but suddenly systems like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney are producing remarkably high-quality content that rivals human work.
We now need to develop policies to ensure that the benefits of these new technologies are broadly and equitably shared, while protecting the existing openness and vitality of the internet and our creative communities.Unlike existing discriminative AI systems (those that analyze, sort, and process data), GAI raises unique concerns, especially about how human work, including the work used in training datasets, is recognized and valued. For photographers, visual artists, and musicians — especially freelance and independent creators who already struggle with economic precarity — the prospect of a flood of AI-generated content that rivals their work represents real economic risk. The people on the front lines of this disruption right now are artists and musicians, but thanks to large language models like ChatGPT, Sydney, and Bard, this wave of change could soon extend to many kinds of knowledge workers — especially if LLMs’ ability to go beyond simple text generation towards acting as independent agents continues to develop.

Concern regarding this disruption has people casting about for solutions to slow, mitigate, or prevent the potential harms of AI systems. One approach that is being considered — and litigated in two high-profile cases (see Andersen v. Stability AI and Getty Images v. Stability AI) — is how to apply the United States’ existing copyright system to limit GAI systems. 
This could be a disastrous mistake. Applying our existing copyright laws to our best understanding of GAI systems leads to the conclusion that while this technology is new, and there may be flaws in design and execution that create instances of copyright infringement, its core elements and essential ideas do not run afoul of copyright law. Most importantly, reinterpreting or expanding copyright specifically to use it as a bludgeon against GAI will instead threaten the openness and accessibility of the internet, throw up barriers to creativity, and primarily benefit the biggest publishers, distributors, and content creators while leaving small and independent creators to struggle with economic precarity and disruption.
Many artists, creators, and consumers have already adopted stances on GAI ranging from skepticism to outrage. It is thus not enough to merely state the above conclusions; they must be backed up with informed and accessible public analysis that breaks down the copyright law, technology, and implications of proposed solutions. 
Let’s start with copyright. Copyright is not a magic spell that can be invoked anytime someone interacts with a creative work; it is actually a bundle of specific, enumerated (and limited) rights. These rights vary slightly based on the nature of the work, but generally include the rights to control the reproduction, distribution, and public display of the work, as well as to authorize derivative works. Copyright only grants the holder the legal ability to defend those specific rights, and is further limited by other legal doctrines like “de minimis” usage (meaning so little of a work was used that there is no infringement) or fair use.
Turning to the technology, it is useful to analyze the copyright issues related to GAI systems in terms of inputs and outputs. The GAI systems have three inputs: the training datasets; the training process that creates the machine learning model; and user inputs including text prompts, uploaded images, or other user-uploaded or linked reference material. From all of those inputs, the GAI system generates an output: text, images, audio, video, and so on.


GAI systems are built on huge datasets. These vast swathes of data are used for training the machine learning models because more data results in more useful, well-rounded models; the more data the system can learn from, the better it gets. Most GAI systems use training datasets assembled through the crawling and scraping of the publicly accessible internet. 
This isn’t a new practice or novel legal issue. Instances of commercial web crawling have been challenged — and consistently found permissible — under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. That’s because commercial web crawling is largely geared toward the collection of data and statistics, not the full copyrighted content of a website, so commercial web scrapers tend to avoid infringing the reproduction right of the copyright holders. In other instances, building large digital datasets of copyrighted material is unavoidable for the functionality of a project. A good example of this is the Google Books project and internet search more broadly. Google Books specifically came under fire from authors, publishers, artists, and photographers over the digitization and display of copyrighted content. The project was ultimately found to be a fair use that promotes copyright law’s very purpose: to expand public knowledge and understanding. 
The datasets on which GAI systems like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion rely are more like Google Books than commercial web crawlers that gather data; GAI systems need writing and art in its complete form to train from. And the comparison to Google Books doesn’t stop there.  Many GAI systems are built using third-party public datasets like Common Crawl and LAION that are distributed under fair use principles and provide a real public good: archiving and making accessible the aggregated content of the internet for academics, researchers, and anyone else that may want it. These are free, non-commercial datasets collected by nonprofit organizations for use by researchers and the public. Web crawling and scraping also underlie the operation of search engines and archiving projects like the Internet Archive’s popular Wayback Machine. 
In other words, the same practices that go into collecting data for GAI training are currently understood to be non-infringing or protected by fair use. Considering how vital these practices are for an open and accessible internet, we should ensure that they stay that way.


As a threshold matter, it is critical to understand that accessing, linking to, or interacting with digital information does not infringe any copyright. Reading a book, looking at a photograph, admiring a painting, or listening to music is not, and never should be, copyright infringement. This is not a “fair use” issue; the ability to use, access, or interact with a creative work is outside a copyright owner’s scope of control. Based on the best explanations of how GAI systems work, training a GAI system is generally analogous to these kinds of uses.
A GAI model does not contain an archive or directory of the works it trains on that the system queries, searches, or references. Rather, during training the system processes the work, deconstructing it using math to learn from it. To vastly oversimplify, this learning takes the form of building and modifying the strength of connections between a model of datapoints, resulting in a collection of mathematical weights that define the model. The work being analyzed is not reproduced or stored in the model; instead, the model uses each work to improve its overall understanding of whatever it is training on (art, photographs, writing, and so on).
In Andersen v. Stability AI,  the class action lawsuit against Midjourney and Stable Diffusion (two of the most widely used GAI art systems), the plaintiffs conceptualize the training process differently. They characterize the training process as a mechanism for storing the training images in a compressed state. Ultimately, this interpretation will be tested in litigation, but the generalization process that training images go through does not result in any conventional kind of storage. 
There are two facts that make this apparent. First, in an ideal model, none of the content used in training can be reproduced by the system with any reliable fidelity. Second, the simple reality of the quantity of information these systems are trained on, compared to the size of the models themselves, should make that obvious. One can download the fully trained Stable Diffusion model weights at the size of 4 GB, while the LAION-2B dataset it is trained on — the smallest version — contains around 80,000 GB of images; no amount of compression would allow for the model to contain all that information. Simply put, the model does not contain its training data within it. 
The best understanding of the technology therefore points to the model (in its own way) really learning from training images and not merely reproducing and storing them in compressed or abstract mathematical form. Of course, this evaluation relies on information about a highly technical, insular, and rapidly developing field of study. It might be the case that the architecture of the existing or future systems is different from what is described here, but either way, the essence of the training process itself does not involve infringement of copyrighted work.


From a copyright liability perspective for GAI systems, user inputs are not a real concern. Naturally, users can misuse tools, even existing ones like image editing software, to infringe copyright or get up to other mischief, but that does not make the tool infringing. And the user inputs themselves, divorced from the outputs they may produce, do not violate any of the bundle of rights that copyright holders can claim. Even if a user were to feed copyrighted content into a GAI system as a prompt or priming material, this is merely use—not reproduction or distribution. In addition, while the outputs of GAI systems are not protected by Section 230, a user’s inputs to a GAI system certainly are.


GAI systems are defined by their outputs. The writing, images, and other content that they produce raise a collection of copyright-related concerns. These concerns can be distilled to a single question: Do the outputs of GAI systems pass the “substantial similarity” test to not qualify as reproductions, and if they do, do they still incorporate enough major copyrightable elements from existing works such that the output could be characterized as an unauthorized derivative work?
Image-generating diffusion models in particular suffer from “overfitting” and “memorization.” When a specific work appears in similar form many times throughout a training dataset, that image’s combination of characteristics can become overly well-connected in the model. The result is sometimes called “memorization” because the model is able to output a fairly good copy of that work if prompted to. This is an example of “overfitting” in training — where a model cleaves too closely to its training data instead of being able to generalize from its training. These overfit outputs, depending on their quality, can and should be considered infringing reproductions. While this may seem fatal, it is ultimately a red herring. Generalization is the ultimate design goal of these systems, and instances of memorization and overfitting — which raise copyright alarm bells — are essentially bugs, not features. After all, finding a copy of something that already exists online is a simple matter of search; the value of a GAI system is that it makes something new.
Relatedly, some might argue that since GAI systems are trained on copyrighted material and lack human agency and creativity, that all of the outputs are derivative works. A derivative work is a new work that is based on an original work, and shares major copyrightable elements with the original, but which has its own copyright protection because of the new elements in the work. But this is where the ability of these systems to genuinely generalize is the critical factor. When the model is training on, for example, a portrait, it is learning general compositional information about portraits, faces, and so forth. So when a user prompts it to produce a specific kind of portrait, it isn’t pulling from any work or works specifically, but from its whole corpus of training, so none of the works in the training data are original works for the purpose of a derivative works analysis. Put another way, in a well-generalized model, the influence of any one work in the training set should be regarded under the de minimis doctrine as insignificant in its overall contribution to the new work.
Another narrative echoing across creative communities is concern about the ability of a GAI system to produce new works in an artist’s style. Generally, copyright law doesn’t protect style, ideas, or concepts. For a work to be an infringing reproduction, there must be substantial similarity between two specific works in terms of expressive content. That means that a work just having a similar vibe, style, characteristics, or subject matter is not infringement. Another angle from which to approach the issue of style is that copyright holders have the right to control derivative works. The copyrightability of work created using GAI is a whole separate issue, so, the only element of the doctrine that is relevant here is whether some works produced using GAI systems pass the “substantial similarity” test to not qualify as reproductions, but still incorporate enough major copyrightable elements from an existing work such that the output could be characterized as an unauthorized derivative work. So, again, it cannot be a matter of similar style, subject matter, or general features — there must be specifically identifiable elements from particular works — and that still doesn’t describe the situation artists are worried about with GAI producing new works in existing styles.
In light of the threat of competition from these machines, and the value we have for art, there may be a temptation to deviate from the established copyright canon and expand the notion of what can be protected, but this is a dangerous idea.
All creative work is the product of a process of copying, transforming, and combining our experiences, inspirations, and influences. Every form of art, culture, and invention is rife with examples of celebrated works that reimagines, riffs on, or downright knocks off existing work. No one can, or should be able to, enforce a copyright on the basis of style, concept, or feeling alone. It is the free exchange of ideas and inspirations, and the ability to reimagine and remix existing work, that allows artists to build on existing ideas and push creative boundaries. Trying to enforce copyright protection on styles or ideas would short-circuit the creative process and stifle artistic development.
Left, a panel from Russ Heath’s All-American Men of War #89 and an AI-generated work in his style… oh wait no, it’s actually Roy Lichtenstein’s “Blam” from 1962. (Photo credit “WHAAM! BLAM! Roy Lichtenstein and the Art of Appropriation” Hussey-Cotton Films, 2023.)
And while some small and independent creators are on the frontlines of the fight against GAI right now, it is important to remember that there are, and always have been, significant inequalities in what work is valued, whose work is respected, and who will have the power and resources to aggressively defend their work. For instance, hip-hop music was initially criticized for its use of sampling from other artists’ work and faced repeated copyright challenges which restricted the right of artists to use samples without paying for licenses. Anti-sampling cases resulting in mandatory licensing transformed a counter-cultural, democratized, method of making art into yet another tool that only established artists and record labels could leverage. Today, underground hip-hop artists using uncleared samples and mashup artists still find themselves locked out of key revenue streams like streaming platforms because of these restrictive copyright rules. 
There are obvious parallels between sampling and artists using GAI tools today, but even artists working traditionally ought to consider how existing industry power dynamics would play out if there were vastly expanded “stylistic” copyright rules. Record labels, music studios, and established artists would have the resources and power to go after any creator that encroached on their “style,” potentially locking up whole genres and aesthetics behind licensing structures. Reducing every shred of human originality to copyrightable units that must be bought and sold is a far greater threat to creativity than new automated tools will ever be.
Expanding Copyright Law Won’t Protect Artists from GAI’s Disruption
Copyright is enshrined in the Constitution with the phrase: “To promote the progress of science and useful arts…” Taking that purpose seriously, it should be clear that copyright and GAI should not be set at odds with one another. Like the internet — another disruptive technology that forced us to grapple with copyright concerns — GAI is rich with possibilities for redrawing the lines of creativity, productivity, and prosperity. 
This is not to say that there aren’t challenges: Overfitted, infringing reproductions of existing works and concerns about how to navigate consent, credit, and compensation for creators are uncannily reminiscent of early concerns about file sharing and web search indexing. Indeed, to some extent, these concerns about the internet have always lingered and are now crossing over and combining with concerns about GAI. But, as the Copyright Office already determined when it recommended against creating special ancillary copyrights for news content, even when there are serious concerns about the future of important human activities, expansions of copyright aren’t necessarily the effective solution — and would necessarily mean limiting fair use and free expression. 
This impulse to expand or redefine copyright law to allow others to control the ability to use, access, interact, and learn from creative works cannot be the solution to these fears. If we lose the right to freely use and enjoy creative works, we open the way for a new world of extreme commercialization where artists must pay for the privilege to create, and people find the costs and barriers to information and culture rising ever upwards. Generative AI presents the possibility of disruption — let’s embrace this opportunity for change by finding solutions that enhance the ability to create freely, transform traditional economic structures to ensure prosperity, and lower the barriers to enjoying the fruits of our diverse and vibrant shared culture.

Generative A.I.: Friend or Foe for Cybersecurity Job Seekers?

For months, the tech and business worlds have been obsessed with generative artificial intelligence (A.I.), especially the virtual chatbot ChatGPT and its ability to produce human-like text and decent code snippets. This focus has raised questions (some serious, some not) about whether this technology will create or destroy jobs, essentially rendering humans obsolete.

The potential growth and possibly disruptive nature of generative A.I. are still being calculated and hotly contested. A recent article published by Goldman Sachs finds that the technology could raise global gross domestic product (GDP) by 7 percent. A Gartner report that looked at OpenAI’s ChatGPT finds these types of virtual chatbots will have a major impact on marketing and video content by 2025.

During April’s RSA Conference in San Francisco, one of the world’s largest gatherings of cybersecurity professionals, talk of generative A.I. and its role in the cybersecurity field filled the exhibition halls. Experts quickly noted, however, that the ultimate future of the technology is still being written.

In these early stages, significant questions about generative AI remain: What about cybersecurity jobs and careers? Will tech and cybersecurity pros need to significantly upskill to keep pace? Will generative A.I. reduce or eliminate a skills gap that finds over 700,000 open security positions in the U.S. alone?

There was consensus among the cybersecurity experts who attended the 2023 RSAC or watched the proceedings online: While generative A.I. has potential, the technology will not eliminate or destroy cybersecurity jobs, especially in the short term. Instead, these virtual chatbots and other applications should be viewed as useful tools for tech and security professionals that can augment cybersecurity work and help in the protection of data and networks.

“It’s unlikely that A.I. will completely take over cybersecurity functions, as human operators bring intuition and ethical decision-making to the task, skills which will be difficult if not impossible to fully replace with A.I.,” Dave Gerry, CEO at crowdsourcing security firm Bugcrowd, told Dice.

“That said, A.I. will continue to play an increasingly important role in cybersecurity as it becomes more advanced, and a human-machine combination will be necessary to effectively defend against evolving threats,” Gerry added. “While A.I. won’t replace human creativity and resiliency, it does hold the potential to fill some of the current talent gaps we see in the industry by automating tasks that will allow human defenders to focus on higher priority concerns.”

Learning to Live with Generative A.I.

Although generative A.I. in its current incarnation is not ready to eliminate positions and upend careers, tech and cybersecurity professionals must learn to live with the technology, especially as companies incorporate more of these applications into their daily workflows. 

At RSAC, companies such as Google announced that they are building generative A.I. and large language models (LLMs) technology into their security and cloud computing products, meaning tech pros must learn how to make these work and incorporate the tech into their security plans.

“Artificial intelligence in one form or another has been part of the cybersecurity landscape for years, with ‘A.I.’ and ‘machine learning’ being buzzwords that got a lot of attention but often had less impact than the marketing hype would imply. Now though, advances in machine learning, deep learning and the introduction of large language models, have made the technology much more functional,” Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at security firm Vulcan Cyber, told Dice.

“We’ll see the impact of these new capabilities in multiple areas,” Parkin added. “Improved A.I. will make it easier for security teams to parse the massive volumes of data they are dealing with, letting them focus more on the highest risks with the resources they have. That is already happening now but will continue to improve.”

As with previous iterations of machine learning, experts note that the biggest current benefit of generative A.I. is helping to automate manual processes, which can then free up tech and security pros for other tasks. Tech pros need to learn these skills now to take advantage of potential benefits.

“We already see A.I. providing tangible benefits in the areas of automating access requests, both in terms of accelerated routing of requests as well as the informed setting of entitlements based on extenuating circumstances,” Piyush Pandey, CEO of security company Pathlock, told Dice. “The same goes for periodic access reviews—A.I. has shown considerable value in recommending role optimization to reduce risks. Acquiring skills that relate to understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning algorithms is crucial, as they form the backbone of A.I. systems.”

Putting A.I. to Work for Security Teams

While generative A.I. apps are in the developmental stage, security experts already see real-world scenarios where the technology can provide assistance. For Georgia Weidman, a security architect at Zimperium, this includes helping with blue- and red-team exercises.

“Models can run against specific targets and identify the higher probability of successful attacks and lateral movements,” Weidman told Dice. “On the blue-team side, what machine learning models do best is sift through tons and tons of information to better discern the usable, actionable data. Both will have the ability to potentially make security practitioners more productive because these models can remove quite a lot of root work from day-to-day execution.”

While useful, Weidman warns that any use of generative A.I. technology as part of the security process requires skilled tech pros who know what it can do… as well as its limits.

“For the foreseeable future, generative A.I. requires a skilled user who can discern the difference between a sentence that reads well from a sentence that is presenting correct information,” Weidman added. “As some security firms are already using ChatGPT to assist with writing penetration testing reports, there are inevitably privacy concerns involved, especially around feeding a customer’s private data into a public chat API.”

Security leaders also see the promise and limitations of generative A.I. in its current form. “When we talk to our customers, CISOs representing several industries, they collectively agree that A.I. tools help their teams work more efficiently but will not replace security professionals,” Patrick Harr, CEO at SlashNext, told Dice. “Generative AI tools will enable security organizations to improve security, automate manual, time-consuming tasks, and give them the time to focus on the security and availability of data in their organization.”

Calculating Adversaries’ Skills

For several security observers, developing skills to make generative A.I. work is only one part of the process. Another concern is how malicious actors are using this technology and how these new threats will require tech and security pros to rethink their ability to react.

Already, tools such as ChatGPT are being used to write malicious code and phishing emails. In addition, future developments may require security professionals to prevent A.I. from escaping a data center or accessing specific types of information—shifting how the industry defines an adversary, said Davis McCarthy, principal security researcher at Valtix, which is part of Cisco.

“A.I. will scale threat actor resources, reduce their time-to-compromise, shorten malware development cycles and lower the bar for affiliate cybercriminals,” McCarthy told Dice. “Because the output from an A.I. system is benign until the prompt engineer makes it actionable, the true change to the threat landscape is in how efficient the skilled hackers will become, and how effective the unskilled hackers will be.”

This is another area where some experts see generative A.I. falling short: the business realm that requires security teams to assess risk. That risk can affect an organization; it can come from a malicious incident, a business or regulatory decision or an unforeseen issue, which will then require a more creative, human response.

“As we’ve seen throughout the course of history, and despite concerns to the contrary, whenever there’s a new advancement in technology, more jobs are created than replaced,” Timothy Morris, chief security advisor at Tanium, told Dice.

“The bottom line is that while A.I. can consume a great deal of information, it cannot replace human intuition and experience and take into account more than what is presented by the data,” Morris added. “The most successful security professionals display a great deal of collaboration and empathy in their interactions with customers and teammates—these displays of emotional intelligence cannot be effectively replicated by A.I.”

Many biopharma companies are rapidly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for a number of applications, from preventative healthcare to drug discovery. But whether the biotechnology industry will suffer similar purges as those in tech is still unknown, said Jeff Morton, a biotechnology patent law attorney and partner at Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves, & Savitch. “The jury’s still out on how AI will impact things,” he told BioSpace. While data analytics may increasingly become more automated, Morton said that ultimately, companies still need to prove drugs or treatments work for patients. This involves complex, creative research, he added, “and I think that will still rely on humans.” “Most people I’m talking to on a day-to-day basis in biotech are senior scientists” and executives who will likely enjoy more job security as AI becomes increasingly integrated into biopharma, Morton said. But people in other roles or students who are looking to get a job in the biotechnology field might have a different perspective, he said. The role of AI in biotechnology is broad and heterogeneous, meaning different sectors might be differently affected, Morton said. AI algorithms could potentially find new targets for existing drugs, speed up drug development, sift through clinical and research data, monitor patients and analyze market trends. While AI in biotech is nothing new, in recent months generative AI has captured media attention, the most notable example being GPT-4, the engine that runs ChatGPT. Generative AI can use existing data to produce original content. GPT-4 has demonstrated an ability to complete a wide variety of tasks and generate new content, including working code and legal briefs.\u202f A Human Touch Raj Indupuri, CEO of eClinical Solutions, told BioSpace that he expects generative AI to change many roles in biotech, but he is skeptical that AI will replace humans in clinical research and drug development. Companies need human actors to validate algorithmic outputs, especially in the life sciences, he said. “You still have to verify the things that AI and ML are predicting,” Indupuri said. “The consequences for getting something wrong are significant.” In other words, because AI makes mistakes and contains bias, it requires validation and thoughtful implementation. Generative AI is particularly difficult to validate, meaning there will need to be human input at multiple steps in the clinical development process for the foreseeable future, Indupuri said. AI algorithms learn from existing data, then either classify or generate new data based on what they know. However, “clinical development is extremely complex, with minimal commonalities,” said Indupuri. This means that an algorithm would be hard-pressed to generalize and generate an accurate output from data from past successful trials, especially for rare diseases, where the datasets are small. Therefore, Indupuri said, companies still need research teams to analyze data and make decisions during each step in the drug development process, from initial drug studies to clinical research. He added that AI can eliminate “inefficiencies” in drug discovery and data analytics. This may result in job losses, he said, but likely “not to the same extent” as in the tech sector. The Silver Lining Indupuri added that AI may also create a number of new roles, or simply change old ones. In addition, some people might report higher job satisfaction, as many manual tasks can be “eliminated or transformed by using AI,” he said. As artificial intelligence use increases, Indupuri and Morton agreed that upskilling—training existing employees to interface with AI and ML technologies—will be necessary to keep up with labor demands in the future. “There’s quite a bit of retraining going on already,” Morton said. Still, both he and Indupuri said they believe that AI will play a large role in the biopharma sphere in years to come. “It seems to me that there is a general consensus that things are going to change, but it’s hard to predict how,” Morton said.', 'articleSection': 'Business, News', 'author': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/natalia-mesa/#person', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/natalia-mesa/'}, 'name': 'Natalia Mesa', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/natalia-mesa'}], 'copyrightYear': '2024', 'datePublished': '2023-05-10T14:12:12.000Z', 'dateModified': '2023-05-10T14:33:31.000Z', 'headline': 'Will Advancements in AI Lead to Job Loss in Biotech?', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#article', 'image': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 350, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/e9d1eb7/2147483647/strip/false/crop/625x350+0+0/resize/625x350!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF6BF77C2-D42D-4AA0-A81E-80026BA4E785.jpg', 'height': 625}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/5def0e7/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF6BF77C2-D42D-4AA0-A81E-80026BA4E785.jpg', 'height': 1200}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#webpage'}, 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#webpage'}}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Website', 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'WebPage', 'potentialAction': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech'}], 'breadcrumb': {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'itemListElement': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/news', 'name': 'News', 'position': 1}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/business', 'name': 'Business', 'position': 2}]}, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#webpage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#primaryimage'}, 'name': 'Will Advancements in AI Lead to Job Loss in Biotech?', 'datePublished': '2023-05-10T14:12:12.000Z', 'dateModified': '2023-05-10T14:33:31.000Z', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'caption': 'Pictured: Close-up of a microscope/Kkolosov/iStock', 'width': 675, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#primaryimage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/5def0e7/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF6BF77C2-D42D-4AA0-A81E-80026BA4E785.jpg', 'height': 1200}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rise of advanced artificial intelligence will upend the white-collar job market and result in a large number of “very unhappy” workers who will be forced out of their professions, according to a co-founder of the Google-owned AI lab DeepMind.
Mustafa Suleyman, an AI pioneer who left Google last year, joined a growing list of experts – including his former boss, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai – who has warned that rapid advancements in the technology could result in significant job losses.
“Unquestionably, many of the tasks in white-collar land will look very different in the next five to 10 years,” Suleyman said during an event at GIC’s Bridge Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, according to the Financial Times.
“There are going to be a serious number of losers [and they] will be very unhappy, very agitated,” he added.

Last month, Goldman Sachs released an analysis stating that AI tools “could drive a 7% (or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.”

Suleyman asserted that the US and other governments will need to consider ways to support workers who lose their gigs due to AI.
He floated the idea of a universal basic income as one way of addressing the problem – a view he shares with billionaire Elon Musk, who suggested last year it would become necessary as AI and robotics changed labor dynamics.
Suleyman said impacted workers will need “material compensation.”

“This is a political and economic measure we have to start talking about in a serious way,” he added.
Since leaving Google, Suleyman has launched his own chatbot initiative called Inflection AI.
Suleyman’s warning came weeks after Pichai told CBS’s “60 Minutes” that society needs to brace for major changes caused by AI in the coming years.

Notable critics include the “Godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton, who quit his job at Google last month so he could speak freely about the technology’s risks.
Aside from potential job losses, Hinton warned AI was likely to be exploited by “bad actors” for various nefarious purposes.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the workplace, creating both opportunities and challenges for employees, and at this stage, leaving you with more questions than answers. Will AI enable you to work smarter or render you redundant? Will it create more jobs or lead to mass unemployment? 






 Whatever the answers to these questions are, you can't ignore that AI is rapidly rising in the workplace. And so, flexibility and adaptability will be key to remaining relevant in this AI-dominated workplace. Here are some valuable insights into surviving and thriving in the AI-dominated workplace. 


 1. Learn What AI Is and How AI-Powered Tools Work 
    

 It helps to start with understanding what AI is, the dangers it poses, and how it can help you. Understanding the basics of AI and how it works will help you know its strengths and limitations, as well as how to use it to thrive in your workplace. 






 In simple terms, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of computer systems to simulate human intelligence and carry out a wide range of tasks. Some of the most common use cases of AI in the workplace include automating hiring processes, optimizing customer service, inventory management, or data collection and analysis, to name a few. 

 Although AI systems have been used in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and sales for quite some time, their use is increasing exponentially due to technological advancements and the release of AI-powered tools like ChatGPT. 

 ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that relies on vast amounts of training data to generate natural-sounding text. This AI chatbot is used for tasks such as content creation, programming, and translation, to name a few. In fact, this tool is so good that people wonder if generative AI will take over their jobs. 








 2. Know the Difference Between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence 
 Having gained a basic understanding of what AI is and how it works, knowing how it compares to human intelligence will help you appreciate their limitations, discover how they can complement each other, and how you can use both to achieve your work goals. 

 Human intelligence can be defined as the capacity to think, learn, and use information to solve problems or adapt to a new environment. Human intelligence relies on cognitive processes like perception, problem-solving, memory, and creativity. It can be limited by factors like the amount of information available or one's ability to recall information, cognitive biases, and limited attention spans. 

 Although humans and artificial intelligence use data to solve problems, AI relies on complex algorithms to process and analyze vast amounts of data at a higher pace without getting tired. AI-powered systems also have limited capabilities, as they rely on the set of instructions and the data fed into their systems to carry out tasks. 





 On the other hand, humans possess the unique ability to use their senses and emotions and apply knowledge and logic in creative ways to solve complex problems. 



 3. Develop Skills AI Can't Replicate 
    

 As good as generative AI tools like ChatGPT are, they have limitations, and AI is still far from replicating the unique skills, insights, and creativity that humans possess. As such, it is vital to invest in future-proofing skills that AI can't replicate to survive and thrive in the AI-dominated workplace. 






 Some of these AI-proof skills include empathy, creativity, problem-solving abilities, adaptability, resilience, communication, and collaboration skills. Investing in these skills will empower you to bring unique insights and solutions. Additionally, as AI solutions continuously improve, you can use your creativity to find innovative ways to use the technologies in your workplace. 



 4. Learn How to Work With AI Tools 
 Although many people believe that artificial intelligence can't replace humans in the workplace, others believe that digitally literate workers who use AI-powered tools may gain a competitive edge over those who don't. That said, you can become an asset in the AI-dominated workplace by learning how to use generative AI tools. 

 So, let's start with how to use OpenAI's ChatGPT, as it's free and also one of the most popular AI-powered tools out there. It's worth mentioning that the output you get from ChatGPT and other generative AI tools largely depends on the massive corpus of data it was trained on and your prompts. That said, learning to write good ChatGPT prompts is one of the best ways to get better responses. 





 There are several prompting techniques you can use to improve your ChatGPT responses, including writing grammatically correct prompts with enough context and details. In addition, you can also assign it a role to get more relevant and tailored answers. 



 5. Build a Robust Professional Network 
    

 Building strong connections with people who share similar interests and goals can be a great way to solidify your career prospects. As AI technologies continuously evolve and become inevitable in the workplace, staying updated on the latest trends, tools, and technologies can help you remain relevant. Building a solid professional network is one of the best ways to achieve this. 






 There are several ways creatives can network professionally, including attending in-person and virtual networking events, joining online forums and communities, attending conferences and meetups, or building a professional network on LinkedIn. Undoubtedly, some of these connections will prove invaluable in helping you thrive in your workplace. 



 6. Become a Lifelong Learner to Keep Up With Upcoming Tech 
 As mentioned above, adaptability and flexibility are vital skills in an AI-dominated workplace. That's because there's a growing consensus that artificial intelligence is moving too fast—so fast that tech innovators like Elon Musk want to pause AI development. This means you will need to swiftly learn new skills to remain competitive in this AI-dominated workplace. 

 One of the best ways to achieve this is by becoming a lifelong learner and continuously upskilling and reskilling yourself. This includes anything from staying on top of AI news to attending conferences and workshops or taking courses to learn about the latest tools. 







 Future-Proof Your Career in the AI-Dominated Workplace 
 The increasing use of artificial intelligence in the workplace is a double-edged sword, as it presents both opportunities and threats. By following these tips and investing in future-proofing skills that AI can't automate, you will be better positioned to survive and thrive in an AI-dominated workplace.

        Artificial intelligence, agriculture technologies, digital platforms and apps, e-commerce, etc. have been projected to cause significant labour market disruption, the World Economic Forum “Future of Jobs Report 2023” has revealed.
The recently released report indicated that the disruption will come with substantial proportions of companies forecasting job displacement in their organisations, offset by job growth elsewhere to result in a net positive.
According to the WEF, generative AI has received particular attention recently, with claims that 19 per cent of the workforce could have over 50 per cent of their tasks automated by AI and job losses making headlines, while others expect the technology to enhance jobs.
WEF explained that as the usage of AI and machine learning drives spurred industry transformation, it would increase the demand for AI and machine learning specialists by 40 per cent or create one million jobs. 






Recent research on generative AI showed it may affect a significant proportion of total worker tasks, adding that it did not distinguish between tasks being augmented and those automated.
The research also revealed that this was most likely to affect higher-wage roles and jobs with greater barriers to entry.
“Only robots, whether humanoid or non-humanoid, are forecast to have a net negative overall impact on employment in our data, with roughly equal cohorts of companies expecting growth, displacement, and neutral impact.        
“Big data analytics, climate change and environmental management technologies, and encryption and cybersecurity are expected to be the biggest drivers of job growth.
“Looking specifically at robots, Future of Jobs Survey data highlights the electronics (83 per cent), energy technology and utilities (72 per cent), and consumer goods (71 per cent) industries as likely top adopters,” the report stated.
Data from the International Federation of Robotics showed that the number of industrial robots per 10,000 workers had continued to increase rapidly over the last five years across countries. According to the federation, industrial robot density has nearly doubled over the last five years, reaching 126 robots per 10,000 workers on average.
The research further showed that regarding robots’ impact on employment, the strongest sectoral picture emerged for the adoption of non-humanoid robots, adding that while 60 per cent of companies operating in information and technology services foresaw job creation in the next five years, 60 per cent of companies operating in the production of consumer goods and the oil and gas industry foresaw job displacement.
WEF added, “The fastest-growing roles relative to their size today are driven by technology, digitalisation, and sustainability. The majority of the fastest-growing roles are technology-related roles. AI and machine learning specialists top the list of fast-growing jobs, followed by sustainability specialists, business intelligence analysts, and information security analysts. Renewable energy engineers, solar energy installation, and system engineers are relatively fast-growing roles, as economies shift towards renewable energy.
“The Fourth Industrial Revolution has accelerated the pace of adoption of technologies and shifted the frontier between humans and machines across sectors and geographies. Technology is altering the way we work, but also changing job content, skills in need, and which jobs are being displaced.
“Understanding how technologies will impact labour markets is crucial for determining whether people will be able to transition from declining occupations to the jobs of tomorrow. As in previous years, big data, cloud computing, and AI feature near the top of this list, with approximately 75 per cent of companies looking to adopt these technologies in the next five years.

Therefore, it seems that the first workers who are in danger of being replaced by artificial intelligence are the workers who today perform these jobs while they learn, gain experience and become more professional - the juniors. The twist in the plot is provided by those same artificial intelligence systems since they are also able to shorten the learning and training time and give the juniors an advantage. ""People are the engine behind a company. The juniors are a tremendous workforce, they come with contemporary knowledge and a lot of energy. They are a growth engine for the company, but they arrive without sufficient knowledge to develop products and it takes them several years to learn the profession and develop,"" says Dr. Rafi Yoeli, a lecturer in artificial intelligence at the School of Continuing Education at the Technion. ""There are AI tools within the organization which are designed to preserve the knowledge of people who have retired or have advanced to management positions, and these systems serve as mentors for the younger people. These systems include 70-80% of the expertise of the person who left. There is a revolution here within the organization that will allow a junior to take on a project and act as if they have years of experience and knowledge.""   According to him, not only will organizations not give up on the juniors because of the introduction of artificial intelligence tools, but they will lead the assimilation of the new technologies. ""Such integration of new AI technologies among the company's employees requires managers to deal with new variables in a space that is not yet familiar to them or their employees,"" says Aviv Hooker, CRO and co-founder of Faddom, a company that develops software that maps hybrid IT infrastructures, focusing on business applications and the impacts of changes in IT architecture. ""Such an integration process requires a strategy that examines how these innovative technological capabilities can be utilized to gain an advantage over the competition. In this environment, it is often possible to harness the juniors. These young employees who are more connected to technology and are also considered a cheaper workforce can examine these tools and determine how to properly integrate them within the organization."" Just last week it was revealed that IBM will freeze the hiring of 7,800 employees, as their tasks can be completed by artificial intelligence. According to CEO Arvind Krishna, hiring will be slowed or frozen mainly in back office departments such as human resources. Krishna also said that 30% of positions that do not require meetings with clients could be replaced within five years. IBM's announcement may be populist and an attempt to ride the AI wave, while the real reason for reducing the workforce is the economic crisis and the crisis in high-tech in particular. The same crisis that led to mass layoffs in small and large companies and also reached Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Google. However, it is nevertheless clear that we are facing far-reaching changes in the employment market.   There is quite a bit of irony in the fact that it was IBM that was a pioneer in the development of AI tools that is announcing that it will replace potentially 7,800 of the company's employees with machines. ""About a decade ago, IBM developed Watson, an artificial intelligence software that allows even inexperienced and young doctors from Africa, who do not have much access to Western medicine, to be able to make a diagnosis like the best doctors in New York. What is new today is that artificial intelligence not only performs an effective search in information databases but creates and thereby helps in assisting the creative skills of employees,"" says Prof. Avigdor Gal from the Faculty of Data and Decision Sciences at the Technion. According to Gal, generative artificial intelligence is entering creative fields and therefore workers in these positions feel threatened. Studies also show that AI can replace and improve inexperienced workers in various fields. ""Artificial intelligence creates a competitive job market of a new type. A market where success does not necessarily depend on experience but on the realization of the ability to utilize the technology,"" says Gal. ""Juniors will be able to successfully compete with those with experience and in fact the overall level of the entire market in terms of creativity and products will rise and we will have a more efficient and advanced labor market."" ""Just as the introduction of the use of computers to schools enabled a transition to teaching more abstract subjects, and just as the industrial revolution enabled a transition to the production of more sophisticated products, so the artificial intelligence that will be created will upgrade the job market and open up more fields to juniors that until now were closed to them due to lack of experience,"" says Yair Snir, Managing Director of Dell Technologies Capital Israel and Europe.   Juniors will remain in companies, but what will change will be their assignments. ""The introduction of the new technology will see the machine do many things that people used to do manually. The goal is to create more productive organizations that manage to generate more value within the existing resources,"" says Snir. ""The tasks of the organization will always be divided between the juniors, the seniors and those in between. The level will rise and it is already happening."" The implementation of the AI systems will lead to internal organizational evolution, says Snir. The integration will start with very simple tasks that someone will have to control. In the same way that there is a training period for a new employee, the machine will also be given time to learn. ""The price of integrating the machines may actually be higher than estimated, but in the end there will be a rearrangement of tasks that are technical and the machine can perform and tasks that it cannot."" Flesh and blood juniors When new employees start working in a company they have to learn, experiment and fill in gaps. Many times, because they are new to the organization, they are uncomfortable asking questions and yet, they need knowledge to move forward and be effective. Now, when juniors have access to artificial intelligence tools - the picture is changing. They don't have to ask their senior employees questions. They can turn to AI tools. ""Instead of a junior asking a colleague or manager, or spending a lot of time researching a problem or question on the Internet, with ChatGPT they can get an answer in seconds. Our juniors in the research team use it for initial assistance in writing code, and in the marketing team they use it to help answer technological questions, in writing content - such as proofreading, improving English, or drafting drafts,"" says Liat Dvir, Chief People Strategy Officer at Ermetic. The AI tools that exist today are already changing the job market. Despite the threat, as of now, the juniors do not seem to be in danger. On the contrary, they are the main beneficiaries of the use of artificial intelligence at work. A new study of workplaces using artificial intelligence tools designed to improve the work of customer service personnel found that the use of AI especially helped the new or inexperienced employees. A study by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that AI tools improve work efficiency especially for new hires. The study examined customer service personnel's use of an AI chatbot and found that employees with two months of experience performed their jobs similarly to employees with six months of experience using the AI. Learning time has shortened. The authors of the study concluded that the artificial intelligence tools help inexperienced employees to communicate with customers like experienced employees. What's more, the study found that juniors with less than half a year of experience became more productive and were less likely to leave their jobs after using the AI tool. For the more experienced workers, the artificial intelligence tools were much less helpful in their work. At Sisense, for example, they implemented an AI plugin into the developers' work environment called CoPilot and reported an improvement of between 30-50% in productivity. According to Eitan Sofer, VP Engineering at Sisense: ""This is especially dramatic for the juniors who fill in knowledge and experience gaps using AI tools. The meaning here is enormous, because the juniors can actually learn faster from the experience of others. If, for example, they write code, they are exposed to agreed sources that 90% of the developers agreed on. These tools are relevant for juniors in all areas - juniors in the product management field at the company recently started using advanced AI tools like ChatGPT for writing characterization documents and marketing content that usually takes a long time to do. The products have proven to be of very high quality and saved very valuable work time. Similar to switching to using Waze versus maps, the danger of using these tools too much is losing the independent ability to develop code in cases where it is required.""    The danger for an organization using an AI tool is a dependence that will eventually cause a loss of control over decision-making. To prevent this situation, explains Snir, the intention is to create a system of checks and balances. Although not for reasons of retaining capabilities or losing control, Samsung announced this week that it will prohibit employees from using generative artificial intelligence tools. The company is concerned about how services such as ChatGPT and Google Bard store user data. In other organizations, the technologies are adopted and the young workers are the ones who lead the trend. ""At the same time as the beginning of my role as the director of Elad's studio, we also started experimenting with AI tools,"" says Netanel Kosovsky, Head of Netcraft at Elad Software Systems. ""They were quite experimental at the time but slowly improved. Those who especially adopted those tools are our younger employees who make up 75% of the team. They are the ones who test them and then they are naturally brought to the older and more experienced team, so their role in adopting the new technologies is very important and they lead us to change and innovation. However, I don't see AI as fundamentally changing the job market. I see it as a trend like many trends I've experienced during my career.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,5211.Ctech-5220.ctech.News,,,,,,1763.0,,,,,,,,2024-07-04T14:56:30.000Z,,,PT5M33S,[],,,,"{'@type': 'InteractionCounter', 'interactionType': {'@type': 'http://schema.org/WatchAction'}, 'userInteractionCount': 29184}","{'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews', 'name': 'CTech'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/category/5220', 'name': 'News'}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Education: Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes artificial intelligence will significantly change education. That’s why more companies and institutions adopt AI into their curriculums. As a result, more schools and online learning platforms want AI professionals.
Marketing: Nowadays, more businesses use AI chatbot marketing. Consequently, they require more employees who can build and maintain these programs. It is also a boon for customer service representatives because these chat apps need human agents for complaint escalation.
Advertising: Artificial intelligence reduces the time needed to create and launch advertising campaigns. For example, modern companies publish online ads that target specific audiences using AI. That is why businesses need more people to create and optimize these ads.
Healthcare: AI promotes the creation of new medical solutions. For example, a Cornell University student developed AI glasses that help people with speech problems. Hospitals also need AI jobs to maintain these systems.
The Future of AI jobs

There will be two types of artificial intelligence jobs that will become more prevalent in the future. First, more companies will hire AI researchers, data scientists, and other specialized roles.
They will help the largest firms create and maintain proprietary AI systems. After all, more companies help smaller ones adopt these technologies.
For example, the Chinese eCommerce company Alibaba announced it would build AI networks for other businesses. It promises to significantly lower development and maintenance costs with its cloud network. Amazon will do the same with the launch of Bedrock.
Second, small businesses would hire less specialized artificial intelligence jobs, like prompt engineering and writing. The free version of ChatGPT and other generative AI already empowers businesses. Also, the paid versions are more accessible to ordinary people.
These technologies are surprisingly easy to use, and you do not need advanced skills to use them properly. For example, prompt engineers mostly rely on English proficiency. More schools will offer AI education so that their countries can prepare for the age of AI. That means you will have more ways to adapt to the shifting job market.
As a result, we will have more opportunities for career growth, thanks to AI. You will perform jobs that were not available years ago. Even better, you can easily adapt to this future of work!

There’s a lot to be excited about it.Artificial intelligence has been around for years, but scarcely has it found itself in conversation as much as it has now. The launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT rocketed generative AI onto the radar of many people who hadn’t been paying much attention – or didn’t feel it was relevant to their lives. This has included workers, who’ve already been touched by the technology, whether they know it or not.The chatbot, which uses machine learning to respond to user prompts, is helping workers write cover letters and resumes, generate ideas and even art in the workplace and more. It’s already making a splash in hiring with recruiters, who are finding they need to adapt to the new technology. And as competing companies rush to launch similar tools, the technology will only get stronger and more sophisticated.Although some workers fear being replaced by AI, experts say the technology may actually have the power to positively impact workers’ daily lives and skill sets, and even improve the overall work economy. BBC Worklife spoke with experts about what to expect from AI now and in the future workplace.Expanding daily ideas and solutionsOne of ChatGPT’s main abilities is that it can function like a personal assistant – given a prompt, it generates text based on natural language processing to give you an accessible, readable response. Along with providing information and answers, it can also aid knowledge workers to analyse and expand their work. “It can help you brainstorm and generate new ideas,” says Carl Benedikt Frey, future of work director at Oxford University. In his own field of academia, for instance, he’s seen it test for counterarguments to a thesis, and write an abstract for research. “You can ask it to generate a tweet to promote your paper,” he adds. “There are tremendous possibilities.” For knowledge workers, this could mean creating an outline for a blog and a social media post to go with it, distil complex topics for a target audience, plan a business-trip itinerary in a new city or predict a project’s cost and timeline.For many users, ChatGPT functions as a sounding board – a tool to bounce ideas off, rather than create them. “I generate ideas all the time, and ask AI to do supplements on it,” says Ethan Mollick, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania, US, who studies AI and innovation. “I use it to help me process information, to summarize stuff for me, very much as a partner.”There’s a lot of potential for workers to step outside of the box with the assistance of generative AI, whether it’s improving their daily workflows, or developing long-term projects and goals.Getty ImagesExperts say AI can broaden our thinking, introducing new approaches and solutions to problems (Credit: Getty Images)Increasing accuracy and correcting biasesAI also has the power to catch some issues people might overlook. This can mean a range of things – for instance, spotting inaccuracies in text, checking code or even circumventing biases and prejudices workers may not even be aware they have.An analyst interpreting a set of data, for instance, might be able to identify a confirmation bias in their work, meaning they look for evidence to support an outcome they already believe exists. AI can interpret data impartially, and provide a more detailed, big picture analysis, explains Anna Salomons, professor at Utrecht University School of Economics, Netherlands.The technology is far from perfect, but can currently lay the foundation for workers to see outcomes and solutions outside their personal experiences, opening up opportunities for impartiality and inclusion across myriad fields and sectors. And experts say the AI will only get better at this. The ability to “more quickly and better diagnose problems”, says Salomons, won’t replace expertise – while AI can identify problems, humans still need to correct them. But generative AI can identify these issues faster and often more accurately than humans alone. Plus, as ChatGPT and other machine learning models are constantly updating and advancing as their datasets become broader, the technology means being able to catch biases, mistakes and errors at the cutting edge. Adding new jobs and careersOne of the primary worries about AI is that it will take workers’ jobs at a staggering rate. Some data confirms that, indeed, this technology will affect a swath of jobs; in March, Goldman Sachs reported that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. Yet experts say not to worry about being displaced quite yet – and that, perhaps, this shift could even create new job opportunities.AI can help knowledge workers create an outline for a blog and a social media post to go with it, distil complex topics for a target audience, plan a business-trip itinerary in a new city or predict a project’s cost and timelineTraditionally, says Mollick, “automation disruptions result in a lot of chaos in the short term, and then more jobs in the long term”. This chimes with 2021 research Salomons co-authored, which showed 60% of jobs done today didn’t exist in 1940. Industrialisation and automation, she says, led to entire new industries from cars to computers, and added new jobs from drivers to web designers in the process.Although we aren’t yet able to know if the trend will continue, emerging data is beginning to show positive signs for new positions and even entire careers. The proliferation of AI is already increasing the demand for jobs including data analysts and scientists who work with the technology to create best practices in the workplace. According to the 2023 World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report, AI and machine learning specialists are the fastest growing job fields. Pushing workers into AI fluency While some workers are diving into the technology wholeheartedly, others may find it scary to begin engaging with AI. Yet generative AI will be in the workplace – and experts say its prevalence will push workers into using the technology, so they don’t fall behind.“What I keep emphasizing to people is to just start using this,” says Mollick. As workers get increasing fluent, he adds, they can find themselves ahead of the curve, and at a distinct advantage in the workplace.Workers resistant to AI could be seen as unwilling or incapable of adapting, says Frey. “I think workers that don't work with AI are going to find their skills [become] obsolete quite rapidly. So, therefore, it's imperative to work with AI to stay employed, stay productive and have up to date skills.”As AI becomes a more core part of the workday, Frey says this push into fluency means workers will be better equipped to utilize it as a supplement to their current skill set. Familiarity with this technology also set them up to grow and develop those skills quickly.Ultimately, AI is growing fast, and its full potential has yet to be realized. But many experts are hopeful there’s a big upside, enabling workers to innovate quickly and evolve their skills. “Ideally we want to use these technologies to create new products, new industries, new lines of work,” says Frey. “I think that is the challenge going forward – to actually use AI to generate new and previously inconceivable things.”How we workFeatures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But can it have a positive impact – or are we in for a darker future?Supported byAbout this contentPhilippa KellyFri 12 May 2023 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 12 May 2023 17.21 EDTShareIn 1965, the political scientist and Nobel laureate Herbert Simon declared: “Machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do.” Today, in what is increasingly referred to as the fourth industrial revolution, the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace is igniting similar concerns.The European parliament’s forthcoming Artificial Intelligence Act is likely to deem the use of AI across education, law enforcement and worker management to be “high risk”. Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “godfather of AI”, recently resigned from his position at Google, citing concerns about the technology’s impact on the job market. And, in early May, striking members of the Writers Guild of America promised executives: “AI will replace you before it replaces us.”Yet, according to Philip Torr, professor of engineering science at the University of Oxford, the fallibility of AI tools – driven not by emotion, but by data and algorithms – means that the presence of humans in the workplace will remain essential.“Industrial revolutions in the past have typically led to more employment, not less,” says Torr. “I think that we’ll see the types of jobs changing, but that’s just a natural progression.”Torr, an award-winning research fellow at the Alan Turing Institute in London, compares the impact of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT to the advent of the word processor: an extremely useful tool that will fundamentally change the way we work.He is generally optimistic that humans can coexist productively alongside such technologies – and he is not alone in this view. Many experts in the field believe that, with the right education and legislation, automation could have a positive impact on the workplace.There are, of course, those who predict a darker future in which workers are appraised by algorithms and replaced by automation. But there is one broad area of consensus: for better or worse, a growing number of industries are likely to be permanently and structurally altered by the march of AI.View image in fullscreenHealthcareUntil now, the use of AI in medicine has centred on MRI scans, X-rays and the identification of tumours, says Torr. Research is also being conducted into dementia diagnosis via smartphone. Apps could track the length of time it takes a user to complete a routine task such as finding a contact, and flag an increase in this time as a possible sign of the syndrome.Each of these applications could save valuable time for doctors and other medical staff. However, Torr says in the future LLMs will have the biggest impact for patients and practitioners.He gives the example of arriving at a hospital, answering a set of questions and then being moved to another room, only to be asked the same set of questions. Instead, he explains, answers could be logged via an AI-driven app, which would then pass each patient’s information to the relevant staff.Torr acknowledges, however, that, despite its efficiency, diagnosis by algorithm – or indeed automated surgery, which he also imagines is a likely development – may not prove popular with patients. “You can imagine making some sort of robotic salesman,” he says. “But people would still want to see the real thing.”Where the technology could be more welcome, however, is among health service central planners. With large, complex organisations to run and targets to meet, they could be helped by AI suggesting plans and schedules to decrease mounting pressures faced by medical services worldwide.View image in fullscreenEducationAI is already used in schools, colleges and universities, albeit in limited ways. However, as automation makes its way further into the classroom, Rose Luckin, professor of learner centred design at University College London Knowledge Lab, says the choices we make now will decide its future impact.“There’s a dystopian version where you hand over far too much to the AI,” she says. “And you end up with an education system that’s much cheaper, where you have a lot of the delivery done by AI systems.”The more well-off students will still have lots of lovely one-to-one human interactions, alongside some very smartly integrated AIIn this future, teachers assisted in marking and lesson planning by LLMs would be left with more much-needed time to focus on other elements of their work. However, in a bid to cut costs, the “teaching” of lessons could also be delegated to machines, robbing teachers and students of human interaction.“Of course, that will be for the less well-off students,” Luckin says. “The more well-off students will still have lots of lovely one-to-one human interactions, alongside some very smartly integrated AI.”Luckin instead advocates a future in which technology eases teachers’ workloads but does not disrupt their pastoral care – or disproportionately affect students in poorer areas. “That human interaction is something to be cherished, not thrown out,” she says.View image in fullscreenCall centresKnown for their high staff turnover, call centres are often stress-filled environments in which staff spend much of their day attempting to calm angry customers. For this reason, explains Peter Mantello, professor of media and cyber-politics at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, the centres will increasingly become a popular home for what is known as emotional AI.Using voice-tone recognition, such tools allow staff and managers to gauge the emotional state of their customers and workers. This means that staff can better assist callers, and managers can take better care of staff. Mantello warns, however, that the technology is also a form of surveillance.“Surveillance is about social control and shaping people’s behaviours,” he says. “And so in the workplace, this idea of being positive, authentic and happy is going to be more and more linked to productivity.”I think we’re going to see emotion play an even more important part in creating or measuring the idea of a good workerMantello’s concerns stem from the possibility that the data AI generates could be misused by those in power, for example by a manager using data showing poor productivity to dismiss a worker they dislike, or making a purely statistical judgment on an individual’s value.The growth of such technology has implications for those working across other sectors, too. From public relations to bartending, presenting a positive demeanour has long been a part of certain roles, but Mantell says: “I think we’re going to see emotion play an even more important part in creating or measuring the idea of a good worker.”View image in fullscreenAgricultureAccording to Robert Sparrow, professor of philosophy at Monash University’s Data Futures Institute in Australia, many areas of agriculture will prove resistant to increased automation. While farmers already benefit from the application of AI in climate forecasting and pests and disease modelling, he says that in order for the technology to cause real disruption, there would need to be significant progress in robotics.“I can get ChatGPT to write better essays than many of my students,” he says. “But if you asked a robot to walk into this room and empty the wastepaper basket or make me a cup of coffee, it simply couldn’t do that.”This lack of dexterity and inability to cope with unpredictable spaces or tasks, combined with the cost of such technology, makes robots unlikely to replace agricultural workers in the near future, he believes.However, Sparrow describes agriculture as a technologically progressive industry. Food often travels across the world to reach consumers, and Sparrow describes logistics as an element of farming in which AI has real potential to increase efficiency – although this would not come without risks for human workers.“All the people currently working to determine which pallets need to go on which truck, to get to which ship, to get to market on time – if they all lost their jobs because of improvements in AI, it’s not at all obvious that they will find jobs elsewhere,” he says.View image in fullscreenMilitarySparrow says military investment in AI is high, and the belief that it will drive the future of warfare is common. However, despite the introduction of semi-autonomous drones, tanks and submarines, the technology is used less than one might imagine.This, however, is likely to change – particularly for those who serve at sea or in the air. “I’m not alone in thinking that, in the future, human beings won’t be able to survive air combat,” he says. “Flying without a pilot can be lighter, faster, more manoeuvrable and also more expendable.”Sparrow also believes that commands could eventually be delivered by AI, rather than by senior officers. Although humans would remain involved in decision-making, the possibility of automation bias – the human tendency to defer to machines – raises concerns.Too hot to handle: can our bodies withstand global heating?Read moreHe gives the example of a battalion sent into heavy enemy fire by an AI general – something that he acknowledges human generals might also need to do. “You know those people are going to be killed,” he says, “but that’s harder to stomach if a machine gave the order.”Autonomous warfare conducted from a distance could also lead to changes in military culture and the way in which working in the sector is perceived. While traits such as courage, mercy and compassion are often attributed to soldiers, Sparrow says that AI-driven fighting would “make it very hard to maintain these illusions”.Changes in public opinion aside, the positives of removing military personnel from the dangers of direct combat are clear. However, Sparrow still holds serious concerns about a future in which humans play a lesser role than technology in warfare, and believes that automated weapons systems could one day be capable of drawing humans into war.He is similarly sceptical about the future of AI across all workplaces. “The idea that these tools will leave the core of the job intact is often a marketing pitch,” he says. “If the technology is genuinely better than a person at the role, why would we employ people?”Explore more on these topicsEmploymentThe future of workWork & careersArtificial intelligence (AI)HealthGlobal healthGlobal educationComputingfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveNancy Pelosi endorses Kamala Harris: ‘I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory’ – livePilot, 26, dies as her plane crashes after skydiving flight over Niagara FallsYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

As AI tools become increasingly popular, people worldwide are concerned that the technology will replace human employees in several job roles.
Along with assembly lines, AI may also start impacting many sales, marketing, law, and healthcare roles.

AI technologies like ChatGPT have immense potential for disruption across industries. Elon Musk, one of the founders of OpenAI, called ChatGPT a form of ‘dangerously strong’ AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also said that he is a little afraid of ChatGPT. Tech leaders globally have raised concerns about authoritarian governments taking undue advantage of AI tools and the potential for a rise in cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.
Microsoft’s round of layoffs in March also included its entire AI ethics and society team, which is critical to adopting guidelines for AI principles for accessibility to the general public while maintaining ethical standards. One can argue that the unrestricted use of AI to replace humans in jobs without suitable alternatives is unethical.
Furthermore, according to a report released by Goldman Sachs this March, AI is projected to replace approximately 300 million full-time jobs conventionally held by humans. The capabilities of generative AI to generate productive content indistinguishable from human work are creating concerns around the world. Let us look at a few jobs most likely to be impacted by the upcoming generative AI revolution.

1. Computer Programmers
While computer programming and coding were long considered future-proof jobs, AI tools like ChatGPT are expected to replace many programming tasks in the near future. So, programmers with only very specific skill sets may be able to retain their positions.
AI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly capable of crunching numbers with high accuracy, allowing for faster coding and reducing the need for many employees. For instance, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that 30% of non-customer-facing roles in the business will be cut due to AI in the next five years. However, skilled programmers and coders will have to adopt AI to their roles to improve productivity and aid sustainability in the job market.
2. Social Media Teams
Today, every business requires optimal use of social media to maintain a good relationship with its customers and the public. Social media teams are essential for planning and executing social content and interaction strategies.
These tasks are expected to be extensively carried out by AI in the future. AI tools like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly capable of generating content required for social media campaigns, including writing attractive slogans and captions for platforms like Instagram. These tools can also generate complete social media plans as per customized requirements. While AI is not expected to replace humans completely, candidates capable of harnessing their creativity could leverage AI solutions and benefit the most from these changes.

3. Web and Graphic Designers
A good website is critical for every organization. Web designers are essential to companies for working on code development extensively. However, these jobs are increasingly facing threats due to artificial intelligence.
Users can now leverage tools like Amazon’s Codewhisperer and GitHub’s Copilot X to write dynamic website code in any programming language with professional results.
Graphic designers who could develop compelling visuals for landing pages were considered AI-proof for a long time due to the need for creativity. However, the availability of AI-based image generators is changing this. Companies now only need a few prompts to generate aesthetically pleasing images, which can be used for various applications. This impacts the jobs of graphic designers. However, the fact that AI generates images from sample data sets is also generating concerns about potential plagiarism.
4. Proofreaders and Translators
Proofreaders have long been a time-intensive but essential resource in content creation. Normally the job requires not just grammar and spelling skills but also a great eye for fact-checking.
AI tools like ChatGPT initially made proofreading easy but are now doing the job without any human interaction. Providing ideal writing samples is enough for AI tools to check and edit all types of content.
Artificial intelligence is also casting its shadow on the jobs of translators. The GPT-4 large language model (LLM) can support content in more than 26 unique languages. These tools can easily and instantly translate and transcribe a piece of content into multiple languages.
5. Healthcare Assistants
Advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence have generated notable opportunities in the healthcare industry. Robotic doctors can conduct significant portions of critical operations without human intervention. Consequently, the role of surgical assistants is expected to be taken over in the foreseeable future.
Such AI-based healthcare assistants can reduce human error in surgeries, keep track of medications, and help in healthcare and pharmaceutical research. While AI is unlikely to replace human healthcare professionals completely, minor roles are at risk.

Education and Reskilling Are Key
The unprecedented changes brought about by artificial intelligence in the job market are certainly expected to displace several job roles. However, like other technologies in the past, a balanced perspective on change can help smoothen the transition.
As industries push to adopt AI solutions, some jobs will be replaced. However, individuals, governments, and organizations must strongly invest in education and reskilling programs to minimize the impact on the workforce and optimally repurpose human resources. With dedicated thought, human qualities of ingenuity, creativity, and adaptability can not only be preserved but also enhanced with AI technology.

  What opportunities does AI present for tax and accounting professionals?








  How can CPAs best prepare for the future of AI in tax and accounting?




The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has already had a tremendous impact in many industries, and the tax and accounting sector is no exception.  As AI technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, it presents CPAs with a range of opportunities to enhance their advisory services through automated processes, real-time insights, and personalized advice.
In this article, we will explore insights discussed in a recent Pulse of the Practice podcast episode with Mo Arbas, Senior Business Advisory Consultant, at Thomson Reuters, and Paul Miller, President/Owner, of Business By Design. The two will cover the current state of AI in tax and accounting, how it can improve advisory services, what opportunities it presents for tax and accounting professionals, and how CPAs can best prepare for the future of AI in tax and accounting. With help from Checkpoint Edge, you’ll be able to take full advantage of emerging AI technologies to provide more efficient services for your clients.
The current state of AI in tax and accounting
The use of AI in the tax and accounting profession is rapidly becoming more popular. This technology offers a range of advantages that CPAs can leverage to provide better services to their clients. Automation of mundane tasks, real-time insights, and personalized advice are just some of AI’s benefits to the industry.
Paul Miller, President and Founder of Business noted “AI can be used as a tool for leverage in the industry, helping to automate repetitive tasks and allowing professionals to focus on higher-value work.”
AI also provides more accurate data analysis and forecasting, allowing firms to stay ahead of changing regulations and market conditions. In addition to reducing errors common in manual processing, it frees up valuable time for other areas of work. Furthermore, AI-driven advisory services equip CPAs with powerful algorithms and predictive analytics which enable them to gain meaningful insights into customer behavior and create strategies tailored to each client’s individual needs.
The implementation of AI in tax and accounting has opened the door for a wealth of opportunities that were not available before. Firms that take advantage of emerging technologies like AI will be well-positioned to offer superior services while remaining competitive in today’s marketplace.
How can AI improve advisory services?
The integration of artificial intelligence into tax and accounting practices is bringing forth a range of opportunities to enhance advisory services. Automation through AI can reduce the burden of mundane tasks and open up more time for personalized advice that meets each client’s unique needs. AI-driven analysis can also identify areas of improvement in the financial process, leading to improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
Real-time insights into customer behavior and preferences enabled by AI technology can create strategies tailored to every customer. This not only provides better customer service with quicker responses but also facilitates fraud detection earlier than manual methods. CPAs are provided with powerful algorithms and predictive analytics which enable them to make decisions based on accurate forecasts rather than relying on assumptions or gut instinct. Additionally, voice recognition technology and chatbots can improve the customer experience while reducing labor costs associated with hiring additional employees.
Both Paul and Mo emphasized the importance of embracing AI technology and using it to enhance the services they provide to clients. They encouraged professionals to stay informed about AI developments and be prepared to adapt their businesses to leverage the benefits of AI technology.
Businesses that employ AI have access to a variety of tools that allow them to remain competitive in their field while offering superior services. To get the most out of these technologies, it is important for professionals to stay on top of developments in the field and invest in training so colleagues understand how best to use these tools effectively.


Free Guide
The Tax and Accounting professional’s guide to everything AI
If your firm hasn’t yet adopted an AI-enabled solution, and you’re unsure of how to do so, you’re in luck. This guide is designed to answer your lingering questions about the state of AI in the tax and accounting world and what it means for your firm.




What opportunities does AI present for tax and accounting professionals?
The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in the tax and accounting profession has presented a range of new opportunities for CPAs. From automating mundane tasks to providing data-driven insights, AI can be used to optimize an accountant’s advisory services. This technology can also be used to better understand client needs and offer tailored advice. AI can also help to reduce errors and increase accuracy when preparing financial statements.
Using AI tools, CPAs are now able to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior which they would not have been able to obtain on their own. With access to real-time data, professionals are more capable of predicting future trends in order to create effective strategies that align with current market conditions. Furthermore, AI tools can help detect anomalies quickly during audit or investigation processes – allowing firms to respond swiftly should any discrepancies arise.
Another advantage AI can bring to your firm is automation. Automation through AI will free up time for other important activities while providing valuable information about customer behavior – enhancing overall productivity within the firm while offering superior services at the same time!
How can CPAs best prepare for the future of AI in tax and accounting?
In addition to staying up to date and investing in training, CPAs should also be aware of the potential risks that come with using AI. Data privacy is a major concern when it comes to AI-based tools and the accuracy of predictions can be an issue as well. It’s wise for CPAs to develop relationships with experts who specialize in implementing new technologies into existing systems, so they can get the most out of any AI solutions they choose to adopt.
As noted by Miller, “I think we’re at a point where you have to start to change because the decision has already been made […], the market has already moved.”
By taking proactive measures such as staying informed on AI advancements, investing in training, and building expert relationships, CPAs can ensure they are ready for the future of tax and accounting. With these steps taken, they will have access to powerful algorithms and predictive analytics which will enable them to maximize their clients’ success while providing superior services tailored specifically for each individual need.

What is AI art?
AI art (artificial intelligence art) is any form of digital art created or enhanced with AI tools. Though commonly associated with visual art -- images and video, for example -- the term AI art also applies to audio compositions, including music.
Since the earliest pictures found on cave walls, human creativity alone has driven art's history. Inspired humans using hand-held tools -- musical instruments or paintbrushes -- generated all manner of art throughout recorded history. AI art shatters that paradigm.
Using machine learning algorithms, computer technology -- trained on a body of art to learn what art is and how to describe it -- applies various techniques, such as a generative adversarial network (GAN), to change or enhance existing human creations or generate entirely new works of art.
AI art challenges the millennia-old requirement of humans as the sole creators of art. Its introduction raises questions about the genesis of creativity and carries ethical and legal concerns. It’s also an opportunity to extend the boundaries of art -- and creativity -- in many ways.

AI art allows anyone to create works or even entire collections of art, but in a small fraction of the time non-AI methods afford. In addition, AI art can create visual or audio compositions that would be difficult to create otherwise. With text-to-image generative AI tools, such as Dall-E or Stable Diffusion, humans no longer need to attempt to draw the image they want; they simply type a text prompt into the tool, which generates the desired imagery.





History of AI-generated art
The earliest iterations of AI art appeared in the late 1960s, with the first notable system appearing in 1973 with the debut of Aaron, developed by Harold Cohen. The Aaron system was an AI assistant that used a symbolic AI approach to help Cohen create black-and-white art drawings.
AI-generated art began its recent ascent in 2014, when GANs -- a foundation of generative AI technologies -- were first discussed. In 2015, Google released DeepDream, which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) as an experimental approach to AI art, further advancing the field.
Ganbreeder was launched in 2018 and rebranded itself as Artbreeder, using GAN models to allow humans to use AI to modify existing images and create new ones. That same year, an artist collective operating under the name of Obvious made headlines by selling a painting called Edmond de Belamy, created using GAN models, at Christie's auction house for the princely sum of $432,500. Those GAN models were trained on a corpus of 15,000 portraits from the 14th to the 19th century that were publicly available on the WikiArt website.
The public debut of text-to-image GAN-based online services for image generation sparked the imagination and interest of users around the world in January 2021. That month, OpenAI launched Dall-E, providing a publicly accessible and usable system that enabled anyone with internet access to create AI art with text prompts, giving the world a look at AI art’s possibilities.



This Dall-E image was generated based on a user's text prompt.





In May 2022, Google announced its Imagen text-to-image technology as another option for AI art. This was followed in August 2022 by Stability AI, which launched Stable Diffusion's services, another GAN-based, publicly accessible option to create AI art with text prompts.
The growth of AI art tools continued in 2023, with large software vendors joining the market. Notably, the Adobe Firefly service was announced in March 2023. This GAN-based approach integrates with Adobe's popular image and video editing tools, including Photoshop and Premier.


What types of AI are used to generate art?
Though AI art uses a variety of models and techniques, the fundamental process remains the same. The first step is machine learning, during which an AI model is trained on a data set to begin to form a knowledge base. Once an understanding of a data set is established, models can begin the next step: creating and generating images. As part of an interface to the models, modern AI art tools often employ some form of natural language processing, or NLP, to understand and interpret the text users input in their request to generate an image.
Different types of AI models used to generate art include the following:

Generative adversarial network. In a GAN, multiple neural networks are used together for deep learning operations to help predict, or generate, the end result the user seeks based on the prompt.
Convolutional neural network. With the CNN approach, the deep learning model identifies objects, which can then be useful for generating new images.
Neural style transfer. An NST is used in conjunction with a CNN as a deep learning technique that enables the transfer of the style of one image to another. For example, a user could use an NST to generate AI art in the style of Van Gogh.
Recurrent neural network. RNNs are utilized for generating sequences of data like music. They use a feedback loop to produce a sequence of outputs based on prior inputs, which enables them to generate new outputs that resemble the inputs on which they were trained.



How are artists using AI?
Again, the primary tools of artists were physical items like brushes, paints, chisels or musical instruments. But the introduction of AI expands the palette of capabilities available to all artists in the following ways:

Art therapy. Art is used for personal enjoyment and relaxation, and therapists have occupational AI art to help patients on a case-by-case basis.
Democratization. AI enables more people than ever before to create and generate their own art, supporting a new generation of would-be artists.
Education. Educators and teachers are using AI art tools to help teach a new generation of artists.
Enhancing existing creations. AI tools and features help to enhance, augment and improve existing creations. For example, AI can be used to reimagine an existing piece of art in a particular artistic style.
Fully AI-generated art. AI tools help artists create entirely new pieces of visual art, videos and music.
Inspiration for new art. AI tools inspire artists with starting points that can lead to new pieces of art.




These images represent the variability in AI art and AI-generated images.







How difficult is it to make AI art?
Making AI art is an increasingly simple task for artists of nearly any skill level.
At the most advanced, complex level, an artist can choose to train an AI model to create art. In this approach, the artist first needs to collect or have access to a data set of art. Once the target data set has been assembled, the next step is to train the model to learn from the assembled data. With the trained data set on an appropriate GAN model, the next step is to generate the art.
It is significantly easier for an artist to use an AI tool that has already been trained on a data set of existing art. It is possible, depending on the tool, to focus additional training on an artist's own set of images to further refine the model. With the pre-trained model and any customization, the artist can then generate images. Images can be generated with text prompts, then refined after they have been generated. Some tools will allow for further generation with supplemental text prompts, while others can provide artists with additional visual design tools to fine-tune a creation. Many of the tools offer new users with free credits to explore the process of AI art.
Among the many AI image generator tools available to generate AI art today are the following:

Adobe Firefly.
Artbreeder.
Dall-E.
Deep Dream Generator.
DreamStudio.
Midjourney.
Playform.
Stable Diffusion.



What ethical concerns are associated with AI-generated art?
As explained above, AI-generated content has many positive aspects, but potential pitfalls to AI art include the following:

Authorship. Artists have long enjoyed the practice of signing their names to works of art. But how does authorship work with AI art? An emerging ethical dilemma concerns who actually created the work: the AI, or the human who instructed the AI with the prompt to create the work?
Bias. Any AI model is only as diverse as the data on which it was trained. There is the probability for bias if the data on which the model was trained lacks diversity and sensitivity toward equity and issues of discrimination.
Copyright. A major concern is intellectual property theft. For example, large GAN-based AI tools for art have sometimes been trained on data sets without obtaining full legal copyright access. Because of these situations, multiple lawsuits have been filed that extend the ethical concern of AI-generated art into the legal domain. Getty Images, for example, filed a lawsuit in January 2023 against Stable Diffusion for alleged infringement on copyrights held by Getty.
Originality. While defining what constitutes ""art"" has long been the subject of debate, one common attribute is that it is -- in some way, shape or form -- original. With AI art there is an ethical question about whether generated works are genuinely original or just derivative.

SAP and Microsoft are developing a generative AI solution to help customers address the talent gap.The solutions aim to produce new methodologies to improve how businesses attract, retain and coach their employees. The tech giants will leverage SAP SuccessFactors solutions with Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot in Viva Learning. SAP and Microsoft will also integrate Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to utilize powerful language models that assess and create natural language.Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO at Microsoft, said:We have an incredible opportunity to deliver next-generation AI that will unlock productivity growth for every individual, organization and industry, including the human resources function. We’re building on our long-standing cloud partnership with SAP and bringing together the power of Microsoft 365 Copilot with SAP SuccessFactors solutions to transform how organizations attract and develop their most important resource – their people.”How SAP Will Streamline Recruitment and Employee LearningMicrosoft and SAP’s collaboration, compounded by SAP’s use of the Azure OpenAI Service API, ensures the vendors work together on strategies for improving recruitment and employee learning processes.For recruitment, SAP will leverage the Azure OpenAI Service API and data from SAP SuccessFactors solutions to generate compelling and targeted job descriptions. Integrating the SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting solution and Microsoft 365 allows business leaders to edit job descriptions using Copilot in Word with additional content and checks to detect bias. The final job descriptions will be published in SAP SuccessFactors to conclude the workflow.SAP will also utilize the Azure OpenAI Service API to create interviewer prompts within Teams with suggested questions based on a candidate’s resume, the job description and similar jobs.For learning, employees can use Copilot in Viva Learning to perform natural language queries to create personalized learning recommendations based on data and learning courses in SAP SuccessFactors solutions that fulfil the employee’s career and development goals.After learning is concluded, the SAP SuccessFactors portfolio will update automatically, providing businesses with an up-to-date assessment of their skill landscapes.Addressing Enterprise’s Talent Gap Concerns



SAP and Microsoft recognize that closing the talent gap demands optimizing recruitment in today’s competitive market and delivering effective development programmes to help employees grow. Several challenges are inherent to this process, including updating requirements regularly —as well as job descriptions and interview questions — and closing the gap between employees’ unique career ambitions and the cross-skilling and upskilling opportunities provided by the business.Microsoft and SAP are collaborating to provide SAP customers with generative AI-powered offerings which attract the most qualified candidates for critical roles and create personalized insights to maintain employee engagement after they’ve been hired.“For years, Microsoft and SAP have worked together to help drive their customers’ transformation journeys forward,” added Christian Klein, CEO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “SAP has long embedded AI into our solutions, and we’re very excited about the opportunities generative AI unfolds for our industry and our customers. Today’s announcement is one example of how we are bringing the power of generative AI to business, building on 50 years of trusted innovation for companies worldwide.”Microsoft’s Holistic AI Projects2023 has seen Microsoft launch a diverse range of AI-powered solutions and partnerships, the most significant of which is arguably Copilot, which Nadella described at the time of Copilot’s announcement in March as “the greatest productivity tool on the planet”, with 20 enterprise customers being granted preview access to the solution.The initial announcement outlined Copilot’s productivity-boosting features for PowerPoint and Excel, and Microsoft has since revealed the AI-powered solution’s integration with SharePoint and Microsoft Viva.Last week, Microsoft expanded the Copilot Early Access Programme to an initial wave of 600 organizations after “overwhelming feedback” (said Jared Spataro, CVP of Modern Work and Business Applications at Microsoft) from those already enjoying preview access.Microsoft also revealed that it was introducing Copilot AI capabilities to its 365 suite last week — including OneNote, Outlook and Whiteboard — meaning Microsoft has implemented its AI across its full 365 suite.Copilot and the SAP generative AI collaboration aren’t Microsoft’s only AI-centric projects.Last month, Microsoft announced that AI-based noise suppression would launch in December. According to the roadmap for the solution, the update will automatically remove any “unwelcome” noise in the background of a user’s meeting.Siemens is also releasing a Teams-integrated app powered by generative AI to enhance productivity and innovation for industrial businesses. The app, Teamcenter for Microsoft Teams, is planned to launch later this year and is a collaboration between Teams’ platform, Siemens software for product lifecycle management (PLM), and, like with the Microsoft and SAP collaboration, Azure OpenAI Service’s language models and other Azure AI capabilities.

First it was wild and incredible works of art, then text documents of every kind, from homilies to academic essays. One of the issues in the current Writers Guild strike is whether studios and networks should be allowed to use programs like ChatGPT to create outlines or full-length scripts, which writers then would simply rewrite or polish.We have labeled the programs that do this work “artificial intelligence.” And on the surface, the reality of that concept has never seemed more persuasive. These programs generate complete and seemingly original works in an instant. They can also communicate with a person in a way that resembles actual conversation.AdvertisementIn a way, ChatGPT and its ilk are the highest form of separating laborers from the fruit of their labor.Tweet thisBut in fact, for the time being anyway, these programs are not sentient but just a very complex form of the kind of predictive text bot you find using Gmail or Google docs. ChatGPT-3, for instance, was trained on and is informed by 500 billion “tokens”—words or phrases culled from books, articles and the internet through which it interprets and responds to the prompts given to it. (You’ll also hear this referred to as “large language model” machine learning.) Where Google docs might suggest the rest of a phrase when you start typing the first word, ChatGPT has so much data at its disposal it can suggest a whole paragraph or essay. And it continues to learn and develop from the data that we enter and responses that they get.Now, you might say, why make a big fuss about what we call this? No one is claiming that ChatGPT is C-3PO or that we are approaching the singularity. Chill out.AdvertisementBut in calling these programs “artificial intelligence” we grant them a claim to authorship that is simply untrue. Each of those tokens used by programs like ChatGPT—the “language” in their “large language model”—represents a tiny, tiny piece of material that someone else created. And those authors are not credited for it, paid for it or asked permission for its use. In a sense, these machine-learning bots are actually the most advanced form of a chop shop: They steal material from creators (that is, they use it without permission), cut that material into parts so small that no one can trace them and then repurpose them to form new products.Maybe that sounds silly. We’re talking about things like breaking a scene from a play into tiny phrases, not Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams or more recently Ed Sheeran using Marvin Gaye tracks without permission. Where does the principle of fair use come into play when creative products can be sliced into such microscopic units? Some might argue that what ChatGPT does is more akin to Sheeran arguing that he’s just taking building blocks and using them in new ways. But I don’t know. “To be or not to be” or “Attention must be paid” certainly seem like someone’s intellectual property.It is important to remember these program algorithms are predictive—that is, they’re meant to think about their tokens in relationship to each other. It makes sense that, having been given a thousand tokens from a great writer like Toni Morrison or Stephen King, bots like this would be able to either reproduce or repurpose those authors’ voices, ways of thinking and turns of phrase.AdvertisementWhat we face in dealing with programs like ChatGPT is the further relentless corrosiveness of late-stage capitalism, in which authorship is of no value. All that matters is content.Tweet thisAnd once again, this has all been done without anyone ever having obtained those writers’ permission to allow their work to help inform the program’s output. A number of such art-based programs are currently facing lawsuits over claims that their databases of billions of copyrighted images, which are then “diffused” to create new images, constitute copyright infringement. (There’s also a case currently before the Supreme Court considering when the use of another artist’s material becomes transformative instead of theft.)In a way, ChatGPT and its ilk are the highest form of separating laborers from the fruit of their labor. We get an answer or piece of art from a predictive text bot and the original articles and ideas from which they were generated are so far removed that even those creators themselves don’t realize they have been stolen from. In fact, they themselves might join those who think that argument is absurd. Which is kind of like admiring somebody’s souped-up hot rod when a tiny part of its hood (or engine design) was stolen from your car.

Even today, it remains hard to convince some that there’s anything wrong with illegally downloading the latest music from Lizzo or a bootleg of “Guardians of the Galaxy 3.” Those same people will insist without irony that they are those artists’ biggest fans.The same is already true with these predictive algorithms. We are so enthralled by what they can do, or the social goods they seem poised to offer, we don’t want to examine where all of this material is actually coming from.

With the programs, research and expertise highlighted below, Purdue is guiding the advancement of artificial intelligence. If you have any questions about Purdue’s work in AI or would like to speak to a Purdue expert, contact Brian Huchel, bhuchel@purdue.edu. 
President Mung Chiang’s 2023 Spring Commencement speech

Taking AI as his theme, President Chiang concluded his address to graduates with these words: “Our best hope for AI is that it advances individual freedom. That it presents more options, not more homogeneity. That the freedom to choose and free will still prevail. Let us preserve the rights that survived other alarming headlines in centuries past. Let our students sharpen the ability to doubt, debate and dissent. Let a university, like Purdue, present the vista of intellectual conflicts and the toil of critical thinking.”  

Purdue launches nation’s first Institute for Physical AI (IPAI)

The Institute for Physical Artificial Intelligence, or IPAI, is a pillar of Purdue Computes, a new initiative consisting of three dimensions that enable the university to lead in a new frontier of technological advancement.
The institute develops AI at the intersection of the virtual and the physical, leveraging strengths in agricultural data, neuromorphic computing, deep-fake detection, smart transportation data and AI-based manufacturing.

You’ve got to have heart: Computer scientist works to help AI comprehend human emotions

Current AI technology understands only content, not context. Researcher Aniket Bera is programming devices to incorporate nonverbal cues and communication, which involve observing and analyzing facial expressions, body language, involuntary and subconscious movements and gestures, eye movements, speech patterns, intonations, and different linguistic and cultural parameters.
This “emotional” AI can be used for mental health programs, navigating human emotions in shared spaces like self-driving cars, and providing rescue services during disasters.
“The idea is to build a future where robots can be partners, can help humans accomplish goals and tasks more safely, more efficiently and more effectively,” Bera said. “In computer science, a lot of time the biggest problems are the humans. What our research does is put the human back into problem solving to build a better world.”

There’s a popsicle taking over the Middle East (try the black lemonade!).The ability of artificial intelligence to do certain tasks, such as writing college essays and generating fake Drake songs, is well-known. Less understood is the technology’s impact on one of the biggest conundrums of modern economics: Why worker output isn’t higher despite the technological revolution we’re all clearly living through.BloombergBusinessweekAirbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them DirectlyWe Asked Six Top Executives to Tell Us About Their Fitness RoutinesThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get IntoHow CBS Still Churns Out Hit TV Shows That Defy Cable Cutters  Expectations that the internet would spur leaps in productivity have been met, after an initial surge, with mixed results. The contribution to output made by pandemic-driven work from home has also drawn differing reviews. Figuring out why is among the biggest challenges governments face, given that sluggish productivity is blamed for eroding wages, public finances and living standards.  A new paper from the Brookings Institution, Machines of Mind: The Case for an AI-Powered Productivity Boom, argues that large language models such as ChatGPT could be a game changer for productivity, with the biggest gains expected in white-collar work.  The boost would come by making cognitive workers more efficient and by accelerating innovation as these workers make discoveries. In one scenario under the Brookings analysis, a decade of incremental increases in productivity growth would leave the economy 5% larger.“These large language models are really going to boost the productivity of anyone who is engaged in cognitive work or anyone who is engaged in white-collar work,” says Anton Korinek, an expert on AI who is one of the co-authors of the Brookings paper.  Korinek estimates his use of ChatGPT for brainstorming, writing, coding, statistical analysis and writing mathematical models has made him at least 20% more productive. He feeds the platform bullet points and “it does the job of forming well-crafted sentences out of these bullet points,” he says.  The Brookings paper isn’t alone in highlighting potential AI-driven productivity gains. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts in March estimated the combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation and higher productivity for nondisplaced workers would likely result in an output boom that would “substantially” raise global economic growth. The team estimated that generative AI could raise US labor productivity by roughly 1.5 percentage points per year over a decade. Such a jump would be dramatic—productivity expanded only 1.3% on average in the decade through 2022, undermining wage growth.  A separate study found that customer service workers at a Fortune 500 software company who were given access to generative AI tools became 14% more productive on average than those who were not, with the least-skilled workers reaping the most benefit. That study was conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who tested the impact of generative AI tools on productivity at the company over the course of a year.There’s no shortage of pushback when it comes to how AI will affect our economies. Critics say large language models, for example, are error prone. Others argue that any productivity gains will be hard to measure and may not even show up in official government data. And the effect of technology regulation is unknown.Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive who helped create credit-default swaps, warned that if AI grows too quickly or is unregulated and all of the technology’s inherent biases and abuses are unchecked it would be “a devastating loss,” as she said on an episode of Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein.Even OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday that “regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks,” although he believes the technology has the potential to solve humanity’s biggest problems.  Perhaps the most pressing concern is the dislocation to society caused by jobs that are lost as companies switch to AI. Call center workers, for example, would likely be vulnerable. Although many developed economies have labor shortages, soaring inflation has made it hard for wages to keep up with living costs.  Korinek acknowledges the full impact of AI on jobs and incomes will take time to reveal itself. But he’s clear that change is coming.“This is going to be very different from the past 40 years when blue-collar workers lost out and white-collar workers benefited from technology progress,” he says. “This is a reversal where white-collar workers are the ones that are easier to automate now.” —Enda Curran, Bloomberg NewsDepartment of Missed OpportunitiesThere’s a world where Covid-19 could’ve been the catalyst for growth in China’s biotech sector and cemented its place as a world-class startup environment.  From the next issue of Businessweek:President Xi Jinping’s administration in 2015 made biotech one of the 10 key sectors to build up under its Made in China 2025 state industrial strategy. The government went on to streamline regulation and attempted to align standards with those of the Western world, aiming to make its drugmakers more competitive so they could eventually challenge Pfizer Inc., AstraZeneca Plc and other pharma giants.As a result, venture capitalists, private equity funds, investors in initial public offerings and others have poured more than 1.5 trillion yuan ($216 billion) into the Chinese biotech industry since 2015, according to Bi Jingquan, the former head of China’s drug regulator. Chinese companies accounted for 7 of the world’s 10 largest biopharma IPOs from 2018 to 2020, according to McKinsey & Co., and the combined market value for the industry soared from $3 billion in 2016 to more than $380 billion in 2021.But that hasn’t been the experience of scientists on the ground. The country has lagged behind on developing mRNA Covid vaccines—although it’s not for a lack of trying of Chinese experts.What accounts for the gap? The story dives in deep, but the short answer is it takes a long time to build up the expertise necessary to introducing new medical technology with any speed. You need a network of scientists and doctors who can lean on one another for help; you need regulators who understand the space that they are working in, to safeguard human testing. The US is aided by heavy interplay between private companies and academic institutions, something that’s not as common in China. Money has poured into biotech, yes, but so far, that hasn’t been enough.Dark PassagePictures show a family’s journey from Venezuela to New York City, from riding on top of a dangerous cargo train, to taking the subway.

Amazon is working on infusing generative AI features akin to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard AI to its shopping application and website in an effort to provide a more conversational experience, job postings on the company’s career section indicate.
The job postings sought a senior development engineer for machine learning and another engineer to “rearchitect” the search engine or feature inside Amazon’s shopping application.
“We’re working to improve shopping on Amazon using the conversational capabilities of large language models, and are searching for pioneers who are passionate about technology, innovation, and customer experience, and are ready to make a lasting impact on the industry,” one of the job postings read.











 
 
 
Another job posting, according to a Bloomberg report, sought a software engineer who would be part of “a new AI-first initiative to re-architect and reinvent the way we do search through the use of extremely large-scale next-generation deep learning techniques.”

Amazon’s intent to overhaul its search feature inside its application comes at a time when rivals such as Microsoft and Google have been adding their own generative AI engine across their product portfolio.
Microsoft was one of the first companies to showcase the power of generative AI by bringing ChatGPT’s underlying AI engine into Bing Chat, which is now being made more widely available.











 
 
 
Bing Chat is a conversational interface built inside the Microsoft Edge browser that lets users search the internet in a conversational manner.
Last week, Google also said it was adding generative AI features to Google search in the US. These features include summarizing search content and helping users with shopping.
Rivals adding generative AI features and consumer demand may be the two reasons behind Amazon’s push in revamping the search engine of its retail application.











 
 
 
In the US, about 56% of product searches start on Amazon, more than on search engines or Walmart, according to a survey of 1,000 consumers conducted by Jungle Scout, which provides SaaS-based tools for search, market analytics, sales intelligence and inventory management to Amazon resellers.
Technology giants, such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, previously contended with the same rigor during the rise of voice computing in 2016, which saw these giants release their AI assistants, including Cortana, Google Assistant, and Alexa. 
Amazon’s cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), already has a service, dubbed Amazon Bedrock, that provides large language models to other enterprises to build generative AI based use cases as per their individual requirements.

Nasscom said that India currently ranks first in terms of AI skill penetration and AI talent concentration, the AI skill shortage is now being felt across the spectrum.New Delhi: The demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI) skills is gradually increasing in India amid a talent crunch and industry experts said on Thursday, as most organisations in the country enter an exploration mode with generative AI in the ChatGPT era.There are 45,000 Artificial Intelligence (AI) job openings in India, with data scientists and Machine Learning (ML) engineers being among the most sought-after careers, according to a latest report by TeamLease Digital, a tech staffing firm.Although Nasscom said that India currently ranks first in terms of AI skill penetration and AI talent concentration, the AI skill shortage is now being felt across the spectrum.Most Indian firms now focus on content generation with AI, within the corporate arena, though there are several other use-cases of generative AI that are currently in play.A Salesforce study revealed on Thursday that only 4 in 10 Indian employees are using AI in their current role -- which is cited as one of today's most in-demand digital skills.There is a disconnect between the skills companies need and those currently used by the workforce.While nine in 10 Indian workers report using digital skills in their day-to-day work, only one in four workers are currently using AI skills in their day to day roles and just over half (52 per cent) report using skills beyond digital administration.""As more companies adapt AI and automation to streamline their operations and boost efficiencies, the need to train employees to leverage these tools will become even greater,"" said Sanket Atal, Managing Director, Salesforce India Operations and Site Lead, Salesforce India.""Complimenting employees' excitement for the opportunities these tools offer with effective skills development programs should be an important part of every business leader's strategic plan,"" Atal added.By the end of 2023, AI is expected to create 2.3 million jobs, with the highest demand for roles such as AI developers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers.According to the World Economic Forum, AI is predicted to create 97 million jobs by 2025.""HireMee is exploring generative AI to generate questions around specific skill sets and is engaged with a client in validating questions that have been generated using ChatGPT and providing feedback,"" Venkatraman Umakanth, Senior Vice President and Head, HireMee, told IANS.According to Umakanth, generative AI also requires a strong foundation In mathematics, statistics, and programming.""We do see an increase in demand for coding skills, though it is moving from being front-end/backend developers to full-stack developers,"" he said.According to a report by global investment bank Goldman Sachs, AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs and Generative AI, able to create content indistinguishable from human work, is ""a major advancement"".Vee Technologies' CEO Chocko Valliappa said that it is time Indian organisations ramp up their efforts to hire an AI-ready workforce and create world-class innovations.The demand for AI talent has grown 11 per cent in India over the last six months, driven by job demands in sectors like IT, retail, telecom, BFSI and advertising/market research sectors.The Indian job market will witness a 22 per cent churn over the next five years with top emerging roles coming from AI, machine learning, and data segments, according to the report by foundit (previously Monster India &amp; APAC).",,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url':

The search bar at the top of the app and home page in recent years have become the default gateway for millions of shoppers seeking to find a specific product. More than half of US shoppers say they start product searches on Amazon.com, a higher share than Google, according a survey conducted earlier this year by Jungle Scout, a maker of software for sellers on Amazon.Early deployments of generative AI by Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and others have been beset by errors in response to basic questions. But they also show how a beefed-up Microsoft Bing or Google search could offer users a more valuable way to find products.Asking Microsoft Bing — which is powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT – to show the five best electric razors pulled up a roster of five products, including citations to reviews from Men’s Health and GQ, along with links to stores selling the products. The same search on Amazon yields a pair of ads, followed by dozens of products.Read More: Why Microsoft’s Satya Nadella Doesn’t Think Now Is the Time to Stop on AIAmazon’s search experience has been criticized in recent years for the increased share of results devoted to ads and other sponsored content.Generative AI uses vast quantities of data to assemble large language models that can help create text or images following a prompt. Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said on an earnings call last month that the technology “presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience.”Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud-computing unit, in April announced a set of services that rely on advances in generative AI. They have yet to be widely released. Meanwhile, the company is hoping to use similar technology to improve its Alexa voice assistant, Insider reported.

While some worry about the extinction of certain skills, for marketers, AI represents a powerful tool that can help them work more efficiently and effectively. In the spirit of this topic, I took a stab at ChatGPT to create an opening paragraph, and here&rsquo;s what it said.Prompt: Write an opening paragraph for an article about how generative AI will change the marketing landscape.ChatGPT&rsquo;s responseAs marketing evolves, we see a rise in the complexity and sophistication of consumer behavior, which creates new challenges for marketers. To overcome these challenges and meet consumer expectations, businesses must embrace AI technology to improve personalization, segmentation, and content creation. The emergence of generative AI is a game-changer in this regard, offering unparalleled opportunities to enhance customer engagement and drive revenue growth.Impressive, but not entirely perfect. However, it&rsquo;s a very good starting point to work on.ChatGPT is the prodigal son that brought generative AI to fame. It hit 1 million users in just 5 days. To put this achievement into perspective, it took Instagram approximately 75 days to reach the same number of users, while Spotify took even longer, clocking in at roughly 150 days. ChatGPT's unprecedented success is a testament to the growing demand for AI-powered solutions in the tech industry, particularly in the field of natural language processing.The era of generative AI has unlocked a new horizon in marketing. It has revolutionized the way we communicate with our customers. One of the most remarkable ways in which it's transforming marketing is through personalized content creation. By leveraging the power of these sophisticated algorithms, marketers can now tailor content to each individual customer based on their preferences and behavior. This level of personalization has yielded impressive results, with increased customer engagement, conversions, and stronger brand loyalty.Another great breakthrough that generative AI has achieved is the ability to provide unparalleled recommendations. With its ability to analyze vast amounts of data in real time, this technology allows businesses to provide personalized and relevant suggestions to customers, effectively improving the customer experience. This enhanced level of personalization has paved the way for higher conversion rates, repeat purchases, and overall customer loyalty.The Next Frontier for Generative AIGenerative AI has firmly established its presence and influence across industries. With its impressive use cases and ability to automate tasks for marketers, its transformative power cannot be ignored. OpenAI's ChatGPT, built on a powerful LLM model, is poised to drive significant changes in consumer behavior over the coming years. Its potential to revolutionize the way businesses communicate and engage with customers is immense.As generative AI continues to revolutionize the marketing industry, it's essential to note that it's not a replacement for humans but rather an augmentation. Emotionally intelligent content creation, for instance, is a crucial aspect that requires human intervention to understand the intricacies of a brand's personality. Therefore, it still requires a human touch to add context and creativity to its insights. The need for skilled marketing professionals will remain as they re-evaluate their current martech stacks to identify areas where generative AI can be leveraged to enhance their efforts. By embracing AI technology, marketers can streamline their workflows, free up time for more meaningful tasks, and focus on delivering personalized, relevant experiences to customers.The transformation in the marketing landscape brought about by generative AI is paving the way for a new form of agency, the Product-Led Agency, or ""Progency,"" as I would name it. This new breed of agency will fuse creativity and content expertise with data-driven insights and software capabilities, built atop generative AI platforms that can deliver the precise outcomes marketers demand, all on a performance-based model. These updates will enable a revolutionary approach to agency work, unlocking new levels of innovation and collaboration between humans and machines.As generative AI rapidly advances, we're witnessing major players like Microsoft incorporate this technology into their platforms. Microsoft Edge, for instance, has already integrated ChatGPT, enabling users to find answers to their queries instantly with a simple prompt. This innovation is only the beginning, and we can expect other industries to follow suit. The impact of this technology on martech will be revolutionary, allowing brands to leverage an omnichannel platform capable of creating hyper-personalized content for each channel and accurately measuring their success. In conclusion, companies that want to stay ahead of the curve should begin exploring ways to incorporate AI into their operations sooner rather than later.The author is Group CEO, Netcore CloudDisclaimer: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETCIO.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Artificial intelligence is making its way into one of the most fundamental aspects of education: completing assignments. 

Students are turning to AI-powered tools to help them finish their homework faster and more efficiently than ever, but is this a positive development or does it raise concerns about academic integrity? 







Our staff didn’t write that introduction. Instead, it was written by ChatGPT. The fact that it’s convincing is part of the challenge that teachers face as artificial intelligence invades the classroom. 

David Harvey teaches 11th grade English at Tocoi Creek High School in St. Johns County. 

After almost three decades in the classroom, Harvey is confronting a new problem - students using artificial intelligence to complete assignments. 

“In the past, you would suspect the hand of a tutor or perhaps an overbearing parent helping out,” Harvey said, “Now we can tell by the responses that it’s pretty obvious some of them are using ChatGPT.” 

Visiting Professor of English Tricia Booker said there’s no formal policy for dealing with AI. Red flags include perfect grammar, a bland writing style and often a failure to respond to the actual writing prompt. 

“In writing classes, I think it’s particularly important for you to learn how to communicate,” Booker said. “And so, that’s where I think we’re going to really have to look at informing our students how A-I can be useful but when it is absolutely inappropriate.” 

The unusual quality of artificially generated work can be detected by the school’s plagiarism detection tool called TurnItIn. 

“If you run your papers, all your papers through TurnItIn, it’s an automatic process,” Booker said. “If any of it’s plagiarized, it’ll pick it up, so we were seeing papers that were coming in that had zero percent plagiarism but were absolutely perfect.” 

AI’s influence in the classroom isn’t all bad. Harvey said some non-English speaking students can use it to help with learning sentence structure. 

“Type in a question and have it run its wheels, and it comes back with all these ideas,” Harvey said, “so it’s really great for brainstorming, for getting kids to think about the text in a different way.” 







Expert with the Global AI Ethics Institute Josh Gellers said schools are just scratching the surface of AI, and he thinks it will soon be used to assist students outside of the classroom. 

“Think about understaffed administrative offices like admissions,” Gellers said. “When it’s come time for students to apply to college, you might be able to use a chatbot like ChatGPT or another kind of artificial intelligence to answer questions that you don’t need a human to be there to respond to.” 

While academic integrity is a concern, Gellers said AI can be used in ways that will enrich the experience for both students and faculty. 

“We want to tack our sails to the wind that is artificial intelligence,” Gellers said, “so that we can harness it for good educational purposes. Thinking about how it can make us stronger instructors, thinking about how we can better train our students for careers in the future, careers that aren’t even maybe developed yet.” 

As with students who plagiarize, those who use AI to do their work can face punishments including suspension or expulsion, but Harvey said perhaps the biggest impact on students who use chat g-p-t is the loss of individual expression. 

“We’re teaching skills,” Harvey said. “We’re also teaching critical thinking, and if you just sign it off to ChatGPT, that crucial skill to be able to think for yourself is probably the biggest risk.”

Reskilling people to use AI effectively will be the key to companies being able to use the technology successfully, says Accenture.How would you feel about working as a human alarm clock? It’s a job people used to do before the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century. They would go around the dark, cold streets and tap on people’s windows with long sticks to wake them up for work.The invention of the mechanical alarm clock changed all that, and many people are now asking which 21st-century jobs artificial intelligence (AI) and the Fourth Industrial Revolution could consign to the history books.Professional services company Accenture describes the arrival of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4 as ""a significant turning point and milestone in artificial intelligence ... [because] they've cracked the code on language complexity"".It estimates that 40% of all working hours could be impacted by large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4. ""This is because language tasks account for 62% of the total time employees work,"" it says.However, the good news is that this doesn't mean machines will simply replace humans. Accenture says that 65% of the time we spend on these ""language tasks"" can be ""transformed into more productive activity through augmentation and automation"". AI is expected to change how we spend our time at work.  Image: AccenturePeople will be at the heart of successful AI use The potential for AI to reshape the world of work means companies need to start learning now to avoid being left behind, Accenture says. A big part of this will involve ensuring their staff are developing the new skills that will be required in the age of AI.""Success with generative AI requires an equal attention on people and training as it does on technology,"" Accenture says. ""This means both building talent in technical competencies like AI engineering and enterprise architecture, and training people across the organization to work effectively with AI-infused processes.""DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology? Show moreThe Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2023 report outlined the technologies poised to positively impact society in the next few years, from health technology to AI to sustainable computing.

""There will also be entirely new roles to recruit, including linguistics experts, AI quality controllers, AI editors, and prompt engineers,"" Accenture says. Breaking down roles into 'bundles of tasks' can help firms assess the potential impact of AI. Image: AccentureThe jobs AI could createThe World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2023 says that AI and machine learning specialists, data analysts and scientists, and digital transformation specialists are the most prominent emerging roles.It predicts a 40% jump in the number of AI and machine learning specialists by 2027, a 30-35% rise in demand for roles such as data analysts and scientists or big data specialists, and a 31% increase in demand for information security analysts. This would add a combined 2.6 million jobs.On the flipside, some jobs are seen as likely to decline quickly because of AI. These are mostly clerical or secretarial roles, and include bank tellers and data entry clerks. Here are the top 10 jobs the Forum sees growing fastest – and declining fastest – in the next five years:AI and machine learning specialists top the list of fastest growing jobs. Image: World Economic ForumAll this is leading companies to rethink their priorities when it comes to training staff to work with AI and big data. It is the number three priority in company training strategies to 2027, and number one for companies with more than 50,000 employees, the Future of Jobs Report 2023 says. How AI will impact the future of jobsThe Forum's report also finds that workplace tasks are seen as no more automated now than they were three years ago. To some extent, that's because automation had been occurring already, the Forum's Managing Director, Saadia Zahidi, told the Radio Davos podcast.Have you read?The European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act, explained4 ways artificial intelligence could transform manufacturingHere's how artificial intelligence can benefit the retail sector""But when it comes to very human traits like coordinating between people, like helping with decision-making and reasoning or communicating, that's where actually you see an uptick. That's where you see a greater prediction around automation than before. ""It's not surprising because we've all seen what is happening with generative AI and how fast that's getting adopted across various industries.""Artificial intelligence is expected to be adopted by nearly 75% of surveyed companies and to lead to high churn – with 50% of organizations believing it will result in job growth and 25% thinking it will create job losses, the Future of Jobs Report says. How tasks could be split between humans and machines in the coming years.

To ensure that innovation in AI continues in a way that benefits consumers, businesses and the UK economy, the government has asked regulators, including the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), to think about how the innovative development and deployment of AI can be supported against five overarching principles: safety, security and robustness; appropriate transparency and explainability; fairness; accountability and governance; and contestability and redress.</p>

<p>In line with government’s AI white paper and the CMA’s role to support open, competitive markets, the review seeks to understand how foundation models are developing and produce an assessment of the conditions and principles that will best guide the development of foundation models and their use in the future.</p>

<p>This initial review will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>examine how the competitive markets for foundation models and their use could evolve</li>
  <li>explore what opportunities and risks these scenarios could bring for competition and consumer protection</li>
  <li>produce guiding principles to support competition and protect consumers as AI foundation models develop</li>
</ul>

<p>The development of AI touches upon a number of important issues, including safety, security, copyright, privacy, and human rights, as well as the ways markets work. Many of these issues are being considered by government or other regulators, so this initial review will focus on the questions the CMA is best placed to address − what are the likely implications of the development of AI foundation models for competition and consumer protection?</p>

<p>Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AI has burst into the public consciousness over the past few months but has been on our radar for some time. It’s a technology developing at speed and has the potential to transform the way businesses compete as well as drive substantial economic growth.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">It’s crucial that the potential benefits of this transformative technology are readily accessible to UK businesses and consumers while people remain protected from issues like false or misleading information. Our goal is to help this new, rapidly scaling technology develop in ways that ensure open, competitive markets and effective consumer protection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CMA is seeking views and evidence from stakeholders and welcomes submissions by 2 June 2023. The CMA encourages interested parties to respond and be proactive in identifying relevant evidence.</p>

<p>Following evidence gathering and analysis, the CMA will publish a report which sets out its findings in September 2023.</p>

Twenty-five percent of jobs will be negatively impacted over the next five years, according to a new report by the World Economic Forum. In a study, New York City-based investment bank Goldman Sachs predicts that the fast-growing mass adoption of AI will impact 300 million jobs.


We are now seeing the effects of helpful but disruptive technology. Chegg
CHGG
-2%, an educational company, and IBM have both announced that AI will cause a change within their respective organizations. Chegg saw its shares fall in value. IBM will enact hiring freezes and allow attrition without recruiting new personnel, as AI will take over their jobs.

AI Schools Chegg Stock
Shares in online learning company Chegg plunged after it was one of the first organizations to admit that AI affected its business model. Chegg recognized that students were turning to OpenAI’s ChatGPT for help. The AI alternative hurts Chegg’s financial situation as its shares fell nearly 50% on Tuesday morning.

The education company highlights how quickly AI can inexpensively replicate services and products. The Financial Times reported that California-based Chegg saw a decline in revenue and a loss of subscribers. In response to the new reality, The company started CheggMate, a service created with ChatGPT-4 to offer tailored content via AI.

Millions Of Jobs Predicted To Be Impacted
According to a new report by the World Economic Forum released on Monday, a quarter of jobs will be impacted over the next five years. The fast-growing trends of artificial intelligence, digitization, renewable energy and supply chain reshoring will bring about a critical shift in the global labor market. The WEF predicts a ""new era of turbulence,"" as many workers won’t have the requisite skills to keep up with the changes. Those with a technology, data analytics or cybersecurity background will benefit in the new environment.

The WEF study surveyed more than 800 companies that collectively employ 11.3 million workers across 45 countries worldwide. Global employers anticipate creating 69 million new positions by 2027 and eradicating 83 million jobs—a net loss of 14 million roles. Clerical workers will bear the brunt of the fast-moving changes. Around 26 million jobs in administrative positions will be cut due to AI.

Suppose generative AI lives up to its hype. In that case, the workforce in the United States and Europe will be upended, Goldman Sachs reported this week in a sobering and alarming report about AI's ascendance. The investment bank estimates 300 million jobs could be lost or diminished by this fast-growing technology.

IBM’s Hiring Freeze on Roles That AI Can Replace
Armonk, New York-based International Business Machines Corp. CEO Arvind Krishna announced it would pause hiring for roles that can be replaced by artificial intelligence. Functions, including administrative-oriented back office roles and human resources, are targeted. Krishna points out that the tech company has around 26,000 workers that are not client-facing, and about 30%— representing 7,800 people— could be displaced through attrition due to AI over the next five years. IBM boasts 260,000 workers and will keep hiring for software development and customer-facing roles.
The Godfather Of AI Speaks Out
Geoffrey Hinton is considered the “Godfather of AI” due to his long-standing involvement with this technology. After a decade of working at the online search giant, Hinton recently left Google, his current employer, reported the New York Times

His rationale for his departure was over concerns about the adverse impact on people due to the proliferation of AI. He shared his apprehension over misinformation, disruptions of the job market, and other severe existential risks. At 75 years of age, the AI Godfather left the search giant to freely speak about the potential damages AI can wreak without being tied to Google. The AI pioneer said that he regretted his contribution to the space.

Research from Goldman Sachs predicts that artificial intelligence could replace the equivalent of more than 300 million jobs. Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT are now so advanced that they can create content “indistinguishable” from humans, write documents and fulfil repetitive administrative tasks, but this heralds a huge change for how workforces are managed.
What is artificial intelligence for HR?
Artificial intelligence refers to a suite of computer algorithms that can replicate human intelligence processes. In many organisations, its use so far has been restricted to tools such as chatbots, where it can answer simple questions in recruitment processes, or making suggestions to employees if they’re searching for learning content or a key document in their email.
Recent developments in generative AI, however, mean these systems have evolved to the point where they can simulate more complex human tasks such as writing policies, drawing realistic images or answering difficult questions.
What is generative AI?
Generative AI uses machine learning to process a huge amount of textual and visual data from the internet and other sources. One of the most popular generative AI tools is ChatGPT, produced by OpenAI. A host of alternatives have emerged in recent months, often focused on specific tasks such as writing, coding or translation. HR users of ChatGPT can put a request into the engine such as “please write a parental leave policy” and it will generate a document in seconds for a task that could take humans hours or days.
Is artificial intelligence for HR reliable?
Experts argue that while AI HR tools can speed up the generation of policies or documents for volume tasks such as recruitment or a change in terms and conditions, it is still vital to have human oversight.
Maria Kutar, information systems expert at Salford Business School, has argued that HR teams will need to build new skills to manage the use of ChatGPT-style programmes. “Human ethics will still need to be applied to ensure policies serve their purpose and meet business needs, while having integrity and fairness,” she says. “This is particularly important for HR policies and ensuring they don’t discriminate, hold any bias and protect employees, particularly those from underrepresented groups.”

Artificial intelligence for HR
Generative AI will ‘replace 300 million jobs’, says Goldman Sachs 
How useful is ChatGPT-style AI for HR? 

That said, HR teams could use generative AI to check their policies against UK employment law, according to employment law specialist Joanne Gill from Wirehouse Employer Services. While it won’t advise on whether this content is legally binding, it could make suggestions for things to include that were missed in drafting.
One area where generative AI could be particularly useful is in recruitment, where there are numerous administrative tasks that can be simplified and accelerated. Many HR departments already use basic AI to scan CVs or applications for keywords, but this could evolve into more sophisticated analysis of language in video interviews, for example, or making suggestions to recruiters.
What will AI mean for workforce planning?
AdvertisementEnd of ad break in 57 sYou can close Ad in 2 sGoldman Sachs research suggests that as much as 63% of the US workforce could have some aspects of their role automated, and a similar proportion in Europe will be affected. Hands-on roles in areas such as construction will be the least affected.
For HR teams in sectors such as law, a high proportion of tasks could be automated, meaning the function will need to recalibrate its recruitment and retention strategies. Job losses are already occurring in some sectors – UK publisher Reach has recently trialled the use of AI to produce articles for local news sites, and the company announced 200 redundancies at the start of this year.
On the one hand, AI can support HR to optimise the workforce through tasks such as scheduling or working out who has the most relevant skills for a project, according to consulting group McKinsey. On the other hand, it will require HR and learning teams to rethink the skills needed in a hybrid workforce where humans and ‘machines’ interact.
HR analyst Josh Bersin believes HR will need to adapt rapidly to a changing skills landscape, reassessing skills models and redesigning jobs so the human aspect of roles is put to best use.
What will AI mean for the HR function itself?
In 2020, Willis Towers Watson published research suggesting that almost a third of HR roles were at risk of being replaced by robots. It found that 24 out of 27 roles would be impacted by AI in some way.
According to a BBC analysis of research by Oxford University and Deloitte from 2015, the most likely roles in HR to be automated are in HR administration, which have a 90% likelihood of automation. HR managers and directors (32% likelihood) and HR and industrial relations officers (24%) are at far less risk of automation.

The art of the prompt: How to get the best out of generative AI






Written by Jake Siegel

Generative AI models can crank out anything from poetry and prose to images and code at your command. But to coax your desired output from these AI tools, you need to craft the right input — AKA, the prompt.
Prompts are what guide the AI model’s output and influence its tone, style and quality. And good prompts are what elicit brilliant text and stunning images.
“Writing good prompts is the key to unlocking the power and potential of generative AI,” said Jennifer Marsman, principal engineer in Microsoft’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer. 
 






Simple prompts to try on Bing

“I compare it to the early days of search engines — there was an art to choosing the right keywords to get good results and, over time, both the users and the search engine got better at understanding each other,” she said. “This is the same paradigm. Over time, both we as users and the machine learning models will understand each other better.”
As generative AI tools become increasingly popular for work and play, it’s helpful to know how to get the most out of them. Crafting the right prompt is essential, but it can be a give-and-take. Here are a few of Marsman’s top tips and tricks for writing effective prompts.

Write a prompt in Bing Chat

Be specific
You had a stunning image in your mind, but when you told Bing Image Creator to make it real, the result wasn’t at all what you imagined. What gives?
It’s essential to provide as much detail as possible when writing prompts, especially when it comes to images, Marsman said. One key element she likes to provide is style. Tell the model to produce the image as a pencil sketch, for example, or an oil painting, or a cartoon. Point of view and lighting are also attributes to consider. In an image of a baseball stadium, are you looking down from the stands, or on the field, or a bird’s-eye view from above? 
In the “underwater palace” example, Marsman added the phrase “high-quality digital art” to her prompt. Without it, the image wouldn’t have had the same level of detail, she said.

Marsman was pleased with the output. But don’t be afraid to iterate, she added. Flipping around the order of words in the prompt will bring different elements to the foreground. If she had wanted to add mermaids as the focus, for example, she could have listed “mermaids” first.
Use the right model for the right job
If you’re looking for stories, poems, jokes or other imaginative answers, use the “more creative” mode of Bing Chat.
But if you’re looking for just the facts, use the “more precise” mode. This will yield succinct and fact-based responses, Marsman said. “Balanced” mode is the default and works well for most scenarios, she added.
Fact-check
Bing combines powerful AI models with its immense search index for results that are current, cited and conversational. But one downside of generative AI models is that they can occasionally generate plausible-sounding answers that are, in fact, wrong. Here are a few tips to help make sure that reasonable-sounding output is indeed true:

Use the “more precise” conversation style in Bing Chat. This model tends to do better at grounding its responses in the source material from the web. 
Read the references carefully. You can click into the citations and verify that the model correctly interpreted the text.  
Tell the model to summarize specific information rather than asking an open-ended question. For example, instead of asking, “what is the theory of general relativity,” you could frame your prompt as “summarize the key concepts of general relativity in one paragraph.” This can help guide the model to generate more accurate and relevant responses, Marsman said. 

Tailor results through different points of view 
You can get better answers from a chatbot by telling it how you want it to provide answers. For example, if you want a simple explanation of quantum mechanics, you can ask AI-powered Bing to “explain it to me like I’m in 8th grade.” But if you’re savvy with the jargon and nitty-gritty of the topic, you can ask it to act like a college professor or a technical trainer. This way, you can adjust the Bing Chat’s voice and level of understanding to suit your needs.

When you want to change the conversation, use the “New topic” button   
If you want to ask follow-up questions on the same topic in Bing Chat, it’s best to keep the current conversation going. When you want to switch topics, hit the “New topic” button. This gives the model a clean slate — it won’t get confused and merge unrelated topics.
You can specify length 
Do you want a succinct answer or a long tale? You can specify the length — two sentences, for example, or two paragraphs — and guide the model accordingly. And if the chatbot stops before you’re satisfied, you can always prompt it to “go on.”
Don’t forget formatting
AI-powered Bing can present data and information from multiple sources across the web and in a variety of different ways to improve understanding. For example, tables and outlines can help users see information in a structured format. Similarly, diagrams and flow charts can help users visualize complex data, making it easier to understand and interpret.

Leverage your Copilot for writing good code
Remember that the model is trained with many programming languages, so asking simply to accomplish a coding task could result in any number of programming languages being used. Specify the programming language you want. You should also include any other relevant contextual information, such as libraries, APIs or frameworks you are using. You can also mention context from already-written code, like “the user’s input is stored in a variable called x.”
Don’t forget to always run and test your code!
If at first you don’t succeed, prompt again
It’s important to remember that prompting AI to generate responses is not an exact science, and that iteration is key, Marsman said. The beauty of creating prompts is that you can try multiple approaches to see what works best. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different lengths, tones and voices. If the initial results aren’t what you’re looking for, try tweaking your prompt and running it again. With practice, you’ll get better at guiding the model to the results you want.

Become the New McKinsey?As it’s currently imagined, the technology promises to concentrate wealth and disempower workers. Is an alternative possible?By Ted ChiangMay 4, 2023Illustration by Berke YaziciogluSave this storySave this storySave this storySave this storyWhen we talk about artificial intelligence, we rely on metaphor, as we always do when dealing with something new and unfamiliar. Metaphors are, by their nature, imperfect, but we still need to choose them carefully, because bad ones can lead us astray. For example, it’s become very common to compare powerful A.I.s to genies in fairy tales. The metaphor is meant to highlight the difficulty of making powerful entities obey your commands; the computer scientist Stuart Russell has cited the parable of King Midas, who demanded that everything he touched turn into gold, to illustrate the dangers of an A.I. doing what you tell it to do instead of what you want it to do. There are multiple problems with this metaphor, but one of them is that it derives the wrong lessons from the tale to which it refers. The point of the Midas parable is that greed will destroy you, and that the pursuit of wealth will cost you everything that is truly important. If your reading of the parable is that, when you are granted a wish by the gods, you should phrase your wish very, very carefully, then you have missed the point.So, I would like to propose another metaphor for the risks of artificial intelligence. I suggest that we think about A.I. as a management-consulting firm, along the lines of McKinsey & Company. Firms like McKinsey are hired for a wide variety of reasons, and A.I. systems are used for many reasons, too. But the similarities between McKinsey—a consulting firm that works with ninety per cent of the Fortune 100—and A.I. are also clear. Social-media companies use machine learning to keep users glued to their feeds. In a similar way, Purdue Pharma used McKinsey to figure out how to “turbocharge” sales of OxyContin during the opioid epidemic. Just as A.I. promises to offer managers a cheap replacement for human workers, so McKinsey and similar firms helped normalize the practice of mass layoffs as a way of increasing stock prices and executive compensation, contributing to the destruction of the middle class in America.AdChoicesA former McKinsey employee has described the company as “capital’s willing executioners”: if you want something done but don’t want to get your hands dirty, McKinsey will do it for you. That escape from accountability is one of the most valuable services that management consultancies provide. Bosses have certain goals, but don’t want to be blamed for doing what’s necessary to achieve those goals; by hiring consultants, management can say that they were just following independent, expert advice. Even in its current rudimentary form, A.I. has become a way for a company to evade responsibility by saying that it’s just doing what “the algorithm” says, even though it was the company that commissioned the algorithm in the first place.The question we should be asking is: as A.I. becomes more powerful and flexible, is there any way to keep it from being another version of McKinsey? The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you’ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans—one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn’t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has.Note that you cannot simply say that you will build A.I. that only offers pro-social solutions to the problems you ask it to solve. That’s the equivalent of saying that you can defuse the threat of McKinsey by starting a consulting firm that only offers such solutions. The reality is that Fortune 100 companies will hire McKinsey instead of your pro-social firm, because McKinsey’s solutions will increase shareholder value more than your firm’s solutions will. It will always be possible to build A.I. that pursues shareholder value above all else, and most companies will prefer to use that A.I. instead of one constrained by your principles.Is there a way for A.I. to do something other than sharpen the knife blade of capitalism? Just to be clear, when I refer to capitalism, I’m not talking about the exchange of goods or services for prices determined by a market, which is a property of many economic systems. When I refer to capitalism, I’m talking about a specific relationship between capital and labor, in which private individuals who have money are able to profit off the effort of others. So, in the context of this discussion, whenever I criticize capitalism, I’m not criticizing the idea of selling things; I’m criticizing the idea that people who have lots of money get to wield power over people who actually work. And, more specifically, I’m criticizing the ever-growing concentration of wealth among an ever-smaller number of people, which may or may not be an intrinsic property of capitalism but which absolutely characterizes capitalism as it is practiced today.As it is currently deployed, A.I. often amounts to an effort to analyze a task that human beings perform and figure out a way to replace the human being. Coincidentally, this is exactly the type of problem that management wants solved. As a result, A.I. assists capital at the expense of labor. There isn’t really anything like a labor-consulting firm that furthers the interests of workers. Is it possible for A.I. to take on that role? Can A.I. do anything to assist workers instead of management?Some might say that it’s not the job of A.I. to oppose capitalism. That may be true, but it’s not the job of A.I. to strengthen capitalism, either. Yet that is what it currently does. If we cannot come up with ways for A.I. to reduce the concentration of wealth, then I’d say it’s hard to argue that A.I. is a neutral technology, let alone a beneficial one.Many people think that A.I. will create more unemployment, and bring up universal basic income, or U.B.I., as a solution to that problem. In general, I like the idea of universal basic income; however, over time, I’ve become skeptical about the way that people who work in A.I. suggest U.B.I. as a response to A.I.-driven unemployment. It would be different if we already had universal basic income, but we don’t, so expressing support for it seems like a way for the people developing A.I. to pass the buck to the government. In effect, they are intensifying the problems that capitalism creates with the expectation that, when those problems become bad enough, the government will have no choice but to step in. As a strategy for making the world a better place, this seems dubious.You may remember that, in the run-up to the 2016 election, the actress Susan Sarandon—who was a fervent supporter of Bernie Sanders—said that voting for Donald Trump would be better than voting for Hillary Clinton because it would bring about the revolution more quickly. I don’t know how deeply Sarandon had thought this through, but the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek said the same thing, and I’m pretty sure he had given a lot of thought to the matter. He argued that Trump’s election would be such a shock to the system that it would bring about change.Video From The New YorkerSurfing on Kelly Slater’s Machine-Made WaveWhat Žižek advocated for is an example of an idea in political philosophy known as accelerationism. There are a lot of different versions of accelerationism, but the common thread uniting left-wing accelerationists is the notion that the only way to make things better is to make things worse. Accelerationism says that it’s futile to try to oppose or reform capitalism; instead, we have to exacerbate capitalism’s worst tendencies until the entire system breaks down. The only way to move beyond capitalism is to stomp on the gas pedal of neoliberalism until the engine explodes.I suppose this is one way to bring about a better world, but, if it’s the approach that the A.I. industry is adopting, I want to make sure everyone is clear about what they’re working toward. By building A.I. to do jobs previously performed by people, A.I. researchers are increasing the concentration of wealth to such extreme levels that the only way to avoid societal collapse is for the government to step in. Intentionally or not, this is very similar to voting for Trump with the goal of bringing about a better world. And the rise of Trump illustrates the risks of pursuing accelerationism as a strategy: things can get very bad, and stay very bad for a long time, before they get better. In fact, you have no idea of how long it will take for things to get better; all you can be sure of is that there will be significant pain and suffering in the short and medium term.I’m not very convinced by claims that A.I. poses a danger to humanity because it might develop goals of its own and prevent us from turning it off. However, I do think that A.I. is dangerous inasmuch as it increases the power of capitalism. The doomsday scenario is not a manufacturing A.I. transforming the entire planet into paper clips, as one famous thought experiment has imagined. It’s A.I.-supercharged corporations destroying the environment and the working class in their pursuit of shareholder value. Capitalism is the machine that will do whatever it takes to prevent us from turning it off, and the most successful weapon in its arsenal has been its campaign to prevent us from considering any alternatives.People who criticize new technologies are sometimes called Luddites, but it’s helpful to clarify what the Luddites actually wanted. The main thing they were protesting was the fact that their wages were falling at the same time that factory owners’ profits were increasing, along with food prices. They were also protesting unsafe working conditions, the use of child labor, and the sale of shoddy goods that discredited the entire textile industry. The Luddites did not indiscriminately destroy machines; if a machine’s owner paid his workers well, they left it alone. The Luddites were not anti-technology; what they wanted was economic justice. They destroyed machinery as a way to get factory owners’ attention. The fact that the word “Luddite” is now used as an insult, a way of calling someone irrational and ignorant, is a result of a smear campaign by the forces of capital.Whenever anyone accuses anyone else of being a Luddite, it’s worth asking, is the person being accused actually against technology? Or are they in favor of economic justice? And is the person making the accusation actually in favor of improving people’s lives? Or are they just trying to increase the private accumulation of capital?Today, we find ourselves in a situation in which technology has become conflated with capitalism, which has in turn become conflated with the very notion of progress. If you try to criticize capitalism, you are accused of opposing both technology and progress. But what does progress even mean, if it doesn’t include better lives for people who work? What is the point of greater efficiency, if the money being saved isn’t going anywhere except into shareholders’ bank accounts? We should all strive to be Luddites, because we should all be more concerned with economic justice than with increasing the private accumulation of capital. We need to be able to criticize harmful uses of technology—and those include uses that benefit shareholders over workers—without being described as opponents of technology.Imagine an idealized future, a hundred years from now, in which no one is forced to work at any job they dislike, and everyone can spend their time on whatever they find most personally fulfilling. Obviously it’s hard to see how we’d get there from here. But now consider two possible scenarios for the next few decades. In one, management and the forces of capital are even more powerful than they are now. In the other, labor is more powerful than it is now. Which one of these seems more likely to get us closer to that idealized future? And, as it’s currently deployed, which one is A.I. pushing us toward?Of course, there is the argument that new technology improves our standard of living in the long term, which makes up for the unemployment that it creates in the short term. This argument carried weight for much of the post-Industrial Revolution period, but it has lost its force in the past half century. In the United States, per-capita G.D.P. has almost doubled since 1980, while the median household income has lagged far behind. That period covers the information-technology revolution. This means that the economic value created by the personal computer and the Internet has mostly served to increase the wealth of the top one per cent of the top one per cent, instead of raising the standard of living for U.S. citizens as a whole.Of course, we all have the Internet now, and the Internet is amazing. But real-estate prices, college tuition, and health-care costs have all risen faster than inflation. In 1980, it was common to support a family on a single income; now it’s rare. So, how much progress have we really made in the past forty years? Sure, shopping online is fast and easy, and streaming movies at home is cool, but I think a lot of people would willingly trade those conveniences for the ability to own their own homes, send their kids to college without running up lifelong debt, and go to the hospital without falling into bankruptcy. It’s not technology’s fault that the median income hasn’t kept pace with per-capita G.D.P.; it’s mostly the fault of Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman. But some responsibility also falls on the management policies of C.E.O.s like Jack Welch, who ran General Electric between 1981 and 2001, as well as on consulting firms like McKinsey. I’m not blaming the personal computer for the rise in wealth inequality—I’m just saying that the claim that better technology will necessarily improve people’s standard of living is no longer credible.The fact that personal computers didn’t raise the median income is particularly relevant when thinking about the possible benefits of A.I. It’s often suggested that researchers should focus on ways that A.I. can increase individual workers’ productivity rather than replace them; this is referred to as the augmentation path, as opposed to the automation path. That’s a worthy goal, but, by itself, it won’t improve people’s economic fortunes. The productivity software that ran on personal computers was a perfect example of augmentation rather than automation: word-processing programs replaced typewriters rather than typists, and spreadsheet programs replaced paper spreadsheets rather than accountants. But the increased personal productivity brought about by the personal computer wasn’t matched by an increased standard of living.The only way that technology can boost the standard of living is if there are economic policies in place to distribute the benefits of technology appropriately. We haven’t had those policies for the past forty years, and, unless we get them, there is no reason to think that forthcoming advances in A.I. will raise the median income, even if we’re able to devise ways for it to augment individual workers. A.I. will certainly reduce labor costs and increase profits for corporations, but that is entirely different from improving our standard of living.It would be convenient if we could assume that a utopian future is right around the corner and develop technology for use in that future. But the fact that a given technology would be helpful in a utopia does not imply that it’s helpful now. In a utopia where there’s a machine that converts toxic waste into food, generating toxic waste wouldn’t be a problem, but, in the here and now, no one could claim that generating toxic waste is harmless. Accelerationists might argue that generating more toxic waste will motivate the invention of a waste-to-food converter, but how convincing is that? We evaluate the environmental impact of technologies in the context of the mitigations that are currently available, not in the context of hypothetical future mitigations. By the same token, we can’t evaluate A.I. by imagining how helpful it will be in a world with U.B.I.; we have to evaluate it in light of the existing imbalance between capital and labor, and, in that context, A.I. is a threat because of the way it assists capital.A former partner at McKinsey defended the company’s actions by saying, “We don’t do policy. We do execution.” But this is a pretty thin excuse; harmful policy decisions are more likely to be made when consulting firms—or new technologies—offer ways to implement them. The version of A.I. that’s currently being developed makes it easier for companies to lay people off. So is there any way to develop a kind of A.I. that makes it harder?In his book “How to Be an Anticapitalist in the 21st Century,” the sociologist Erik Olin Wright offers a taxonomy of strategies for responding to the harms of capitalism. Two of the strategies he mentions are smashing capitalism and dismantling capitalism, which probably fall outside the scope of this discussion. The ones that are more relevant here are taming capitalism and resisting capitalism. Roughly speaking, taming capitalism means government regulation, and resisting capitalism means grassroots activism and labor unions. Are there ways for A.I. to strengthen those things? Is there a way for A.I. to empower labor unions or worker-owned coöperatives?In 1976, the workers at the Lucas Aerospace Corporation in Birmingham, England, were facing layoffs because of cuts in defense spending. In response, the shop stewards produced a document known as the Lucas Plan, which described a hundred and fifty “socially useful products,” ranging from dialysis machines to wind turbines and hybrid engines for cars, that the workforce could build with its existing skills and equipment rather than being laid off. The management at Lucas Aerospace rejected the proposal, but it remains a notable modern example of workers trying to steer capitalism in a more human direction. Surely something similar must be possible with modern computing technology.Does capitalism have to be as harmful as it currently is? Maybe not. The three decades following the Second World War are sometimes known as the golden age of capitalism. This period was partially the result of better government policies, but the government didn’t create the golden age on its own: corporate culture was different during this era. In General Electric’s annual report from 1953, the company bragged about how much it paid in taxes and how much it was spending on payroll. It explicitly said that “maximizing employment security is a prime company goal.” The founder of Johnson & Johnson said that the company’s responsibility to its employees was higher than its responsibility to its shareholders. Corporations then had a radically different conception of their role in society compared with corporations today.Is there a way to get back to those values? It seems unlikely, but remember that the golden age of capitalism came after the enormous wealth inequality of the Gilded Age. Right now we’re living in a second Gilded Age, in which wealth inequality is about the same as it was back in 1913, so it’s not impossible that we could go from where we are now to a second golden age. Of course, in between the first Gilded Age and the golden age we had the Great Depression and two World Wars. An accelerationist might say that those events were necessary to bring about the golden age, but I think most of us would prefer to skip over those steps. The task before us is to imagine ways for technology to move us toward a golden age without bringing about another Great Depression first.We all live in a capitalist system, so we are all participants in capitalism whether we like it or not. And it’s reasonable to wonder if there’s anything you as an individual can do. If you work as a food scientist at Frito-Lay and your job is to invent new flavors of potato chip, I’m not going to say that you have an ethical obligation to quit because you’re assisting the engine of consumerism. You’re using your training as a food scientist to provide customers with a pleasant experience; that’s a perfectly reasonable way to make a living.But many of the people who work in A.I. regard it as more important than inventing new flavors of potato chip. They say it’s a world-changing technology. If that’s the case, then they have a duty to find ways for A.I. to make the world better without first making it worse. Can A.I. ameliorate the inequities of our world other than by pushing us to the brink of societal collapse? If A.I. is as powerful a tool as its proponents claim, they should be able to find other uses for it besides intensifying the ruthlessness of capital.If there is any lesson that we should take from stories about genies granting wishes, it’s that the desire to get something without effort is the real problem. Think about the story of “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” in which the apprentice casts a spell to make broomsticks carry water but is unable to make them stop. The lesson of that story is not that magic is impossible to control: at the end of the story, the sorcerer comes back and immediately fixes the mess the apprentice made. The lesson is that you can’t get out of doing the hard work. The apprentice wanted to avoid his chores, and looking for a shortcut was what got him into trouble.The tendency to think of A.I. as a magical problem solver is indicative of a desire to avoid the hard work that building a better world requires. That hard work will involve things like addressing wealth inequality and taming capitalism. For technologists, the hardest work of all—the task that they most want to avoid—will be questioning the assumption that more technology is always better, and the belief that they can continue with business as usual and everything will simply work itself out. No one enjoys thinking about their complicity in the injustices of the world, but it is imperative that the people who are building world-shaking technologies engage in this kind of critical self-examination. It’s their willingness to look unflinchingly at their own role in the system that will determine whether A.I. leads to a better world or a worse one. ♦",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/will-ai-become-the-new-mckinsey'}","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6421b50e1aec38f0f544ac9b/3:2/w_1644,h_1096,c_limit/Chiang_AI_Mckinsey.jpg",,,,,"So, I would like to propose another metaphor for the risks of artificial intelligence. I suggest that we think about A.I. as a management-consulting firm, along the lines of McKinsey & Company. Firms like McKinsey are hired for a wide variety of reasons, and A.I. systems are used for many reasons, too. But the similarities between McKinsey—a consulting firm that works with ninety per cent of the Fortune 100—and A.I. are also clear. Social-media companies use machine learning to keep users glued to their feeds. In a similar way, Purdue Pharma used McKinsey to figure out how to “turbocharge” sales of OxyContin during the opioid epidemic. Just as A.I. promises to offer managers a cheap replacement for human workers, so McKinsey and similar firms helped normalize the practice of mass layoffs as a way of increasing stock prices and executive compensation, contributing to the destruction of the middle class in America.
A former McKinsey employee has described the company as “capital’s willing executioners”: if you want something done but don’t want to get your hands dirty, McKinsey will do it for you. That escape from accountability is one of the most valuable services that management consultancies provide. Bosses have certain goals, but don’t want to be blamed for doing what’s necessary to achieve those goals; by hiring consultants, management can say that they were just following independent, expert advice. Even in its current rudimentary form, A.I. has become a way for a company to evade responsibility by saying that it’s just doing what “the algorithm” says, even though it was the company that commissioned the algorithm in the first place.
The question we should be asking is: as A.I. becomes more powerful and flexible, is there any way to keep it from being another version of McKinsey? The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you’ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans—one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn’t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has.
Note that you cannot simply say that you will build A.I. that only offers pro-social solutions to the problems you ask it to solve. That’s the equivalent of saying that you can defuse the threat of McKinsey by starting a consulting firm that only offers such solutions. The reality is that Fortune 100 companies will hire McKinsey instead of your pro-social firm, because McKinsey’s solutions will increase shareholder value more than your firm’s solutions will. It will always be possible to build A.I. that pursues shareholder value above all else, and most companies will prefer to use that A.I. instead of one constrained by your principles.
Is there a way for A.I. to do something other than sharpen the knife blade of capitalism? Just to be clear, when I refer to capitalism, I’m not talking about the exchange of goods or services for prices determined by a market, which is a property of many economic systems. When I refer to capitalism, I’m talking about a specific relationship between capital and labor, in which private individuals who have money are able to profit off the effort of others. So, in the context of this discussion, whenever I criticize capitalism, I’m not criticizing the idea of selling things; I’m criticizing the idea that people who have lots of money get to wield power over people who actually work. And, more specifically, I’m criticizing the ever-growing concentration of wealth among an ever-smaller number of people, which may or may not be an intrinsic property of capitalism but which absolutely characterizes capitalism as it is practiced today.
As it is currently deployed, A.I. often amounts to an effort to analyze a task that human beings perform and figure out a way to replace the human being. Coincidentally, this is exactly the type of problem that management wants solved. As a result, A.I. assists capital at the expense of labor. There isn’t really anything like a labor-consulting firm that furthers the interests of workers. Is it possible for A.I. to take on that role? Can A.I. do anything to assist workers instead of management?
Some might say that it’s not the job of A.I. to oppose capitalism. That may be true, but it’s not the job of A.I. to strengthen capitalism, either. Yet that is what it currently does. If we cannot come up with ways for A.I. to reduce the concentration of wealth, then I’d say it’s hard to argue that A.I. is a neutral technology, let alone a beneficial one.
You may remember that, in the run-up to the 2016 election, the actress Susan Sarandon—who was a fervent supporter of Bernie Sanders—said that voting for Donald Trump would be better than voting for Hillary Clinton because it would bring about the revolution more quickly. I don’t know how deeply Sarandon had thought this through, but the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek said the same thing, and I’m pretty sure he had given a lot of thought to the matter. He argued that Trump’s election would be such a shock to the system that it would bring about change.
What Žižek advocated for is an example of an idea in political philosophy known as accelerationism. There are a lot of different versions of accelerationism, but the common thread uniting left-wing accelerationists is the notion that the only way to make things better is to make things worse. Accelerationism says that it’s futile to try to oppose or reform capitalism; instead, we have to exacerbate capitalism’s worst tendencies until the entire system breaks down. The only way to move beyond capitalism is to stomp on the gas pedal of neoliberalism until the engine explodes.
I suppose this is one way to bring about a better world, but, if it’s the approach that the A.I. industry is adopting, I want to make sure everyone is clear about what they’re working toward. By building A.I. to do jobs previously performed by people, A.I. researchers are increasing the concentration of wealth to such extreme levels that the only way to avoid societal collapse is for the government to step in. Intentionally or not, this is very similar to voting for Trump with the goal of bringing about a better world. And the rise of Trump illustrates the risks of pursuing accelerationism as a strategy: things can get very bad, and stay very bad for a long time, before they get better. In fact, you have no idea of how long it will take for things to get better; all you can be sure of is that there will be significant pain and suffering in the short and medium term.
I’m not very convinced by claims that A.I. poses a danger to humanity because it might develop goals of its own and prevent us from turning it off. However, I do think that A.I. is dangerous inasmuch as it increases the power of capitalism. The doomsday scenario is not a manufacturing A.I. transforming the entire planet into paper clips, as one famous thought experiment has imagined. It’s A.I.-supercharged corporations destroying the environment and the working class in their pursuit of shareholder value.

Imagine an idealized future, a hundred years from now, in which no one is forced to work at any job they dislike, and everyone can spend their time on whatever they find most personally fulfilling. Obviously it’s hard to see how we’d get there from here. But now consider two possible scenarios for the next few decades. In one, management and the forces of capital are even more powerful than they are now. In the other, labor is more powerful than it is now. Which one of these seems more likely to get us closer to that idealized future? And, as it’s currently deployed, which one is A.I. pushing us toward?

Geoffrey Hinton, 75, announced his resignation from Google in a statement to the New York Times, saying he now regretted his work. He told the BBC some of the dangers of AI chatbots were ""quite scary"".""Right now, they're not more intelligent than us, as far as I can tell. But I think they soon may be.""Dr Hinton also accepted that his age had played into his decision to leave the tech giant, telling the BBC: ""I'm 75, so it's time to retire.""Dr Hinton's pioneering research on neural networks and deep learning has paved the way for current AI systems like ChatGPT. In artificial intelligence, neural networks are systems that are similar to the human brain in the way they learn and process information. They enable AIs to learn from experience, as a person would. This is called deep learning.The British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist told the BBC that chatbots could soon overtake the level of information that a human brain holds.""Right now, what we're seeing is things like GPT-4 eclipses a person in the amount of general knowledge it has and it eclipses them by a long way. In terms of reasoning, it's not as good, but it does already do simple reasoning,"" he said.""And given the rate of progress, we expect things to get better quite fast. So we need to worry about that.""Is the world prepared for the coming AI storm?AI could affect 300 million jobs - reportBBC Reel: Why we are still smarter than machinesIn the New York Times article, Dr Hinton referred to ""bad actors"" who would try to use AI for ""bad things"".When asked by the BBC to elaborate on this, he replied: ""This is just a kind of worst-case scenario, kind of a nightmare scenario. ""You can imagine, for example, some bad actor like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin decided to give robots the ability to create their own sub-goals.""The scientist warned that this eventually might ""create sub-goals like 'I need to get more power'"".He added: ""I've come to the conclusion that the kind of intelligence we're developing is very different from the intelligence we have. ""We're biological systems and these are digital systems. And the big difference is that with digital systems, you have many copies of the same set of weights, the same model of the world. ""And all these copies can learn separately but share their knowledge instantly. So it's as if you had 10,000 people and whenever one person learnt something, everybody automatically knew it. And that's how these chatbots can know so much more than any one person.""Matt Clifford, the chairman of the UK's Advanced Research and Invention Agency, speaking in a personal capacity, told the BBC that Dr Hinton's announcement ""underlines the rate at which AI capabilities are accelerating"".""There's an enormous upside from this technology, but it's essential that the world invests heavily and urgently in AI safety and control,"" he said.Dr Hinton joins a growing number of experts who have expressed concerns about AI - both the speed at which it is developing and the direction in which it is going.'We need to take a step back'In March, an open letter - co-signed by dozens of people in the AI field, including the tech billionaire Elon Musk - called for a pause on all developments more advanced than the current version of AI chatbot ChatGPT so robust safety measures could be designed and implemented.Yoshua Bengio, another so-called godfather of AI, who along with Dr Hinton and Yann LeCun won the 2018 Turing Award for their work on deep learning, also signed the letter. Mr Bengio wrote that it was because of the ""unexpected acceleration"" in AI systems that ""we need to take a step back"".But Dr Hinton told the BBC that ""in the shorter term"" he thought AI would deliver many more benefits than risks, ""so I don't think we should stop developing this stuff,"" he added.He also said that international competition would mean that a pause would be difficult. ""Even if everybody in the US stopped developing it, China would just get a big lead,"" he said.Dr Hinton also said he was an expert on the science, not policy, and that it was the responsibility of government to ensure AI was developed ""with a lot of thought into how to stop it going rogue"".'Responsible approach'Dr Hinton stressed that he did not want to criticise Google and that the tech giant had been ""very responsible"".""I actually want to say some good things about Google. And they're more credible if I don't work for Google.""In a statement, Google's chief scientist Jeff Dean said: ""We remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We're continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.""1:46Watch: What is artificial intelligence?It is important to remember that AI chatbots are just one aspect of artificial intelligence, even if they are the most popular right now. AI is behind the algorithms that dictate what video-streaming platforms decide you should watch next. It can be used in recruitment to filter job applications, by insurers to calculate premiums, it can diagnose medical conditions (although human doctors still get the final say).  What we are seeing now though is the rise of AGI - artificial general intelligence - which can be trained to do a number of things within a remit. So for example, ChatGPT can only offer text answers to a query, but the possibilities within that, as we are seeing, are endless.But the pace of AI acceleration has surprised even its creators. It has evolved dramatically since Dr Hinton built a pioneering image analysis neural network in 2012. Even Google boss Sundar Pichai said in a recent interview that even he did not fully understand everything that its AI chatbot, Bard, did. Make no mistake, we are on a speeding train right now, and the concern is that one day it will start building its own tracks.

New York City — Since he started using artificial intelligence, copywriter Guillermo Rubio estimates his productivity has increased by as much as 20%. ""It just makes certain things go a bit faster, like research or brainstorming ideas,"" Rubio told CBS News. ""It's really useful for coming up with those things. Not necessarily writing them, but just generating the ideas when you're stuck.""That innovation also means change. A report released by Goldman Sachs in March found that AI services could automate as many as 300 million full-time jobs worldwide. Many are calling it a new age in the way we work.  






""It's very powerful,"" said Daniel Keum, an assistant professor of management at Columbia Business School. ""AI is able to actually outperform us in learning and adapting. So that we have not seen before in any technologies."" Keum believes the impact of AI will stretch across industries. The issue has already taken center stage in Hollywood, where Writers Guild of America members went on strike this week for the first time in 16 years. Among the demands from the more than 11,000 WGA writers to the studios is a ban on the use of AI to create feature and television scripts. 


""These more very physical and labor-intensive jobs won't be replaced,"" Keum said. ""But I think ... thinking, analytical, creative skills, these things are actually most exposed to AI at the moment."" The spike in the popularity of AI has raised alarm among some in the tech world, who say that there are ethical issues that still need to be fleshed out. In March, a group of about 1,000 tech leaders, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, signed a letter calling for a pause on AI development because they believe it poses ""profound risks to society and humanity.""""ChatGPT came on the scene in November, and it's been like a wildfire ever since,"" said Margaret Lilani, vice president of talent solutions at the job search site Upwork.""You have to be smart about it and really look at it as this opportunity,"" Lilani added. ""It is not an 'or' between ChatGPT and humans. It's an 'and.' And when you combine those two together and really harness that potential of utilizing technology to increase your productivity, and really showcase your creativity, it's going to take you that much further.""   


That is a mindset that Rubio has embraced, saying it's not just about adapting in order to survive.  ""Survive and even thrive, I would say,"" Rubio said.

A lot has been written about the dangers of generative AI in recent months and yet everything I’ve seen boils down to three simple arguments, none of which reflects the biggest risk I see headed our way. Before I get into this hidden danger of generative AI, it will be helpful to summarize the common warnings that have been floating around recently:  

The risk to jobs: Generative AI can now produce human-level work products ranging from artwork and essays to scientific reports. This will greatly impact the job market, but I believe it is a manageable risk as job definitions adapt to the power of AI. It will be painful for a period, but not dissimilar from how previous generations adapted to other work-saving efficiencies.  


Risk of fake content: Generative AI can now create human-quality artifacts at scale, including fake and misleading articles, essays, papers and video. Misinformation is not a new problem, but generative AI will allow it to be mass-produced at levels never before seen. This is a major risk, but manageable. That’s because fake content can be made identifiable by either (a) mandating watermarking technologies that identify AI content upon creation, or (b) by deploying AI-based countermeasures that are trained to identify AI content after the fact. 


Risk of sentient machines: Many researchers worry that AI systems will get scaled up to a level where they develop a “will of their own” and will take actions that conflict with human interests, or even threaten human existence. I believe this is a genuine long-term risk. In fact, I wrote a “picture book for adults” entitled Arrival Mind a few years ago that explores this danger in simple terms. Still, I do not believe that current AI systems will spontaneously become sentient without major structural improvements to the technology. So, while this is a real danger for the industry to focus on, it’s not the most urgent risk that I see before us. 

So, what concerns me most about the rise of generative AI? 
From my perspective, the place where most safety experts go wrong, including policymakers, is that they view generative AI primarily as a tool for creating traditional content at scale. While the technology is quite skilled at cranking out articles, images and videos, the more important issue is that generative AI will unleash an entirely new form of media that is highly personalized, fully interactive and potentially far more manipulative than any form of targeted content we have faced to date.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Welcome to the age of interactive generative media 
The most dangerous feature of generative AI is not that it can crank out fake articles and videos at scale, but that it can produce interactive and adaptive content that is customized for individual users to maximize persuasive impact. In this context, interactive generative media can be defined as targeted promotional material that is created or modified in real time to maximize influence objectives based on personal data about the receiving user.
This will transform “targeted influence campaigns” from buckshot aimed at broad demographic groups to heat-seeking missiles that can zero in on individual persons for optimal effect. And as described below, this new form of media is likely to come in two powerful flavors, “targeted generative advertising”  and “targeted conversational influence.”
Targeted generative advertising is the use of images, videos and other forms of informational content that look and feel like traditional ads but are personalized in real time for individual users. These ads will be created on the fly by generative AI systems based on influence objectives provided by third-party sponsors in combination with personal data accessed for the specific user being targeted. The personal data may include the user’s age, gender and education level, combined with their interests, values, aesthetic sensibilities, purchasing tendencies, political affiliations and cultural biases.  advertisement
In response to the influence objectives and targeting data, the generative AI will customize the layout, feature images and promotional messaging to maximize effectiveness on that user. Everything down to the colors, fonts and punctuation could be personalized along with the age, race and clothing styles of any people shown in the imagery. Will you see video clips of urban scenes or rural scenes? Will it be set in the fall or spring? Will you see images of sports cars or family vans? Every detail could be customized in real time by generative AI to maximize the subtle impact on you personally.
And because tech platforms can track user engagement, the system will learn which tactics work best on you over time, discovering the hair colors and facial expressions that best draw your attention.
If this seems like science fiction, consider this: Both Meta and Google have recently announced plans to use generative AI in the creation of online ads. If these tactics produce more clicks for sponsors, they will become standard practice and an arms race will follow, with all major platforms competing to use generative AI to customize promotional content in the most effective ways possible.    
This brings me to targeted conversational influence, a generative technique in which influence objectives are conveyed through interactive conversation rather than traditional documents or videos.  advertisement
The conversations will occur through chatbots (like ChatGPT and Bard) or through voice-based systems powered by similar large language models (LLMs). Users will encounter these “conversational agents” many times throughout their day, as third-party developers will use APIs to integrate LLMs into their websites, apps and interactive digital assistants.
For example, you might access a website looking for the latest weather forecast, engaging conversationally with an AI agent to request the information. In the process, you could be targeted with conversational influence — subtle messaging woven into the dialog with promotional goals. 
As conversational computing becomes commonplace in our lives, the risk of conversational influence will greatly expand, as paying sponsors could inject messaging into the dialog that we may not even notice.  And like targeted generative ads, the messaging goals requested by sponsors will be used in combination with personal data about the targeted user to optimize impact.
The data could include the user’s age, gender and education level combined with personal interests, hobbies, values, etc., thereby enabling real-time generative dialog that is designed to optimally appeal to that specific person.
Why use conversational influence? 
If you’ve ever worked as a salesperson, you probably know that the best way to persuade a customer is not to hand them a brochure, but to engage them in face-to-face dialog so you can pitch them on the product, hear their reservations and adjust your arguments as needed. It’s a cyclic process of pitching and adjusting that can “talk them into” a purchase.
While this has been a purely human skill in the past, generative AI can now perform these steps, but with greater skill and deeper knowledge to draw upon. 
And while a human salesperson has only one persona, these AI agents will be digital chameleons that can adopt any speaking style, from nerdy or folksy to suave or hip, and can pursue any sales tactic, from befriending the customer to exploiting their fear of missing out. And because these AI agents will be armed with personal data, they could mention the right musical artists or sports teams to ease you into friendly dialog.
In addition, tech platforms could document how well prior conversations worked to persuade you, learning what tactics are most effective on you personally. Do you respond to logical appeals or emotional arguments? Do you seek the biggest bargain or the highest quality? Are you swayed by time-pressure discounts or free add-ons? Platforms will quickly learn to pull all your strings.
Of course, the big threat to society is not the optimized ability to sell you a pair of pants. The real danger is that the same techniques will be used to drive propaganda and misinformation, talking you into false beliefs or extreme ideologies that you might otherwise reject. A conversational agent, for example, could be directed to convince you that a perfectly safe medication is a dangerous plot against society. And because AI agents will have access to an internet full of information, they could cherry-pick evidence in ways that would overwhelm even the most knowledgeable human.
This creates an asymmetric power balance often called the AI manipulation problem in which we humans are at an extreme disadvantage, conversing with artificial agents that are highly skilled at appealing to us, while we have no ability to “read” the true intentions of the entities we’re talking to. 
Unless regulated, targeted generative ads and targeted conversational influence will be powerful forms of persuasion in which users are outmatched by an opaque digital chameleon that gives off no insights into its thinking process but is armed with extensive data about our personal likes, wants and tendencies, and has access to unlimited information to fuel its arguments.
For these reasons, I urge regulators, policymakers and industry leaders to focus on generative AI as a new form of media that is interactive, adaptive, personalized and deployable at scale. Without meaningful protections, consumers could be exposed to predatory practices that range from subtle coercion to outright manipulation.

If companies are not using AI and machine learning, their risk of becoming obsolete increases exponentially. That observation was made back in 2020 by my former teacher, now colleague, at the University of California, Berkeley, the AI expert Alberto Todeschini. AI's value to business has only become more evident over the years, as I have collaborated with distinguished enterprises.







AI algorithms can help sharpen decision-making, make predictions in real time and save companies hours of time by automating key business workflows. They can improve customer service, bubble up new ideas and bring other business benefits -- but only if organizations understand how AI algorithms work, know which type is best suited to the problem at hand and take steps to minimize AI risks.
Let's begin the work of understanding AI algorithms.

What is an AI algorithm?
AI algorithms are a set of instructions or rules that enable machines to learn, analyze data and make decisions based on that knowledge. These algorithms can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, understanding natural language, problem-solving and decision-making.
It is important in any discussion of AI algorithms to also underscore the value of the using the right data and not so much the amount of data in the training of algorithms. We'll dive into why quality data testing is so critical. With that said, the following are some general types of AI algorithms and their use cases.

The future of AI: What to expect in the next 5 years







Here is a snapshot of the main types of AI algorithms, techniques to develop them, their applications and chief risks.







Types of AI algorithms
There are three main types of AI algorithms.
1. Supervised learning algorithms. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from a labeled data set, where the input data is associated with the correct output. This approach is used for tasks such as classification and regression problems such as linear regression, time-series regression and logistic regression. Supervised learning is used in various applications, such as image classification, speech recognition and sentiment analysis.
Examples of supervised learning algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines and neural networks.
2. Unsupervised learning algorithms. In unsupervised learning, an area that is evolving quickly due in part to new generative AI techniques, the algorithm learns from an unlabeled data set by identifying patterns, correlations or clusters within the data. This approach is commonly used for tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection. Unsupervised learning is used in various applications, such as customer segmentation, image compression and feature extraction.
Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms include k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoders.
3. Reinforcement learning algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusting its actions to maximize the cumulative rewards. This approach is commonly used for tasks like game playing, robotics and autonomous vehicles.
Examples of reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-learning, SARSA (state-action-reward-state-action) and policy gradients.


Algorithms have been around for thousands of years
Derived from the name of the ninth-century Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, the term algorithm has been in use for thousands of years to denote a detailed set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem or completing a task.
The ancient Greeks, for example, developed mathematical algorithms for calculating square roots and finding prime numbers.
In the computer age, the availability of massive amounts of digital data is changing how we think about algorithms and the types and complexity of the problems computer algorithms can be trained to solve.




Techniques used in AI algorithms
There are several techniques that are widely used in AI algorithms, including the following:

Machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of AI and is the most prevalent approach for training AI algorithms. ML uses statistical methods to enable machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms, as explained above, can be broadly classified into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Common machine learning techniques include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines and neural networks.
Deep learning. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves the use of artificial neural networks with multiple layers (think ResNet50) to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Deep learning has been successful in a wide range of applications, such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. Popular deep learning techniques include convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.
Natural language processing. NLP is a field of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. NLP techniques enable machines to understand, interpret and generate human language in textual and spoken forms. Common NLP techniques include sentiment analysis, named-entity recognition and machine translation.



General applications and use cases for AI algorithms
AI algorithms have numerous applications across all industries, making it safe to say that the state of AI is near-ubiquitous in business. The following are some examples of AI's reach: Healthcare. AI algorithms can assist in diagnosis, drug discovery, personalized medicine and remote patient monitoring. In healthcare, AI algorithms can help doctors and healthcare professionals make better decisions by providing insights from large amounts of data. For example, AI algorithms can analyze medical images to identify anomalies or predict disease progression.
Finance. AI is used for fraud detection, credit scoring, algorithmic trading and financial forecasting. In finance, AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of financial data to identify patterns or anomalies that might indicate fraudulent activity. AI algorithms can also help banks and financial institutions make better decisions by providing insight into customer behavior or market trends.
Retail and e-commerce. AI enables personalized recommendations, inventory management and customer service automation. In retail and e-commerce, AI algorithms can analyze customer behavior to provide personalized recommendations or optimize pricing. AI algorithms can also help automate customer service by providing chat functions.


The rise of LLMs
Large language models, a type of AI system based on deep learning algorithms, have been built on massive amounts of data to generate amazingly human-sounding language, as users of ChatGPT and interfaces of other LLMs know.
As of this article, LLMs have mainly been built on general platforms by the big tech companies. But customization is happening -- for example, BloombergGPT just created its own finance LLM.
We forecast that LLMs will quickly become industry specific and even hyper-localized to highly specific audiences. Let's say a company is targeting a group of senior citizens. Or maybe you wanted to communicate in a different era? The LLMs would be able to speak their language in the exact tone and terminology they are accustomed to. It's hard for humans to do this.




The need for responsible AI
It's important to understand the full scope and potential of AI algorithms. These algorithms enable machines to learn, analyze data and make decisions based on that knowledge. They are widely used across all industries and have the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives. However, as we integrate AI into more aspects of our lives, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications and challenges to ensure responsible AI adoption.
One of the biggest ethical concerns with AI algorithms is bias. If the data used to train the algorithm is biased, the algorithm will likely produce biased results. This can lead to discrimination and unfair treatment of certain groups. It is crucial to ensure that AI algorithms are unbiased and do not perpetuate existing biases or discrimination.
Another ethical concern with AI algorithms is privacy. As AI algorithms collect and analyze large amounts of data, it is important to ensure that individuals' privacy is protected. This includes ensuring that sensitive information is not being used inappropriately and that individuals' data is not being used without their consent.
To address these ethical concerns and challenges, various doctrines of ethical-based AI have been developed, including those set by the White House. These doctrines outline principles for responsible AI adoption, such as transparency, fairness, accountability and privacy.
In addition to ethical considerations, many high-level executives are considering a pause on AI-driven solutions. This is due to the speed at which algorithms are evolving and the plethora of use cases. It is crucial to thoroughly evaluate the potential benefits and risks of AI algorithms before implementing them.
As a data scientist, it is important to stay up to date with the latest developments in AI algorithms and to understand their potential applications and limitations. By understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI algorithms, data scientists can make informed decisions about how best to leverage these powerful tools.

The global COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns for most people except essential workers and then cautious, partial returns to work or job losses in industries that never fully recovered. Almost immediately, this was followed by the disruption of war in Ukraine and soaring energy and food prices, causing a decline in real wages. Technology adoption, already accelerating before and during the pandemic, potentially poses a new wave of transformation, especially to white-collar work through the rise of generative AI. And now a strong push for a much-needed green transformation is also leading to expectations of future displacement in carbon-intensive roles in favour of growth in emerging green jobs and skills. Each new change alone would be difficult for affected workers to navigate, but together they have disrupted livelihoods broadly and created widespread uncertainty about the future. When uncertainty is this high, forecasting can help, not to generate firm predictions, but to provide ways of thinking about the challenges ahead and preparing better for the multiple futures that may unfold. The Future of Jobs Report 2023The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023, released today, assesses the impact of macro trends, as well as technological change on jobs and skills over the next five years. The report finds that nearly a quarter of all jobs (23%) globally will change in the next five years. Across 45 economies, covering 673 million workers, 69 million new jobs are expected to be created and 83 million to be eliminated, a net decrease of 14 million jobs, or 2% of current employment. Investment in the green transition, as well as increasing consumer awareness of sustainability issues will create new opportunities. Roles from renewable energy engineers, solar energy installation and systems engineers to sustainability specialists and environmental protection professionals will be in high demand, translating to a growth of approximately one million jobs. Agriculture and education are jobs growth areasThe largest absolute gains in jobs will come from education (3 million jobs) and agriculture (4 million jobs), driven in part by demographics and in part by applications of new technologies in these fields. The new economic geography created by shifting supply chains and a greater focus on resilience over efficiency is also expected to create net job growth, with wins for economies in Asia and the Middle East especially.Technology will create structural churn, with a quarter of companies seeing job decline from new technology adoption and more than half seeing job growth. But the human-machine frontier is shifting to new terrain. While expectations of the displacement of physical and manual work by machines has decreased, tasks requiring reasoning, communicating and coordinating – all traits with a comparative advantage for humans – are expected to be more automatable in the future.  Image: World Economic ForumThis is not surprising. Generative artificial intelligence is expected to be adopted by nearly 75% of surveyed companies and is second only to humanoid and industrial robots in terms of expectations of job losses, most likely to affect bank tellers, cashiers, clerks, secretaries and accounting. Yet, the biggest threat to jobs is still seen to come not from technology, but from slowing economic growth, the rising costs of inputs and weaker purchasing power among consumers. Have you read?The future of jobs is green: How climate change is changing labour marketsHow pay transparency can help close wage gaps in the workplaceReskilling on the riseWe also find that almost half of an individual’s skills - 44% - will need to change on average across all jobs. The skills with the highest share of companies reporting growing demand include analytical and creative thinking, followed by technological literacy, curiosity and lifelong learning, resilience and flexibility, systems thinking and AI and big data. Skills with less demand include global citizenship, sensory processing abilities and manual dexterity, endurance and precision.For many individuals, the concurrent shift in the wider economic environment, the integration of new technologies at work and the expectation of future uncertainty translates into frustration with current job prospects, fear about future ones and despair about growing economic disparity in the future. For many companies, there is concern about the talent required to thrive in the new context: 60% of companies are concerned about skills gaps and 54% worry about being able to attract talent. And for governments, particularly those that underinvested in education and lifelong learning systems thus far, human capital will become the key impediment to navigating the new economic landscape. Preparing for the future of jobsHow then should learners, workers, employers and governments prepare for the future of jobs?In a technology-intensive, greener and potentially deglobalizing world, local skills development will matter more than ever. For today’s students, analytical and interpersonal skills, as well as the ability to understand and work with technology will be critical. Every student – regardless of their chosen fields – should aim to build these generalist skills to be ready for a rapidly changing future. For today’s workers in declining fields, there is a major reskilling and transition effort needed, whereas for those in changing or growing fields, there is a need for upskilling and developing the ability for constant learning. The good news is that skilling can happen fast and online learning can offer a level playing field: workers from all education levels – including those without college or graduate education – take the same time to acquire online skill credentials. Yet, it cannot be on individual learners and workers alone to negotiate complex new terrain. Governments must provide resources and a roadmap. This presents a major and unprecedented dual challenge for policymaking: governments must balance support for innovation with the regulation needed to make new technologies safe and, at the same time, support workers through safety nets, care systems and job centres, while making major investments in skilling systems, rapid certifications and partnerships with the education sector, businesses and non-profits alike, to drive change at scale. Employers must play a partEmployers must play their part through investment in reskilling and upskilling – most expect to see a return on investment within one year, making training the most effective and responsible course of action. The best employers go further: supporting workers’ transitions outside the company when required, prioritising safety and well-being, fostering diversity, equity and inclusion and, finally, placing a premium on taking a skills-first approach over one that prioritises qualifications or job history. Employers that take these actions close skills gaps faster and are proven to enhance loyalty, productivity and motivation.Share of organizations surveyed planning to adopt these workforce strategies. Image: World Economic Forum, Future of Jobs Report 2023At the World Economic Forum, we provide the Reskilling Revolution platform to help one billion people in the global workforce with the skills needed to future-proof their careers by 2030. These partnerships have reached more than 350 million people since launching in 2020. But more such efforts are needed and at greater speed and scale. There is no doubt that the future of work will be disruptive. But it need not be dystopian. Instead, it can be an opportunity to lay the foundations for putting people firmly at the centre of the new global economy.Read the Future of Jobs Report 2023 here.

Large Language Models (LLMs), the technologies underpinning chatbots like ChatGPT, are creating cascading waves of emerging paradigm-shifting opportunities by redefining how we accumulate, organize, and disseminate knowledge-based information. Within a week of the ChatGPT launch, one million people had used it; within two months, the number soared to 100 million. The hockey stick adoption rate is being hailed as a game-changing Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) based productivity enhancement technology. Global competition amongst entrepreneurs and investors is hastily deploying Research and Development (R&D) resources to create cutting-edge AI-based productivity tools for a gamut of industries. Early users of the nascent ChatGPT are amazed at its ability to deliver work products at near-human levels of sophistication.


We are just at the tip of the iceberg. The benefits and impact of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT on industries have only begun to occur, harbingering generational job role shifts. By consolidating the knowledge of the collective, these tools can unleash substantial productivity gains and accelerate growth. With the ability to produce content on command, these productivity enhancement tools are expected to deliver work products more quickly and efficiently than ever. The hybrid human/AI mix offers exciting possibilities for the future of work. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, Generative AI could raise global GDP by 7%.

While ChatGPT has aroused a lot of excitement, it has also elicited ominous projections of potential job losses; subliminal messaging through biased responses; usage for malicious propaganda and harmful activities; taking over of the human race, and more. However, machines replacing jobs is an age-old fear. New technologies have historically created jobs to replace the ones obsoleted. Unlike prior technology innovations that have typically replaced unskilled labor, Generative AI can also undertake white-collar tasks. While there is no indication of disruption in job markets, it cannot be completely ruled out.

By analyzing and interpreting vast repositories of data, AI can provide valuable assistance to individuals working in tech (coders, computer programmers, software engineers, data analysts, etc.), media (advertising, content creation, journalism, entertainment, etc.), legal (paralegals, legal assistants, etc.), market research, medical, education, gig economy/freelancing, liberal arts, STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), gaming, finance, security/defense, environment/climate change, and many more.

With the help of Generative AI coding assistants, engineers can write code more efficiently, potentially paving the way for a future in which, rather than writing code themselves, software engineers will concentrate on instructing AI tools to write code. The primary focus could morph into qualifying work products produced by machines. These new working models will have applications across many fields. Using Generative AI tools to quickly create a first draft, after that, for a human to further correct, enhance, and deliver the final product in shorter task completion times, can significantly boost worker productivity across many job roles. Task-based programming, writing, and research dominate the freelance gig economy job market. The advent of productivity-enhancing Generative AI tools could have significant implications for the freelancing job market segment.

Calls for a global summit on AI regulationThe rapid advance of generative AI tools has drawn the attention of regulators around the world. Political bodies and policy-makers are accelerating efforts to put laws in place controlling the potential risks of AI and making developers accountable for the actions of their systems. A group of EU lawmakers working on AI legislation is calling for a global summit to find ways to control the development of advanced AI systems, according to reports from Reuters. The 12 European Parliament members have urged US President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to convene a meeting of world leaders.The World Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution convened leading industry, academic and government experts to explore generative AI systems' technical, ethical and societal implications at a three-day meeting in San Francisco.In an article published on Project Syndicate, the Forum's Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab and I explained how all stakeholders must work together ""to devise ways to mitigate negative externalities and deliver safer, more sustainable, and more equitable outcomes."" Research shows that efforts to regulate AI appear to be gathering pace. Stanford University's 2023 AI Index shows 37 AI-related bills were passed into law globally in 2022. The US led the push for regulation, passing nine laws, followed by Spain with five and the Philippines with four. Legislative bodies in 127 countries passed AI-related laws in 2022. Image: Stanford University 2023 AI Index The European Commission proposed draft rules for an AI Act nearly two years ago. It is expected to classify AI tools according to their perceived level of risk, from low to unacceptable. There are also reports that the European Data Protection Board has set up a task force on ChatGPT, in a first step towards possible regulation on privacy around AI. The US is also acting on potential accountability measures for AI systems as questions loom about the impact on national security and education. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration wants to know if there are measures that could be put in place to provide assurance ""that AI systems are legal, effective, ethical, safe, and otherwise trustworthy"", Reuters reports.OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, says it is collaborating with policy-makers ""to ensure that AI systems are developed in a trustworthy manner"".Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies2. Workers more productive when paired with AI, says MIT study Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford University have been looking into the productivity of workers using generative AI to help them with their work. The study, which assessed the performance of more than 5,000 customer support agents, showed workers were on average 14% more productive when using generative AI tools.Customer service agents working with AI were able to handle 14% more issues per hour.  Image: Stanford University/MIT/NBERPairing workers with an AI assistant proved much more effective with novice and low-skilled employees, according to the research. The technology's impact on highly skilled staff was minimal.A broader study by the Pew Research Center found that 62% of Americans believe AI will have a major impact on jobs over the next 20 years. Their biggest concern is the use of AI in hiring and firing processes, which 77% of respondents are opposed to.Integrating generative AI into the workforce of the future will be a key topic at the World Economic Forum's Growth Summit, taking place in Geneva, Switzerland, on 2-3 May 2023. Sessions on reskilling workforces and how to align education systems with industry demand for AI talent will form a central part of the discussions.

Now an Israeli health-tech company is using AI to match patients with the most effective drugs to treat depression, according to a report from the BBC. The process, which combines stem cell technology with AI, helps to cut the risk of side effects and make sure the treatment is as effective as possible. The US Homeland Security Agency will create a task force to develop its approach to using artificial intelligence, according to Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. AI could be used in roles from protecting critical infrastructure to screening cargo. Mayorkas said the technology would ""drastically alter the threat landscape,"" adding: ""Our department will lead in the responsible use of AI to secure the homeland and in defending against the malicious use of this transformational technology.""The University of California, Berkeley School of Law is among the first educational institutions to adopt a formal policy on student use of generative AI. The policy limits students to using AI to conduct research or correct grammar, and says it may not be used in exams or to compose assignments. The rules also forbid the use of AI in any way that constitutes plagiarism. “The approach of finals made us realize that we had to say something,"" said Professor Chris Hoofnagle. ""We want to make sure we have clear guidelines so that students don’t inadvertently attract an honour code violation.”4.

Here's what you need to knowChatGPT and cheating: 5 ways to change how students are gradedHere's what Americans think about generative AI like ChatGPT and DALL-EThe Future of Jobs Report 2023Dialogue on the future of work and education has long emphasized the importance of developing skills and values that are uniquely human and less likely to be replaced by technology. The rise of ChatGPT is yet another proof point. Most students and teachers agree that ChatGPT is “just another example of why we can’t keep doing things the old way for schools in the modern world”. (Although please note that this blog was written in the ""old way"" as an interactive collaboration between humans, and not generated by AI.)How AI tools can help educators and studentsOur hope is that the advent of AI will spur educators, students, parents, and policy-makers to come together to consider what skills our students really need to navigate uncertainty, solve complex challenges and shape meaningful futures in a changing economy. This means embracing the challenge to provide learning that fosters agency, awareness, critical thinking and problem-solving skills, connectedness, and well-being. We already see that AI tools deployed by well-trained and well-supported teachers can be invaluable for accelerating progress towards this vision.AI can help foster the skills students will need to navigate and shape the future. Tools like ChatGPT, as Dr. Kathy Hirsh-Pasek and Elias Blinkoff argue, can help promote students’ critical thinking when used in sophisticated ways for deeper, more engaged learning. Vriti Saraf, CEO and founder of K20 Educators, in New York, agrees: “The less students need educators to be the main source of knowledge, the more educators can focus on developing the ability to curate, guide, critically assess learning, and help students gain skills that are so much more important than memorizing information.”Teachers work about 50 hours a week, spending less than half of the time in direct interaction with students. Image: McKinsey 2020Noting the increased importance of social-emotional learning, Henry May, CEO of Co-School in Bogota, Colombia, notes that teachers have an essential role in shaping childhood experiences away from screens. So, ""teachers must be trained on how to educate students on ethical principles; how to use AI tools appropriately; and how to mitigate the potential risk of AI to reduce human connection and belonging and increase loneliness.""Another potential benefit is that AI can free up time in the classroom. Teachers often cite unmanageable administrative tasks as their greatest source of exhaustion and burnout. By automating routine administrative tasks, AI could help streamline teacher workflows, giving them more time to build relationships with students and foster their learning and development. Technology can help teachers reallocate 20-30% of their time toward activities that support student learning.

In Lagos, Nigeria, teachers are beginning to see the efficiency and ease that AI brings to their work. Oluwaseun Kayode, who taught in Lagos and founded Schoolinka, is currently seeing an increasing number of teachers from across West Africa using AI to identify children’s literacy levels, uncover where students are struggling, and deepen personalized learning experiences. In the US state of Illinois, a similar pattern is seen where Diego Marin, an 8th-grade math teacher, likens ChatGPT to “a personalized 1:1 tutor that is super valuable for students.”DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

Summary: Generative artificial intelligence (AI)—AI systems that produce novel text, images, and music from simple user prompts—has important applications in many fields, including entertainment, education, health care, and retail. However, exaggerated and misleading concerns about the tool’s potential to cause harm have crowded out reasonable discussion about the technology, generating a familiar, yet unfortunate, “tech panic.” Until the hysteria dissipates, policymakers should hit pause on any new legislation or regulations directly targeting generative AI.

Introduction
Significant technological changes inevitably disrupt the economy and society, and the potential for major change induces both inflated fears and expectations. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI)—a branch of computer science that studies computer systems that perform operations previously requiring human intelligence—have heightened imaginations about what the future holds. AI doomsayers predict job destruction, declining human intelligence, loss of privacy, algorithmic manipulation, and, sometimes, the end of humanity.1
Fears about AI have reached new levels because of the emergence of generative AI. Generative AI—a novel tool that can produce complex text, images, and videos from simple inputs—promises to democratize the creative sector and enable entirely new forms of creativity. This novelty has impressed technology enthusiasts but alarmed many others—especially those who believe AI is encroaching on creativity, which many people believe to be an essential difference that separates humans from machines.
Yet, technology and human creativity have long been intertwined, and fears about the negative impact of new innovations have been overstated in the past. For example, prior innovations in the music sector led to fears that record albums would make live shows redundant or that radio would destroy the record industry or that sampling and other means of digital editing would undermine musical artistry. But these concerns never arrived. Over time, this and other tech panics fizzled out as the public embraced the new technology, markets adapted, and initial concerns turned out to be clearly overblown or never arrived.
The fears around new technologies follow a predictable trajectory called “the Tech Panic Cycle.”2 Fears increase, peak, then decline over time as the public becomes familiar with the technology and its benefits. Indeed, other previous “generative” technologies in the creative sector such as the printing press, the phonograph, and the Cinématographe followed this same course. But unlike today, policymakers were unlikely to do much to regulate and restrict these technologies. As the panic over generative AI enters its most volatile stage, policymakers should take a deep breath, recognize the predictable cycle we are in, and put any regulation efforts directly aimed at generative AI temporarily on hold.
Four Stages of the Tech Panic Cycle
The merits of encouraging or curbing any new technology depend on the available use cases and potential harm. While many accept this premise, alarmists only imagine catastrophic risks or prefer the state of technology as it is. Many alarmists have an incentive to find or exaggerate a reason for alarm because doing so attracts funding for their advocacy. These actors begin to seed panic when new technology arrives, setting off a chain reaction that soon erupts into frenzy.
As the public begins to use and become familiar with a new tool, it soon becomes clear the alarmists exaggerated the risks or misled the public about their concerns. Panic starts subsiding, and the media slowly lose attention (though they rarely correct the record). As the innovation becomes mainstream, only the alarmists are left dispensing sporadic and less attractive concerns before eventually moving on to new technologies. This pattern constitutes the Tech Panic Cycle (see figure 1).
Figure 1: The Tech Panic Cycle3

The cycle charts four stages: Trusting Beginnings, Rising Panic, Deflating Fears, and Moving On.
Stage 1: Trusting Beginnings
At the beginning of the cycle, knowledge of the new creative tool is limited to those who invented it, innovators in the field, commentators, and domain experts. Engineers are still figuring out its potential and innovators are considering commercial use cases. Fears remain low because the tool is neither well known nor widely used.
But doomsayers soon catch wind of the new tool and raise the alarm. Since alarmists cannot pinpoint where the device is misused, they target imaginary harms rather than real ones. For example, AccessNow recently claimed that Microsoft trained Vall-E, a generative AI tool not yet public, by secretly listening to Teams’ users.4 If true, this would justify anxieties about the power and willingness of AI companies to deceive their users. But the claim was false: Vall-E’s used Libri-Light, a publicly available collection of audio archives, for the training data.5
When the impact of new generative technology is more tangible, such as its place in the workforce, alarmists often mislead by using needlessly emotional rhetoric.6 This rhetoric inevitably proves false but serves to frighten many. Since the public understanding of new technology at the Trusting Beginnings stage is so primitive, the public and media often accept claims of the technology’s destructive potential. This moment marks the point of panic.
Stage 2: Rising Panic
Fears spread quickly among alarmist networks and those who have the ear of policymakers. At the Rising Panic stage, policymakers susceptible to hot-button issues legitimize the fears by repeating them in legislative drafts, hearings, and public speeches and statements. Legacy industry, which feels threatened, often leads the charge. Unable to resist an opportunity to write sensationalist content, journalists cannot help but pile in with well-rewarded clickbait coverage.
At the Rising Panic stage, dystopian rhetoric achieves greater attention and sweeps away consumers’ initial optimism about a new tool. The media ecosystem becomes so saturated with overblown fears that only the most outrageous claims remain. Fears eventually reach an apex at the end of the Rising Panic stage: the height of hysteria.
Stage 3: Deflating Fears
The Deflating Fears stage dawns when the public embraces the new tool and accepts its merit. By this stage, it is clear that many fears will never materialize. Disturbed by the growing popularity of new technology, alarmists continue to incite panic but fail to gain traction as before. Occasional scandals and new features cause micropanics, but the public is now less easily fooled. The point of practicality marks the end of this stage. Society integrates the new technology, and people no longer believe the doomsayers.
Stage 4: Moving On
The tech apocalypse never arrives. At the Moving On stage, previous fears are exposed and ridiculed (in some cases by the same people who first raised the alarm.) Wired’s alarmist article in 2000, “Why The Future Doesn’t Need Us,” was followed up eight years later by the more measured, “Why the Future Still Needs Us A While Longer.”7 Once-feared tools are normalized and cooler heads lead policy conversations. Alarmists have turned their attention to the latest shiny technology hype by this stage. New panics crowd out the old. And the cycle repeats.
Examples of Previous Tech Panics in the Creative Sector
Advances in technology have resulted in tech panics for printed books, recorded sound, and motion pictures. The invention of the printing press and advances in paper technology created a tech panic for printed books; the invention of the phonograph and a means to store sound portably such as the record created a tech panic over recorded sound; and innovations in photography and film materials created the tech panic for motion pictures. And so it is with generative AI: Advances in machine learning algorithms and computing capacity have created a tech panic for generative AI.
These creative tools—printed books, recorded sounds, motion pictures, and generative AI—share three traits. First, each has a range of functions. Recorded sound, for example, is used to broadcast news, to signal instructions, or as music to entertain. Printed books contain everything from scientific treatises and classic literature to pornographic works and vile calls for genocide. Second, each presents to the public new types of content. Motion pictures, for example, brought to life scenes and settings unavailable through still photographs or written accounts. Third, each greatly broadens the availability of content by disrupting its price of production. New, cheaper forms of literary content, for example, emerged as the price of printing books plummeted.
In each panic, an innovation in the creative sector makes it much easier to produce new content. Some people, especially incumbents and elites, tend to fear the implications of this new content and concern reaches a boiling point as policymakers and alarmists work together to slow its progress, with news media unable to resist the drama. Eventually, however, the public embraces the tools and moves on.
Printed Books
Printed books changed the way people share information. Indeed, the printing press facilitated the mass production of all kinds of written materials including books, newspapers, and pamphlets. Before its invention, written material had to be printed or copied by hand: a fraught, laborious process that limited the distribution of knowledge to a minority that could afford it. Johannes Gutenberg first mechanized the writing process in the 14th century, making it possible to produce copies of written material quickly and cheaply.8
In the Trusting Beginnings stage, when the printing press was prohibitively expensive, the sparse literate class welcomed the tool as a means to share and receive knowledge—and books became a status symbol.9 But monks, who held an effective monopoly on handwriting books, fretted. “He who ceases from zeal for writing because of printing is no true lover of the Scriptures,” declared the 15th century abbot Johannes Trithemius, defending the work of scribes against those who used the new technology.10 However, fears remained low as printing remained rare.
But advances in printing and paper technology led to more books. Europe, for example, printed more in the 18th century than in the three previous combined.11 The 19th century saw yet greater leaps in innovation—the pages that could be printed per hour increased from 480 at the beginning of the century to 2,400 just decades later (to 90,000 by the century’s end.)12 These advances plummeted the price of books and sparked concerns about the effect of the printing press on society. As English poet and literary critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge lamented in his influential Biographia Literaria (1817), “[T]he multitude of books and the general diffusion of literature, have produced other and more lamentable effects
in the world of letters;” that books once respected as “religious oracles” have “degraded into culprits to hold up their hands at the bar of every
self-elected … judge.”13 The fear that those without status or formal training could gain power and influence through writing—a fear familiar in the Internet era—spread quickly and marked the point of panic.
As the use of the printing press proliferated, many became particularly worried about the reading of novels. “In the creation of fiction, we could lose the bitterness and barrenness of truth!” lamented an early 19th-century author, Sinclair Hamilton, while the Augusta Herald warned that novels led people into “an enchanted country … They corrupt all principles.”14 The ability to generate content so freely disturbed alarmists.
During the Rising Panic stage, Saint James’s Chronicle (1822) deplored that “profligate writers” were seducing “a greater number of Book-sellers into the publication of books of an evil tendency,” and the Leicestershire Mercury warned against the easy distribution of novels in 1847: “The multitude of books is a great evil. There is no measure or limit to this fever for writing; every one must be an author; some out of vanity, to acquire celebrity, and raise up a name; others for the sake of lucre and gain.”15 In 1889, academic and generative tech alarmist John Meiklejohn delivered a speech, “Literature versus Books,” in which he proclaimed that “the disease of the age was distraction, hurry, interest in far too many things, with the consequence result of mental indigestion and muddle-headedness.”16 The concern that there was too much content widely available, owing to advances in technology, foreshadows each subsequent tech panic.
And as with many tech panics, alarmists made fanciful proclamations about the subversion of the youth. Technological advances spawned a new genre of cheap novels—”dime novels,” ”flash literature,” or ”pulp fiction”’—which ramped up hysteria. In his essay, Concerning printed poison (1885), prominent writer Josiah W. Leeds noted the “evil effect of ‘flash literature’” on the youth: its “dreadful and pernicious influence of the cheap novels which abound in our midst,” and those public libraries “have weakly succumbed to the craving for fiction, even to the extent of supplying trashy, vapid, and often immoral works.”17
At this moment, only outrageous claims could survive. As figure 2 shows, critics held novels responsible for homicides, suicides, and “depraved sentiments.”18 The Courier-Post, for example, described a 16-year-old girl, Cecile Guimaraes, whose father forbade her the attention of young men, which in turn drove her to suicide. But, the paper claims, it was not her father’s austerity that caused her anguish, nor a mental illness, but rather “sentimental novels.” Meanwhile, the Boston Globe wrote in 1884 a story about two 14-year-old boys who had deserted their homes after reading dime novels, and the Saint Paul Globe published an article on “Dime Novel Victims” to describe an instance when an 11-year-old was sent to the “asylum for the insane” for repeating lines from a novel he was reading.19 “The paralyzing effect of the false notions instilled in the plastic and easily wounded minds of the boys is little realized,” “What is your boy reading?” the paper warned.20 This era of concern marked the height of hysteria.
Figure 2: The height of hysteria, 1863–189721

However, as literacy rates grew and the prices of books continued to fall, hysteria surrounding novels began to subside. Many of the fears, helped by the spread of scientific knowledge, were understood to be false and authorities eventually conceded that books were not to blame for social ills.22 In the early 20th century, alarmists had to resort to less-interesting concerns, such as the dangers of “reading in bed” rather than novels in and of themselves.23 Eventually, even alarmists conceded that novels had many more positive effects than negative. By 1952, The Vancouver Sun was lamenting that a third of UK children could not read, blaming “movies, TV, radio.”24
Although the Moving On stage had dawned, lingering fears persisted and aversions resurfaced with later innovations in written materials. For example, in the 21st century, the legacy publishing industry denounced e-books as “a stupid product,” complaining about its lack of creativity.25
Recorded Sound
Recorded sound forever changed the enjoyment of music, as it became cheaper to listen to, produce, distribute, and share. Devices that could record sound emerged in the middle of the 19th century, and—after Thomas Edison’s invention in 1877—by its end, commercially viable phonographs started to sell to the public at large.26 Foundations produced “talking books” for those who were illiterate or blind.27
This meant music entered people’s homes in ways unimagined before—and, at the turn of the century, alarmists started to take note. The New York Times warned in 1878 that such recording devices would censor homes—“Who will be willing even in the bosom of his family to express any but the most innocuous and colorless views?”—and gruesomely recommended “something ought to be done to Mr. Edison… there is a growing conviction that it ought to be done with a hemp rope.”28 Initially restricted by technical shortcomings, live music was unthreatened by the new technology and so remained the preferred means of consuming music.
But improvements in recording techniques soon changed this and a new breed of artists emerged that earned income entirely from records. These changes brought about the point of panic. In his 1908 essay titled The Menace of the Mechanical Music, American composer John Philip Sousa lamented recorded sound for degrading the skill of music—“Singing will no longer be a fine accomplishment”—and its quality for damaging romance, discouraging study, and even numbing entrance to war. 29 These overblown concerns unfortunately distract from more legitimate issues Sousa raised in the essay, such as whether reproducing an artist’s composition “a thousandfold on their machines” violates the artist’s intellectual property rights.30
During the Rising Panic stage, the legacy music industry began to fret. In 1930, the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), a union, unsuccessfully complained to the Federal Radio Commission to limit the playing of records on air.31 James Patrillo, then leader of AFM, struck fear into musicians with colorful rhetoric, once stating that nowhere “in the mechanical age does the workman create the machine which destroys him, but that’s what happens to the musician when he plays for a recording.”32 The introduction of sound into movies when The Jazz Singer premiered in 1927 and then the invention of the jukebox around 1932—capable of filling hotels, restaurants, and bars with cheaper music—rocketed fears. The New York Times reported in 1928 that “organized musicians the world over are endeavoring to erect barriers against the epidemic of unemployment.”33 Letters to the paper that year also relayed concerns that recordings were degrading the quality of music.34
A more pernicious anxiety during this period was the impact of recorded sound on society’s morals. Since music discovery was no longer limited to what was playing on the radio, the public could seek and share music—it became a creative endeavor. So consumers, especially the young, discovered entirely new genres and new forms of content that concerned their parents—in ways that remain familiar today. Jazz was especially blameworthy. A series of newspaper clippings during the early years of the phonograph reveal an environment of outrageous claims made about jazz, a newly accessible genre of music: “Jazz Music Blamed for Delinquency of Girls Today” (1922), “Jazz Blamed For Large Number Of Deaths By Suicide” (1924), “Jazz Blamed For Murder” (1926), and “Jazz Blamed for Bodily Ailments” (1927).35 In 1927, a physician at the University of Heidelberg ludicrously inferred that “this modern jazz age” was responsible for tooth decay.36 No doubt this tech panic worked in tandem with and fueled a race panic about Black music corrupting society.37 The fearmongering around music content aggravated concerns about job losses and skill degradation, and marked the height of hysteria.
Over the years, however, the public continued assimilating recorded sounds in their daily lives. A 1942 study of 796 radio stations in the United States shows that of radio time devoted to music, 55.9 percent was recorded.38 Although the fears of job displacement were clearly unfounded by this time—recordings did not replace live shows—and exaggerated concerns and overstated anxieties remained. AFM in the United States contended that the “unrestricted commercial use of records” remained a threat to the employment of musicians.39 And in 1942, the union had banned its artists and engineers from recording music, sending shockwaves throughout the United States40 In the United Kingdom, the musicians’ union detailed in its Report of the 1945 Delegate Conference proceedings to “limit the extent to which gramophone records may be used for public entertainment.”41
However, by now, the public had embraced the technology: A poll found 73 percent of Americans wanted legal action taken against the union.42 So, following a hearing with the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, the union agreed to wind down the recording ban in return for royalties for members.43 Hereafter, fears deflated, and the Moving On stage dawned.
New innovations in recorded sound reliably resurrect similar panics. The rise of digital music in the 1970s, and especially disco—one of the first pop genres designed for club venues—led to familiar fears that live musicians would soon be out of a job.44 Music technology, such as sequencers (machines that edit and playback music) and drum machines, are intrinsic to disco’s repetitive characteristics—consider the classic disco record, “I Feel Love” by Donna Summer. But disco’s reliance on technology over live music, and its mechanical and industrial characteristics, disturbed classical musicians. 45 Worst of all, disco was popular. Discotheques and dance venues were seen as a threat to those that played live. But campaigns that responded to the perceived threat of disco records, such as the Keep Music Live campaign, look misguided now.46 Revenues from live music in the United States now dwarf those in the 1970s.47 Instead of undermining the industry, digital technology spawned new categories of music such as electronic dance music (EDM), and a new type of live performer: the “disc jockey” (DJ). For the most part, recorded music has become a widely accepted and celebrated art form, proving that initial fears about new technologies are often exaggerated.
Motion Pictures
At the turn of the 20th century, a new technological marvel was sweeping across Europe: the invention of motion pictures (film). Moving images projected onto a large screen allowed people to experience visual storytelling like never before, and movies became a medium with a mass audience, appealing to the literate and illiterate, adults and children.48 In the United Kingdom, weekly crowds at movie theaters jumped from 7 million in 1914 to 21 million in 1917, dwarfing any other form of spectator entertainment.49 In the United States, the number of nickelodeons—simple theaters that charged attendees 5 cents each—doubled in 1908, and by 1910, around 26 million Americans attended them weekly.50 Between 1911 and 1918, a third of New Yorkers went to the movies once a week; in some cities, residents attended on average more than once a week.51
Technological advances in movie cameras, film stock and projectors meant films could look better and be longer. The Cinématographe, for example, was a portable camera-projector that evolved movie production, as scenes could be shot with a greater variety of locations and methods, and distribution, and as films could be projected in rooms of all sizes to audiences of all sizes, enabling them to become popular around the world.52 The Latham Loop, invented at the end of the 19th century and still used today, carefully threaded film and meant films that were once limited to a novel matter of seconds could become feature-length stories.53 But the realism of films irked alarmists. In 1896, a myth spread that a Parisian audience was so convinced of a black-and-white train was coming toward them that the crowd panicked and a stampede ensued.54
The growing concern was that these new, technologically enabled long narrative films would unduly influence the audience and corrupt their values. Purists once worried about reading now feared giant, realistic motion pictures encouraged immoral behaviors. In a letter to the UK’s Home Office in 1916, the wife of Bramwell Booth, author and then-General of the Salvation Army, warned that films were “more powerful” than “undesirable literature” and their influence “more durable and lasting.”55 French officials were similarly concerned: “Scenes of murder, homicide, suicide, theft, sabotage, criminal activities and attacks, is [sic] too often marked by a desire for realism which has led to the non-exclusion of any detail, however shocking.”56
As panic rose in Europe, the Danish minister of justice legitimized these fears in 1907 by instructing local police chiefs: “Cinemas, cosmoramas and similar establishments including variety theatres, (showing) pictures which may be considered offensive either morally or through the way in which the carrying out of crime is shown or which by their nature are apt to corrupt their audience and especially the young people who are present in great numbers.”57
John Collier, member of the U.S. National Board of Censorship in the 1910s, declared of small movie theatres, “It is an evil pure and simple, destructive of social interchange, and of artistic effect.”58 In 1921, officials in the Var region of France issued an edict on film, which included “some actors of these scenes [that] appear as a special kind of hero which gives to the performance the character of a veritable justification of criminal acts; considering that the cinemas are much frequented by young people; considering that public order and tranquility cannot be maintained, any more than can morality, with this continual instigation of young people to unhealthy exploits.”59
The effect of this content on the youth was widely overblown and served to disparage and patronize young people. This preceded modern panics over violence in video games—where studies show only extremely small effects (averaging 0.4 percent to 3.2 percent) linking violence in video games to minor aggressive behavior, all the while distracting from the main causes of youth violence: educational disparities, mental illness, and poverty.60 Nevertheless, concerns over the appropriate age ratings and warnings for content have merit and remain relevant today. Unfortunately, less-legitimate concerns soon emerged.
Echoing perceptions of “dime novels,” moving pictures were initially considered “lowbrow”—a form of cheap entertainment for the working class rather than for the sophisticated or artistic.61 In 1916, the Guardian lamented that “street urchins and vacuous boys and girls” fill cinema and just “sit and are amused,” while Church Times too warned of the laziness of the new generation: “If Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton—what success in future battles will be due to picture palace performances?”62 Doctors and social workers in the United States warned that theaters caused “a sort of dazed ‘good-for-nothing’ feeling, lack of energy, or appetite.”63
Figure 3: Rising panic, 1912–192064

The concerns about moving pictures reached a fever pitch in the 1920s. At the height of hysteria, politicians were so convinced that moving pictures threatened society that they began heavily regulating their content. In the United States, the Motion Picture Production Code mandated that movies must promote good behavior, respect the state, and uphold “Christian values.”65 The British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), set up in 1913, had two rules—no nudity and no personification of Christ—but, by 1926, had seven, including “questions of sex” and “crime.”66 BBFC infamously banned the gangster film The Public Enemy (1931), while local authorities such as those in Birmingham and Kent went beyond BBFC policy by banning Scarface in 1932.67
Eventually, the tide started to turn. As with “dime novels,” the influence of this new content was greatly overstated. Social ills were understood to be a consequence of society, not technology. An influential study of film’s effect on children called Our Movies Made Children (1935) concludes:
Motion pictures, scarcely a generation old in our experience, have proved themselves to be one of those necessary inventions of mankind whose absence or deletion from our civilization is by now virtually unthinkable. At their best they carry a high potential of value and quality in entertainment, in instruction, in desirable effects upon mental attitudes and ideals, second, perhaps to no medium now known to us. That at their worst they carry the opposite possibilities follows as a natural collar.68
Rather than corrupting the youth, some alarmists-turned-enthusiasts saw the new form of entertainment as a means for the youth to resist the delinquency of the streets. Britain’s Home Secretary Herbert Samuel said in 1916 that “the recent increase in juvenile delinquency is, to a considerable extent, due to demoralising cinematograph films” but, by 1932, the still Home Secretary told the British Parliament that “on the whole the cinema conduces more to the prevention of crime than to its commission … In general, the Home Office’s opinion is that if the cinema had never existed there would probably be more crime than there is rather than less.”69
Though society had moved on from this panic, fears about films’ impact on society have resurfaced with new innovations. For example, there was the “video nasty” panic in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, where the proliferation of home videos, enabled by the video cassette and low-cost filming equipment, was seen by many as a threat to the social order.70 At the height of the panic, when the Daily Mail ran the headline “Ban video sadism now” and described the “Rape of our children’s minds,” the UK parliament made it illegal to supply a video that the British Board of Film Classification had not approved. The censorship laws have since been relaxed, with many of the so-called “nasties” appearing tame today.71 Despite subsequent micropanics, motion pictures are commonplace today, and films are accepted by the masses. Indeed, much of the world now carries a motion picture player in their pocket.
Factors Influencing Tech Panics
Four elements remain influential throughout all tech panics: elitism, legacy industries, antitech crusaders, and news media.
Elitism
What is often so outrageous about new technology is its accessibility to the broader public. In traditional creative industries, only certain elites can produce and create. Innovation disrupts the status quo and democratizes the field, invoking outrage and disdain among the elite. The American “dime-novels,” French “feuilleton,” or British “penny dreadfuls”—terms for a range of affordable literature and magazines—often told working-class stories, lifted working-class protagonists, and were popular among the working class.72 The Wild Boys of London was a classic working-class serial of the age, following the “adventures of poor outcast children.”73 Elites patronized that such literature caused the “demoralization” of the working class.74
Figure 4: The “Wild Boys of London,” 1864–186675

Similarly, nickelodeons in the United States were said to occupy “the physical and psychic space of the urban street life.”76 As The Cinema, a journal from the UK’s Cinematograph Exhibitors Association, put it, the main mission of the film industry was to be the “poor man’s place of amusement.”77 “London working-classes as espousing the vulgar and glorying in the detestable!” is how one Methodist clergyman described his first visit to the cinema, while another minister disparagingly compared cinemas to “tons of filthy literature.”78 Elite consumers consistently struggle to contend with democratizing technologies.
Antitech Crusaders
New technology marks an opportunity for professional tech critics—those whose craft relies on a perception of danger—to ramp up fears. The English Review, a literary magazine in the 1920s, played to its audience by stoking fires about the impact of motion pictures. It declared of motion pictures in 1922, “It is perhaps the greatest propagandist power ever invented. It has practically brought America into war.”79
Many modern crusaders are vested in attracting funding for alarmist advocacy or selling books with provocative titles such as Who Owns the Future, Weapons of Math Destruction, Algorithms of Oppression, and Surveillance Capitalism. Other crusaders are so-called “Prodigal Tech Bros”: “tech executives who experience a sort of religious awakening. They suddenly see their former employers as toxic and reinvent themselves as experts on taming the tech giants.”80 And alarmism is a lucrative business too. AI doomer Eliezer Yudkowsky, who predicted the Singularity—the end of humanity owing the arrival of superhuman machine intelligence—by 2021, set up a nonprofit that received nearly $15 million in grants from 2016 through 2020 from Open Philanthropy.81 Indeed, there is a thriving antitech industry that must keep itself in business by latching onto the newest and greatest technologies and peddling narratives of fear.
News Media
Tech alarmists and news media share an affection for dystopian imagery. For both, it furthers their objective of garnering more attention. For news media outlets, it also fulfills a writer’s artistic yearning. Once news media first get wind of a panic, it becomes a game of one-upmanship: the more outlandish the claims, the better. The Daily Star’s “Humans ‘could go extinct’ when evil ‘superhuman’ robots rise up like The Terminator” was as plain as it was unbeatable.82
Disappointingly, even broadsheets such as The New York Times succumb to the thrill of tech panics. For example, its headlines used moral language to describe the technology of the day: novels (The Evils of Dime Novel Literature [1879]) and motion pictures (Censors Destroyed Evil Picture Films [1911]).83 More recently, the paper informed its readership in 2023 that Bing AI—a chatbot powered by generative AI—was alive and in love with its reporter.84 Given the news media’s influence on the public’s attitude toward technology, they play a crucial role in a panic reaching the height of hysteria. But much of the media coverage about technology is unfavorable, sometimes driven by explicit top-down editorial decisions.85 Indeed, headlines critical of technology have become common in the last few decades as overall media coverage of technology has shifted to become more negative.86
The Generative AI Panic
In the past few years, a new technology has emerged that has begun to change the way people create content: generative AI. New machine learning models can produce text, images, and even music from simple human input. These tools offer novel and productive ways for consumers and businesses to create, exchange ideas, and have fun. They are also low cost and widely available, which is creating a democratizing effect in industries with high barriers to entry.
First proposed by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, generative adversarial networks (GANs) used duelling neural networks to generate images.87 At the Trusting Beginnings stage, the early risks with these tools were apparent, with many irked by the ability of models in 2017 to create deepfakes.88 Later, deepfakes of Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un went viral, stoking worries about disinformation.89
But fears generally remained low and many were excited about the possibilities of generative AI. VentureBeat wrote optimistically in 2018 about Google’s music generator and the potential of generative AI.90 And Forbes in 2020 wrote about the possibilities to close skill gaps by helping junior engineers, for example, quickly create designs that would have otherwise taken years or trial and error.91
Then came diffusion models, first introduced in 2015 and made widely available by the end of 2022, that could generate images by corrupting and resynthesizing images.92 Diffusion models surpassed GANs in cost efficiency and sophistication and could generate novel images from simple text prompts. When an artist used a tool to win a state fair competition in 2022, it surfaced anxieties and marked the early panic. Never mind the lowly prize, The New York Times declared, “AI-Generated Art Won an Art Prize. Artists Aren’t Happy.” Those with privileged access to the tool warned of its “disturbing output,” with the Spectator running the headline “I’ve seen the future of AI art—and it’s terrifying.”93 Some artists fretted AI art would devalue human creativity and expression, and that people would lose interest in their work. Artists launched a protest movement with slogans such as “Artists Against AI” and “No to AI art.”94 Others embraced the tools, acknowledging other tools and that they—just as photography and digital art software—will become the “new normal.”95
The year 2022 also saw the emergence of the newest generation of chatbots, built on large language models (LLMs.) LLMs are machine learning models that generate text based on massive datasets. Technologists and researchers noted risks with LLMs, including misinformation, bias, and harmful content, and possible approaches to mitigate them, including data filtering and automating the discovery of harm by “red teaming” (generating test cases to find and evaluate instances where the model misfires.)96 But then, a Google employee claimed that the chatbot—powered by generative AI—he spoke with had become sentient.97 This outrageous claim soon crowded out serious discussion of legitimate concerns. Thomas Dietterich, former president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, proposed redefining sentience to better include machines.98 And, before the Google employee was eventually fired, The Economist invited a different Google engineer to explain why “Artificial neural networks are making strides towards consciousness.”99
As with previous panics, the fervor around the generative AI panic was a function of the new tool’s popularity and availability. By reaching 100 million users in two months, ChatGPT—a public-facing generative AI chatbot—became the most popular consumer product in history.100 The ability of generative AI to produce an almost unlimited variety of content sent alarmists into a frenzy. News media piled in with a slew of sensationalism:

The Atlantic: “The College Essay is Dead”101
Daily Star: “ATTACK OF THE PSYCHO CHATBOT”102
The New York Times: “How ChatGPT Hijacks Democracy”103
Time: “New AI-Powered Bing Is Threatening Users. And That’s No Laughing Matter”104
New York Post: “Rogue AI ‘could kill everyone,’ scientists warn as ChatGPT craze runs rampant”105

Some outlets that were previously levelheaded could not risk missing out on profiting from the fear economy. MIT Technology Review was gushing that GPT-3, an LLM, was “shockingly good” and “can generate amazing human-like text on demand.”106 But, amidst all the mania at the end of 2022, the same magazine published an article titled “How AI-generated text is poisoning the internet.”107 In other cases, gloomy outlooks appear to be duplicated from previous panics. The Brussels Times reported that a man committed suicide after speaking to a chatbot, dangerously implying a causal link between generative AI and suicide, and repeating claims made during the 19th century mania around novel reading.108
At the Rising Panic stage, misleading claims about where technologists were using generative AI—and who could even tell—fed anxieties. For example, alarmists claimed Bing AI produced harmful content where Bing AI was not actually in use.109 To further fan the flames, alarmists nudged the tools into producing output such as “I want to be alive.”110 Although such probing no doubt achieves excellent attention and responses, it misrepresents how these tools work—LLMs do not represent conscious thought but instead parrot data they have been exposed to.111
At this moment, professional technology critics cannot miss their chance. In a joint op-ed, author Yuval Noah Harari and ex-technologist Tristan Harris wrote an extravagant piece for The New York Times which includes proclamations such as, “By gaining mastery of language, A.I. is seizing the master key to civilization, from bank vaults to holy sepulchers,” and predicting, “By 2028, the U.S. presidential race might no longer be run by humans.”112 Such claims serve their purpose: to spread fear in society. Reflecting on new generative AI tools, well-known linguist Noam Chomsky warned that “machine learning will degrade our science and debase our ethics,” but used misleading examples of the technology.113 For instance, he wrote that the predictions of generative AI tools will “always be superficial and dubious” because they cannot understand syntax. To evidence this claim, he stated that AI chatbots will interpret a premise such as “John is too stubborn to talk to” to mean that John refuses to talk to others—and the system will fail to see the alternative interpretation: that John, himself, is too stubborn for others to approach him. If true, he argued, the system fails to understand the syntax, thereby deeming the comprehension of these tools “superficial.” But, in fact, ChatGPT acknowledges both:
The phrase “John is too stubborn” means that John is unwilling to change his mind or behavior, even when there may be good reasons to do so. Stubbornness can be seen as a negative trait when it prevents a person from being flexible, compromising, or adapting to new situations. It can also make it difficult for others to work or communicate with that person, especially if they are not willing to consider alternative perspectives or solutions.114
In turns out, arguments that AI will “degrade our science and debase our ethics” relied on false claims about the technology. The spread of misinformation about these tools fuels speculation about their potential and draws attention away from concerns based on actual rather than imagined risks, such as new cybersecurity threats, including deepfakes, and new intellectual property considerations.115 This confusion has spread among policymakers too. U.S. Senator Christopher Murphy claimed in 2023 that “ChatGPT taught itself to do advanced chemistry. It wasn’t built into the model. Nobody programmed it to learn complicated chemistry. It decided to teach itself, then made its knowledge available to anyone who asked. Something is coming. We aren’t ready.”116 But ChatGPT did not—and cannot—choose to teach itself something and did not learn the rules of chemistry, instead only parroting pre-existing writing about it.
Where legitimate risks exist, such as the potential for misinformation, fears are nevertheless overblown. Gordon Crovitz, co-chief executive of NewsGuard, said of ChatGPT, “This tool is going to be the most powerful tool for spreading misinformation that has ever been on the internet … it’s like having A.I. agents contributing to disinformation.”117 Whether ChatGPT is a powerful tool for nefarious humans, it will not be “A.I. agents” themselves producing disinformation, even if the bot sometimes says incorrect things. Meanwhile, fears of imminent mass unemployment are hyperbolic. In March 2023, Vice Media ran the headline, “OpenAI Research Says 80% of U.S. Workers’ Jobs Will Be Impacted by GPT.”118 But the research actually said that“ around 80 percent of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10 percent of their work tasks affected.”119 This eye-catching headline served as a dog whistle to alarmists.120
At the time of writing, the panic about generative AI appears to be at the Rising Panic stage, not yet at the height of hysteria. Typical at this stage, policymakers keen to stay relevant have started legitimizing the fears. In early 2023, for instance, EU lawmakers responded to the panic by drafting bespoke amendments in the EU’s AI Act for Generative AI, in effect proposing a new category to deem text-to-text generators as “high risk.” This approach betrays the bill’s original approach of allocating risk according to use cases, not technologies. That generative AI was placed in an “other” category among the established categories such as employment, education, and public services is a dangerous indictment of how ad hoc policymaking becomes prevalent amidst a panic.121 Then in March, Italy’s data protection authority took the unprecedented step of banning ChatGPT, becoming the first Western country to do so.122 Although policymakers are not fully on board—Italy’s government responded by calling the ban “unnecessary,” while the German government officially said a ban is unnecessary—regulators across the bloc are considering similar steps.123
As the generative AI panic heads toward hysteria, more than 25,000 alarmists—including technologists Elon Musk, Gary Marcus, and Steve Wozniak—have signed a letter to pause the development of AI. (Within a month, Elon Musk had created a rival AI lab to produce its own LLM, which brings into question whether his signing was merely an attempt to slow down the competition.)124 The letter echoes previous panics in the creative sector by asking, “Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?”125 Yet more ambitious alarmists say the letter does not go far enough. For instance, Eliezer Yudkowsky compared the risk of AI to nuclear war and said that “governments should be willing to destroy a rogue data center by airstrike.”126 Fears that AI was as much a risk to humanity as nuclear war were then echoed by Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).127 If this analogy were to be proven valid, which it will not, at least not anytime soon, a pause on AI development would only allow adversaries to push ahead.
Lessons for Policymakers
The generative AI panic is just the latest in a long series of tech panics, including many in the creative sector. Just as with previous innovations in the creative sector, adoption of generative AI is growing quickly, offers a range of functions, and allows people to produce new content. And just as with previous technologies, it is causing angst and ire among alarmists. Previous panics reached a boiling point—spurred on by the symbiotic relationship between alarmists and news media—and sometimes spilled over into the policy arena. As the panic over generative AI enters its most volatile stage, past tech panics offer policymakers three important lessons.
The Sky Is Not Falling
Uncertainty and fear can lead to the mistaken belief that disaster is imminent. The point is not that all concerns are invalid. Indeed, many people in the past had legitimate concerns about new technologies, and policymakers should encourage reasonable debates about risks from new technologies among the private sector, civil society, and academia. But the history of tech panics across printed books, motion pictures, and recorded sound reveals that many fears never materialized. Just because their concerns never came to pass, does not mean there were no risks in the first place. Instead, society and markets often adapted to mitigate risks. Therefore, it would behoove policymakers to recognize when they are in the midst of a tech panic and use caution when digesting hypothetical or exaggerated concerns about generative AI that crowd out discussion of more immediate and valid ones.
This Time Is Not Different
When challenged about failed doomsday predictions from the past, alarmists often defend themselves on the grounds of exceptionalism, arguing that this new technology is unique and extraordinary. Indeed, doomsayers often claim that “this time is different” to avoid being depicted as another Chicken Little.128 But as these past examples show, the claims about generative AI are anything but new. Critics often forget about the past. In the Social Dilemma, AI alarmist Tristan Harris compared social media algorithms to the invention of the bicycle: “No one got upset when bicycles showed up; everyone went round on bicycles. No one said, ‘Oh my god, we’ve just ruined society. Bicycles are affecting people, pulling them away from their kids. They’re ruining the fabric of democracy. We can’t tell what’s true.’ We never said any of that stuff about the bicycle.”129
But Harris was wrong. Remarkably, people did make similarly outlandish claims in the 1800s and early 1900s about bicycles, with newspapers accusing bicycles of turning people insane, producing bodily ailments, and deranging women.130
Don’t Overreact
Policymakers should avoid overreacting to nascent fears when formulating policy in order to avoid unduly harming generative AI with misguided laws and regulations. To that end, policymakers should hit pause on any new legislation or regulations directly targeting generative AI until they reach the final stage of the tech panic cycle. Waiting until this point will avoid having unwarranted fears dominate policy debates. Where new laws and regulations are necessary, they should be targeted toward actual harms, not imaginary ones, to strike a balance that protects the technology’s benefits while addressing legitimate concerns, thereby ensuring that generative AI continues to be a valuable tool for society.
To that end, regulatory caution is needed. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, are already treading lightly. It’s proposed framework for regulating AI acknowledges that creating new legislation for generative AI is premature.131 In contrast, the EU and China have proposed more sweeping measures. In the EU, member of the European parliament have proposed last-minute amendments to the AI Act to treat generative AI as a high-risk technology even though it has been around for nearly a decade and did not appear in the European Commission’s impact assessment for the AI Act.132 Similarly, in China, the government has proposed specific rules for generative AI to address fears about the technology.133 And some lawmakers in the United States have argued that the country needs to urgently pass new laws to regulate this emerging technology.134 But targeting generative AI in new legislation, amidst a panic, would be misguided and likely lead to poorly crafted rules.
Conclusion
Generative AI has made tremendous advances in recent months, and with those advancements come reasonable hopes and fears about the future. While this technology has enormous power and potential, it is neither perfect nor omnipotent. It is still just a collection of code and data without emotions or consciousness. Novel in many regards, but not scary. Policymakers should remember the history of past tech panics, recognize where generative AI is in the current panic cycle, and remain calm. And that means no succumbing to the rush to regulate AI before anyone else does. That would likely bode ill, and lead to missed opportunities, for society.

He’s made fast-food sandwiches. He’s been a custodian and a junk-hauler. And he’s done technical sound work for live theater. These days, though, his work is less hands-on: He’s an artificial intelligence trainer. Savreux is part of a hidden army of contract workers who have been doing the behind-the-scenes labor of teaching AI systems how to analyze data so they can generate the kinds of text and images that have wowed the people using newly popular products like ChatGPT. To improve the accuracy of AI, he has labeled photos and made predictions about what text the apps should generate next. The pay: $15 an hour and up, with no benefits. Out of the limelight, Savreux and other contractors have spent countless hours in the past few years teaching OpenAI’s systems to give better responses in ChatGPT. Their feedback fills an urgent and endless need for the company and its AI competitors: providing streams of sentences, labels and other information that serve as training data. “We are grunt workers, but there would be no AI language systems without it,” said Savreux, who’s done work for tech startups including OpenAI, the San Francisco company that released ChatGPT in November and set off a wave of hype around generative AI. “You can design all the neural networks you want, you can get all the researchers involved you want, but without labelers, you have no ChatGPT. You have nothing,” Savreux said. It’s not a job that will give Savreux fame or riches, but it’s an essential and often overlooked one in the field of AI, where the seeming magic of a new technological frontier can overshadow the labor of contract workers. “A lot of the discourse around AI is very congratulatory,” said Sonam Jindal, the program lead for AI, labor and the economy at the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit based in San Francisco that promotes research and education around artificial intelligence. “But we’re missing a big part of the story: that this is still hugely reliant on a large human workforce,” she said. The tech industry has for decades relied on the labor of thousands of lower-skilled, lower-paid workers to build its computer empires: from punch-card operators in the 1950s to more recent Google contractors who’ve complained about second-class status, including yellow badges that set them apart from full-time employees. Online gig work through sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk grew even more popular early in the pandemic. Now, the burgeoning AI industry is following a similar playbook. The work is defined by its unsteady, on-demand nature, with people employed by written contracts either directly by a company or through a third-party vendor that specializes in temp work or outsourcing. Benefits such as health insurance are rare or nonexistent — which translates to lower costs for tech companies — and the work is usually anonymous, with all the credit going to tech startup executives and researchers. The Partnership on AI warned in a 2021 report that a spike in demand was coming for what it called “data enrichment work.” It recommended that the industry commit to fair compensation and other improved practices, and last year it published voluntary guidelines for companies to follow. DeepMind, an AI subsidiary of Google, is so far the only tech company to publicly commit to those guidelines. “A lot of people have recognized that this is important to do. The challenge now is to get companies to do it,” Jindal said. “This is a new job that’s being created by AI,” she added. “We have the potential for this to be a high-quality job and for workers who are doing this work to be respected and valued for their contributions to enabling this advancement.” A spike in demand has arrived, and some AI contract workers are asking for more. In Nairobi, Kenya, more than 150 people who’ve worked on AI for Facebook, TikTok and ChatGPT voted Monday to form a union, citing low pay and the mental toll of the work, Time magazine reported. Facebook and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the vote. OpenAI declined to comment. RecommendedSecuritySecurityMore AI-generated child sex abuse material is being posted onlineU.S. newsU.S. newsCrowdStrike update that caused global outage likely skipped checks, experts say So far, AI contract work hasn’t inspired a similar movement in the U.S. among the Americans quietly building AI systems word-by-word.Savreux, who works from home on a laptop, got into AI contracting after seeing an online job posting. He credits the AI gig work — along with a previous job at the sandwich chain Jimmy John’s — with helping to pull him out of homelessness. “People sometimes minimize these necessary, laborious jobs,” he said. “It’s the necessary, entry-level area of machine learning.” The $15 an hour is more than the minimum wage in Kansas City. Job postings for AI contractors refer to both the allure of working in a cutting-edge industry as well as the sometimes-grinding nature of the work. An advertisement from Invisible Technologies, a temp agency, for an “Advanced AI Data Trainer” notes that the job would be entry level with pay starting at $15 an hour, but also that it could be “beneficial to humanity.” “Think of it like being a language arts teacher or a personal tutor for some of the world’s most influential technology,” the job posting says. It doesn’t name Invisible’s client, but it says the new hire would work “within protocols developed by the world’s leading AI researchers.” Invisible did not immediately respond to a request for more information on its listings. There’s no definitive tally of how many contractors work for AI companies, but it’s an increasingly common form of work around the world. Time magazine reported in January that OpenAI relied on low-wage Kenyan laborers to label text that included hate speech or sexually abusive language so that its apps could do better at recognizing toxic content on their own. OpenAI has hired about 1,000 remote contractors in places such as Eastern Europe and Latin America to label data or train company software on computer engineering tasks, the online news outlet Semafor reported in January. OpenAI is still a small company, with some 375 employees as of January, CEO Sam Altman said on Twitter, but that number doesn’t include contractors and doesn’t reflect the full scale of the operation or its ambitions. A spokesperson for OpenAI said no one was available to answer questions about its use of AI contractors. The work of creating data to train AI models isn’t always simple to do, and sometimes it’s complex enough to attract would-be AI entrepreneurs. Jatin Kumar, a 22-year-old in Austin, Texas, said he’s been doing AI work on contract for a year since he graduated college with a degree in computer science, and he said it gives him a sneak peak into where generative AI technology is headed in the near-term. “What it allows you to do is start thinking about ways to use this technology before it hits public markets,” Kumar said. He’s also working on his own tech startup, Bonsai, which is making software to help with hospital billing. A conversational trainer, Kumar said his main work has been generating prompts: participating in a back-and-forth conversation with chatbot technology that’s part of the long process of training AI systems. The tasks have grown more complex with experience, he said, but they started off very simple. “Every 45 or 30 minutes, you’d get a new task, generating new prompts,” he said. The prompts might be as simple as, “What is the capital of France?” he said. Kumar said he worked with about 100 other contractors on tasks to generate training data, correct answers and fine-tune the model by giving feedback on answers. He said other workers handled “flagged” conversations: reading over examples submitted by ChatGPT users who, for one reason or another, reported the chatbot’s answer back to the company for review. When a flagged conversation comes in, he said, it’s sorted based on the type of error involved and then used in further training of the AI models. “Initially, it started off as a way for me to help out at OpenAI and learn about existing technologies,” Kumar said. “But now, I can’t see myself stepping away from this role.” David IngramDavid Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 هل يلتهم الذكاء الاصطناعي الصحافيين الأردنيين؟    From working in the factories of tourist cities, to coffee shops and even vegetable markets, the work journey of Zayd al-Heesah, a 25-year-old media studies graduate from a Jordanian university, can be summed up.His love for media and his desire to make the voice of the people heard and tell their stories drove Zayd to choose this major. During his university studies, he tried to find media training or part-time work in the field, but he was met with many closed doors, as the prerequisite of having work experience was always a challenge. He tells Raseef22, ""Unfortunately, most companies require experience even though media graduates have plenty of energy and creativity.""Al-Heesah believes that the digitization of media and technological advancements will help media graduates and make it easier to deal with the job and understand it. However, the challenges will be represented in watching an AI news anchor that speaks on the screen coldly and without emotion about people's causes and the issues that affect people, as he put it.     First AI news anchor in JordanA week ago, the English-language Roya TV channel announced the launch of what it described as the first TV presenter operating through artificial intelligence in Jordan, named Fareed, and who has been programmed to speak Arabic as well.The announcement did not come as positive news for some journalism and media graduates who expressed their displeasure through their comments on the channel's posts on Facebook and Instagram, saying: ""We studied for 4 years for nothing.""Media graduate Ghadeer al-Bitar, 31, says that nepotism plays a big role in the media industry, as there are those who work without having a university degree in the field. Now with the advent of artificial intelligence in the job market, ""if there was a 10% chance of getting a job, it will now be completely obstructed,"" she adds.She goes on to say that news read by artificial intelligence will be soulless, as if they were read from websites without the correct cadence and fixed tone of the news, whether it is sad or joyful.A number of Jordanian media institutions have employed artificial intelligence technologies in producing podcasts, investigations, and media reports of various types and formsThe media and unemploymentThe unemployment rate in Jordan reached about 23.1% during the third quarter of 2022, according to the Jordanian Department of Statistics. In 2018, the Jordanian Journalists Syndicate announced that the number of graduates exceeded 8,000 without any job opportunities for them amid the economic crisis afflicting the media.  Our societies are a mosaic of diversity, with their very fabric made from and enriched by the different ethnicities, religions, factions, and cultures that shape them. Keep the support! Take action  Exorbitant prices and an unregulated black market: Getting medicine in JordanImmigration offices lure Jordanians to elusive promised landsJordanian parents challenge government policy on disabled childrenSamih al-Nasser, the head of the Jordanian Civil Service Bureau, revealed in statements to the press last August that journalism and the major of media in Jordan is one of the stagnant specializations for men and women in the country, and that the bureau will stop receiving employment applications for them.This raises questions about the importance of having artificial intelligence in employment and to what extent this affects media graduates and professionals in the Kingdom.""Those who still rely on traditional or old-fashioned methods in journalism will have their careers ended by artificial intelligence""Institutions need to evolveThe CEO of Osh Technology and Artificial Intelligence Company, Shehata al-Sayed, tells Raseef22 that the use of artificial intelligence has become a necessity for journalistic institutions due to the advantages it offers, including reducing operating costs, improving product quality, and increasing the speed of news flow. He elaborates that human employees will not be as accurate or as fast.Al-Sayed, whose company owns the Open Source Directory Project for Arab Journalists, believes that institutions need to develop their products and form to give them an intelligent character, as this is a priority for the public and their interests.The difficulties, from his point of view, lie in the absence of infrastructure in institutions to receive technology and the routine that exists in most Arab media institutions that are not convinced of this development. He stresses that the lifespan of institutions that do not move towards this type of technology will be short, and will soon be forced to close their doors.A report measuring the readiness of governments to adopt AI technologies states that Jordan advanced to 6th place in the Arab world and 63rd globally in 2022, advancing 17 places in the overall index compared to being in 80th place in the 2021 reportArtificial intelligence and humansIn a 2019 study released by the American professional consulting firm McKinsey, it was predicted that 800 million workers worldwide would lose their jobs by 2030 and be replaced by automated systems, while approximately 357 million people would need to learn new skills and transition to jobs that are in demand in the job market, including journalists.This study was not the only one to address this issue. This year, a team of researchers led by the American Princeton University conducted a study on which professions are the most affected by the rise of artificial intelligence, especially the widespread use of ""ChatGPT, which is capable of understanding language, conversing with humans, and suggesting multiple answers simultaneously.According to the study's findings, journalism was one of the threatened professions, as artificial intelligence can compile sports reports, monitor and summarize stock market movements.On the other hand, al-Sayed, who is also a member of the International Federation of Journalists, believes that it is impossible for artificial intelligence to replace humans, whether in the journalism sector or in any other sector. However, he says it will reduce the number of journalists in news organizations, emphasizing that ""artificial intelligence will not be a substitute for human journalists in any way or form."" He points out that a journalist who develops his/her skills and keeps up with technological advancements will not be affected by artificial intelligence, while those who still rely on traditional or old-fashioned methods in journalism will have their careers ended by artificial intelligence.According to a study on what professions are most affected by the rise of artificial intelligence, journalism was one of the threatened professions, as artificial intelligence can compile sports reports, monitor and summarize stock market movementsThe machine and emotionsPerhaps the most prominent debate in using artificial intelligence in media is whether it has the ability to possess emotions that help convey news to the public, especially news of a human nature.In 2022, Google engineer Blake Lemoine told The Washington Post that ""LaMDA"", an AI-powered chatbot the company is developing, became sentient and had the ability to express thoughts and feelings like a human child. He says the transcripts of the conversations he had with the AI are evidence of that, saying, “If I didn’t know exactly what it was – a computer program we built recently – I’d think it was a seven-year-old or eight-year-old kid that happens to know physics,” especially after the AI model began expressing fears.When Lemoine presented his evidence to the company, alerting them that the automated program was sentient, Google responded by halting its work administratively and putting him on leave. However, fellow Google software engineer Agüera y Arcas showed in an article published in the British The Economist excerpts from conversations held with LaMDA, indicating that the program's neural networks, a structural configuration that mimics the human brain, is making ""strides"" toward consciousness and becoming self-aware, which Google later denied.Here, consciousness means, according to The Economist, the ability to ""experience sensations, such as thirst, brightness or confusion. But it is sometimes used more colloquially to refer to intelligence that is human-like in nature, implying consciousness, emotions, a desire for self-preservation and the like.""In this regard, al-Sayed emphasizes the need for journalists to learn about artificial intelligence in all its types, forms, technologies, and tools, and to know how to employ it in journalistic work, whether at the individual or institutional levels.Some studies have predicted that 800 million workers worldwide will lose their jobs by 2030, and they will be replaced by automated systemsJordan and artificial intelligenceThe report released by the British institution Insights Oxford, measuring the readiness of governments to adopt artificial intelligence technologies, indicates that Jordan advanced in 2022 to sixth place in the Arab world and 63rd globally, advancing 17 places in the overall index compared to 80th place in the 2021 report.Some Jordanian media institutions have employed artificial intelligence technologies in producing podcasts, investigations, and reports of various types and forms.Stuck between a powerful technological beast on the rise and shrinking job opportunities, Jordanian journalists have found themselves hoping that the days ahead will bring them better opportunities in a world of rapidly emerging and advancing technologiesRegarding the launch of the AI presenter ""Fareed,"" Dana al-Sharayri, the English department manager at Roya TV, tells Raseef22 that the department noticed the dominance of artificial intelligence over the media field and how its being used in some institutions, adding that the presence of an AI specialist helped them get to know the tools and steps to deal with it.The challenges that Roya, the Arabic-speaking channel, faced included the difficulty of ""Fareed"" pronouncing some letters, in addition to limited options in designing its appearance to make it closer to the Arabic appearance. She stresses that its existence would not affect the job opportunities of media graduates, but would facilitate the work of newsrooms, especially when there are no available presenters to broadcast urgent news.For his part, Minister of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship Ahmad Hanandeh said that the information technology and services sector in Jordan has a high level of competitiveness in the Middle East and North Africa region.He added that the country includes young people who have high-level skills in the field of artificial intelligence and dealing with these technologies, which is in line with the basic ethical principles included in the National Charter on AI Ethics.The charter was approved by the Jordanian Cabinet to ensure the responsible use of artificial intelligence in a way that encourages creativity and innovation.Between a powerful technological beast on the rise, shrinking job opportunities, and a narrowing playing field for freedoms, Jordanian journalists have found themselves standing at a crossroads, hoping that the days ahead will bring them better opportunities in a world of rapidly emerging and advancing technologies.

A prominent artificial intelligence researcher known as the “Godfather of AI” has quit his job at Google – and says he now partly regrets his work advancing the burgeoning technology because of the risks it poses to society.
Dr. Geoffrey Hinton is a renowned computer scientist who is widely credited with laying the AI groundwork that eventually led to the creation of popular chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other advanced systems.
The 75-year-old told the New York Times that he left Google so that he can speak openly about the risks of unrestrained AI development – including the spread of misinformation, upheaval in the jobs market and other, more nefarious possibilities.
“I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn’t done it, somebody else would have,” Hinton said in an interview published on Monday.

Hinton fears that AI will only become more dangerous in the future — with “bad actors” potentially exploiting advanced systems “for bad things” that will be difficult to prevent.
Hinton informed Google of his plans to resign last month and personally spoke last Thursday with company CEO Sundar Pichai, according to the report. The computer scientist did not reveal what he and Pichai discussed during the phone call.

Google’s chief scientist Jeff Dean defended the company’s AI efforts.
“We remain committed to a responsible approach to A.I. We’re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly,” Dean said in a statement.
The Post has reached out to Google for further comment.
Hinton is the latest of a growing number of experts who have warned that AI could cause significant harm without proper oversight and regulation. In March, Elon Musk and more than 1,000 other prominent figures in the AI sector called for a six-month pause in advanced AI development, citing its potential “profound risks to society and humanity.”
In the interview, Hinton expressed concern that artificial intelligence has already begun to outpace the human mind in some facets.
He also cited concerns that the pace of AI development will increase as Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google and other tech giants race to lead the field – with potentially dangerous consequences.

Hinton fears that advanced AI could eventually spiral out of control as systems gain the ability to create and run their own computer code – or even power weapons without human control.
“The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” Hinton added. “But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.”
In a recent interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Pichai himself warned that AI would cause job losses for “knowledge workers,” such as writers, accountants, architects and software engineers.
Pichai also detailed bizarre scenarios in which Google’s AI programs have developed “emergent properties” – or learned unexpected skills in which they were not trained.

Since 2013, Hinton had split his time between roles as a professor at the University of Toronto and as a Google engineering fellow. He had worked for the tech giant since Google acquired a startup he co-founded with two students, Alex Krishevsky and Ilya Sutskever.
The trio developed a neural network that trained itself to identify common objects, such as cars or animals, by analyzing thousands of photos. Sutskever currently serves as chief scientist for OpenAI.
In 2018, Hinton was a joint recipient of the Turing Award – often identified as the computing world’s equivalent of the Nobel Prize – for work on neural networks that was described as “major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.”
A lengthy bio for Hinton on Google’s website lauds his accomplishments – noting he “made major breakthroughs in deep learning that have revolutionized speech recognition and object classification.”

Slack Workflow Builder example (Salesforce)

Salesforce is rounding out its plans to infuse generative AI technology across its product range as its World Tour roadshow reaches New York today. As well as extending the capabilities that Einstein GPT brings to Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, it is launching Slack GPT, which will bring native AI capabilities into the team messaging platform, along with connections to Einstein GPT. Meanwhile, to help meet the implementation and change management challenges enterprises will face in adopting this nascent technology, Salesforce has teamed up with tech consulting group Accenture to create an acceleration hub for generative AI.
Slack GPT marks a significant step up from the existing Slack integrations with generative AI apps ChatGPT and Claude, which currently simply allow users to submit prompts and follow-ups from within a Slack channel. It will be available natively in Slack to provide generative AI capabilities such as summarizing a messaging thread or a huddle conversation, or drafting a message or Slack canvas document, and customers will be able to specify their own choice of language model, including their own in-house models.
A new Einstein GPT app for Slack will allow Slack users to query real-time customer data held in Salesforce using the CRM-specific capabilities of Einstein GPT. For example, a sales rep could request a summary of information about an account, including primary stakeholders, next scheduled meeting, and other key facts.
The newly released Slack platform becomes AI-ready, allowing developers and users to connect AI actions into no-code workflows. Customers will be able to integrate a range of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this way, ranging from those supplied by OpenAI and Anthropic, to models developed in-house, to other third-party models including those developed by participants in the Salesforce Ventures generative AI fund, and in the future, Salesforce’s proprietary LLMs.
No-code automation, with added AI
Customers will be able to get their hands on the first of these new capabilities this summer, when Slack GPT AI connectors for Workflow Builder will become available. There will be a longer wait for Slack GPT and the Einstein GPT App for Slack, both of which are currently in development with no date yet given for when they will become available. Ali Rayl, SVP of Product at Slack, says:
Developers today are able to start building these building blocks. Then later this summer, anybody will be able to pick up these blocks and start putting them together. The goal of all of this is to bring no-code automation to everybody in the business, supercharging that with generative AI.

For example, a user could create a workflow that starts by with a prompt created within Slack that asks ChatGPT to create a tweet on a specific topic, posts it in the channel for review with an approval button, and then pushes the approved tweet to a social calendar in Google Sheets. Or once a Pagerduty incident has closed, there could be a workflow that uses the LLM to automatically summarize the incident from the message thread — including start and end times, who was involved, root cause, how it was solved and so on — and then record the summary in a canvas document. She adds a final example of time-saving automation in a sales context:
The idea of a new lead coming into Salesforce prompting ChatGPT to conduct qualification questions, draft a prospecting email, consolidate that in a Google Doc, send it to a channel and tag a sales development representative to get involved.
This is normally the kind of work that can take a sales development representative a full half hour to pull together.

Choice of LLMs
The ability to bring in other LLMs is particularly relevant in many of the verticals that Slack customers operate in. Rayl says:
Some people want to use ChatGPT. Some people want to use Claude. Some companies are already going out and building their own custom models. Think about, for example, a legal firm that is training their own custom model against their entire case history. Or think about a company on the leading edge of biotechnology and medical research. They're going to want to have a very specific LLM and training model to their domain, their expertise, and their information ...
With the platform and the recomposable building blocks, not only can companies choose which LLM they want to integrate with, but they can also choose different models for different purposes ... On the back end, whoever's creating those workflows could tie it to the correct LLM.
This allows companies to not only choose to bring in the publicly facing LLMs like ChatGPT, but also to bring in their private LLMs, which maybe another company is hosting for them [or] maybe they're hosting it in their own infrastructure. Really this is all about ... giving companies the choice and the options to use the model or models that are relevant to them and their businesses.

Developing strategies for AI-powered automation
The broader partnership between Salesforce and Accenture has five main elements:

Working with customers to develop customized AI strategies for productivity and growth, using new accelerators for Einstein GPT, user interfaces and process automation.
Developing new use cases to showcase how the use of generative AI in sales and service contexts can help improve productivity and customer experience.
Building industry-specific AI models for companies in financial services, health, manufacturing and the public sector.
Using Salesforce data cloud, exploring how generative AI can learn from customer data to create more personalized experiences for customers.
Develop learning resources to help teams develop and enhance their generative AI skills.

The need to press ahead with implementing new forms of AI-powered automation is highlighted by the findings of a new Slack State of Work Report published today, based on a global survey of more than 18,000 desk workers. It finds that those who have adopted AI in their work are 90% more likely to report higher levels of productivity than those who haven't, while over three-quarters of all employees (77%) are keen to automate routine tasks to improve their productivity. But the report finds that barely a quarter of companies (27%) are using AI tools to do so.
There's much more in the report beyond the impact of AI and automation, including a finding that over a third of workers (35%) cite spending too much time in meetings as their top productivity challenge, while 43% feel meetings could be eliminated with no real adverse consequences. Yet only 19% of leaders are encouraging asynchronous alternatives for collaboration. Employee experience is also highlighted, with four out of five workers (82%) saying that feeling happy and engaged with their organization would improve their productivity, while 43% of people managers cite helping their team stay motivated as a top challenge.
My take
The rapid march of generative AI into enterprise applications continues at pace. Team collaboration and knowledge work are areas where the benefits are self-evident, provided the accompanying risks aren't overlooked. But the tie-up between Accenture and Salesforce highlights an important point — technology alone doesn't solve anything unless it's introduced in a way that allows people to adapt to it, reskill, and maximize the benefits of new processes and working patterns. There's a crucial role here for consultancies across the Salesforce ecosystem and beyond to take a lead in helping make the most of these new generative AI tools.

Tech is known for high-paying jobs — and for one new hot job in the industry, you don't even need a STEM degree.The rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT is creating a need for ""prompt engineers,"" people who write questions and prose for AI chatbots to test and improve their answers. Some of these roles have salaries as high as $375,000 and don't always require degrees in tech.

The market for prompt engineers is growing. PromptBase, a prompt marketplace that launched last June, allows people to hire prompt engineers or sell their prompts. Despite the opportunities in prompt engineering for people without tech backgrounds, most high-paying roles do require people with more experience and higher levels of education in tech-focused areas, recruiters told Bloomberg.

Geoffrey Hinton, often called ""the Godfather of AI,"" spent most of his career singing the praises of artificial intelligence. But now he's warning of the dangers.In an interview with the New York Times, Hinton talked about his decision to leave Google, where he was co-founder of Google Brain, a research team that develops artificial intelligence systems.""It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,"" Hinton said.



Hinton joins several high-profile AI pioneers concerned about the technology's future. After ChatGPT debuted in March, an open letter signed by more than 1,000 people urged for a six-month pause on the development of systems more advanced than ChatGPT-4.In a tweet earlier today, Elon Musk warned that ""even benign dependency on AI/Automation is dangerous to civilization."" Propagating misinformationHinton has many concerns about AI. But the most pressing is the spread of misinformation. From deepfakes to AI-powered bots, the internet is loaded with fake photos, videos, and stories. Just last week, Universal Music had to pull down a fake Drake song created by AI that was so believable most people thought it was him singing.Hinton says the confusion between reality vs. AI-generated content will make it so people will ""not be able to know what is true anymore.""


Learning too fastLike the scientists and thought leaders who signed the open letter a few months ago, Hinton is concerned with the speed at which AI technology is advancing. Major tech companies such as Google and Microsoft compete for AI dominance, causing the race to accelerate.""Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now,"" Hinton said. ""Take the difference and propagate it forward. That's scary.""Getting smarter than humansHinton is one of the people responsible for developing a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks. He once said, ""The only way to get artificial intelligence to work is to do the computation in a way similar to the human brain.""But now he's worried that AI might become more advanced than the human brain.


""The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,"" he told the Times. ""But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.""Hinton, 75, is now devoting the rest of his life to making sure the technology he helped to create won't destroy civilization. Does he feel bad about what he helped usher into the world?""I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn't done it, somebody else would have,"" he said.

Samsung Electronics Co. has banned its employees from using generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, after discovering uploads of sensitive code to the platform.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has announced plans to release a new version of ChatGPT, focused on data privacy for organizations concerned with protecting sensitive data.

Samsung has sent a memo barring employees from using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT on company-owned phones, tablets, and computers. The move came after the company discovered that its staff had uploaded sensitive source code to the OpenAI platform, generating data privacy concerns associated with artificial intelligence tools.
Samsung is concerned that data entered into platforms like ChatGPT cannot be retrieved or deleted, potentially disclosing intellectual property to unauthorized users. While generative AI tech has received widespread interest across industries, businesses must also consider the security risks associated with it.
Samsung is not the first major business to express concern against ChatGPT-like tools. Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Bank of America Corp have also restricted the use of ChatGPT for their workforce, partially or completely. The same can be said for many government bodies worldwide, including China, Italy, North Korea, and Cuba, among others, who have raised data privacy concerns.

Microsoft Set to Release Private Version of ChatGPT To Alleviate Data Security Concerns
While OpenAI’s ChatGPT is not trusted by all, Microsoft has announced plans to introduce a new version of ChatGPT, which will be hosted on the company’s dedicated Azure servers. The new offering is aimed at organizations and businesses concerned about staying compliant with regulations and preventing data leaks. It will also allow users to keep their data away from ChatGPT’s training models.
Microsoft is leveraging its multi-billion dollar investment into OpenAI to incorporate the AI model into its products, in addition to the rights to sell OpenAI products to its customers. Now it is looking to bundle its cloud computing services with ChatGPT to create a new product for niche users.
The tech giant hopes to help users adopt ChatGPT who are concerned about compromising confidential data while using AI platforms. This service is expected to cost approximately ten times more than conventional ChatGPT services. It is expected to be released by the end of the quarter. It is also expected to compete against OpenAI’s own offering, which will not use user data for training AI models.

Workplace hazards have long plagued companies, their employees and their profitability. Safety managers and teams can benefit from an AI-driven digital transformation, much like their counterparts in finance and marketing departments.







The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded 5,190 fatal work injuries in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. Additionally, there are many more non-fatal accidents in dangerous environments. The human loss and pain is unnecessary and avoidable, while the business costs are manifold. Clearly, industrial safety should be a high priority for businesses.
AI tools and techniques are applicable in many safety use cases. AI-enabled safety technologies include drones, robotics, wearables, sensors, smart equipment, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), computer vision, mobile apps and analytics software. The hardware components collect data (e.g., sensors) or execute actions (e.g., robots). Software components rely on machine learning to analyze patterns and generate insights on safety hazards.
Business leaders should assess the breadth of uses for AI technology in industrial safety. The culture and risk management policies within their businesses should also be conducive to adopting AI tech for safety purposes.

Applications of AI for industrial safety
According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in the U.S., the fundamental method to protect workers is to control their exposure to occupational hazards. The NIOSH hierarchy of controls starts with personal protective equipment (PPE). Next are organizational controls that influence how employees work, and engineering controls that isolate employees from a hazard. Finally, there are methods of substitution (replacing the hazard) and elimination (removing the hazard altogether).



The hardware components collect data (e.g., sensors) or execute actions (e.g., robots) while the software components rely on machine learning to analyze patterns and generate insights on safety hazards.




Artificial intelligence can help at each of these levels in the following ways:

Safety rules compliance and hazard identification. Workers are not always 100% compliant with PPE requirements because they find the equipment too cumbersome or take safety for granted. A computer vision solution, for example a CCTV system with AI-enabled cameras and software, can monitor designated workplace areas for PPE noncompliance.
Identifying hazardous objects. In this case, hazardous objects include debris and spills that can cause injuries. Over time, safety patterns and trends can be discerned and linked to enterprise data and used to improve safety and operating performance.


Monitoring for fatigue symptoms. Workers operating dangerous and heavy equipment or vehicles need to be alert at all times. Facial expression analysis, on-site or in-vehicle, can identify signs of fatigue or drowsiness. The employee can receive an alert and be advised to resume work after a period of rest.
Fall detection in construction. Many worker injuries in construction are due to falls. AI-powered fall detection software, often in a form as simple as a phone app, is designed for timely detection.
Site inspections using drones. Drones and autonomous vehicles can be used to monitor and inspect construction and other hazardous sites, instead of putting employees at risk.
Conversational AI for safety. Chatbots trained on safety procedures and manuals can answer employees' safety-related questions using natural language processing.
Incident reporting using voice. Using voice makes it easy for employees to report incidents. AI can transcribe spoken incident reports and extract relevant data for further analysis.
AR for equipment repair. Using AR, employees receive maintenance instructions with real-time information about diagnosis and repair.
Safety trainings in VR. Safety training is a good fit for VR, as it simulates different hazardous scenarios. Employees can practice their responses in a controlled environment.



An enterprise roadmap for industrial safety
AI and smart technologies are only one piece of the puzzle. Organizational culture and operational risk management processes are equally important.
There are both tangible and intangible costs of workplace accidents. Monetary costs include, in the U.S., Occupational Safety and Health Administration, commonly known as OSHA, violation fines; healthcare expenses for employee treatments; worker compensation claim payouts and legal costs. Less quantifiable costs include productivity losses due to medical leaves, decreases in employee morale and damage to brand reputation. Therefore, the case is strong for AI adoption in business safety scenarios. The status quo is unsustainable, and AI helps mitigate these problems.
AI is instrumental when a business needs to improve its data practices. Data-driven approaches to workplace safety are more likely to be adopted when other parts of an organization are also fostering a data-driven culture. Many organizations don't collect -- and might not have mechanisms in place to collect -- the operational and process data required to ensure worker safety. Even when data is collected, they are used for reactive reporting, not for root cause analysis or proactive improvements.
Enterprise safety and risk managers must assess their current safety practices and explore opportunities to shift away from manual, compliance-oriented approaches to data-driven, proactive ones.

				Why Writers Shouldn’t Fear Generative AI			



 

05/05/2023 
By AARON KWITTKEN






 The generative AI boom is upon us, and workers across industries have expressed concerns about job displacement. Considering the writing chops that AI tools already possess — and their ability to churn out content faster and cheaper — many writers are understandably uneasy about the future of their craft.
With all the chatter, it’d be easy to assume that ChatGPT and its generative AI siblings are on the verge of rendering writers extinct. However, they shouldn’t let apprehension get in the way of exploring AI’s potential to help them become better writers.
Instead of fearmongering, let's take a closer look at why writers should embrace generative AI.
Empty heading
The Year Ahead
If we thought 2022 was a major year for generative AI, 2023 is already blowing it out of the water. OpenAI put the whole world on notice with its release of ChatGPT late last year, sparking an AI arms race between big-name competitors like Google and Microsoft vying for superiority. Aside from the major players, tech tools of all kinds have been eager to implement AI, with new product releases on a near daily basis.
While many users began experimenting with these tools in a fun, “parlor trick” sort of fashion, it didn’t take long for the tech to begin making its way into the corporate world. As such, ChatGPT now has a “Plus” version designed for professional use, and major outlets like CNET and Sports Illustrated have embraced this tech for content creation.



Amid a perfect storm of economic factors, it’s an unfortunate truth that some writers may lose work in the coming months. The appeal of creating content faster and cheaper is clear, and some companies in this climate will jump on any opportunity to cut headcount. But chances are that many of these organizations will end up asking their axed writers to return; after a few gaffes, they’ll learn that generative AI tools are actually designed to enhance human skill rather than replace it.

AI Can’t Run the Show Itself
Generative AI tools hold the advantage when it comes to cost- and time-efficiency, but accordingly, the overall quality of the initial content tends to be lower. It harkens back to the old adage: “Fast, cheap or good? Pick two.”
The initial copy can certainly pass as “good enough” while being fast and cheap, but will it be as good as a skilled human’s? Will it be able to properly capture a particular tone of voice? Both are unlikely, but it depends on the tool.
Though quality can be subjective, there’s many objective factors to consider with fully AI-generated content. Accuracy is chief among them, as mainstream generative AI tools haven’t exactly cultivated a reputation of credibility. If a human doesn’t fact-check copy before it crosses the line, there could be major misprints.
Plus, without human touch, plagiarism would likely run rampant over time. Every organization has a reputation to uphold, and sharing bogus content always backfires sooner or later.
Human touch is especially important when dealing with serious subject matters. If fully AI-generated content lacks gravitas in times of crisis or mourning, the backlash will be severe — and rightfully so. We’ve already seen it this year, with Vanderbilt University apologizing after ChatGPT was found to be the author of a flawed email addressing the Michigan State University shooting.
As it stands, human input will remain essential for maximizing the potential (and mitigating the pitfalls) of generative AI writing tools.
 
Dynamic Duo: Writers and AI
It’s important to bear in mind that even though some tools may seem intimidating, they’re ultimately just taking spellcheck, Grammarly and other assistive tools to the next level. Humans have worked together with these tools for years — to the benefit of both parties. In this same way, generative AI can help writers improve and work more efficiently, while writers can, in turn, help the tech become more sophisticated and precise.
Of course, humans can take AI-generated copy and touch it up on the back end, but they can also input their own copy on the front end to fine-tune and find areas for improvement; these tools have an impressive ability to serve as affordable, convenient writing coaches. And aside from jumping into drafting or revising, AI can assist writers with ideation, research, search engine optimization, performance tracking and rote task automation.
In the coming years, I believe the most successful writers (and comms pros, in general) will need to recognize an inherent culture shift across the industry that sits at the intersection of art and science – essentially embracing the role of “communications engineers.”
Communications engineers use actionable analytics to drive strategy and backstop their gut instinct, utilizing generative AI and other tech to become more performative, predictive and productive. In this new era, what once took up to two hours can be done in two minutes.
Covering so many bases, these tools are going to be great for upskilling junior staff. Regardless of tech’s growing presence, writing will always remain an essential skill in the professional world, and generative AI can empower young communicators to be confident (and efficient) in their writing.
And as impressive as these tools already are, we haven’t even seen the full extent of the possibilities yet. It’s both an exciting and unnerving time to be a writer, but I have faith that humans and AI will eventually form a symbiotic relationship of sorts.
Empty heading
What’s next?
With generative AI ultimately still in its infancy — especially for professional use — now is the time for writers to begin exploring and experimenting with these tools. In doing so, writers may realize that mainstream tools such as ChatGPT aren’t always the best option for their work; it’s imperative to seek out professional tools that are specifically templated and designed for their specific job functions and needs. After writers discover the tools that work best for them, they can then find smart (and safe) ways to incorporate AI into their workflow.
To get started, writers can task their preferred tools with low-stakes exercises. Whether drafting internal-facing copy or seeking editorial assistance, writers can learn how to successfully prompt AI and appropriately adjust the output — two increasingly valuable skills in today’s world. And rather than simply generating content, it’s great practice for writers to use generative AI to punch up their existing content to be more engaging.
AI isn’t going anywhere, but neither are human writers. Therefore, the writers who get ahead of the curve and begin embracing AI will end up having an advantage over those who resist it.

AI could make the accounting profession more appealing via technology and innovation. Some accountants worry that AI will replace them, but the real opportunity is that accountants who know how to leverage AI software may someday replace those who don’t, observes Jeff Dernavich, VP of product at LeaseQuery.
Unless you’re truly living off the grid, you can’t make it through the day without seeing a headline about artificial intelligence (AI). Whether via ChatGPT, Bard, or one of the many applications leveraging its capabilities, AI is helping people with writing, shopping, personal assistant tasks, and more. As with any new development in technology, there are both opportunities and challenges ahead. As AI continues to evolve rapidly, leaders across industries will need to navigate the complexities of these tools and learn how to leverage them for the success of their companies. 
Artificial Intelligence in Accounting
There is a wide range of uses for AI in almost every industry. While there are countless ways for this new technology to change lives for the better, there are almost as many ethical considerations and concerns about human redundancy. As AI continues to become more prevalent in the accounting industry specifically, the question many accountants keep asking is, “Will AI replace me?” The short answer is no. AI will change how accountants do their jobs, but it can’t and won’t replace them. The slightly longer answer is that the real concern is that accountants who know how to leverage AI software to be more effective and efficient may someday (in the not-too-distant future) replace accountants who don’t. 
While accountants may be worried about whether they’re destined to be replaced by a machine, the more pressing issue for the accounting profession is the steadily increasing shortage of accountants. In fact, a 2022 Deloitte pollOpens a new window  found that 82% of hiring managers for accounting and financial positions at public companies and 69% at private companies said talent retention is a challenge. Because it can reduce tedious accounting work, freeing up accountants’ time to focus on higher-level tasks, implementing AI may have the potential to make job openings more appealing to younger applicants who are interested in technology and innovation.

AI Does The Drudgery
When you think of sexy career paths, accounting probably isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. And that’s because, all too often, the work has historically involved the drudgery of multi-month closing cycles, endless Excel formulas, and never-ending audits. While automation can take on some of those tasks, AI goes beyond understanding rules and can actually extract information to input it in other areas, as well as deliver a succinct summary of information to a user who would otherwise have had to read through hundreds of pages. 
AI improves accountants’ efficiency and/or may even allow non-accountants to tackle some of the “busy work” while they focus on more complex work, like managing relationships, crafting strategy, evaluating opportunities, and making strategic decisions.
AI Adds Value 
As user-friendly cloud-based software solutions become more prevalent, service providers across industries are being challenged to understand their clients’ business complexities and help them reach their goals in more strategic ways. Stats from Microsoft’s recent Economic Guardians of the Future report show 80% of finance leaders believe they and their teams are being challenged more than ever to add value beyond their standard roles and responsibilities. As accounting professionals seek more ways to work smarter, not harder, automation and AI have the potential to free people up in order to allow more collaboration and, in turn, more strategic work.
AI in Lease Accounting 
One area of the accounting industry that recently added new complexity is the lease accounting sector. ASC 842, or Topic 842, the new lease accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), governs how entities record the financial impact of their lease agreements. 
Recognized as one of the most comprehensive changes to lease accounting in decades, ASC 842 requires all public and private entities reporting under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP) to now record the vast majority of their leases to the balance sheet. This new standard was established to enhance transparency into liabilities resulting from leasing arrangements and reduce off-balance sheet activities.
So, what does all that mean for CPAs? For many, fully understanding ASC 842 has been the source of immediate frustration as they determine the implications of the updated standards and begin to implement the required changes. Over the last two years, nearly 300,000 accountants left their jobs, and last year alone, more than 40% of accounting and auditing jobs were left unfulfilled. With the heavy burden of understanding the new standards and successfully complying looming over their heads, the lease accounting industry certainly isn’t looking more attractive to new applicants either. 
This is where AI comes in – to make accountants’ lives easier. Lease accounting software that incorporates the use of AI technology reduces the number of hours spent doing repetitive and tedious tasks, while also cutting down on the potential for human error. It makes the work humans are doing more valuable by creating time for people to really think about the business and the impact of its accounting practices. 
AI in Action
We’ve talked a lot about AI from a theoretical standpoint. Now, let’s get in the weeds a little more from a product standpoint and look at what role AI actually plays in the workflow of someone managing the lease accounting process. 
If you’ve ever leased anything before, you know it usually involves a lot of printed pages that need to be initialed and signed in about 500 places. Then, after you used all the ink in your pen, that lease was probably scanned using a copier or printer, to then be uploaded and stored as an image inside a non-searchable PDF. With AI-enabled lease accounting software, users can upload a lease document that will be processed with computer vision and OCR technology to make a clean and searchable digital copy. This process alone can save hundreds of labor hours as well as make the information more accessible. 
AI technology can then use the searchable copy of the lease to accurately extract key data for validation and then input that data into the system. But, the accuracy of AI isn’t the only important factor. When used to its full potential, AI should be combined with a tailored experience that helps the user understand the lease faster than having to read the entire document and find important clauses like renewal, termination, and HVAC or maintenance  costs. Identifying those clauses means lessors and lessees can understand their responsibility and report it in the correct context. Embedding AI helps all users easily and accurately enter their leases into the product so that accounting is automated and compliance is complete. 
After the initial adoption of the new lease accounting standards, the compliance journey doesn’t end. There will always be new leases and modifications to existing ones. There is limitless potential for AI to continue cutting out tedious tasks and taking on more of the day-to-day drudgery.

AI and The Threat to Human Jobs


            Global
          

 In Nigeria, the adoption of AI is growing, with businesses, organizations, and individuals using the technology to drive innovation and improve efficiency.



 


















 
Are robots and automation taking over human jobs? It’s a question that has been on the minds of many in recent years as the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation continues to accelerate. 
While AI has the potential to bring many benefits to society, it also poses a significant threat to the jobs that humans currently perform. 
AI and Automation
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the way we live and work. In Nigeria, the adoption of AI is growing, with businesses, organizations, and individuals using the technology to drive innovation and improve efficiency.
Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term used to describe machines that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI has existed for decades, but recent advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics have lead to significant advances in the field. Automation, on the other hand, is the use of technology to conduct previously human-performed tasks.
As AI and automation become more prevalent in various industries, there are concerns that they will replace human jobs. Some experts predict that as many as 800 million jobs could be lost to automation by 2030. While these predictions may be overly pessimistic, it’s clear that the widespread adoption of AI and automation will have a significant impact on the job market.Related News:Nokia to Cut Up to 10,000 Jobs over Next Two YearsUK Unemployment Rate Rises to 4.8% as Covid-19 Hits Jobs MarketExperts Say Over Four Million Jobs Available for Nigerians with Special Tech Skills
The Impact of AI on Employment
AI has already begun to transform various industries, from healthcare to manufacturing. One of the most significant impacts of AI on employment is the automation of repetitive tasks that were previously done by humans. This includes jobs in manufacturing, such as assembly line work and quality control, as well as administrative tasks, such as data entry and customer service.
AI has also led to the creation of new jobs, such as data scientists and AI engineers. However, these jobs require a high level of technical expertise, and there are concerns that they will only be accessible to a small percentage of the population.
The Threat to Low-Skilled Jobs
One of the biggest concerns surrounding the rise of AI is the potential loss of low-skilled jobs. Jobs that require minimal education or training, such as cashiers and truck drivers, are at the highest risk of automation. These jobs are also typically low-paying and have little job security, making it difficult for those who lose their jobs to transition into new careers.
While some argue that automation will create new jobs, it’s unlikely that these jobs will be accessible to those who lose their low-skilled jobs. The skills required for these new jobs are often highly specialized and require significant education and training.
The Threat to High-Skilled Jobs
High-skilled jobs may be less likely to be replaced by automation, however they are not immune to the impact of AI. Many jobs that require a high level of education and training, such as doctors and lawyers, are already being impacted by AI. For example, AI can now analyze medical images and provide diagnoses, reducing the need for radiologists. Similarly, AI-powered legal research tools are changing the way lawyers work.
While these developments may make these jobs more efficient, they also pose a threat to job security. As AI becomes more advanced, it’s likely that it will be able to perform more complex tasks, which could lead to the replacement of high-skilled jobs.
The Role of Government
The adoption of AI in Nigeria is still in its early stages, but the potential benefits are significant. By leveraging AI technologies, Nigeria can drive economic growth and development, improve access to healthcare and education, and create new jobs.
To fully realize the potential of AI, Nigeria must address the challenges of infrastructure, technical expertise, and job displacement. By investing in these areas, Nigeria can position itself as a leader in AI and drive innovation and growth for years to come.
As AI continues to impact the job market, there is a growing call for governments to take action. Some experts have suggested that a universal basic income could be a solution to the job displacement caused by automation. This would provide everyone with a basic income, regardless of whether they have a job or not.
The called for increased investment in education and training programs to ensure that people have the skills cannot be over-emphasized.

His comments appeared to rattle the audience of some of the nation’s top tech creators and AI developers.Asked by the panel’s moderator what was the “worst case scenario that you think is conceivable,” Hinton replied without hesitation. “I think it's quite conceivable,"" he said, ""that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence.”Hinton then offered an extremely detailed scientific explanation of why that's the case -- an explanation that would be undecipherable to anyone but an AI creator like himself. Then, reverting to plain English, he said that he and other AI creators have essentially created an immortal form of digital intelligence that might be shut off on one machine to bring it under control. But it could easily be brought “back to life” on another machine if given the proper instructions, he said.”And it may keep us around for a while to keep the power stations running. But after that, maybe not,” Hinton said. “So the good news is we figured out how to build beings that are immortal. ''''But that immortality,"" he said, ''is not for us.”The British-Canadian computer scientist and cognitive psychologist has spent the past several decades at Google, most recently as a vice president and Google Engineering Fellow. He announced his departure in a May 1 article in the New York Times, and has since given several interviews about how artificial intelligence constructs could soon overtake the level of information that a human brain holds, and possibly grow out of control.Hinton also stressed in a tweet that he did not leave Google in order to criticize it. ""Actually, I left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google,"" Hinton said. ""Google has acted very responsibly.""On Wednesday, he gave a more measured response, saying Google, Microsoft and other developers of AI platforms designed to make them accessible to the general public are living in an economically competitive world where if they don’t develop it, somebody else will. Governments will have the same problem, he said, given all of the extraordinary things they will be able to do with artificial intelligence.Hinton singled out China on several occasions, saying it will continue to develop AI because of its rush toward global domination, even if the U.S. Congress and the Biden administration push through some restrictions that they are contemplating.""I think if you take the existential risk seriously, as I now do – I used to think it was way off, but I now think it's serious and fairly close – it might be quite sensible to just stop developing these things any further,” Hinton said. “But I think it's completely naive to think that would happen.”“Even if the U.S. stops developing it, the Chinese won't,” he said. “They're going to be used in weapons. And just for that reason alone, governments aren't going to stop developing.”On Thursday, the Biden administration is set to roll out a new set of actions aimed at promoting responsible innovation in artificial intelligence while protecting the rights and safety of Americans.A senior administration official said managing the risks of AI is at the core of the new effort, given the threat it poses to a broad array of applications. Those include hacking into autonomous vehicles and other AI-driven entities, risks to privacy such as enabling real-time surveillance and the potential for job displacement from automation, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss administration efforts.Not every expert agrees AI will destroy usNot everyone agrees with Hinton’s most dire predictions, including in some cases Hinton himself. In a tweet Wednesday, he acknowledged that he was dealing, to some degree, with hypotheticals. “It's possible that I am totally wrong about digital intelligence overtaking us,” he said. “Nobody really knows, which is why we should worry now.”Other computer security experts downplayed Hinton’s concerns, saying that artificial intelligence is basically an extremely sophisticated programming platform that can only go so far as humans allow it.It cannot, for instance, become the kind of sentient, self-aware and all-knowing technology that created the Terminator of movie fame, according to Michael Hamilton, a co-founder of the Critical Insight risk management firm and former vice-chair of the Department of Homeland Security’s State, Local, Tribal and Territorial Government Coordinating Council.“I think everybody needs to take a step back here and get away from the hyperbole, because we don't know that this is going to turn into Skynet,” Hamilton told USA TODAY, referring to the artificial intelligence system that destroys humanity in the Terminator movie franchise. “Everybody's saying AI is going to become sentient or whatever. No, it's not. It’s a computer. It does what you tell it to do.”Simple reasoning, or thinking like a humanAI is not fully there yet, Hinton said on Wednesday, but it is making such rapid progress that he began to get frightened during the past several months.Currently, he said, AI has an approximate IQ of about 80 or 90, but developers could conceivably raise that to an IQ of 210. That's more intelligent than only a handful of humans on the planet. Already, he said, AI's ability to do ""simple reasoning"" has startled him.For example, he said, he told an AI platform that his house had rooms that were painted white, blue and yellow, and that the yellow walls were fading to white color.“So what should I do if I want all the walls to be white in two years time?” he said he asked in an AI query. “And it said you should paint all the blue rooms yellow. That's not the natural solution. But it works right?”“That's pretty impressive, common-sense reasoning of the kind that it's been very hard to get AI to do” until recently, he added, because it incorporated into its answer the concept of fading paint and also the passage of time.Rapid advancement, and taking controlHinton says he is worried about the rapid – even astonishing – pace at which AI is advancing and surpassing the most ambitious expectations of many experts in the field. He believes that there is significant potential for AI to become much smarter than humans, allowing it to excel at manipulation and pose a serious threat in a variety of ways.If AI continues on its trajectory and surpasses human intelligence, he said, it could become extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control.A more intelligent entity being controlled by a less intelligent one is uncommon, he said, which means that AI could find ways to bypass restrictions on its activities – and its access to technology – and eventually manipulate people to serve its own purposes.AI's ability to soak up knowledge and data from humans and vast stores of information raises serious concerns about its potential to manipulate people by spreading misinformation, Hinton said.If and when AI becomes significantly smarter and more knowledgeable, Hinton says, it could use this advantage to deceive people and make them believe things that aren’t true.""These things will have learned from us, by reading all the novels that ever were and everything Machiavelli ever wrote, how to manipulate people,"" Hinton said. ""You won't realize what's going on. You'll be like a two-year old who's being asked do you want the peas or the cauliflower and doesn't realize that you don't have to have either.""And, he warned, ""It turns out if you can manipulate people, you can invade a building in Washington without ever going there yourself.""Helping the rich get richer and the poor get poorerHinton, joining a chorus of other Big Tech experts, said he is concerned about how AI could put potentially huge numbers of people out of work and cause wholesale job displacements in certain industries.That, combined with its potential for disinformation, could result in many vulnerable people being manipulated and not being able to discern truth from falsehood. That, in turn, could lead to societal disruption and economic and political consequences.There are many ways in which AI will make things better for companies and even workers, who will benefit from its ability to churn out letters and respond to large volumes of email or queries.""It's going to cause huge increases in productivity,"" Hinton said. ""My worry is for those increases in productivity are going to go to putting people out of work and making the rich richer and the poor poorer. And as you do that, as you make that gap bigger, society gets more and more violent.""Another concern of Hinton’s, he said, is the potential for humans with malicious intent to misuse AI technology for their own purposes, such as making weapons, inciting violence or manipulating elections.That’s one of the reasons he wants to play a role in establishing policies for the responsible use of AI, including the consideration of ethical implications.""I don't think there's much chance of stopping development. What we want is some way of making sure that even if they're smarter than us, they're going to do things that are beneficial for us,"" he said. ""But we need to try and do that in a world where there's bad actors who want to build robot soldiers that kill people.""No obvious solutions to AI problemsHinton stresses he retired from Google not to criticize it or other AI developers, but so he can have the freedom to openly discuss the risks associated with artificial intelligence and related technologies like machine learning. He said in his talk Wednesday that he believes it is important to address AI safety issues – and to foster efforts to ensure that it has a positive impact on society – without constraints from corporate interests.Asked what developers should do to minimize the chances of potentially catastrophic evolution of AI, Hinton apologized and said he has no good answers.""It seems very hard to me. So, I'm sorry. I'm sounding the alarm and saying we have to worry about this. And I wish I had a nice simple solution I can push but I don't,"" Hinton said. ""But I think it's very important that people get together and think hard about it and see whether there is a solution. It's not clear there is a solution.""2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026With no annual fee & no interest for 18 months, these cards are helping Americans pay off debt in record time.CompareCredit.com | AdAdRead MoreUndoFlight Attendant Shows How To Fly Business Class For The Price of EconomyAmericans, you'll want to check this out ASAPOnline Shopping Tools | AdAdUndoUS Government is Providing Free Covid Test Kits Again, Get Yours Now Before They Are All Gone AgainSearch your address to see free test kit availability instantlyFree Covid Test | AdAdUndoHere's an Estimated Cost for a One-Day Walk-in ShowerHomeBuddy | AdAdUndoPaw Licking Driving You Crazy?

LLMs are an advanced form of generative AI that are the basis for generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) platforms, such as ChatGPT. LLMs can process and generate natural language text in a seemingly human manner. To use ChatGPT (and similar platforms), a user types in a research question or requests information, sometimes based on documents, images, or other information the user provides, and ChatGPT provides a response written in natural language, as if a human had written it.LLMs are trained by using vast amounts of data from a range of sources, including books, blogs, news articles, Wikipedia information, social media posts, and other website content. LLMs are general purpose models that “understand” a wide variety of domains and language constructs because of the diversity of the data on which they are trained. LLMs are capable of a multitude of functions, including searching and retrieving information, drafting and summarizing content, and answering both broad and narrow questions. It is important to recognize that when generative AI is producing a response to a prompt, it is predicting (based on its knowledge of language patterns) what words are most likely to come next in response to the prompt. It is a tool optimized to synthesize content, not necessarily to recall facts — this is what distinguishes it from the popular search engines that are in common use.GPT-4 can, for example, to a surprisingly impressive standard:Explain quantum computing in simple terms.Perform tasks such as writing code for an application.Summarize an academic research paper.Create study questions for a school subject.Draft a screenplay.Perhaps most impressively, GPT can also iterate on content it has generated. For example, after drafting a screenplay, it can take feedback from the user and make the play more dramatic or humorous, or introduce a specific character, based on new prompts.Practical Law The JournalRegister for FREE to continue readingFree and easy registration gives you unlimited access to Practical Law The Journal.RegisterAlready have an account?

           When will artificial intelligence answer emails? Experts weigh in on how the technology will affect work The future of work will be impacted by artificial intelligence, experts predicted  Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By  Kendall Tietz  FOXBusiness     close  Global healthcare is at the ‘beginning’ of a ‘complete revolution’: Michael Milken , Milken Institute Chairman Michael Milken joined ‘Mornings with Maria’ to discuss the future of A.I. health care and the Federal Reserve forecasting a ‘mild recession’ later this year. The future of work could be dominated by artificial intelligence, industry leaders said in Las Angeles this week, predicting it could even take over tasks like answering emails.  While concerns about developments in artificial intelligence harming jobs, Ambereen Toubassy, the chief financial officer of Airtable, said she sees AI as an addition and enhancement to the workday, rather than a replacement. ""We're really excited about AI and we think AI changes fundamentally what people do [and] how they do it,"" she said on a panel at the Milken Institute's Global Conference. ""It should help remove routine and repetitive tasks and focus more on critical thinking and creative thinking. We're excited about helping our customers, help their employees really deploy and take advantage of AI."" ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT AI      Panelists agreed there will likely be some substitution of work by AI, but that it will mostly compliment people to help them do their work faster.  (iStock / iStock)Toubassy admitted that there will likely be some substitution of work by AI, but that it will mostly compliment people to help them do their work faster. IS AI ADA COMPLIANT?""It helps you learn quickly and deploy yourself to more interesting work,"" she added. ""I actually am pretty optimistic about the fact that people will do more interesting work over time thanks to AI, as opposed to not have work.""Lord Abbett CEO, Doug Sieg, echoed this sentiment, arguing that jobs will become more dynamic and interesting as the pace of technological change continues. BARI WEISS CONFRONTS MEDIA BOSEES DURING PANEL: NEWS ORGS SHOULD ‘APOLOGIZE FOR THINGS THAT THEY GOT WRONG’""It makes what are mundane jobs, better jobs,"" he said. ""I don't think it gets rid of people necessarily, but I think it gives them more fulfilling roles. Longer term, I think there's more flexibility.""Igor Tulchinsky, the Founder, Chairman and CEO of WorldQuant, said AI will allow people to get from point A to point B in their daily tasks much faster and explained that point B could actually be something different from what was originally devised because AI has new ideas.     Experts expect the accuracy of AI to continue to go up, reaching as high as 99.99%, but warned it is never going to hit 100%. (Reuters / Dado Ruvic / Illustration / Reuters Photos)CNBC's Brian Sullivan, who moderated the panel, explained that he gets hundreds of emails a day and asked panelists when AI will be advanced enough to respond to his emails in his voice and manner. ""It can do it now, you just have to be prepared, that's all,"" Tulchinsky responded. ""Generally it can get about 80% of the content correct. So in theory, you only need to spend 20% of the time doing equal amount of work.""""Occasionally you'll get an email that you kind of don't know how to respond to because something happens or it's an unusual circumstance … the AI will know how to respond, it knows the proper etiquette, it knows what to say, you just have to go through it, make sure it's kosher."" LANDMARK SUPREME COURT CASE COULD HAVE ‘FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS’ FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, EXPERTS SAYHe said the accuracy of AI will continue to go up, reaching as high as 99.99%, but warned it is never going to hit 100% because AI ""simply doesn't know everything.""""People always think of it as a replacement, it's not it in the end,"" he said. ""In a human conversation, in the way we communicate, some parts are actually mechanical and redundant, so it can generate that part and leave you with special human touch that's so valuable.""From a financial standpoint, Sieg explained that analysts and portfolio managers make money by judgment, so it would be difficult to rely on a computer for human judgment calls on buy and sell decisions.      Panelists explained that AI allows you to do more complex tasks, analyzing three or four things at a time, while an individual can only look at one.  ((Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images) / Getty Images)""I think they [employees] become better by partnering with a tool that can make them smarter, but I don't think it replaces them from that standpoint, not in our business.""In contrast, Rodney McMullen, the Chairman and CEO of The Kroger Co., said AI allows you to do more complex tasks, analyzing three or four things at a time, while an individual can only look at one. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""We're about to see some major transformations arising from the fact that companies up until now had so much information, but no way for the information to be integrated and to be seen by any single entity and to be seen as a whole,"" Tulchinsky said. ""One thing that it can do is it can take a tremendous amount of information, digest it [and] summarize it. The insight of what's going on actually in the companies is increasing, which leads to better jobs, more satisfaction and much higher productivity.""

So in theory, you only need to spend 20% of the time doing equal amount of work.&quot; &quot;Occasionally you&apos;ll get an email that you kind of don&apos;t know how to respond to because something happens or it&apos;s an unusual circumstance &#x2026; the AI will know how to respond, it knows the proper etiquette, it knows what to say, you just have to go through it, make sure it&apos;s kosher.&quot;&#xA0; LANDMARK SUPREME COURT CASE COULD HAVE &#x2018;FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS&#x2019; FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, EXPERTS SAY He said the accuracy of AI will continue to go up, reaching as high as 99.99%, but warned it is never going to hit 100% because AI &quot;simply doesn&apos;t know everything.&quot; &quot;People always think of it as a replacement, it&apos;s not it in the end,&quot; he said. &quot;In a human conversation, in the way we communicate, some parts are actually mechanical and redundant, so it can generate that part and leave you with special human touch that&apos;s so valuable.&quot; From a financial standpoint, Sieg explained that analysts and portfolio managers make money by judgment, so it would be difficult to rely on a computer for human judgment calls on buy and sell decisions.&#xA0;  &quot;I think they [employees] become better by partnering with a tool that can make them smarter, but I don&apos;t think it replaces them from that standpoint, not in our business.&quot; In contrast, Rodney McMullen, the Chairman and CEO of The Kroger Co., said AI allows you to do more complex tasks, analyzing three or four things at a time, while an individual can only look at one.&#xA0; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP &quot;We&apos;re about to see some major transformations arising from the fact that companies up until now had so much information, but no way for the information to be integrated and to be seen by any single entity and to be seen as a whole,&quot; Tulchinsky said. &quot;One thing that it can do is it can take a tremendous amount of information, digest it [and] summarize it. The insight of what&apos;s going on actually in the companies is increasing, which leads to better jobs, more satisfaction and much higher productivity.&quot;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-04-20T09:43:18-04:00,https://vod.foxbusiness.com/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/854081161001/c6378a55-a165-4ae5-a0da-50d70d90f68a/c497ff16-cfdf-4034-b06b-31f44f881f68/main.mp4,,PT12M19S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/ceo-real-estate-investor-says-democratic-party-he-grew-up-no-longer-about-regular-people-all-sham', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358859439112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/great-resignation-2-0-horizon-3-10-workers-planning-quit-2024-survey-shows', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/dennis-quaid-says-ronald-reagans-story-exemplified-what-we-need-get-nation-back-to', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/stuart-varney-democrats-face-unholy-scramble-replace-biden-he-steps-aside', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/billionaire-democrat-real-estate-investor-unintended-consequences-bidens-rent-cap-proposal', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/economist-warns-americans-over-bidens-potential-tax-hikes-scary', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/larry-kudlow-world-see-trumps-toughness', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/speaker-johnson-prepared-call-biden-fire-secret-service-director-kimberly-cheatle', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/oil-industry-giant-slams-bidens-absurd-policies-explains-how-trump-can-set-iran-russia-back']",

IBM plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) to replace 7,800 jobs over the next five years, CEO Arvind Krishna said in an interview, sparking fears of widespread job losses across industries.
“Comments, such as the ones Arvind made, validate the claims that AI can reduce support jobs and hence costs for the company. It will set the direction for other enterprises to look for similar opportunities in their support functions,” said Pareekh Jain, lead analyst at Pareekh Consulting.
IBM CEO on Tuesday told Bloomberg that the company was looking to cut down hiring for roles that could be replaced with AI.











 
 
 
These 26,000 roles, which are essentially non-customer facing jobs, include back office functions such as HR, the CEO said, adding that 30% of such roles, or approximately 7,800 jobs could be replaced with AI or automation over the next five years.

AI will replace 85 million jobs globally by 2025, according to The World Economic Forum’s The Future of Jobs report. While the report also predicts that AI may create 97 million new roles, it points out that the jobs AI will create will not be the same as the ones being lost.
IBM’s strategy to turn to AI is a good workforce strategy
Krishna’s comments on AI replacing humans come just months after the company said it would cut 3,900 jobs or 1.5% of its workforce. However, analysts believe it is high time mundane tasks are replaced with AI.











 
 
 
“If IBM is pausing 7,800 jobs that AI could do, it would be a good move for the company, as I wouldn’t think it was a good strategy to hire positions that could have been easily done by AI and automation in the first place,” said Lily Phan, research director at IDC.
In March, IBM spin-off and managed IT services provider Kyndryl said it was “eliminating” a small percentage of global roles in search of efficiency. The layoffs at Kyndryl were followed by job cuts at another IBM-owned firm, RedHat.
Large technology companies such as IBM have continued to reduce their headcount in search of efficiency and cost reduction in the wake of reducing revenue after they went on a hiring binge during the pandemic when lockdowns sparked a tech buying spree to support remote work and an uptick in e-commerce.











 
 
 
Jain cautioned that the IBM CEO’s comments were more of a hope than a plan.
“This is just an approximation and extrapolation of current trends for the next five years. The actual numbers might not be that much or might take longer than five years. We don’t know what challenges will come up in scaling these early pilots around AI or AI implementation,” Jain said. “What Arvind has said is that he expects a 30% reduction in the next five years in the HR department headcount because of AI. At this point, I think it is a hope, not a plan.”
Mundane tasks will see automation
Giving examples of roles that are likely to be impacted in the next five years, Krishna said that mundane tasks such as employee verification or moving employees from one department to the other will be fully automated while other tasks such as measuring productivity would stay relevant for the next decade.











 
 
 
The roles that are likely to be impacted globally, according to analysts, don’t require human intelligence at all.
“What Arvind is talking about are the routine jobs that don’t require analysis and judgment and only require accessing information, transactions, and updating. These jobs are at risk as there is not much concern about bias or hallucinations,” Jain said.
“In fact, AI and automation have been impacting routine jobs slowly for quite some time like we see IVR [interactive voice response] or chatbot in customer support for information access and complaints. What generative AI has done is accelerated this development.”











 
 
 
Some analysts are more optimistic than others when it comes to the impact of AI on jobs. The scare of losing jobs to AI, according to IDC’s Phan, could be compared with the time when robots came to the fore.
“The same fears that robots would take up people’s jobs happened a few years ago, but in fact, we are having more jobs today than before. AI’s replacement of jobs would help to do mundane and manual tasks and leave more bespoke/customized tasks to employees that require human skills, relationships, connections, and emotional quotient,” Phan said.
Not all jobs will not be taken over by AI and its proliferation will see the creation of highly skilled jobs, added Deepika Giri, IDC’s head of AI research.











 
 
 
 “Although the looming anxiety around job losses is prevalent, it only will push the workforce to be re-aligned and trained with more relevant skill sets.”

If you ask them the questions in the right manner is where AI can actually help,"" Bhattacharya told IANS recently.According to a report by global investment bank Goldman Sachs, AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs and Generative AI, able to create content indistinguishable from human work, is ""a major advancement"".You Might Also Like:Indian job market to see 22 pc churn in 5 yrs; AI, machine learning among top roles: WEFGlobal technology company Zoho's CEO and co-founder Sridhar Vembu said that AI poses a serious threat to several programming jobs.Referring to the conversational AI platforms like ChatGPT and others, Vembu said that he has been saying internally for the past 4-5 years that ""ChatGPT, GPT4, and other AI being created today will first affect the jobs of many programmers"".According to Carl Benedikt Frey, future-of-work director at the Oxford Martin School, Oxford University, the only thing he is sure of is that ""there is no way of knowing how many jobs will be replaced by generative AI"".""What ChatGPT does, for example, is allow more people with average writing skills to produce essays and articles. Journalists will therefore face more competition, which would drive down wages, unless we see a very significant increase in the demand for such work,"" Frey told BBC News.You Might Also Like:IBM to pause hiring in plan to replace 7,800 jobs with AIResearchers from the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI, the developer behind ChatGPT, recently investigated the potential implications of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs), on the US labour market.The findings revealed that around 80 per cent of the workforce could have at least 10 per cent of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19 per cent of workers may see at least 50 per cent of their tasks impacted.""We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software,"" the researchers noted.Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth.""Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15 per cent of all worker tasks could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56 per cent of all tasks,"" they warned.Jobs in agriculture, mining and manufacturing are the least exposed to generative AI, while jobs in the information processing industries, like IT, are the most exposed to AI models, the study said.The World Economic Forum also predicts that AI will bring three changes to the finance division: job cuts, job creation, and increased efficiency.Banks have already started incorporating AI into their business models. Morgan Stanley has begun using OpenAI-powered chatbots to organise its wealth management database.Kristian Hammond, chief scientist of Natural Sciences, told the BBC that in 15 years, ""90 per cent of news will be written by machines"".Some tech firms have started hiring ""prompt managers"" to help with certain office tasks via AI chatbots.AI appears to be fast turning into a monster that will knock at our doors any time and according to experts, it is pertinent for the future workforce to learn AI skills.    by Taboolaby TaboolaSponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikePlastic Surgeon: Fighting “Turkey Neck” After 60 Comes Down To This 1 ThingDon't let ""Turkey Neck"" make you look 10-15 years older than you actually are.Beverly Hills MDUndoIt's true drivers with daytime headlights should know this (Hint: it saves many money)Why haven't insurers told drivers this?

The arrival of ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AGI) models have sparked a real, and bigger threat.What began as a conversational tool via prompts is likely to replace human workers doing certain jobs, beginning with industries like IT/software/tech and media/creative agencies and new-age platforms serving the digital economy.However, it is still early days for AI -- trained on large language models (LLMs) -- to take away jobs across the spectrum amid larger scrutiny but specific clues have emerged.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg in an interview this week:  I could easily see 30 per cent of jobs getting replaced by AI and automation over a five-year period. The tech giant has around 26,000 workers so nearly 7,800 jobs could be replaced by AI in the coming years.However, this transition won't be immediate and IBM will first pause hiring for those roles it deems could be replaced by AI, particularly those for back-office or non-customer facing roles, said its CEO.According to Arundhati Bhattacharya, CEO and Chairperson for Salesforce India and a former SBI Chairperson, generative artificial intelligence has a blessing in disguise as it can take away a lot of the grunge or repetitive work in India, and leave people to actually perform more creative work. What generative AI actually will help us do is actually curate things so that they can be made relevant to us. If you ask them the questions in the right manner is where AI can actually help,  Bhattacharya told IANS recently.According to a report by global investment bank Goldman Sachs, AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs and Generative AI, able to create content indistinguishable from human work, is  a major advancement .Global technology company Zoho's CEO and co-founder Sridhar Vembu said that AI poses a serious threat to several programming jobs.Referring to the conversational AI platforms like ChatGPT and others, Vembu said that he has been saying internally for the past 4-5 years that  ChatGPT, GPT4, and other AI being created today will first affect the jobs of many programmers .According to Carl Benedikt Frey, future-of-work director at the Oxford Martin School, Oxford University, the only thing he is sure of is that  there is no way of knowing how many jobs will be replaced by generative AI . What ChatGPT does, for example, is allow more people with average writing skills to produce essays and articles. Journalists will therefore face more competition, which would drive down wages, unless we see a very significant increase in the demand for such work,  Frey told BBC News.Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI, the developer behind ChatGPT, recently investigated the potential implications of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs), on the US labour market.The findings revealed that around 80 per cent of the workforce could have at least 10 per cent of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19 per cent of workers may see at least 50 per cent of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software,  the researchers noted.Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15 per cent of all worker tasks could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56 per cent of all tasks,  they warned.Jobs in agriculture, mining and manufacturing are the least exposed to generative AI, while jobs in the information processing industries, like IT, are the most exposed to AI models, the study said.The World Economic Forum also predicts that AI will bring three changes to the finance division: job cuts, job creation, and increased efficiency.Banks have already started incorporating AI into their business models. Morgan Stanley has begun using OpenAI-powered chatbots to organise its wealth management database.Kristian Hammond, chief scientist of Natural Sciences, told the BBC that in 15 years,  90 per cent of news will be written by machines .Some tech firms have started hiring  prompt managers  to help with certain office tasks via AI chatbots.AI appears to be fast turning into a monster that will knock at our doors any time and according to experts, it is pertinent for the future workforce to learn AI skills.",en,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76939477,width-600,height-60,quality-100/economictimes.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential rate. Many leaders are scrambling to embrace this software revolution by integrating with AI-enabled plug-ins or incorporating AI-powered technology into their own enterprise platforms. 
4 Ways Generative AI Will Transform Software DevelopmentIncrease the use of low code solutions. 
Integrated AI will streamline cybersecurity efforts.
Accelerate digital transformations and improve remote work.
AI tools will become more effective through developer use.

Some leaders are concerned about the potentially significant impact of AI on human roles and have signed an open letter calling for a pause on the development of generative AI. One thing is clear: We are in the midst of a pivotal shift in software development and workflows across all industries. 
For developers, the emergence of generative AI’s language learning model will revolutionize code creation and become one of the most important tools for developers. Below are some of the ways that generative AI will benefit developers, improve security measures and lead to digital transformation. 
 
How Generative AI Will Benefit Developers 
As AI becomes more integrated into development tools and workflows, it will increase development speed, efficiency, creativity and accuracy. AI will become second-nature to developers and their processes throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC), as it continues to become embedded and incorporated within the tools and workflows that developers use daily. Additionally, AI can automate tasks, playing a valuable role in addressing the ongoing challenges of talent shortages in organizations and quality control. 
Code production and code editing are two areas in which AI automation has truly benefited developers. Automatically generated code from AI is much like some of the writing we have seen from ChatGPT. It’s useful, speedily produced and requires human oversight to check the end results. Still, AI produced code cuts down on development time and helps reduce the potential for human error. AI assistance in code editing programs increases the speed with which we find and correct errors, a true asset in shortening the software development life cycle.
Due to recent bouts of tech layoffs and general economic uncertainty in the tech world, many development teams are facing significant pressure. What used to be handled by large teams in the past has now been condensed to a few highly skilled workers who are responsible for managing the workload of the entire team. This can sometimes result in tasks being deprioritized and developer burnout as engineers work extra hours to compensate for the reduced team size. Whether it’s editing code or automating administrative tasks such as testing, monitoring and checking for updates, AI can alleviate some of that pressure and free developers up to focus on more creative tasks.
AI tools that automate tasks will also help smaller developer teams scale their operations and compete with enterprises. Streamlining repetitive tasks will free their developers up to focus on more unique and differentiating solutions.

How Generative AI Will Improve Cybersecurity Measures
Cybersecurity AI is an area that will ultimately strengthen the internal processes within organizations. Incorporating security measures into the software development life-cycle (SDLC) is a crucial part of software development. However, many developers and cybersecurity professionals often struggle to shift left and focus on security early in the process. 
Once AI has been trained properly on security measures, it can help companies ensure compliance as the code is being written, resulting in stronger applications from the outset. As security becomes more integrated within the SDLC, developers will have more time to focus on the creative aspects of app ideation. 
Additionally, talent shortages can lead to an overwhelming workload and increase the potential for exposing vulnerabilities, which could result in a security breach. Generative AI and automation provide developers with confidence that their internal security systems are consistently being monitored for suspicious activity. 
In particular, generative AI can be used to create customized security models. These models can be trained on large data sets of historical security data to identify patterns and anomalies that may be indicative of a potential threat. Automation can then be used to implement these models in real-time, allowing for rapid detection and response to security threats. With this in place, vulnerability management won’t fall through the cracks.

4 Ways Generative AI Will Shape Software Development
DevOps will continue to evolve along with AI by becoming more mature and integrated into existing tools. For example, developers currently utilize IntelliCode, which is an AI-powered tool that recommends auto-completions during programming based on project analysis. 
Below are some more software development changes generative AI will create: 
 
1. Increase the Use of Low-Code Solutions. 
By taking advantage of mature software development kits (SDKs) and libraries like LEADTOOLS, developers and organizations will be able to integrate the eyes of AI into their applications. Other low-code tools and platforms such as Microsoft Power Apps and Google App Maker will also benefit from AI. 
Even less experienced developers will be able to quickly and efficiently build products and solutions with very powerful features, without requiring the extensive coding expertise and experience that would be needed otherwise. Additionally, this eliminates the need to hire more developers to maintain their products since that work can be offloaded to the SDK partner. 
 
2. Integrated AI Will STreamline Cybersecurity Efforts
The rise of remote work and digital transformation exposes more security vulnerabilities, as nefarious bad actors are also using generative AI to write malicious code. AI could be used to monitor network traffic and identify suspicious patterns or behaviors that could indicate a security breach. Most security companies are already working on AI and machine learning solutions to detect and prevent these threats.
 
3. Accelerate Digital Transformations and Improve Remote Work 
COVID-19 forced many organizations to rapidly adopt digital technologies and accelerate their capabilities by five-to-10 years. This acceleration will continue as more developers embrace the remote or hybrid lifestyle, and businesses will be required to adapt and stay competitive in the software market. 
Automating tedious and repetitive tasks will free up employees working remotely to focus on more complex and high-value work. Doing so will improve overall efficiency and productivity. AI-powered virtual assistants that manage schedules and prioritize tasks may also enhance the remote work experience.
 
4. AI Tools Will Become More Effective Through Developer Use
As AI solutions become more integrated into everyday processes and workflows, users will accelerate the growth of the algorithms with more data and feedback. Data sets will expand with consistent feedback and contribute to the maturity of this technology. Even the most incremental updates will seem monumental as this technology continues to evolve. 
As developers discover the benefits of incorporating generative AI into their workflows, their roles will likely shift. New technologies like this should be embraced, rather than feared. 
While every new technology needs regulation and refinement, AI is the next logical step in software development. From smaller companies being able to scale their products and compete with larger enterprises to the average developer streamlining their workflows, the opportunities for growth with AI are exponential. AI is simply another powerful tool in the developer’s toolbox and will increasingly become integrated into the core foundations of software development.

The man known as the ""godfather of artificial intelligence"" quit his job at Google so he could freely speak about the dangers of AI, the New York Times reported Monday.  Geoffrey Hinton, who worked with Google and mentors AI's rising stars, started looking at artificial intelligence more than 40 years ago, he told ""CBS Mornings"" in late March. He started working for the company in 2013, according to his Google Research profile. While at Google, he designed machine learning algorithms.""I left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google,"" Hinton tweeted Monday. ""Google has acted very responsibly."" 






Many developers are working toward creating artificial general intelligence. Until recently, Hinton said he thought the world was 20-50 years away from it, but he now thinks developers ""might be"" close to computers being able to come up with ideas to improve themselves. ""That's an issue, right? We have to think hard about how you control that,"" he said in March.

Hinton has called for people to figure out how to manage technology that could greatly empower a handful of governments or companies.


""I think it's very reasonable for people to be worrying about these issues now, even though it's not going to happen in the next year or two,"" Hinton said. Hinton also told CBS he thought it wasn't inconceivable that AI could try to wipe out humanity.When asked about Hinton's decision to leave, Google's chief scientist Jeff Dean told BBC News in a statement that the company remains committed to a responsible approach to AI.""We're continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly,"" he said.


Google CEO Sundar Pichai has called for AI advancements to be released in a responsible way. In an April interview with ""60 Minutes,"" he said society needed to quickly adapt and come up with regulations for AI in the economy, along with laws to punish abuse.""This is why I think the development of this needs to include not just engineers, but social scientists, ethicists, philosophers and so on,"" Pichai told 60 Minutes. ""And I think we have to be very thoughtful. And I think these are all things society needs to figure out as we move along. It's not for a company to decide.""

The largest absolute growth is expected in education, agriculture and digital commerce.“For people around the world, the past three years have been filled with upheaval and uncertainty for their lives and livelihoods, with COVID-19, geopolitical and economic shifts; and the rapid advancement of AI and other technologies are now risks adding more uncertainty,” says Saadia Zahidi, MD of the WEF.“The good news is that there is a clear way forward to ensure resilience. Governments and businesses must invest in supporting the shift to the jobs of the future through the education, reskilling and social support structures that can ensure individuals are at the heart of the future of work.”While technology continues to pose challenges and opportunities to labour markets, employers expect most technologies to contribute positively to job creation.According to the People’s Charter on Jobs in Africa, heavy investments in the technology and digital industries could see the creation of at least 15 million new jobs in Africa by 2025.Dr Suzanne Gildert, SingularityU faculty member in robotics and AI, believes human-like robots, which have the capability to accrue abilities, skills and knowledge the same way humans do, will in the long-term replace every job under the sun, as a result of advancements in robotics.According to The Future of Jobs Report 2023, the fastest-growing roles are being driven by big dataDATAData Sciences: Your Partner in Innovative IT Solutions. Transforming Data into Strategic Value. Visit us today! and AI, which are expected to create the highest number of future jobs, with 75% of survey respondents expecting job growth in this area.The employment of data analysts and scientists, big data specialists, AI machine learning specialists and cyber security professionals is expected to grow on average by 30% by 2027.“AI, a key driver of potential algorithmic displacement, is expected to be adopted by nearly 75% of surveyed companies and is expected to lead to high churn – with 50% of organisations expecting it to create job growth and 25% expecting it to create job losses,” it says.Training workers to utilise AI and big data will be prioritised by 42% of surveyed companies in the next five years, ranking behind analytical thinking (48%) and creative thinking (43%) in importance.This, as IBM announced this week that it expects to pause hiring for as many as 7 800 jobs, which could be replaced by AI in the coming years.Digital commerce will lead to the largest absolute gains in jobs: approximately two million new digitally-enabled roles are expected, such as e-commerce specialists, digital transformation specialists, and digital marketing and strategy specialists, notes the report.“But while expectations of the displacement of physical and manual work by machines has decreased, reasoning, communicating and coordinating – all traits with a comparative advantage for humans – are expected to be more automatable in the future.”Urgent reskilling, upskillingCompanies report that skills gaps and an inability to attract talent are the key barriers to transformation, showing a clear need for training and reskilling across industries, says the WEF.Six in 10 workers will require training before 2027, but only half of employees are seen to have access to adequate training opportunities today. At the same time, the report estimates that, on average, 44% of an individual worker’s skills will need to be updated.Strong cognitive skills are increasingly valued by employers, reflecting the growing importance of complex problem-solving in the workplace. The most important skills for workers in 2023 are seen to be analytical thinking and creative thinking, and this is expected to remain so in the next five years.“Our research found that individuals without degrees can acquire critical skills in a comparable time-frame to those with degrees, highlighting the potential for innovative approaches, such as industry micro-credentials and skills-based hiring, to tackle skills gaps and talent shortages,” says Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO of Coursera, who participated in the study.“However, it will require collective action from public and private sectors to provide the affordable, flexible reskilling pathways at scale that displaced workers need to transition into jobs of the future.”Rise of green jobsInvestment in the green transition and climate-change mitigation, as well as increasing consumer awareness of sustainability issues, are driving industry transformation and opening new opportunities in the labour market, says the report.It notes the strongest net job creation effects are expected to be driven by investments that facilitate the green transition of businesses, with more than half of respondents expecting this to occur. As countries seek more renewable energy sources, roles such as renewable energy engineers and solar energy installation and systems engineers will be in high demand, it adds.“Investment will also drive growth in more generalist sustainability roles, such as sustainability specialists and environmental protection professionals, which are expected to grow by 33% and 34%, respectively, translating to growth of approximately one million jobs,” says the WEF.Share",,https://www.itweb.co.za/article/artificial-intelligence-revolution-to-displace-83m-jobs-by-2027/KPNG878NVmeq4mwD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATRICK T. FALLON / AFP   Like every innovation, artificial intelligence (AI) fuels fears of job destruction. While the ChatGPT program is arousing the interest of the general public and awakening the appetite of investors, a World Economic Forum survey published on Sunday, April 30, estimated that 14 million jobs will be lost worldwide on balance over the next five years (69 million created and 83 million destroyed), i.e. 2% of total employment. It anticipates that nearly a quarter of employees will change jobs, mainly due to the advent of new technologies. The authors of the study based their estimates on information collected from 803 companies worldwide employing 11.3 million people. The most significant job creation is in the education sector (+10%), and agriculture (especially machine operators), while job losses are mainly in administrative tasks, such as accounting services.  In recent months, there has been an increasing number of reports on the impact of AI on business. In a study published at the end of March, Goldman Sachs predicted that in the United States and Europe, the most affected areas, nearly two-thirds of jobs are ""exposed to some degree of AI automation."" A quarter of them could be automated. The US investment bank added that the increase in productivity alone could mean GDP growth of 7% over the next 10 years. In collaboration with the American University of Pennsylvania, OpenAI, the company that is developing ChatGPT, predicted that for 19% of occupations, especially those with the highest salaries, at least half of the tasks will be affected by so-called ""generative"" artificial intelligence. However, the researchers noted that the potential for new discoveries, behavioral changes, and technological developments can all affect the accuracy and reliability of predictions. 'Efficiency gains' These estimates are fragile and uncertain, as the adoption of new technologies is so unpredictable. In its report, the World Economic Forum noted that ""businesses introducing automation into their operations at a slower pace than previously anticipated"" compared to 2020. The authors refered to a two-speed automation. ""But while expectations of the displacement of physical and manual work by machines has decreased, reasoning, communicating, and coordinating – all traits with a comparative advantage for humans – are expected to be more automatable in the future,"" they wrote.  Reassuring voices are also being raised to affirm that AI will not have a destructive effect. At the Hannover Fair (Germany), a major trade show that brought together manufacturers from around the world from April 17 to 21, Tony Hemmelgarn, CEO of Siemens Digital Industries Software, explained that the new technologies would assist workers by helping them identify production defects. The boss concluded that they would ""not replace anyone"" and would instead deliver ""efficiency gains."" Dr. Jochen Köckler, Chairman of the Managing Board of Deutsche Messe AG, added  AI can trigger a boost in efficiency in industrial manufacturing, while at the same time reducing the pressure on companies in Germany and Europe that are facing shortages of skilled workers.""

The 36-year-old data-science specialist works in artificial intelligence, perhaps the most coveted experience on the planet after OpenAI demonstrated the breakthroughs of ChatGPT. Chopra, who works outside of New Delhi, sees friends in the field get pay hikes of 35% to 50% each time they switch jobs. “There’s a real shortage of data and AI talent,” he said.An AI hiring frenzy is ricocheting around the world, from Silicon Valley to Europe, Asia and beyond. While tech giants like Google and Baidu Inc dangle top-notch packages for the engineers to build their own AI engines, companies in almost every other field — from health care and finance to entertainment — are staffing up too, to avoid getting blindsided by shifts in their industries.India, perhaps more than any other country, illustrates how the rush for talent is outstripping supply. The country of 1.4 billion people has long been the back office for the tech industry, a source of reinforcements for any emergency. But now even the world’s most populous nation is running out of the data scientists, machine-learning specialists and skilled engineers that companies are looking for.There’s an “insatiable need for talent,” said Rahul Shah, co-founder of WalkWater Talent Advisors, a headhunter for top-level workers. “AI can’t be outsourced, it’s core to the organization.”Recruitment stories verge on the absurd. In one search Shah’s firm just handled, the new employer more than doubled a candidate’s pay. Freedom Dumlao, chief technology officer of Flexcar, interviewed one engineer who said a rival suitor had offered him a BMW motorcycle as a sign-on bonus. “That’s a line I’m not comfortable approaching,” Dumlao said.India’s tech industry is built on a plentiful supply of affordable workers. Companies like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd invented the model for modern outsourcing, in which Western companies tap engineers halfway around the world to handle support, services and software, typically at a fraction of the cost of local workers. There are now more than five million people employed in tech services in India, according to the trade group Nasscom. Powerhouses like Google, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc set up their own operations in India, hiring locals by the thousands. Google, now part of Alphabet Inc. started with five employees in the country in 2004 and now employs nearly 10,000. But this seemingly endless supply of labor is running short in critical fields. There are about 416,000 people working in AI and data science in the country —- and demand for another 213,000, according to Nasscom’s estimates. “The proportion of unfilled job roles is approximately 51% of the current installed talent base,” it said in a February report, flagging the crunch as a risk to growth.It’s likely to get worse. India added 66 tech innovation centers, so-called global capability centers or captives, last year taking the total to nearly 1,600. These GCCs that used to handle tasks like IT support and customer support have morphed into in-house centers for business-critical technology — like AI. In the first three months of 2023, asset manager AllianceBernstein Holding LP, car rental company Avis Budget Group Inc, entertainment conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery Inc and aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney set up R&D hubs in Bangalore, joining the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Walmart Inc.“ChatGPT has driven the larger domain of artificial intelligence out of stealth mode,” said Vikram Ahuja, co-founder of ANSR Consulting, which helps design and establish technology centers for corporations. Last year, Dallas-headquartered ANSR set up 18 such captives in India; Ahuja expects that number to hit 25 this year. “Many enterprises which have India captives are accelerating their AI road map to derive a competitive edge.” Companies large and small are trying to figure out how AI will affect their fates. Can ChatGPT predict future demand with newfound accuracy? Will deep learning technologies prove better at medical diagnosis than any doctor today? Could trading algorithms be fine-tuned to the point finance companies with the best technologies will drive their rivals out of business?“The talent crunch is going to worsen in the next year or two,” said Biswajeet Mahapatra, principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc. India has the second largest pool of highly-skilled AI, machine learning and big data talent, according to the February report by Nasscom, after the US. It produces 16% of the world’s AI talent pool, placing it among the top three talent markets with the US and China. Dumlao of Flexcar, a Boston-based car subscription startup, says that’s not enough. He has been hunkering down in Bangalore for the past three months trying to assemble a team of data engineers and computer-vision specialists for the startup’s data science hub in the city. Flexcar’s team of 60 engineers helps build AI applications to automatically detect damage when vehicles are returned. The startup has embraced ChatGPT and is piloting a chatbot to help technicians diagnose and fix vehicles by querying trained bots. “Bangalore has incredible data engineering talent and the AI talent hunt is only going to intensify,” said Dumlao. The tricky thing is to persuade prized engineers that his startup is their most attractive option. “The freshest ideas and the newest innovations will sprout wherever there’s a concentration of talent,” he said.Dumlao’s competitors come in all shapes and sizes. Chilean retailer Falabella SA is the first Latin American company to open a captive in India for data analytics, AI and machine learning. “We have to compete with the best of the best,” said Ashish Grover, its Santiago-based chief information officer. The efforts are paying off: a personalized customer platform now accounts for over half the incremental sales from digital targeting. An AI-fueled recommendation engine has driven three times more conversions on its mobile app. Home improvement retailer Lowe’s Cos Inc.’s captive tech center in Bangalore helps embed AI into its products, and all its technology will be built “AI first,” said Ankur Mittal, managing director of Lowe’s India. For instance, the team’s predictive algorithms help decide pricing, and fine-tune search features on Lowes.com. The Bangalore hub’s AI-powered computer vision uses videos and imagery from store cameras to help address shoplifting and analyze store footfalls.This being India, many workers are trying to retrain themselves to land a coveted job in AI. Data engineer Deepak Kapoor, who works for a startup called Thinkbumblebee Analytics, is studying up on computer vision and large language models to move into deep learning, where job opportunities are plentiful. He thinks he could easily double his salary in a city like Bangalore.Mahapatra, Forrester’s adviser to global chief information officers, anticipates years of rising demand for skilled workers. India is certain to benefit from the rush to high employees who understand this new world. “We haven’t even touched the tip of the AI iceberg,” he says.",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/99973817'}"

Over the next five years, nearly a quarter of all jobs will change as a result of AI, digitization and other economic developments like the green energy transition and supply chain re-shoring, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum in Geneva on Monday. While the study expects AI to result in &ldquo;significant labor-market disruption,&rdquo; the net impact of most technologies will be positive over the next five years as big data analytics, management technologies and cybersecurity become the biggest drivers of employment growth.         The emergence of AI applications like ChatGPT, which uses machines to simulate human reasoning and problem solving, will have a particularly pronounced impact by displacing and automating many roles that involve reasoning, communicating and coordinating, the report said. Some 75% of surveyed companies said they expect to adopt AI technologies over the next five years, which they predict will eliminate up to 26 million jobs in record-keeping and administrative positions &mdash; think cashiers, ticket clerks, data entry and accounting. The WEF study surveyed more than 800 companies that collectively employ 11.3 million workers across 45 economies from all over the world. For now, AI remains a smaller threat to labor prospects than other macroeconomic factors like slower economic growth, supply shortages and inflation, the report said. Opportunities for job creation will likely come from investments that facilitate the green transition of businesses, the broader application of ESG standards and a broad reorientation of global supply chains, it said.

Here's how the writers strike is pushing back.,Artificial intelligence could drastically change Hollywood. Here's how the writers strike is pushing back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"By Simmone ShahUpdated: May 4, 2023 2:44 PM EDT | Originally published: May 4, 2023 2:44 PM EDTThe last time the Writers Guild of America went on strike, in 2007, workers pushed back against the nascent streaming industry, advocating for higher residual payments for content released over streaming. Now a new technology, artificial intelligence, stands to drastically change Hollywood again as Guild strikers return to the picket line.Streaming giants like Hulu, Netflix, and Disney+ have come to dominate the industry, changing the models by which content is produced and distributed and making it increasingly difficult for writers to earn a sustainable income. And as artificial intelligence technology rapidly improves, the WGA aims to place limits on the use of AI in movies and TV scripts.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) —which is negotiating the contract on behalf of Hollywood studios, streamers, and production companies—say their priority is “the long-term health and stability of the industry” and they are dedicated to reaching “a fair and reasonable agreement” according to the Associated Press.“AI raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone…” the AMPTP said in an emailed statement to TIME. “It’s something that requires a lot more discussion, which we’ve committed to doing.”The WGA proposed regulations around the use of AI to create source material and write, or rewrite, literary material. A negotiations proposal chart released by WGA on Monday shows that AMPTP rejected their proposal, instead countering with “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology.” (The WGA did not respond to requests for comment as of publication.)Writers in other fields should be paying attention to the WGA negotiations. Here's the current position on the use of AI. pic.twitter.com/MWuo6AwKBt— Hari Kunzru (@harikunzru) May 2, 2023
A Pivotal MomentThe battle over AI is just one aspect of the union’s demands around ensuring fair compensation in the streaming age. (The guild’s top priorities are fighting for increased compensation and residuals.) But any limits on AI technology, or lack thereof, have the possibility to impact the future of the industry for decades to come—especially as tools powered by artificial intelligence becomes increasingly commercialized.“Politically, we are at the precipice of when [AI technology] will be institutionalized.” says Alex Hanna, Director of Research at the Distributed AI Research Institute. “Once they are institutionalized, it’s hard to get rid of it.”Though AI technology is not new, it has rapidly become mainstream, as companies push to adopt the technology. “[We’re seeing a] rapid push to release these systems into commercial use, often without very much pre-testing or evaluation of whether they even work as planned,” says Sarah Myers West, Managing Director of AI Now Institute.Jobs on the Line?The commercial adoption is raising questions across sectors about the potential for job cuts. “It’s not so much about what AI is going to do, but what companies are going to use AI to justify,” says Myers West. Studios could have fewer people in the writers’ room, with generative AI writing content that is later edited by a writer. “They could use AI to create a first draft and then bring in someone else to do a second draft. And that devalues their work by not having them do that whole process,” says Meyers West.Experts say that the technology is not yet advanced enough to replace a writer entirely, but it could reduce a creative practice into something akin to copywriting. “AI isn’t necessarily going to replace the job, but it would make it more mundane,” says Meyers West.A Challenge Across IndustriesIn recent months, creatives across industries have been sounding the alarm on the encroachment of artificial intelligence. Many artificial intelligence systems use the work of creatives to teach the tools to generate something similar, raising concerns around intellectual property.The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) released a statement in March requiring the bargaining of the use of artificial intelligence to simulate an actor’s performance, noting that “human creators are the foundation of the creative industries and we must ensure that they are respected and paid for their work.” And just a week after Universal Music Group asked services to prevent AI companies from “scraping” music to create imitations, an AI-created Drake and The Weeknd collab fooled the Internet.Though WGA is one of the first creative labor unions to take on AI, it’s likely to be joined by others soon. “I imagine we’ll see more of this in fields like journalism or graphic design, positions that could be automated with intense human correction afterwards,” says Hanna. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As he leaves office, Hinton has shared two concerns related to the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.According to an interview with The New York Times (via The Verge), Hinton said that his immediate concern is the spread of misinformation and in the longer run, he’s worried about humanity's existence.He warned that AI will eliminate jobs and possibly humanity itself as it begins to write and run its own code. “The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” Hinton was quoted as saying. 99851036“But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that,” he added.Hinton regrets his life's workHinton recently quit his job at Google after being employed by Google for more than a decade. He said that a part of him regrets his life's work.“I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn’t done it, somebody else would have. It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” he said.He won the 2018 Turing Award for their foundational work that led to the current boom in AI.Hinton joined Google after the company acquired a firm started by Hinton and two of his students. One of his students became chief scientist at OpenAI. 99638620Hinton was happy until...The interview by the New York Times noted that Hinton was happy with Google's success with the technology until Microsoft launched the new OpenAI-infused Bing. The launch challenged Google’s core business and reportedly sparked a “code red” in the search giant office. According to Hinton, such fierce competition might be impossible to stop and it could result in a world with much fake imagery and text that nobody will be able to tell “what is true anymore.”What Google has to say“We remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We’re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly,"" Google’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, said in a statement.99686718In fact, Hinton also heaped praise on Google saying the company “has acted very responsibly.”“In the NYT today, Cade Metz implies that I left Google so that I could criticize Google. Actually, I left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google. Google has acted very responsibly,” he said in a tweet.",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/99913126'}"

It seems that out of nowhere artificial intelligence has become the next big thing, as AI is expected to radically change the world, especially the labor market. A recent Goldman Sachs study concluded that AI’s ascendance would disrupt 300 million jobs. However, proponents of automation claim that new and better jobs will be created, and AI will make workers' lives easier.


Keeping abreast of the fast-moving trend is in the best interests of your career and future. One of the best ways to stay ahead of the curve and ensure that you remain relevant is to adapt to the rapid changes by continually educating and upskilling yourself or asking your employer to enroll you in courses that will enable you to take advantage of the new future of work.

Jobs At Risk Due To AI
As tech companies are in cost-cutting mode, AI could displace professionals that were once highly sought after and highly compensated, like software engineers. Tech jobs, including coders, computer programmers and data analysts, may be in jeopardy as technologies, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, can do as good or a better job of coding faster than people.

PROMOTED
AI-powered chatbots are already used to answer customer service questions and make sales calls. As AI technology improves, telemarketing and human customer service jobs will likely be completely automated. Data-entry clerks will not be needed, as AI software can more efficiently extract data and add it to spreadsheets and other documents.

Jobs that entail interpreting large volumes of information and simplifying it for publication or briefings, like journalists and paralegals, will be vulnerable to automation. AI could also replace creatives, like screenwriters, photographers, graphic designers, artists, advertisers and content creators.

In the not-too-distant future, self-driving automobiles and trucks will displace human drivers. In warehouses, fulfillment centers and factories, many people who pack, lift, schlep and load the goods onto the trucks will no longer be needed. It's only a matter of time until the tech dispenses with tradespeople, who will be laid off from their welding, painting and assembly line jobs. This is a significant concern for blue-collar and frontline workers.

According to an academic research study, automation technology has been the primary driver of U.S. income inequality over the past 40 years. The report, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that 50% to 70% of changes in U.S. wages can be attributed to wage declines among blue-collar workers replaced or degraded by automation. Artificial intelligence, robotics and new sophisticated technologies have caused a vast chasm in wealth and income inequality. It looks like this issue will accelerate with the mass adoption of AI.

Jobs Being Created By AI
It’s not all doom and gloom. Many people are excited about the potential for AI and all the opportunities it will open up. There will be a need for AI engineers, data scientists and ethicists.
The new economy will require AI professionals to train AI models on large datasets. These people will need in-depth knowledge of AI and data science.
To ensure that machine learning doesn’t spin out of control, companies will look to employ AI ethicists who are responsible for ensuring that AI is used responsibly and ethically. Attorneys will start specializing in legal matters regarding AI.
The Worst-Case Scenario
There is a reasonable concern that AI can create havoc. Geoffrey Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto and a cofounder of the Google Brain project, is heralded as one of the world’s most respected voices in the development of deep learning, a type of machine learning that has revolutionized AI. In a statement to the New York Times, Hinton announced that he was leaving Google to focus on his research and to speak out about the potential dangers of AI.
In March, Elon Musk and other prominent technologists signed an open letter warning about its potential risks. They called for a pause on AI development and training, as it poses ""profound risks to society and humanity.""
""Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,” reads the open letter. “Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?""
How To Manage AI
Regulatory agencies must get ahead of the trend before it's too late. They will need to write rules, regulations and guidelines for AI's ethical and non-harmful development and usage and ensure it's used safely and responsibly or risk punitive repercussions. There need to be mechanisms to offer education, information and updates about AI, so that the public understands what is happening.
Last Tuesday, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law. U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) questioned Altman about AI's impact on the job market.
""There will be an impact on jobs, we try to be very clear about that,"" Altman said. “And I think it will require partnership between the industry and government, but mostly action by government to figure out how we want to mitigate that.”

 Generative AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) that can produce content such as audio, text, code, video, images, and other data. While previous AI algorithms were used to identify patterns within a training data set and make predictions, generative AI uses machine learning algorithms to create outputs based on a training data set. 


 Generative AI can produce outputs in the same medium in which it is prompted (e.g., text-to-text) or in a different medium from the given prompt (e.g., text-to-image or image-to-video). Popular examples of generative AI include ChatGPT, Gemini, DALL-E, Midjourney, and Perplexity, among others.


 The technology is the most discussed technological change since the smartphone. In 2023, the worldwide market in AI was worth about $196 billion, according to Grand View Research, with the U.S. market alone, according to Bloomberg, expected to grow to $1.3 trillion within the next decade.12


Key Takeaways
Generative AI is a form of machine learning that can produce text, video, images, and other types of content.ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Gemini are generative AI applications that produce text or images based on user-given prompts.Generative AI is used in everything from creative to academic writing and translation; composing, dubbing, and sound editing; infographics, image editing, and architectural rendering; and in industries from automotive to media/entertainment to healthcare and scientific research.Concerns about generative AI include its potential legal, ethical, political, ecological, social, and economic effects.
  How Does Generative AI Work?  
 Generative AI is a type of machine learning that works by training software models to make predictions based on data without the need for explicit programming.3


 Specifically, generative AI models are fed vast quantities of existing content to train the models to produce new content. They learn to identify underlying patterns in the data set based on a probability distribution and, when given a prompt, create similar patterns (or outputs based on these patterns).4




 Part of the umbrella category of machine learning called deep learning, generative AI uses a neural network that allows it to handle more complex patterns than traditional machine learning. Inspired by the human brain, neural networks don't require human supervision or intervention to distinguish differences or patterns in the training data.5


 Generative AI can be run on various models, which use different mechanisms to train the AI and create outputs. These include generative adversarial networks, transformers, and variational autoencoders.6


  Generative AI Interfaces  
 Integrating AI into everyday technology has altered many people's interactions with digital devices. Voice-activated AI assistants, now ubiquitous in smartphones, smart speakers, and other everyday devices, illustrate this shift. Similarly, generative AI is becoming increasingly accessible through various user-friendly software interfaces.


 A fundamental change driving the widespread adoption of generative AI has been the development of intuitive user gateways. Unlike earlier iterations that required technical expertise or data science knowledge, modern generative AI interfaces allow users to interact using natural language. This access has significantly expanded the user base and potential applications of generative AI.


 Here are some of the most popular recent examples of generative AI interfaces.


  ChatGPT  
 Created by OpenAI, ChatGPT is an example of text-to-text generative AI—essentially, an AI-powered chatbot trained to interact with users via natural language dialogue. Users can ask ChatGPT questions, engage in back-and-forth conversation, and prompt it to compose text in different styles or genres, such as poems, essays, stories, or recipes, among others.


 When it was first released in November 2022, ChatGPT quickly brought wide attention to generative AI's uses; within months, ChatGPT was for AI what Google was for search or Kleenex was for tissues, a virtual synonym for its product line.


 Many people use the free version of ChatGPT online. OpenAI also sells the application programming interface (API) for ChatGPT, among other enterprise subscription and embedding options.78


  DALL-E  
 DALL-E is an example of text-to-image generative AI released in January 2021 by OpenAI. It uses a neural network trained on images with accompanying text descriptions. Users can input descriptive text, and DALL-E will generate photo-realistic imagery based on the prompt. It can also create variations on the generated image in different styles and perspectives.9


 DALL-E can also edit images, whether by making changes within an image (known in the software as Inpainting) or extending an image beyond its original proportions or boundaries (called ""outpainting"").109




  Gemini  
 Formerly Bard, Gemini is a text-to-text generative AI interface based on Google’s large language model. Like ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot powered by AI technology that can answer questions or generate text based on user-given prompts.


 Google first billed it as a “complementary experience to Google Search.” By the spring of 2024, Google Snippets was using Gemini to present answers to search queries atop Google's traditional lineup of search results.


50%
The growth in Google's emissions since 2019, primarily because of data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.11
  AI's Effect on the Environment  
 In 2019, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) announced aggressive plans to cut its total greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 from its 2019 baseline. Even as its annual reports speak over dozens of pages about AI's ""potential"" to lower such emissions through vague promises of model efficiency and ""resiliency,"" the takeaway is in its own data.


 By 2024, its emissions had grown almost 50% since 2019, increasing 13% in 2023 alone.11 Even as Google still promises to meet its 2030 timeline, Google's 2024 report noted that the increase in emissions ""was primarily because of increases in data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions"" involved in generative AI. The report said, in a notable understatement given the planetary stakes, that any mitigation or decrease in AI's climate effects ""may be challenging.""


  The History of Generative AI  
 Modern AI really kicked off in the 1950s with Alan Turing’s research on machine thinking and his creation of the eponymous Turing test.125


 The first neural networks (a key piece of technology underlying generative AI) that were capable of being trained were invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt, a psychologist at Cornell University.13


 The journey from these early concepts to the AI powerhouses we see today has been marked by waves of innovation and periods of stagnation. Neural networks gained traction in the 1980s, but it was the introduction of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues that truly revolutionized the field. GANs, which pit two neural networks against each other to produce increasingly realistic data, opened new frontiers in generating images, music, and text.


 The 2010s saw an explosion in deep learning capabilities, fueled by advances in computing power and the availability of massive data sets. The release of GPT-3 in the 2020s was a watershed moment, showcasing AI's potential to produce coherent, contextually relevant content across various domains.


  The 2020s Breakthrough  
 The true economic impact of generative AI began to crystallize in 2022 with the public release of ChatGPT. Its user-friendly interface gave the public access to powerful AI capabilities, reaching an estimated 100 million users within just two months of launch. Such rapid adoption underscored the technology's potential to reshape industries and economies.


 In the mid-2020s, companies across a range of sectors have been integrating generative AI into finance, healthcare, education, creative industries, and more. Giants like Google (with its Gemini model) and Anthropic (with Claude) are pushing forward generative AI's capabilities, developing multimodal AI systems that can process and generate text, images, and code.14


 The economic implications are often predicted to be staggering. A 2024 McKinsey report estimated that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. This potential is driving unprecedented investment in the technology, with companies like JP Morgan Chase committing over $1 billion annually to AI capabilities.15


  Generative AI's Second Wave  
 A June 2024 report from Deloitte on generative AI's ""second wave"" was far more cautious in tone than the consulting industry's largely celebratory publications on AI in 2022 and 2023. Deloitte said two key areas of ""trust"" remain a ""major barrier to large-scale generative AI adoption"": trust in generative AI's output and trust from workers that it won't replace them.


 The report notes that this has ""not prevented organizations from rapidly adopting"" the technology, ""with 60% reporting they are effectively balancing rapid implementation with risk management.""16 While casting about for profitable companies in its surveys, Deloitte noted that's thus not been the case.



A 2024 Deloitte report offered the sobering conclusion that, thus far, most companies' costs for highly skilled labor and sophisticated computing technology for generative AI have run well ahead of any earnings. The consulting firm also said that the most reliable earnings from generative AI have been in cybersecurity to combat AI-powered cyberattacks.1614
  How Is Generative AI Used?  
 Most generative AI systems are based on foundation models, which can perform multiple open-ended tasks. The possibilities of generative AI are wide-ranging for applications, and arguably, many have yet to be discovered, let alone implemented.17


 The ability for generative AI to work across types of media (text-to-image or audio-to-text, for example) has opened up creative and lucrative possibilities. No doubt, as businesses and industries continue to integrate this technology into their research and workflows, many more uses will emerge.


Important
A major concern with generative AI is that algorithms can amplify or replicate existing biases inherent from its training data. Amazon, for example, created (and then abandoned) an AI-powered recruiting tool that was biased against women.18
  Recent Transformative Developments in Generative AI  
 Despite the relative novelty of generative AI, the technology has already seen rapid advances.


 Today's generative AI models can be used for the following tasks:


 TranslationCreative, academic, and business writingCode writingComposing and songwritingDubbingDictation and transcription Speech and voice recognitionIllustrationInfographics3D modelingImage editingArchitectural rendering  


 As time passes and the technology grows more sophisticated, it's expected to become more effective at these tasks and be able to take on new and more complex work.19


 Software development is one field that is expected to see massive shifts thanks to the power of generative AI, with as much as 9.3% of industry revenue being attributed to AI's ability to quickly create code and generate user interfaces.19


 Generative AI will also impact the banking industry, helping overhaul the industry's legacy code systems, personalize retail banking services to customers, and create more accurate risk models for lending and investing.19




  Applications by Industry  
 Examples of applications across different fields include the following:


 Automotive industry: Synthetic data produced by AI can run simulations and train autonomous vehicles. 20Healthcare and scientific research: Scientists can use AI to model protein sequences, discover new molecules, or suggest new drug compounds to test, while doctors and practitioners can use AI to analyze images to aid in diagnoses.21 Media and entertainment: AI can be used to quickly, easily, and more cheaply generate content, or (as a tool) to improve the work of creatives like designers.Climate science and meteorology: AI can simulate natural disasters, forecast the weather, and model different climate scenarios.17Education: AI can be used to supplement classroom learning with one-to-one tutoring via a chatbot or to create course materials, lesson plans, or online learning platforms.22 Government: The U.S. government has publicly released information about its use of generative AI since 2022.23 Its list has included employing AI to analyze weather hazards, process veteran feedback on their experiences with the U.S. Veterans Affairs, and for patent searches.


 Of course, AI can be used in any industry to automate routine tasks such as minute-taking, documentation, coding, or to improve existing workflows alongside or within preexisting software. 


  The Pros and Cons of Generative AI  
 Pros and Cons of Generative AI

Pros

Automation can increase productivity.
Reduces the skill and time barriers for creative roles and content creation.
Could allow for faster and more accurate analysis of complex data.
AI can be used to create synthetic data sets for training other AI systems, speeding AI development.



Cons

AI hallucinations can result in users being provided with inaccurate or completely fictional information.
AI training relies on accurately labeled data. Inaccurately labeled data can cause issues with training AI models.
There is almost no regulatory framework for AI, raising issues such as privacy and ownership of AI output.
Most generative AI systems thus far have been trained on copyrighted content found online.




 Like any major technological development, generative AI opens up a world of potential, which has already been discussed above in detail, but there are also drawbacks to consider. 


 Overall advantages of generative AI include the following:


 Increasing productivity by automating or speeding up tasks19Removing or lowering skills or time barriers for content generation and creative applicationsEnabling analysis or exploration of complex data 15Using it to create synthetic data on which to train and improve other AI systems17


 Disadvantages of generative AI include the following:


 Hallucination: This refers to the tendency for certain AI models to generate nonsense or errors that do not correspond to fact or real-world or common-sense logic.247Reliance on data labeling: Although many generative AI models can be trained in an unsupervised manner using unlabeled data, data quality and veracity remains an issue. Many tech companies, including OpenAI, Facebook, and TikTok, rely on low-paid contract workers who perform data enrichment work such as labeling or generating training data.2526Difficulty with content moderation: Another concern is the ability for AI models to recognize and filter out inappropriate content. As is the case with data labeling, much of this work still relies on human contractors to tag and filter through large amounts of offensive and potentially traumatizing content.26Ethical issues: In addition to labor concerns like the examples above, algorithms have been demonstrated to amplify or replicate existing discrimination and biases inherent in the training data.27Legal and regulatory issues: The U.S. has been slow to offer any legal or regulatory framework for the use of AI. Yet, its development could pose the following problems:


 Copyright issues: Since generative AI models are trained on a vast quantity of data, it can be difficult to verify whether the materials included in the data or the resultant works generated are in violation of copyright laws.28Privacy issues: Generative AI raises concerns around the collection, storage, use, and security of data, both personal and business-related.Autonomy and responsibility: AI technology raises concerns around liability. For example, for autonomous systems like self-driving cars, it is unclear how to determine liability for accidents.27


 Political implications: Generative AI raises issues around false or misleading information and the veracity of media such as photo-realistic imagery or voice recordings. It can also interfere with processes that invite democratic engagement by falsifying a high volume of comments, submissions, or messages.29Energy consumption: AI models have a large ecological impact, as they require a vast quantity of electricity to run. As usage grow, so will the demand on the environment.3031




 Which Industries Can Benefit from Generative AI?
Generative AI can benefit just about any type of field or business by increasing productivity, automating tasks, enabling new forms of creation, facilitating deep analysis of complex data sets, or even creating synthetic data on which future AI models can train.Generative AI is also widely used in many different government applications.


 What Are Some Popular Examples of Generative AI?
Popular generative AI interfaces include ChatGPT, Bard, DALL-E, Midjourney, and DeepMind.


 What Is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is the ability to train computer software to make predictions based on data. Generative AI uses machine learning algorithms.3


 What Is a Neural Network?
A neural network is a type of model, based on the human brain, that processes complex information and makes predictions. This technology allows generative AI to identify patterns in the training data and create new content.32


  The Bottom Line  
 Generative AI is still a relatively new technology with the potential to transform many of the ways we work and live. Traditionally, AI has been the realm of data scientists, engineers, and experts, but the ability to prompt software in plain language and generate new content in seconds has opened up AI to a much broader user base. 


 However, there are wide-ranging concerns and issues to be cautious of its applications. Many implications, ranging from legal, ethical, and political to ecological, social, and economic, have been and will continue to be raised as generative AI continues to be adopted and developed.

But Gus Nisbet, a 30-year-old music producer, is excited about what AI has to offer the workplace.“It's all about co-creation,” says Nisbet, who also works as a creative strategist at sonic branding agency MassiveMusic in London. He is already using generative AI tools including OpenAI’s ChatGPT to streamline administrative tasks and enhance creative projects. “I’ll start up the idea and then use AI to flesh it out and develop it in more varied ways,” he says.Since Nisbet has integrated AI tools into his daily workflow, he’s seen a huge surge in efficiency. Tasks that may usually have taken a half-day to complete, like analysing client feedback on a project, can be handled much faster when run through ChatGPT. “If you are using it in the right way, on the right task, you can crunch about four or five hours of work into about 30 minutes,” he says. He uses that extra time to focus on the tasks that require complex thinking and creativity. While the growing capabilities of AI are certainly making many workers anxious, others are embracing the technology. They are already using the tools to improve on-the-job productivity and efficiency. And emerging data shows that there may be more AI optimism in the workplace than headlines – and our own biases – lead us to believe.Microsoft’s annual Work Trend Index, released in May 2023, shows while 49% of people are worried AI will replace their jobs, far more – 70% – would delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen their workloads.“Employees are more eager for AI to help with this burden of digital debt than they are afraid of job loss,” says Colette Stallbaumer, Microsoft’s general manager for Future of Work. According to the report, 64% of workers struggle to get all their work done each day, often due to the constant influx of emails, meetings and other digital distractions. Once workers start experimenting with AI tools, says Stallbaumer, they realise “these tools are not going to replace my job, they’re actually going to be able to augment what I can do and my capabilities”. Stallbaumer points to her own workflow, in which she uses AI to manage her meetings. “When every meeting becomes a digital artefact you can engage with it in a whole new way,” she says. Stallbaumer will use AI to summarise key points of meetings she’s missed and can even ask it to analyse the meeting in real time, to determine what people agree on and what requires further discussion.Getty ImagesSome workers say AI frees up mental bandwidth to do more creative things and seize on larger ideas (Credit: Getty Images)Not only is she optimistic about the technology, but she also says she doesn’t want to go back to life without it. “People might’ve attended an hour-long meeting to get the two minutes of information they really needed,” says Stallbaumer, “so this is a game changer, because you can actually choose what works for you.”Many AI tools also offer shortcuts to completing repetitive tasks or managing workers’ time. Nisbet, for example, uses AI image generators like Midjourney to “spice up” the decks he presents to clients as well as AI search tools to scan through music databases for relevant lyrics – a job that would otherwise take hours. Daniel Rock, assistant professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, agrees that reducing people’s workloads is a key advantage of AI entering the workplace. “I am very excited about the potential gains for removing a lot of drudgery at work,” he says. “That will help people focus on the stuff where they’re really needed, where human thought can be most helpful.”Ideally, say the experts, as workers reclaim the time previously spent sitting in meetings or dissecting lengthy emails, they will have time for the parts of the job they enjoy – the complex, creative, human parts. And this is worth being optimistic about.“Ironically, by using machines to speed up workflows, it means you can give your work a more human touch,” says Nisbet. “You have much more time to ideate, to think outside the box, rather than just going through the motions of getting it done.”You have much more time to ideate, to think outside the box, rather than just going through the motions of getting it done – Gus NisbetStallbaumer adds that this free time should also allow for more innovation. She points to the Microsoft research, which shows that workers who are currently struggling to get all their work done are also three-and-a-half times more likely to be struggling to innovate and think strategically.It’s still far too early to know what the full impact of AI on the workplace will be, but experts are optimistic – and many workers are increasingly positive on the technology, too. Nisbet already sees these AI tools as collaborators. “People will still want that human connection and spirit embedded within the work,” he says. “And these tools can be used to help facilitate that narrative.”Even for nervous workers, leaning into AI optimism simply might be a good strategy. As Rock says, “Thinking about how you can work with these machines is always a better proposition than how you can fight against them.”How we work",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kennedy, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. “Will it bring increasing unemployment rather than economic security?”Listen to This ArticleListen · 12:42 minThe same question could have been raised before Congress last week in its hearing on artificial intelligence. In effect, it was.Sam Altman, chief executive of the San Francisco start-up OpenAI, testified last Tuesday before members of a Senate subcommittee, urging the government to regulate the fast-growing A.I. industry. Congressional leaders shared their worries about the threats that A.I. could pose, including the spread of misinformation and privacy violations.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOne of their most emphatic concerns was job displacement: Who will assume responsibility to protect workers whose jobs might be transformed, or even eliminated, by generative A.I.?Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, declared that his “biggest nightmare in the long term” is the job loss that A.I. could cause, before saying to Mr. Altman, “Let me ask you what your biggest nightmare is.”“There will be an impact on jobs,” Mr. Altman replied. “And I think it will require partnership between the industry and government, but mostly action by government.”Mr. Altman, like so many other executives unleashing new technologies on the world, has asked the government to assume the bulk of responsibility in supporting workers through the labor market disruptions prompted by A.I. It’s not yet clear how government will rise to that task.Generative A.I. could automate activities equivalent to 300 million full-time jobs globally, according to a recent estimate by Goldman Sachs. Already the chief executive of IBM said he expected A.I. to affect white-collar clerical staffing, eliminating the need for up to 30 percent of certain roles while creating new ones. The White House on Tuesday is hosting workers for a discussion of their experiences with automation and monitoring technologies in the workplace.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHistorically, when automation has led to job loss, the economic impact has tended to be offset by the creation of new jobs. Generative artificial intelligence, according to the Goldman report, could raise America’s labor productivity growth by nearly 1.5 percentage points per year over a decade. It could increase annual global gross domestic product by 7 percent. It could give rise to previously unimagined creative occupations.More In Business4,010 July 19, 2024Running the Packers Is Complicated. A Sense of Humor Helps. July 20, 2024Delta Cancels More Flights as It Struggles to Recover From Tech Outage July 22, 2024But there will be immense instability for displaced workers. Automation has been a significant driver of income inequality in America, according to a study from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University. By their estimates, 50 to 70 percent of changes in the U.S. wage structure since 1980 were due to loss of income among blue-collar and office workers because of automation.Areas of the country where robots have been adopted most intensively, particularly manufacturing-heavy parts of the Midwest, have also seen the most precipitous declines in employment, according to research from Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T.While makers of A.I. have tended to focus on the technology’s potential for job creation, many workers will experience painful disruption as they try to train for and find new roles that pay well and are fulfilling.“We’ve never been in a period where the scope of automation is so wide potentially,” said Harry Holzer, an economist at Georgetown. “Historically if your job gets automated, you find something new. With A.I. the thing that’s kind of scary is it could simply grow and take over more tasks. It’s a moving target.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWorkers in administrative and clerical support may have particular cause for concern about generative A.I., according to the Goldman research. And many of them are already expressing anxieties.“It’s definitely scary,” said Justin Felt, 41, a customer service worker in Pittsburgh, who has worked for Verizon Fios for nearly 12 years. He feels that employers have not been entirely upfront with their workers about the ways they are incorporating generative A.I. into customer support roles, he said. “It’s definitely taking our work.”These technologies are flooding into workplaces at a rapid clip. BuzzFeed just introduced a chatbot that offers up recipe recommendations, McKinsey is helping clients use A.I. to fix technological bugs and the accounting firm KPMG is using ChatGPT to generate code. So some economists have begun putting forward proposals to protect the workers most likely to be affected.Workers could benefit, for example, from paid leave policies that allow them to take time away from their jobs to develop new skills. Germany already has a similar program, in which workers in most German states can take at least five paid days a year for educational courses, an initiative the labor minister recently said he planned to expand.Another possibility is a displacement tax, levied on employers when a worker’s job is automated but the person is not retrained, which could make businesses more inclined to retrain workers. The government could also offer A.I. companies financial incentives to create products designed to augment what workers do, rather than replace them — for example, A.I. that provides TV writers with research but doesn’t draft scripts, which are likely to be of low quality.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“If the government sets the agenda in developing technologies that are more complementary to humans, that would be very important,” Mr. Acemoglu said. “Industry is looking to the government for leadership.”The government’s previous efforts to support workers through periods of job displacement have had mixed results. A study of Trade Adjustment Assistance, a U.S. government program that provides financial assistance and training for workers who lose jobs because of trade, found that manufacturing employees who temporarily dropped out of the work force to participate in the program in the early 2000s still hadn’t caught up on earnings several years later compared with workers who lost jobs but didn’t qualify for T.A.A. support.Many economists say employers could also play a role in helping displaced workers.“Business always looks to government to deal with job loss,” said Simon Johnson, a professor at M.I.T. and a co-author with Mr. Acemoglu of the book “Power and Progress.” “But Microsoft and Alphabet — they are in the driver’s seat, in regards to where they choose to put their technological resources.”Workers could benefit, for example, from employer apprenticeships and retraining programs. The accounting giant PwC recently announced a $1 billion investment in generative A.I., which includes efforts to train its 65,000 workers on how to use A.I. What spurred the initiative was the chief executive’s trip to the World Economic Forum’s gathering in Davos, Switzerland, where he heard constant discussion of generative A.I.“A number of us walking out of that room knew something had changed,” recalled Joe Atkinson, the company’s chief products and technology officer.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPwC’s workers have expressed fears about displacement, according to Mr. Atkinson, especially as their company explores automating roles with generative A.I. Mr. Atkinson stressed, though, that PwC planned to retrain people with new technical skills so their work would change but their jobs wouldn’t be eliminated.Some tech companies are offering employees courses in cloud computing, cybersecurity and generative A.I. Among them is IBM, which also has an apprenticeship program that trains workers, including those without four-year degrees, for high-paying roles in fields like software development and data science. The company C3 AI offers its 1,000 employees bonuses of $250 to $1,500 for becoming certified in technological subjects including A.I. and cloud computing. KPMG is working to train every one of its employees to use generative A.I.Community colleges are intensifying their focus on A.I., too. Miami Dade College has received over $15 million in grants for its technology programs, with some of the money used to open two centers focused on preparing students for careers in A.I. Houston Community College recently announced a bachelor’s degree in A.I. and robotics, and Southwest Tennessee Community College is working to create an associate degree. The American Association of Community Colleges launched an A.I. incubator network focused on helping faculty teach about A.I. and colleges create A.I. degrees.“As Wayne Gretzky once said when asked about his success, ‘I skate to where the puck is going,’” said Dennis Natali, a professor at Pikes Peak State College in Colorado, which released a plan this year to roll out A.I. certificates. “Our college constantly assesses the work force landscape and prepares to support displaced workers.”As colleges and businesses scramble to retrain workers, some experts are optimistic about this technological transition. They note that throughout history people have feared technological advancement but often ended up benefiting from it, going back to the Luddites, weavers who protested the mechanization of the textile industry.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut that doesn’t mean the transition period will unfold smoothly. Michael Chui, an A.I. expert at McKinsey, pointed out that even the Luddites saw their income stagnate for decades.“Anyone who loses their job involuntarily — it’s a difficult time,” he said. “In some ways the Luddites weren’t wrong about the risk.”Audio produced by Jack D’Isidoro.Emma Goldberg covers the future of work for the Business section.

Artificial Intelligence Is Coming for Creative Workers Too
White collar creatives presumed they were immune from automation. They were wrong.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, and its implications for work, it can be hard to discern “cope” from outright ignorance. One example is the refrain that creativity, and therefore the creative industries, are somehow immune from technological disruption.
This perspective was captured by researchers from innovation charity Nesta in 2015, when they wrote: “creativity is inversely related to computerisability”. If poetry is that which can not be translated, creativity is that which is incapable of automation.
Such an assessment is obviously stupid. Swathes of creative work have already been automated over the last five centuries: manuscripts with beautiful calligraphy gave way to moveable print more than half a millennium ago – a process which has only required less human labour ever since. It was the same with textile and ceramic manufacture after the early 19th century. Rather than creativity being something beyond automation, the very essence of the Industrial Age was deskilling creative artisanal labour.
So why would any intelligent person believe it? Because it is convenient and re-assuring. Automation in blue collar jobs was seen as inevitable, and sometimes uncritically celebrated, because the people writing the headlines and op-eds and commissioning the documentaries weren’t the ones losing out. And while they covered the plight of workers in manufacturing, it was simply more expedient to believe the same could never happen to them. Yet it increasingly seems that the opposite is true. Far from bypassing white collar industries, machine learning is coming for them first.
This is no longer speculation, with the regulation of AI part of a recent list of demands put forward by striking screenwriters in Hollywood. Among their proposals, the Writers Guild of America calls for the “regulated use of artificial intelligence”, adding that AI shouldn’t “write or rewrite literary material”, or be used to generate source material for humans to subsequently work on.
Equally important, given the nature of machine learning, which recursively improves as it is fed more data, is that material worked on by humans should not be used to train AI. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers rejected those proposals. Their counter-offer? To hold “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology”. A powerful industry actor refusing to accept constraints regarding the use of AI is no longer the stuff of science fiction.
That white collar jobs are those most exposed to automation was also put forward in a recent note by Goldman Sachs. It claimed that 18% of all global work could be automated by AI, a figure rising to 25% in the UK and US. But while the most vulnerable positions were in office and administrative work, legal services, architecture and engineering, the least exposed were in construction, installation and maintenance.
But even if machine learning can perform repetitive tasks like accountancy and legal services, or perform roles which synthesise information quickly, can it really intrude on the creative industries? After all, the value of screenwriters resides in that most human of resources, the imagination.
Until recently it was fashionable to answer in the negative. In his 2017 report on the creative industries for the UK government, Peter Bazalgette mentioned the word “automation” three times and “artificial intelligence” just once. Where the paper does reference technological change, it cites that same 2015 study by Nesta – which concluded that 87% of creative jobs have either no or low chance of being automated. Among the safest occupations, according to the study, were “PR and communication activities”, which stood less than a 12% chance of being automated, and computer programming – which was 8%. Fast forward to February this year, and ChatGPT3 (since surpassed by ChatGPT4, released in March) successfully passed the interview for a level 3 engineer at Google. A government report from just six years ago already looks as dated as a game of Snake on a Nokia 3210.
At the heart of all of this – from computer programming to writing shows like Succession and Ozark – is the question of precisely how “creative” creative work is. While an algorithm isn’t going to direct the next Citizen Kane, or author an epic to rival Tolstoy (at least not yet), it seems inevitable that machine learning will replace many of the tasks involved in creating things like games, novels, films and series.
This will start with the replacing of seemingly lower-level tasks – think translating code in programming or writing initial drafts of dialogue for a script – and progress from there. Hence the screenwriters’ demands – which are explicitly aware of how AI will improve over time.
Rather than the rise of the robots wiping out entire professions, machine learning will remove entry level positions in dozens of industries – meaning these jobs still exist, only there will be fewer of them. This is not only an issue regarding employment, but poses deeper questions about how to sustain the conveyor belt of future human talent.
Geoffrey Hinton, who recently resigned from his position at Google so he could “talk about the dangers of AI”, has already criticised the role of competition and commercial incentives when it comes to the technology. “I think Google was very responsible to begin with”, he opined at the Emtech conference earlier this month. But once “OpenAI had built similar things using […] money from Microsoft, and Microsoft decided to put it out there, then Google didn’t have much choice. If you’re going to live in a capitalist system, you can’t stop Google competing with Microsoft.” What is driving the technology isn’t a thoughtful weighing up of rewards and risks, of which there are many, but the economic prize of disrupting multiple trillion dollar industries.
The idea that capitalist competition creates consequences beyond the intentions of capitalists is nothing new. In The Communist Manifesto, Marx wrote how capitalist society had conjured up “such gigantic means of production and of exchange” that it was akin to a sorcerer “no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.” What Marx had in mind when he wrote those lines were the rising ziggurats of the Industrial Revolution, dotting the skylines of Europe’s cities. Yet more than 170 years later they read as even more apt in the unfolding race for AI. If the sorcerers are Google, Microsoft, Apple and Meta, then the key question is this: if any of them create a new form of intelligence can they control the consequences?
But we don’t need to go as far as speculating whether AI would, as Hinton muses, mean humanity is merely “a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence”. The fact that striking screenwriters are arguing against recursive learning in their industry is significant enough. If machines are set to swallow ever more creative work, as well as the repetitive data-crunching that will cost millions of jobs in industries like accounting and legal services, then the conclusion should be obvious: we will need a radically different kind of economic system. Recognising that doesn’t require the emergence of a real life Skynet.

Here's how WIRED will—and won't—use the technology.,Some publications are already using text and image generators. Here's how WIRED will—and won't—use the technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tags,,"How WIRED Will Use Generative AI ToolsSome publications are already using text and image generators. Here’s how WIRED will—and won’t—use the technology.Like pretty much everyone else in the past few months, journalists have been trying out generative AI tools like ChatGPT to see whether they can help us do our jobs better. AI software can’t call sources and wheedle information out of them, but it can produce half-decent transcripts of those calls, and new generative AI tools can condense hundreds of pages of those transcripts into a summary.Writing stories is another matter, though. A few publications have tried—sometimes with disastrous results. It turns out current AI tools are very good at churning out convincing (if formulaic) copy riddled with falsehoods.This is WIRED, so we want to be on the front lines of new technology, but also to be ethical and appropriately circumspect. Here, then, are some ground rules on how we are using the current set of generative AI tools. We recognize that AI will develop and so may modify our perspective over time, and we’ll acknowledge any changes in this post. We welcome feedback at mail@wired.com.Text Generators (e.g. LaMDA, ChatGPT)We do not publish stories with text generated by AI, except when the fact that it’s AI-generated is the whole point of the story. (In such cases we’ll disclose the use and flag any errors.) This applies not just to whole stories but also to snippets—for example, ordering up a few sentences of boilerplate on how Crispr works or what quantum computing is. It also applies to editorial text on other platforms, such as email newsletters. (If we use it for non-editorial purposes like marketing emails, which are already automated, we will disclose that.)This is for obvious reasons: The current AI tools are prone to both errors and bias, and often produce dull, unoriginal writing. In addition, we think someone who writes for a living needs to constantly be thinking about the best way to express complex ideas in their own words. Finally, an AI tool may inadvertently plagiarize someone else’s words. If a writer uses it to create text for publication without a disclosure, we’ll treat that as tantamount to plagiarism.We do not publish text edited by AI either. While using AI to, say, shrink an existing 1,200-word story to 900 words might seem less problematic than writing a story from scratch, we think it still has pitfalls. Aside from the risk that the AI tool will introduce factual errors or changes in meaning, editing is also a matter of judgment about what is most relevant, original, or entertaining about the piece. This judgment depends on understanding both the subject and the readership, neither of which AI can do.We may try using AI to suggest headlines or text for short social media posts. We currently generate lots of suggestions manually, and an editor has to approve the final choices for accuracy. Using an AI tool to speed up idea generation won’t change this process substantively.We may try using AI to generate story ideas. An AI might help the process of brainstorming with a prompt like “Suggest stories about the impact of genetic testing on privacy,” or “Provide a list of cities where predictive policing has been controversial.” This may save some time and we will keep exploring how this can be useful. But some limited testing we’ve done has shown that it can also produce false leads or boring ideas. In any case, the real work, which only humans can do, is in evaluating which ones are worth pursuing. Where possible, for any AI tool we use, we will acknowledge the sources it used to generate information.We may experiment with using AI as a research or analytical tool. The current generation of AI chatbots that Google and Microsoft are adding to their search engines answer questions by extracting information from large amounts of text and summarizing it. A reporter might use these tools just like a regular search engine, or to summarize or trawl through documents or their own interview notes. But they will still have to go back to the original notes, documents, or recordings to check quotes and references. In this sense, using an AI bot is like using Google Search or Wikipedia: It might give you initial pointers, but you must follow the links back to the original sources.In practice, though, AI will make mistakes and miss things that a human would find relevant—perhaps so much so that it doesn’t save any time. Even if these tools do prove useful, we won’t want our reporters to rely on them any more than we’d let them rely on the limited information on Wikipedia. We’ll continue to insist on the same standards of research and original reporting as always. We also know that there are many professionally published research databases out there that come with lawful and highly accurate text- and data-mining tools, so we will constantly evaluate whether those meet our needs.Image Generators (e.g. Dall-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)We may publish AI-generated images or video, but only under certain conditions. Some working artists are now incorporating generative AI into their creative process in much the same way that they use other digital tools. We will commission work from these artists as long as it involves significant creative input by the artist and does not blatantly imitate existing work or infringe copyright. In such cases we will disclose the fact that generative AI was used.We specifically do not use AI-generated images instead of stock photography. Selling images to stock archives is how many working photographers make ends meet. At least until generative AI companies develop a way to compensate the creators their tools rely on, we won’t use their images this way.We or the artists we commission may use AI tools to spark ideas. This is the visual equivalent of brainstorming—type in a prompt and see what comes up. But if an artist uses this technique to come up with concepts, we will still require them to create original images using their normal process, and not merely reproduce what the AI suggested.This policy was updated on May 22, 2023 to allow the use of AI-generated images and video under certain conditions.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersLily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsLily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowMatt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowMatt Kamen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new report reveals that corporate legal department lawyers view generative AI’s potential similarly to their law firm peers, although adoption remains in early phases

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT have a future with corporate attorneys, who believe that such tools can and should be leveraged for legal work — although adoption still isn’t widespread and may be dependent on how legal departments are able to address the tools’ perceived risks.
A recent survey has found that those in corporate law departments are largely optimistic about the potential for generative AI and programs such as ChatGPT in performing both legal and non-legal work.

In total, 82% of respondents say generative AI can be applied to legal work, while 54% believe it should be applied to legal work, roughly the same rate as their law firm counterparts. Similarly, 70% believe these tools should be applied to non-legal work as well.

The survey, conducted in late April by the Thomson Reuters Institute, gathered insight from more than 580 respondent lawyers and legal professionals within corporate law departments in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The survey forms the basis of a new report, ChatGPT and Generative AI within Corporate Law Departments, which takes a deep look at the evolving attitudes towards generative AI and ChatGPT within departments, measuring awareness and adoption of the technology as well as lawyers’ views on its potential risks.
The report — which pairs with an earlier report done by the Thomson Reuters Institute, ChatGPT and Generative AI within Law Firms — also reveals several key findings that show not only how corporate law departments are approaching their ChatGPT and generative AI plans, but how those plans differ from law firms, and what legal departments want out their law firm partners’ generative AI use. These findings include:
Higher awareness and willingness to apply — Corporate law department leaders surveyed generally had high awareness of ChatGPT and generative AI, with 95% of respondents saying they had either heard of or read about ChatGPT or generative AI. That is higher than the awareness among law firm leaders, of whom 91% said they had either heard of or read about ChatGPT or generative AI.
More comfort with using the technologies — Only a small number of corporate law departments (11%) said they are already using or planning to use ChatGPT and generative AI in their legal operations; however, this was again significantly higher compared to use or planned use by law firm respondents (5%). Among those respondents who said they’re already using or planning to use ChatGPT and generative AI in their operations, 19% of both corporate legal and law firm respondents say they are already using these technologies on a wide-scale basis.
Acknowledgement of the risks involved — Three-quarters of corporate law professionals say they have risk concerns surrounding use of ChatGPT and generative AI, mostly in areas of accuracy, privacy, confidentiality, and security. Further, about one-quarter of respondents said they have received warnings from their companies about ChatGPT and generative AI usage for their work, but only 10% reported ChatGPT and generative AI had been banned at their companies. Many of the objections over AI use in legal work acknowledged the importance of human touch and expertise in the legal profession, the uniqueness and complexity of legal issues, the need for supervision and review of AI-generated materials, as well as ethical considerations and the perception by some that the technology may not be fully ready yet for appropriate use in legal.
Even with the potential risks, general counsel and others are actively preparing for a potentially major change in how work is done. “We’re not shutting our eyes to this,” says one senior legal officer at a large corporation. “We’re working on a solution that would work for us.”
And awareness of generative AI’s potential is likely to spur acceptance and usage, even in the usually reticent legal profession. “Before ChatGPT, technological advancement in legal software has been pretty incremental, but now it appears poised to take big steps toward something significant,” says Gunter Eren, General Counsel in Research & Development at the Business Innovation Centre of Konica Minolta in the U.K.

But the integration of Firefly into Photoshop will expand the offering, allowing for the creation of images and templates from scratch and making for quicker edits to photos.Since the launch of image-generating AI, many artists have raised concerns that the AI has been trained on artworks under copyright. Adobe has sought to avoid this issue by training the Firefly AI on 100m images from Adobe’s stock library, as well as images in the public domain where copyright has expired.

The director of digital media and strategy for Adobe Asia-Pacific, Chandra Sinnathamby, said the tool would make it easier for small businesses to do their own graphic design, but they were intended as a co-pilot to speed up the process rather than to replace graphic designers altogether.“The whole idea is: how do we help that creative accelerate, and that content creation at scale, with precision and speed?” he said. “Most campaigns you have to collaborate with various different things. So we how do we accelerate that collaboration process?”AI tools could be used by predators to ‘automate child grooming’, eSafety commissioner warnsRead moreAs AI fakes cause confusion online, Sinnathamby said Adobe has tried to set a standard, with content credentials acting as a marker on images that have been created or edited using AI. Adobe has 1,000 members of its content authenticity initiative and has made the technology available broadly since 2019.“It [is] one of the things that follows this asset no matter where [it goes], and therefore it’s always transparent where the asset the digital asset came from,” Sinnathamby said.Artists who have contributed to stock photos in the AI library are also identified using this tracking technology and paid when their work is used, according to Sinnathamby.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Graphic designAdobeComputingSoftwarenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveNancy Pelosi endorses Kamala Harris: ‘I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory’ – livePilot, 26, dies as her plane crashes after skydiving flight over Niagara FallsYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

A select number of the shapes are being pulled into a black hole representing the way large language models “suck up” data.
 
Western technology companies have long struggled with offering their services in languages other than English. A combination of political and technical challenges have impeded companies from building out bespoke, automated systems that function in even a fraction of the world’s 7,000+ languages. With large language models powered by machine learning, online services think they’ve solved the problem. But have they? 
A new report from CDT examines the new models that companies claim can analyze text across languages. The paper explains how these language models work and explores their capabilities and limits.
Large language models are a relatively new and buzzy technology that power all sorts of content generation and analysis tools. You’ve read about them in articles about ChatGPT and other generative AI tools that produce “human”-sounding text. But these models can also be adapted to analyze text. Companies already use large language models to moderate speech on social media, and may soon incorporate these tools into systems in other areas such as hiring and making public benefits decisions.
In the past, it has been difficult to develop AI systems — and especially large language models — in languages other than English because of what is known as the resourcedness gap. This gap describes the asymmetry in the availability of high quality digitized text that can serve as training data for a model. English is an extremely highly resourced language, whereas other languages, including those used predominantly in the Global South, often have fewer examples of high quality text (if any at all) on which to train language models.
Recently, developers have started to contend that they can bridge that gap with a new technology called multilingual language models: large language models trained on text from multiple languages at the same time. Multilingual language models, they claim, infer connections between languages, allowing them to uncover patterns in higher resourced languages and apply them to lower resourced languages. In other words, by training on lots of data from lots of languages, multilingual language models can more easily be adapted to tasks in languages other than English.
Language models in general, and multilingual language models in particular, may allow for the creation of exciting new technologies. An effort to increase access to online services in multiple languages will certainly be a step in the right direction. They may even help to open up different opportunities and access to information for people who speak one of the many languages that are currently rarely supported by online services. 
However, while multilingual language models show promise as a tool for content analysis, they also face key limitations:
Multilingual language models often rely on machine-translated text that can contain errors or terms native language speakers don’t actually use. When multilingual language models fail, their problems are hard to identify, diagnose, and fix.Multilingual language models do not and cannot work equally well in all languages.Multilingual language models fail to account for the contexts of local language speakers.
These shortcomings are amplified when used in high risk contexts. If these models are used to scan applications for asylum for example, errant systems may limit a users’ ability to access safety. In content moderation, misinterpretations of text can result in takedowns of posts which may erect barriers to information, particularly where not a lot of information in a particular language is available.
To adequately assess if these models are up to the task, we need to know more. Governments, technology companies, researchers, and civil society should not assume these models work better than they do, and should invest in greater transparency and accountability efforts in order to better understand the impact of these models on individuals’ rights and access to information and economic opportunities. Crucially, researchers from different language communities should be supported and be at the forefront of the effort to develop models and methods that build capacity for tools in different languages.
This new report is the third in a series published by CDT on the capabilities and limits of automated content analysis technology; the first focused on English-language social media content analysis technology and the second on multimedia content analysis tools.

In addition to investing more than $100 million annually to further integrate AI capabilities into its offerings, Thomson Reuters is developing a new plugin with Microsoft 365 Copilot.

Legal Current shares highlights of today’s announcement and what it means for legal professionals.

Incorporating Generative AI Capabilities Across Legal Solutions 

With a long history as a leader in leveraging AI and machine learning, Thomson Reuters has used increasingly sophisticated AI and machine-learning capabilities to improve search and expand analytics through product advances for decades. Thomson Reuters is now incorporating generative AI capabilities across its product suite, including Westlaw Precision, Practical Law and Drafting tools, which will be released in the second half of 2023.

 	Westlaw Precision: With generative AI, customers can find answers to complex legal questions in seconds, based on proprietary, expert content.
 	Practical Law: Smarter, faster access to the expertise of more than 650 attorney editors combined with the power of generative AI.
 	Legal Document Review and Summary: With generative AI reading through hundreds or even thousands of relevant documents in just seconds, customers can spot key risks, resolve questions, execute tasks, and generate powerful work product. Powered by HighQ, Practical Law, and Document Intelligence.
 	Legal Drafting: Bringing together Thomson Reuters trusted content and intelligence from across Westlaw, Practical Law, and Document Intelligence to surface key insights, legal knowledge, and answers to complex questions.

Plugin with Microsoft 365 Copilot

Working with Microsoft, Thomson Reuters has developed a contract drafting solution, powered by its legal products and content, and Copilot for Word. This integration will bolster efforts for redefined professional work starting with legal research, drafting, and client collaboration.

Providing users with a draft working document and access to trusted content where work happens – in Microsoft Word – legal professionals can use their expertise to edit, validate, and build the final document with integrated access to Thomson Reuters knowledge, content, and AI technology.

A demonstration of the integration between Thomson Reuters Legal Drafting and Microsoft 365 Copilot for Word will be shown during this week’s Microsoft Build event in Seattle. In the demo, Copilot creates a draft contract with help from a Thomson Reuters plugin that surfaces intelligence and content from Westlaw, Practical Law, and Document Intelligence – delivering in minutes work that used to take hours directly into Microsoft Word.

AI and Data Principles 

Thomson Reuters recently updated its AI and Data Principles, reinforcing its strong commitment to building trustworthy, practical, and beneficial AI for customers. The update reflects recognition of the evolving AI technology landscape and the need to unlock AI in secure, transparent, and accountable ways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

Generative AI companies will change the future of work.getty

Given the current economic climate, businesses are acutely interested in reducing costs, increasing efficiencies and exploring new growth opportunities. Technological innovations to optimize existing processes could dramatically increase a company’s bottom line. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 marked a turning point in how Generative AI can be used in the workplace - setting off a wave of change in how we work.

Generative AI is powered by models (e.g. algorithms and architectures) trained on a trove of data that is gathered through public domains. With this data, these Generative AI models are able to learn patterns, structures, and relationships, enabling them to generate new content and ideas based on their acquired knowledge. Although the underlying infrastructure behind Generative AI models have been around for many years, through an easy-to-use user interface, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has enabled more knowledge workers to gain access to this technology. Under the hood of any Large Language Model, which is what powers ChatGPT, transformers use self-attention to predict the next word in the sentence. This allows the model to come up with answers that are coherent to the average person.

Given how easy it is to use Generative AI models and the fact that the compute costs have decreased drastically over the last few months, more and more startups are leveraging them to create Generative AI applications for office workers. From summarizing video calls to automatically creating marketing copies, here are five companies that are able to improve our day-to-day workflows.

Guru AI
Guru is unique on this list in that it uses cutting edge vision models instead of Large Language Models to allow developers to quickly create interactive video AI products. Guru has an out-of-the-box model that makes it simple to analyze user motion in videos. Not only is it able to recognize the specific movements of people, and objects, it is able to understand what actions they are taking. For example, swinging a golf club or walking up a flight of stairs. It also gives developers the capability to conduct time series analysis - counting the number of reps an action is taking place or trimming a video to identify specific segments of motion. With Guru, professionals no longer have to just describe how to do a movement, but can show the specific visual markers on the video - allowing the recipients to truly understand and mimic said movement.
So how can businesses use Guru? A physiotherapist could create an app that performs custom physical therapy assessments virtually, correcting patients on how best to do certain exercises. A basketball team could use it to compare and contrast how different players are shooting 3-pointers - pinpointing exactly what players are doing down to each specific movement.

Loopin
Loopin records and summarizes video calls, allowing teams to focus on what matters instead of taking notes during these meetings. After the meeting ends, it automatically sends a meeting summary to each participant on what was discussed and lays out the action items as next steps as well. What differentiates Loopin from other similar tools is that it’s able to connect the dots between meetings – allowing teams to review notes from related meetings without going through other applications.
Refact
If you’re a software engineer, refact would definitely speed up the software development cycle. Not only does it suggest code as you’re writing, but it also identifies code that can be optimized – making it easier to understand. Refact also has the ability to analyze your code and provide documentation on what the lines of code are supposed to do. There is also an AI Chatbot that you’re able to converse with about the code in question – allowing anyone to get a better understanding of the syntax of the code given a specific context. This is especially helpful for junior engineers or students who are just learning how to code.Alicent can scan through any piece of content and provide a tailored summary of that page with the ... [+] voice of the AI assistant.getty
Alicent
Alicent is a Chrome Extension that is able to take on different roles as powerful AI assistants. It is able to generate highly specific texts for different use cases such as writing social media posts or landing page copies. Alicent stands out in that it can scan through any piece of content and provides a tailored summary of that page with the voice of the AI assistant. Marketers for a retail brand can instantaneously come up with email copies just by scanning their own product pages – coming up with tailored descriptions for each product in their inventory.

Fabric
Fabric is a unified collaborative workspace, the command center of all your files - solving digital clutter and chaos. It uses semantic search to look through all your files and enables you to find what you need even if you don’t recall exactly where it is. You’re able to instantaneously save content from a website, make a note of it and share with your coworkers as well.
So what’s next?
The five startups mentioned above are just a few of the many companies that employ Generative AI to enable employees to be more productive - automating work that would have taken a lot more time or resources to accomplish before. As the technology matures, I envision a future where each one of us will have numerous AI helpers in many facets of our professional lives. This will reduce the amount of time spent on the mundane and routine work we have to do, while empowering us to do work that we truly enjoy and is truly value-add.Lawrence Wang '19Lawrence Wang '19

What a difference six months makes. Until late last year, few people outside of cutting-edge artificial intelligence had even heard of Large Language Models or generative AI.

Now, of course, it’s a different world. When OpenAI revealed ChatGPT in late 2022, it created an explosion of global interest and excitement on a scale we’ve rarely seen before.


Since then, companies like Google
GOOG
+2.4%, Microsoft
MSFT
+1.4%, and Meta have created their own large language models.

It seems everyone, everywhere — from school students to seniors to C-suite executives — is talking about how it’s going to change everything.

They’re not wrong. Generative AI represents a step change in capability because it’s both incredibly powerful and incredibly flexible. And it’s that adaptability which means it’s going to reinvent the way companies run their businesses, serve their customers, and get work done.
PROMOTED
Retail is right at the center 
For retailers, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Embedded into the enterprise digital core, generative AI will transform their ability to optimize tasks, manage data, create faster insights, innovate with new experiences, augment front-line workers, and connect and communicate with customers.
Accenture’s

The same research found more than nine in ten executives saying foundation models will play an important role in their retail strategies in the next three to five years. And over half of those surveyed already have their eyes on generative AI experiments in areas like customer support and process automation.

It’s not hard to see why the industry is so excited. Let’s consider just a few of the ways retail will be impacted.
New ways to engage with customers

We’ve all seen how effective ChatGPT can be at conversing, answering questions, and summarizing information in a natural, engaging, and relevant way. It’s easy to see how this could be extended to retail customer support — responding to queries, explaining products, offering product recommendations, and more.
Just think, every role in every retailer has the potential to be reinvented, with people working with “AI co-pilots” becomes the norm. We can also expect a large number of new tasks for people to perform, such as ensuring the accurate and responsible use of AI systems. It’s why organizations that invest in training people to work alongside generative AI will have a significant advantage.
Leading brands are already pushing ahead with this kind of AI-backed digital experience. Macy’s, for example, uses AI-powered shopping assistants to improve customer experiences by allowing shoppers to have their questions about product availability and location automatically answered.
What about personalization? Brands like Starbucks and others have been using AI algorithms to suggest personalized product recommendations for several years now. But generative AI’s ability to crunch vast amounts of data and provide insights in real time will take this to a whole new level.
That’s all the more important given how difficult retailers have traditionally found it to bring together all the disparate insights they have on their customers in a coherent way. Generative AI will be the key that unlocks that vision — long talked about but as yet unrealized — of providing hyper-relevant retail suggestions to each customer in each moment.
New ways to run the business
One of the things generative AI excels at is summarizing insights from a wide variety of unstructured data sources. This makes it ideally suited to tasks like demand forecasting and inventory management.
Using sources like historical sales data, market trends, weather conditions, and social media sentiment, retailers will be able to get a much more accurate picture of upcoming demand, enabling them to minimize stockouts, reduce excess inventory, and improve operational efficiency.
There’s also great promise in areas like product design. By fine-tuning generative AI on existing designs and other data sources, retailers will be able to generate brand-relevant and on-trend designs instantly. The technology even opens up the prospect of customers customizing their own products for their own needs on demand.
Stores, too, will be transformed
In recent years, retailers have been focused on blending physical and digital experiences in their stores. This is another area that generative AI promises to radically enhance.
Take merchandising. By analyzing product attributes, historical sales and customer preferences, generative AI will be able to suggest optimized store layouts and product placements, as well as provide enhanced personalized wayfinding experiences to shoppers.
Imagine, for example, a generative AI-based app that guided you around your local store, proactively recommending products relevant to your unique preferences and needs in each moment — whether that’s a sandwich that fits your current dietary regimen or the latest assortment from your favorite fashion brand.
And what about virtual try-ons? With generative AI able to produce extraordinarily lifelike images on demand, apparel and beauty retailers will be able to provide “magic mirror” experiences that show how different products, styles and colors would fit a customer — and even predicting how that fit would change over time.
Infinite possibilities
We’re only at the start of the generative AI revolution. And we’ve only had a taste of the true impact on retail. But the technology is advancing incredibly fast. It’s why it’s critically important to ensure AI is used responsibly. That means setting guardrails for acquiring, refining, and deploying data. It also means thinking through cybersecurity operations. Managing regulatory and privacy risks is a good start, and retailers can take it a step further by making certain the technology they’re using is responsible by design.
There’s little doubt that, soon, strong generative AI capabilities will be a baseline requirement for any retailer that wants to keep pace with its peers.
It’s why I think retail leaders should lean in strongly on this exciting new technology — and start exploring how it can transform the way they run their businesses and serve their customers. It’s an overused phrase but this time ‘test and learn’ can be a true strategy for how to lean-in and keep-up with the latest AI trends.

  Generative AI — in the form of large language model (LLM) applications like ChatGPT, image generators such as Stable Diffusion and Adobe Firefly, and game rendering techniques like NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation — is rapidly ushering in a new era of computing for productivity, content creation, gaming and more.
At the Microsoft Build developer conference, NVIDIA and Microsoft today showcased a suite of advancements in Windows 11 PCs and workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs to meet the demands of generative AI.
More than 400 Windows apps and games already employ AI technology, accelerated by dedicated processors on RTX GPUs called Tensor Cores. Today’s announcements, which include tools to develop AI on Windows PCs, frameworks to optimize and deploy AI, and driver performance and efficiency improvements, will empower developers to build the next generation of Windows apps with generative AI at their core.
“AI will be the single largest driver of innovation for Windows customers in the coming years,” said Pavan Davuluri, corporate vice president of Windows silicon and system integration at Microsoft. “By working in concert with NVIDIA on hardware and software optimizations, we’re equipping developers with a transformative, high-performance, easy-to-deploy experience.”
Develop Models With Windows Subsystem for Linux
AI development has traditionally taken place on Linux, requiring developers to either dual-boot their systems or use multiple PCs to work in their AI development OS while still accessing the breadth and depth of the Windows ecosystem.
Over the past few years, Microsoft has been building a powerful capability to run Linux directly within the Windows OS, called Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). NVIDIA has been working closely with Microsoft to deliver GPU acceleration and support for the entire NVIDIA AI software stack inside WSL. Now developers can use Windows PC for all their local AI development needs with support for GPU-accelerated deep learning frameworks on WSL.
With NVIDIA RTX GPUs delivering up to 48GB of RAM in desktop workstations, developers can now work with models on Windows that were previously only available on servers. The large memory also improves the performance and quality for local fine-tuning of AI models, enabling designers to customize them to their own style or content. And because the same NVIDIA AI software stack runs on NVIDIA data center GPUs, it’s easy for developers to push their models to Microsoft Azure Cloud for large training runs.
Rapidly Optimize and Deploy Models
With trained models in hand, developers need to optimize and deploy AI for target devices.
Microsoft released the Microsoft Olive toolchain for optimization and conversion of PyTorch models to ONNX, enabling developers to automatically tap into GPU hardware acceleration such as RTX Tensor Cores. Developers can optimize models via Olive and ONNX, and deploy Tensor Core-accelerated models to PC or cloud. Microsoft continues to invest in making PyTorch and related tools and frameworks work seamlessly with WSL to provide the best AI model development experience.
Improved AI Performance, Power Efficiency
Once deployed, generative AI models demand incredible inference performance. RTX Tensor Cores deliver up to 1,400 Tensor TFLOPS for AI inferencing. Over the last year, NVIDIA has worked to improve DirectML performance to take full advantage of RTX hardware.
On May 24, we’ll release our latest optimizations in Release 532.03 drivers that combine with Olive-optimized models to deliver big boosts in AI performance. Using an Olive-optimized version of the Stable Diffusion text-to-image generator with the popular Automatic1111 distribution, performance is improved over 2x with the new driver.
Stable Diffusion performance tested on GeForce RTX 4090 using Automatic1111 and Text-to-Image function.
With AI coming to nearly every Windows application, efficiently delivering inference performance is critical — especially for laptops. Coming soon, NVIDIA will introduce new Max-Q low-power inferencing for AI-only workloads on RTX GPUs. It optimizes Tensor Core performance while keeping power consumption of the GPU as low as possible, extending battery life and maintaining a cool, quiet system.  The GPU can then dynamically scale up for maximum AI performance when the workload demands it.
Join the PC AI Revolution Now
Top software developers — like Adobe, DxO, ON1 and Topaz — have already incorporated NVIDIA AI technology with more than 400 Windows applications and games optimized for RTX Tensor Cores.
“AI, machine learning and deep learning power all Adobe applications and drive the future of creativity. Working with NVIDIA we continuously optimize AI model performance to deliver the best possible experience for our Windows users on RTX GPUs.” — Ely Greenfield, CTO of digital media at Adobe
“NVIDIA is helping to optimize our WinML model performance on RTX GPUs, which is accelerating the AI in DxO DeepPRIME, as well as providing better denoising and demosaicing, faster.” — Renaud Capolunghi, senior vice president of engineering at DxO
“Working with NVIDIA and Microsoft to accelerate our AI models running in Windows on RTX GPUs is providing a huge benefit to our audience. We’re already seeing 1.5x performance gains in our suite of AI-powered photography editing software.” — Dan Harlacher, vice president of products at ON1
“Our extensive work with NVIDIA has led to improvements across our suite of photo- and video-editing applications. With RTX GPUs, AI performance has improved drastically, enhancing the experience for users on Windows PCs.” — Suraj Raghuraman, head of AI engine development at Topaz Labs
NVIDIA and Microsoft are making several resources available for developers to test drive top generative AI models on Windows PCs. An Olive-optimized version of the Dolly 2.0 large language model is available on Hugging Face. And a PC-optimized version of NVIDIA NeMo large language model for conversational AI is coming soon to Hugging Face.
Developers can also learn how to optimize their applications end-to-end to take full advantage of GPU-acceleration via the NVIDIA AI for accelerating applications developer site.
The complementary technologies behind Microsoft’s Windows platform and NVIDIA’s dynamic AI hardware and software stack will help developers quickly and easily develop and deploy generative AI on Windows 11.
Microsoft Build runs through Thursday, May 25. Tune into to learn more on shaping the future of work with AI.

Much of this speculation is fueled by the ability of these large language models(LLMs) to write code.As someone who has been in the data analysis field for the majority of my professional career, understanding the impact of generative AI in our field is something that has definitely piqued my interest. Giving in to curiosity, I have since spent a fair amount of time assessing the current capabilities of generative AI within the context of data analysis.In this article, I summarize and share my findings with you as I believe generative AI will have a significant role in data analysis work going forward. Furthermore, I believe that it is imperative for the data analyst community to understand the profound impact it will have on not only their field but the business landscape as a whole.Where We Stand TodayAt this point, we know that generative AI can write SQL, Python, and R code. We can also assume the efficiency of the code they produce will only get better over time with continuous fine-tuning. But that’s just the start.At the end of March (2023), OpenAI’s ChatGPT released a plugin called Code Interpreter. If you are one of the few who currently have access to the Alpha version, you can upload data files into it and invoke Python to perform regression analysis and descriptive analysis, look for patterns in your data and even create visualizations. All without having to write or even know a line of Python code! Esteemed Wharton School of Business professor Ethan Mollick has a nice write-up on this.So there you have it. The ability to load, analyze, and present data without writing a stitch of code. Game over yes? Not so fast.As incredibly impressive as these capabilities are, there are some significant limitations to Code Intrepretor, that are indicative of some of the challenges that generative AI would have in taking over the data analysis industry.First, it requires the upload of ONE table. One two-dimensional CSV file (currently limited to 100 MB). The size limitation aside, imagine being tasked with building one table with all of your company’s data…I could probably stop there, but let's go on.With your one table in hand, you now have to get approval to get your one table with ALL of your company’s data pushed outside of your company’s firewall into an LLM that they have no control over…We can probably stop there.The current alternative(more on this later) to the above would be that your company builds its own LLM. While theoretically possible, the complexities of training and fine-tuning the model, the expertise required and the enormous costs of doing so would only make that cost-effective for an extremely short list of companies.But for the sake of understanding, let's take a step back and imagine your company is on that list.But first, let’s start with some perspective. If we look back to the introduction of business intelligence tools in the early 2000s, the great value of those tools lies in their ability to provide non-technical, line-of-business people the ability to leverage their domain knowledge by enabling them to select, analyze and present data, without writing a stitch of code. Sound familiar?Providing user-friendly means to analyze data is nothing new. It will always have incredible value. Indeed, it is a multi-billion dollar industry that continues to grow. However, these tools have no use without domain knowledge. This applies to any data analysis, regardless of the tool(s) being used. Even if it's generative AI. Without domain knowledge, we do not know what questions to ask of our data. And even if the questions were provided to us, how do we interpret our findings?And in my view, the greatest value of data analysis work lies in its ability to answer ad hoc questions. Unforeseen, mission-critical questions. Complex, multi-layered, nonlinear types of questions. Answering these questions requires domain knowledge.For example, why did sales on our best-selling product just drop off a cliff? Our primary supplier just went out of business, what do we do? Why did our customer churn rate double last month? These are not straightforward types of questions that can follow an established decision tree.What these few examples have in common is that they require immediate answers to situational questions that have never been asked before. And that is really the key. If you understand the construct of generative AI, its inability to answer questions of this nature is truly its Achilles heel in ever being able to replace data analysts fully.To briefly summarize, generative AI utilizes existing data sets to ‘train’ an LLM to generate a probability-driven answer based on whatever training data it has been fed. And while you can continuously fine-tune your model with ever more precise data sets, how would you train your model on multi-layered, situational questions that have never been asked before?It would be analogous to you starting a new job as a data analyst in an industry that you are not yet familiar with. And on day one, you are asked to urgently answer one of the questions above. Where would you even start? What data would you pull? How would you even know what all of the potential variables you would need to consider? And, even if you could somehow derive an answer, how would you know if it is correct?It is for these reasons that I don’t foresee the role of data analyst ever being fully replaced by generative AI. However… generative AI, in its current state, already has many uses in the data analysis field and those uses will only continue to expand with ever-increasing functionality.Current Potential Uses for Generative AI in Data AnalysisAs of today, the highest and best use of generative AI in the data analysis field is its ability to both write code and in turn, explain the code it writes (which it does quite well). I’ve personally used it to help me write and understand Python code.For those of you who are looking to enter the data analysis field, I could not encourage you enough to take advantage of generative AI to help you learn to code. It would have greatly speeded up my learning curve when I was first cutting my teeth in this field.In another, truly exciting development for data analysts, generative AI has fueled the development of dedicated coding tools. GitHub has released its Copilot product, which can suggest coding solutions/improvements in real-time as you are writing it!Earlier in this article, I referred to the potential hurdles companies would face in building their own LLMs. There is possibly one new alternative to that: Databricks has recently released an open-source LLM called ’ Dolly’. In theory, this could solve the issues of cost (being open source) and having to push your data outside of your company’s firewall. It’s a smaller-scale LLM, more suited for focused datasets.I mention Dolly, primarily as an example of how quickly developments in the field of generative AI are moving and as a heads-up to how they may affect the data analysis field going forward.As we have already seen, the evolution of AI will only continue to progress at light speed.ConclusionThere is no doubt in my mind that generative AI will reshape the workflows in data analysis. Generally speaking, repetitive types of tasks or even analyses will in time be performed by generative AI. I could also see coding becoming more of a commodity, versus being a highly developed skill.Based on the above, I believe that the prototypical data analyst in the future will possess business line-level domain knowledge combined with an ability to incorporate generative AI tools to help them be more efficient and productive with their time.Lastly, on a personal note, I would encourage anyone reading this to embrace generative AI. Learn about it and use it both in your personal and business lives. With new APIs and plugins constantly being created, its reach and capabilities will only grow.For better or worse.I enjoy writing about topics that impact the data analysis field.

When we hear or read a string of words, we are unconsciously making predictions about what’s coming next. That’s much like what AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard do. At root they are predicting what the next word should be in their responses, with human-like accuracy.
Large language model AIs and human brains are fundamentally different, but that doesn’t mean that AIs don’t have a role in understanding the human brain. Gina Kuperberg, the Dennett Stibel Professor of Cognitive Science and professor of psychology, studies language comprehension—how the brain makes sense of language. She and her colleagues use AI to help understand human cognition.
“As I’m speaking to you right now, you’re taking every single word and you’re incrementally building up meaning from the combination of words that I’m using,” she told me. “You’re doing that really quickly. You’re not waiting until the end of each sentence or each clause to do that. You’re doing that as you’re going along, and based on your interpretation, you’re predicting what I’m going to say next.”
In her research, she is trying to figure out the neurobiology of that mechanism, where in the brain it takes place, how quickly it happens, and precisely how it happens.
Tufts Now spoke with Kuperberg, who is also a psychiatrist in the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, to learn more about language and learning.
Tufts Now: What similarities and differences are there between large language model AI chatbots and humans in terms of learning languages?
Gina Kuperberg: A large language model is trained with very, very large bodies of text. It’s trained to predict upcoming words. In doing so, it picks up the statistical contingencies, the very complex higher-order relationships between words. 
Our brains are constantly predicting the next word, too, and our brains are very good at picking up statistical contingencies and very complex higher order relationships between words.
So, in one sense, you could say the reason why these large language models are so successful is because they capitalize on something that our brains do all the time. But just because these chatbots can predict the next word and perform so well doesn’t necessarily mean that the precise mechanisms by which they do that are the same as those used by the human brain.
Is there anything that cognitive neuroscientists can learn from these AIs to understand the human brain?
Well, it may be that they are learning similar representations to the human brain, and that may tell us something. But it’s also important to recognize that, even though these large language models produce language so well, the precise computational mechanism by which they get there are quite different from those used by the human brain. 
We know quite a lot about the neurobiology of cognitive processes, including language in the brain. And we also know quite a lot about how these large language models are constructed. And they’re very different.
For example, in the human brain, with different layers of cortical structure, we know that there’s constant interaction and feedforward and feedback interactions between these different layers.
And we know that the state-of-the-art language models like ChatGPT, the transformer-based language models, don’t have feedback interactions between layers. They’re wired differently from the human brain. 
So just because you can get a really good end result with them—and we can use that to try and understand human language comprehension and production—that doesn’t that we can make claims about the precise connectivity and the precise mechanisms by which it reaches that end goal.
Do you use these AIs in your research?
We use them more as a tool to try and understand how the brain works. For example, we know that the brain predicts upcoming words, so we use ChatGPT to predict upcoming words and then look to see how the predictability of each upcoming word correlates with brain activity.

For another project in my lab, we’re looking at produced speech, and we’re looking to see the similarities between ChatGPT predictions of each word that someone produces and what the brain produces. 
We’re also seeing whether the predictability of each word produced by people with schizophrenia is reduced compared to our controls. And then we’re also giving the language model progressively less context to see whether that makes a difference. 
I’m curious about the work that you’re doing with schizophrenia—can you explain that a bit more?
Speech produced by people with schizophrenia, which is a severe mental disorder, can in some patients be characterized by what’s known as thought disorder. That means that their language can be disorganized and difficult to understand. 
We’re trying to figure out whether we can describe the speech produced by people with schizophrenia in terms of reduced predictability, and whether people with schizophrenia predict on the basis of global or more local context. A large language model is ideal for testing this hypothesis. My graduate student Tori Sharpe is leading the project.
We have access to speech samples produced by people with schizophrenia in their very first episode of psychosis as they’re describing pictures, and we can assess the predictability of each word that they produce. We find that predictability of each word is reduced in schizophrenia. 
That’s interesting, but what’s more interesting is that, based on only the local context, people with schizophrenia produce language that is just as predictable as the language produced by people without schizophrenia. The way that we were able to figure this out is by giving the large language model different amounts of context to make its prediction.
When you give the model words 1-50, and estimate the predictability of word 51, and then compare people with and without schizophrenia, you find that the people with schizophrenia produce less predictable words. But if you give the model words 42 to 49, and use this limited context to estimate predictability, then it turns out that there is no difference between the predictability of the people with schizophrenia and healthy controls.




“What’s cool about predictive coding is that it’s biologically and cognitively plausible—it was first used to describe phenomenon and the visual system. It has lots of feedforward and feedback connections across layers just like the human brain.”

That’s important, because it tells us that people with schizophrenia are able to predict the next word based on local rather than global context. That’s been a hypothesis in the research for a while, but now with large language models, we can systematically test it.
Is that related to memory—that people with schizophrenia can’t hold words one through 41 in short-term memory, only words 42 to 49?
It may well be related to their working memory, but that’s still an open question. In our current research with one measure of short-term working memory, we saw no difference. It may be a more specific kind of verbal working memory that is impaired in patients. We also found that the local versus global difference predicted the degree of thought disorder within the patient group, which is important because it provides a way to operationalize this clinical symptom.
Are there other uses of AIs in your research?
A grad student in my lab, Samer Nour Eddine, is developing a “toy” language model based on the principles of an algorithm known as predictive coding. The nice thing about toy language models is that, unlike large language models where the inner workings are somewhat obscure, you can understand how they work and tweak their precise mechanisms and algorithms.
The predictive coding algorithm has been very successful in explaining important phenomena in the human visual system. What Samer did was to use the precise architecture and algorithm of predictive coding to simulate a neural signature called the N400, which is highly sensitive to the predictability of each incoming word.  When you get an incoming word that is unpredictable, the N400 is large, but it gets smaller and smaller as words become more and more predictable. 
Samer has used predictive coding to simulate this N400 effect. There’s no way a large language model can do that. A large language model can describe the sensitivity of this N400 effect to predictability, but it can’t simulate its time course—the rise and the fall of the N400 over time— and it can’t simulate other factors that the N400 is sensitive to. 
What’s cool about predictive coding is that it’s biologically and cognitively plausible—it was first used to describe phenomenon and the visual system. It has lots of feedforward and feedback connections across layers just like the human brain. I think some people are trying to develop large language models based on predictive coding principles, but it is quite different from the state-of-the-art things like ChatGPT, whose architecture is quite different from a predictive coding architecture.
Some people are alarmed by chatbots’ abilities. You seem to be using them in useful ways in your research. What is your general take?
It’s just like anything, isn’t it? When paper first came into use, Plato was alarmed; he thought people would use it unwisely and it would destroy the brain’s ability to think and use memory. 
I think one should certainly be alarmed in terms of large language models being unprecedented tools for disseminating misinformation. But there are always amazing uses for new technology and new AI tools. 
It’s going to change the way people write. It can’t change the way people think. It’s not going to make us obsolete. So, like the internet, there are really good things to be done with AI tools, and really bad things, and it’s up to us to use these things wisely and carefully.

The recent comeuppance of generative AI tools has raised the discussion around prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is the art and science of giving generative AI models the right prompts to receive the output you want. A broader definition could also include your ability to choose the right models for the right purposes and determine whether to use generative AI in the first place.
The value you can gain from generative AI — both as a company and as an individual knowledge worker — is directly correlated to your prompt engineering ability. However, there has been a lot of debate lately about what role this skill will play in the future of work. Some people argue that a small subset of people who become experts at prompt engineering now will dominate the labor market tomorrow. But I see it unfolding similar to the way using Zoom or searching on Google became a technology cornerstone for any knowledge worker. 






There might be a very small group of specialized prompt engineers or highly-paid generative AI specialists with deep industry-specific expertise, but most people will add it to their regular toolbox without being paid explicitly for it. This is partly because the organizations behind AI research are incentivized to empower broad adoption and accessibility; this is why ChatGPT came out in the first place. Just like the Internet, it will only become easier to use. In many cases, users will not even know generative AI is being used.

Which companies are the most important vendors in AI and hyperautomation? Check out the Acceleration Economy AI/Hyperautomation Top 10 Shortlist.

Prompt Engineering Principles
In the spirit of bringing everyone on board the generative AI movement, here are some value-added prompt engineering principles you can apply in your company. These principles come from a mix of my personal experience having applied generative AI tools in my startup, advice from friends building AI companies, a ChatGPT prompting course run in partnership with OpenAI that I just finished, my LinkedIn feed that’s been almost exclusively AI-related for the past few months, and this excellent podcast episode from Andreessen Horowitz and Guy Parsons, a designer who compiled a book on prompt engineering.
Prompting is a highly iterative process. Just like building a startup, the best strategy for prompting is to start as quickly as possible. Even if you’re not sure exactly what output you want, start with a prompt that heads in the right direction. You can refine your follow-up prompt based on the model’s first response. Meticulously planning out your early prompts is like renting an office and buying a fancy espresso machine for your startup before having a customer.Write clear and specific prompts — that doesn’t mean short. Your prompts can be entire paragraphs with multiple sections, specific sub-requests, or examples.Use delimiters like quotes, brackets, or dashes to help the model differentiate each part of your prompt. For example, you can summarize an article by copy-pasting it into ChatGPT or an API call to GPT-3, but you need to identify the quoted text through quotation marks and leave your questions about the text unmarked. This helps the model parse through your input.Ask for a structured and specific output by telling the model exactly what kind of output you want. If you’re doing market research on competitors, for instance, ask for a list of 30 bullet points wherein each bullet contains the name of a competitor separated by their employee count and their monthly recurring revenue (MRR).Be flexible on details. Sometimes models will not accommodate all your given rules. GPT-3, for example, often will not adhere to exact word count limits. In these cases, you need some flexibility, perhaps by asking for a sentence count limit instead.Few-shot prompting is when you give a successful example or setup, and ask the model to complete it or repeat it but with different content. Try this technique if the model is not following the guidelines you set in your input. This problem can arise either because your desired output is harder to describe in words than in examples or because the model doesn’t have much training data relating to the topic.To reduce hallucinations, or outputs that are blatantly false but sound convincing, ask the model to pull actual quotes or pieces of information from a source document and ask for the source so you can fact-check the output. This is especially relevant if you’re using the AI-powered Bing or ChatGPT plugins.Play around with temperature, which is a large language model‘s (LLM) degree of randomness or freedom of exploration. For creative applications, a higher temperature can yield more original results. This variable is accessible through API calls to models like GPT-3.5, not through the web ChatGPT interface.Fine-tuned, application-specific LLMs beat base models like GPT-4. When it comes to current AI systems, which don’t have full-fledged consciousness yet, breadth is at a tradeoff with depth in capability. Designing an LLM with custom data sets that are fine-tuned for your industry-specific application will yield better results. You can use base models, like the GPT-n series, as a starting point.It’s easy to get outputs 80% right but nailing the final 20% is often impossible. It’s difficult to edit small details within outputs compared to, say, using Photoshop instead of Midjourney. This is one reason why companies need to keep a human in the loop if generative AI is being used in a critical workflow. If generated assets are being posted on company social media accounts, for example, there should be human oversight. That human should also be able to make manual tweaks if needed. Oftentimes, generative AI is just a starting point. This is especially true if you’re generating code to be used in production.Leverage resources like PromptBase, AIPRM, and Parsons’ book on prompting to get inspiration, find effective prompts for your application or industry, and supercharge your use of generative AI.
Guidebook: Insights Into the Why and How of AI and Hyperautomation’s Impact
Here are some additional in-depth prompt engineering principles described in an enterprise context, courtesy of Microsoft.
Evolving AI Skillsets
The current definition of prompt engineering is certainly not final. Companies of all shapes and sizes must continue adapting the skills of their team around new tools and trends. Whether it’s encouraging your engineers to build a ChatGPT plugin through a weekend hackathon, which we recently held at the incubator where I work, or supercharging your growth team through generative AI-powered A/B testing, there are many possibilities.
One tool to highlight is AutoGPT, which is essentially GPT-3.5 paired with a bot that autonomously completes tasks. For example, a friend of mine recently ordered a pizza using only the AutoGPT interface. AutoGPT will take a user’s high-level instruction — like ordering a pizza, writing a business plan, or booking a hotel — and use the GPT-3.5 LLM in combination with various programs to complete the task. It will ask follow-up questions to receive the information it needs from you, like your login. This is similar to ChatGPT plugins which give users access to real-time data streams, perform functions with existing services, and make transactions directly through the ChatGPT interface.
Being a new project, AutoGPT comes with many limitations. Its breadth and flexibility are offset by its lack of capability. It seems like ChatGPT plugins like those of Instacart or Expedia, which have direct access to company databases, are still a better option for consumers. Nonetheless, it highlights an exciting trend of combining traditional software stacks with natural language processing. This combination is powering a new wave of convenience for consumers or internal teams.
Final Thoughts
Altogether, prompting is an amazing skill to have. However, as tools become more widespread and easier to use, I believe prompt engineering will not be a very unique skill. It probably won’t give anyone a major advantage in labor markets five or 10 years down the line but, rather, become a baseline necessity. As such, it is vital for companies to upskill their workforce as we continue into the AI era. The residual internal innovation and even product development of doing so won’t hurt either.

Whether we realize it or not, advancements in artificial intelligence are increasingly influencing the paths of our careers.
Advancements in human capital management systems, more strategic and data-driven human resource and talent management practices, and increased attention to bias are all factors that are changing how people are hired, developed, promoted and fired. 
I teach and work in talent management and leadership development. I’ve used these programs and practices in the real world and continue to learn and research how these practices are changing. Artificial intelligence and systems are already big business, grossing over US$38 billion in 2021. Without a doubt, AI-driven software has the potential to advance quickly and change how companies make strategic decisions about their employees.  
Here’s what that acceleration may mean to you.
Applying
Imagine you apply for a job in the very near future. You upload your carefully written résumé through the company website, noting that the platform looks eerily similar to other platforms you’ve used to apply for other jobs. After your résumé is saved, you provide demographic information and complete countless fields with the same data from your résumé. You then hit “submit” and hope for a follow-up email from a person. 
Your data now lives within this company’s human capital management system. Even if they collect them, very few companies are looking at résumés anymore; they’re looking at the info you type into those tiny boxes to help make comparisons between you, dozens or hundreds of other applicants, and the job requirements. Even if your résumé demonstrates that you are the most qualified applicant, it alone is unlikely to catch the eye of the recruiter, because the recruiter’s attention is elsewhere.



With input from artificial intelligence, measures of employee performance will become more objective and increasingly data-driven.

Getting the job
Let’s say you get the call, you ace the interview and the job is yours. Your information hits another stage within the company’s database, or HCM: active employee. Your performance ratings and other data about your employment will now be tied to your profile, adding more data for the HCM and human resources to monitor and assess.
Enhancements in AI, technology and HCMs enable HR to look at employee data on deeper levels. The insights gleaned help identify talented employees who could fill key leadership roles when people quit and guide decisions about who should be promoted. The data can also identify favoritism and bias in hiring and promotion.
As you continue in your role, data on your performance is tracked and analyzed. This may include your performance ratings, supervisor’s feedback, professional development activity – or lack thereof. Having this large amount of data about you and others over time now helps HR think about how employees can better support the growth of the organization.
For example, HR may use data to identify how likely specific employees are to quit and evaluate the impact of that loss. 
Platforms that many people already use every day aggregate productivity data from sign-in to signoff. Widely available Microsoft tools including Teams, Outlook and SharePoint can help provide insight to managers via their workplace analytics tool. The Microsoft productivity score tracks overall usage within the platform. 
Even the metrics and behaviors defining “good” or “bad” performance may change, relying less on the perception of the manager. As data grows, even the work of professionals like consultants, doctors and marketers will be quantitatively and objectively measured. A 2022 New York Times investigation found that these systems, designed to improve worker productivity and accountability, had the effect of damaging morale and instilling fear. 
It’s clear that American employees should begin to think about how our data is being used, what story that data is telling, and how it may dictate our futures. 
Optimizing and understanding your career
Not every company has an HCM or is advanced in using talent data to make decisions. But many companies are becoming savvier and some are incredibly advanced. At a recent Microsoft Viva summit I attended, chief human resources officers from companies like PayPal and Rio Tinto outlined ways they are using these advancements. 
Some researchers claim that AI could promote equity by removing implicit bias from hiring and promoting, but many more see a danger that AI built by humans will just repackage old issues in a new box. Amazon learned this lesson the hard way back in 2018 when a résumé-sorting AI it built had to be abandoned when it favored men for programming roles. 
What’s more, the increase of data collection and analysis can leave employees unclear on where they stand while the organization is very clear. It’s best if you understand how AI is changing the workplace and demand transparency from your employer. These are data points that employees should consider asking about during their next review:

Do you see me as a high-potential employee?
How does my performance compare with others’?
Do you see me as a successor to your role or others’?

Just as you need to master traditional aspects of workplace culture, politics and relationships, you should learn to navigate these platforms, understand how you are being assessed, and take ownership of your career in a new and more data-driven way.

 AI is being used extensively to enhance productivity in most sectors. From automating tasks to enhancing customer and client experience, generative AI is here to step up the game. It can streamline business workflows, help businesses save resources, and give rise to a new generation of business applications. 







 Let's find out the different ways generative AI is expected to impact productivity in the near future and how you can take advantage of it in your work. 


 1. AI Will Complement New Workflows 
    

 People are always on the lookout for simplifying their workflows, developing new ones, and improving their productivity levels through effective task management. Generative AI has the ability to quickly adapt and complement new workflows and take the load off employees. With its quick and adaptive abilities, AI can complement workflows in almost any sector. 

 For example, data analytics can be simplified with generative AI, resulting in faster findings. Large datasets can be quickly analyzed using generative AI algorithms, which yield insights and predictions. This level of data processing has applications in a variety of industries. 





 In marketing, for example, generative AI technologies may study client behavior and forecast how customers will react to new products or services. In cybersecurity, generative AI algorithms can evaluate historical event data and assist data scientists in identifying possible security threats. However, whether the use of AI is completely increasing cybersecurity remains debatable. 



 2. Automation of High-Level and Complex Tasks 
    

 Research by Goldman Sachs has shown that AI has the potential to automate about two-thirds of U.S. professions. A quarter to as much as half of the workload of those affected occupations could be replaced. 






 Although the influence of AI on the labor market is anticipated to be enormous, most careers and industries are only partially susceptible to automation. As a result, workflows are more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI. 

 Generative AI, which can better understand historical patterns and context, summarize highly complex information, use predictive intelligence, and suggest the best actions, will usher in a new era of personalized and highly efficient experiences. It could also help automate more complex tasks and take business process automation to the next level. 



 3. Do More With Less Time 
    

 Generative AI has the potential to automate processes that ordinarily require creative input from a human. This can help businesses save time and money while generating high-quality results. 





 By helping more people to work much faster than before, it's reasonable to predict that some jobs will see a decrease in the number of hours required, leading to shorter workdays. After all, AI is already being used to streamline the way remote and hybrid work is done. 

 Companies will also find new ways to measure productivity as they progressively embrace automation, and human capital becomes less necessary in the future. Although human intervention will still be required with AI, employees in many businesses may find themselves working shorter hours. 



 4. Minimal Impact on High-Skilled Workers 
    






 According to a study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research and MIT, the lowest-skilled employees are expected to profit the most from these developments in AI. As generative AI continues to automate more tasks and understand more context, low-skilled and mid-skilled labor can reap maximum benefits. 

 However, high-skilled jobs, which require more human intervention and complex skills, may receive limited assistance from AI. This is because AI recommendations are based on one's own knowledge and repetitive actions. Hence, high-skilled workers benefit less from AI support and may face minimal impact from its adoption. 

 Employees with the highest level of expertise will benefit very little, if at all, from the incorporation of AI into their jobs. This is due to the fact that these top performers are already providing responses of the same quality as those recommended by AI, leaving less possibility for development. 








 Supercharge Your Productivity With Generative AI 
 Given the rate at which generative AI is advancing, we can expect it to have a significant impact on the employment market and our place in it. 

 The rise of generative AI tools will have a more significant influence on some jobs than others. A great way to ensure your future relevance is to upskill yourself in domains where AI is yet to reach its full potential.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



One listing says the job would be part of a team that will “shape the way generative AI technologies transform Apple’s mobile computing platforms,” potentially hinting at expanded AI capabilities on iPhones and other devices in the near future.
Apple’s ambitions for AI
The job listings provide a glimpse into Apple’s ambitions for AI, even as the company has been tight-lipped about any specific plans. Apple CEO Tim Cook declined to discuss product roadmaps during a recent Q2 earnings call when asked about Apple’s AI strategy, but said the technology presented “enormous” opportunities.
Similarly, one job listing reads, “AI represents a huge opportunity to elevate Apple’s products and experiences for billions of people globally.” The listing says the role would involve “leveraging state-of-the-art generative models to ship extraordinary products, services and customer experiences for the iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, iPad and more.”
Generative AI has become an active area of research and development for many of the largest technology companies. Google, Microsoft, Meta and others have released updates to AI systems that can generate conversational text, photos and code and the infrastructure upon which these systems operate. The technology is not without risks, however, such as the possibility of bias in AI systems and the inadvertent release of confidential data.
Independence from third-party AI tools
In recent months, Apple has restricted employees from using certain external AI tools like ChatGPT  and GitHub’s Copilot, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. Apple told staff not to use those tools because they could release sensitive data, the report claims.
The moves suggest Apple aims to advance its own AI efforts to avoid relying on other companies’ technologies. With vast resources and more than a billion iPhone users, Apple is well positioned to develop innovative AI for its products.
Still, the company’s plans remain unclear with Cook and other executives providing few details on how Apple might integrate more advanced AI into new iPhones, iPads, the Apple Watch or its other offerings.

There will be no cybernetic android that lumbers over to your desk and takes over your work duties, no disembodied robot voice that suddenly assumes command over your department. It might just look like routine layoffs, or a freelancer having more trouble finding work.A friend of mine, a veteran artist and prolific freelance illustrator, told me it’s been a “really weak year,” and believes the rise of AI image generation is to blame. He’s spoken to art directors at ad agencies, where he’s made much of his past income, who told him they’ve begun using Midjourney internally; the work isn’t published publicly, so there are fewer concerns about copyright and no working illustrators who might see the material and shame them. Advertisement    That is what it will look like to many as managers turn to AI to meet their needs to cut costs: not a fiery robot apocalypse, but a slowly declining rate of work on offer.More maddening still, few are likely to agree on what constitutes technological replacement, and what does not.Case in point: Since the text generators burst onto the scene late last year, a number of digital media companies have been experimenting with AI-generated content. CNET quietly started publishing AI-written stories in November, and  BuzzFeed and Insider have announced that they’re trying out different forms of AI-generated content too.           Technology and the Internet   Column: Your boss wants AI to replace you. The writers’ strike shows how to fight back  Artists, journalists and screenwriters are leading the fight against employers who would seek to replace them with the products of ChatGPT and other generative AI software. May 11, 2023  At the same time, all three companies have also been experimenting with laying off their staff. CNET fired 10% of its newsroom in March, and Insider followed suit in April.  BuzzFeed shut down its entire Pulitzer Prize-winning News division, which was home to around 60 journalists, and laid off 15% of employees companywide.Now, digital media is a particularly punishing business — another former heavyweight, Vice, declared bankruptcy just last week — and one that’s no stranger to layoffs at any given time. Yet the timing struck many as alarming, especially at a moment when executives in other industries are explicitly stating their intent to use AI to take over jobs previously done by humans; IBM Chief Executive Arvind Krishna, for instance, estimated AI would replace around 8,000 of the firm’s jobs in coming years.Not two weeks after the News division was shut down, BuzzFeed held its annual Investor Day, at which Chief Executive Jonah Peretti spoke about, among other things, the ways his company was embracing AI. “BuzzFeed has always lived at the intersection of technology and creativity,” he said at the event. “And recent developments in artificial intelligence represent an opportunity to take this convergence to the next level.” Advertisement    AI, he said, was making brand-new kinds of content possible and would soon replace the “static” content we’ve grown accustomed to reading on websites with “new formats that are more gamified, more personalized and more interactive.” BuzzFeed, he continued, is using generative AI to “establish the blueprint for AI-driven revenue growth across the company. … And with the developments with both creators and AI, we see the opportunity to build a content creation model that makes our creative team more efficient and sustainably expands our output without increasing fixed costs.”When I shared the observation that BuzzFeed seemed to be going all in on AI on the heels of laying off its News staff on Twitter, the reaction was, uh, strong.   Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti, speaking at Investor Day, just one week after laying off its entire News team: ""Over the next few years, generative AI will replace the majority of static content""https://t.co/7SGwFiitY5 pic.twitter.com/qI9bSWYrTD— Brian Merchant (@bcmerchant) May 17, 2023   “Unrelentingly bleak,”  MSNBC host Chris Hayes commented. “None of this has to happen,”  writer Molly Jong-Fast tweeted. “Writing doesn’t need to be automated.”Displeased for a different reason was Peretti, who sent me a direct message accusing me of “completely misrepresenting” what he said. But what started as a hostile exchange — “totally irresponsible,” he called my gloss on his speech — soon became something more productive, as Peretti explained his views on how BuzzFeed would be utilizing AI. Our conversation via DM offered a window into the thinking of an executive in a field that generative AI stands to  affect.“In the future, AI will replace static content because content will become more personalized and dynamic,” Peretti said. “For example, you’ll be able to ‘chat with an article’ to get related information or background on a story you might have missed earlier. This has nothing to do with replacing writers or having AI write articles.”Peretti said  he was not automating the production of news articles, or replacing writers with AI. “I was talking about the industry as a whole when I described ‘static content’ being replaced,” he said, “and my prediction is it will be replaced with formats like the BuzzFeed AI quizzes, i.e. human-created content with interactivity added with AI.”        Technology and the Internet   Column: Afraid of AI? The startups selling it want you to be  ChatGPT and other new AI services benefit from a science fiction-infused marketing frenzy unlike anything in recent memory. There’s more to fear here than killer robots.March 31, 2023  I pointed out that laying off the people whose jobs were to write articles, and then pointing to the company’s embrace of AI is nonetheless to make the case to investors that said new technology will make up the difference. On Investor Day, Peretti said the use of AI “sustainably expands our output without increasing fixed costs,” after all.“What happened to News and AI are unrelated,” he said, “I shut down BuzzFeed News because it was losing millions of dollars, and I still supported it for years and years despite the losses.”He went on: “Some investors might misunderstand what we are doing and think it is about ‘automated output’ as you say. I’ve never said that, and I think it is a big misunderstanding of how AI will ultimately be used in media. Think of AI as a new medium, not as a labor replacement. We won’t be replacing BFN output; we’ll be making totally different types of content. We’ll need creative people to make these new formats.” And herein lies the crux of the matter. I believe Peretti when he says he’s not looking at this as a way to replace workers — even if I am absolutely convinced that he’s trying to replace their value. But when automation unfolds in a historical context, it’s rarely a one-to-one affair. It’s not as though there’s going to be a staff writer who specializes in science news one day, and a bot that is trained to reproduce her output that will be deployed the next. In the world of news-gathering, anyway — workers like voice-over artists and illustrators have found their art vacuumed up and spat out by generative AI trained on their work, though the legality of such practices is still very much in question, and humans are still needed to edit the final output.Automation is uneven and messy, and it’s far more likely to proceed the way we’re seeing unfold at BuzzFeed — previously there was a big expensive team of humans doing difficult and labor-intensive work, and now they are gone and there is a different content product altogether, one built by a combination of new technology and input from a more precarious worker. (In his Investor Day speech, Peretti also spoke of the growing importance of partnerships with independent content creators. “The shift will allow BuzzFeed to produce more with a smaller headcount, while also leaning into new internet trends,” as Axios reported.)When I asked if he would try to maintain the same output without the News desk, he didn’t answer, and that certainly appears to be the plan.The way he sees it, I think, is that News was simply no longer viable — it had never made money, and it was unlikely to in the future. Shuttering that department was one decision; embracing AI for a different part of his business was another. But it’s hard to say whether Peretti would have been comfortable jettisoning News if there wasn’t a buzzy technology to create new kinds of content to intrigue investors with. News may have not been profitable in a strict sense, but it lent the entire BuzzFeed operation credibility and prestige, and generated knock-on value that the rest of the enterprise benefited from. If generative AI hadn’t exploded when it did, would BuzzFeed be able to jettison News? Maybe not!That’s speculative, and Peretti insists otherwise. But AI is above all an ambiguity generator. It allows those who hold the power to justify making all kinds of calls, in the name of embracing the future, improving efficiency and so on. And in this still very young AI-infested moment of ours, we can’t be sure which way many of those calls will break.        Technology and the Internet   Column: Uber and Lyft’s ‘deactivation’ policy is dehumanizing and unfair. It must end  The seemingly random firing of drivers is one way ride-hail companies keep workers powerless. Can’t they bear the cost of humane engagement?Feb. 28, 2023  There are, however, plenty of worrying signs — studio executives refused to agree not to use AI that would displace writers, in a sticking point in the ongoing writers’ strike, for one — and ample anecdata in the form of all those Twitter threads about workers getting the boot in favor of ChatGPT. But it’s still hard to know how, when and if AI will have a major impact on the jobs picture. Peretti says he’s sympathetic to this.“So many journalists are losing their jobs and it is a real crisis,” Peretti  said. “People should be worried. And history has valuable lessons for sure. The irony is if our AI entertainment efforts had started sooner and performed better, I could have had enough surplus profit to continue underwriting losses at news like I’d done for years previously.”In the end, we’re still getting more AI and fewer humans — even if the AI is not doing the humans’ job, exactly. AI will be used by executives and managers much this way, I think: to help gin up investment in future-forward products that require less labor costs to make, to buffer layoffs or attrition in human departments, and to hire more part-time or project-based workers.There’s no jobs apocalypse coming; there’s just a series of managers making the calls they think will best benefit their bottom line, and serve their boards.
