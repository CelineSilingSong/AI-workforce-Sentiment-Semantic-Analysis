These companies are AI trailblazers and embrace AI to provide next-level products and services. Here are 10 of the best examples of how these companies are using artificial intelligence in practice.
The 10 Best Examples Of How Companies Use Artificial Intelligence In PracticeAdobe Stock

1.   Alibaba

Chinese company Alibaba is the world's largest e-commerce platform that sells more than Amazon and eBay combined. Artificial intelligence (AI) is integral in Alibaba’s daily operations and is used to predict what customers might want to buy. With natural language processing, the company automatically generates product descriptions for the site. Another way Alibaba uses artificial intelligence is in its City Brain project to create smart cities. The project uses AI algorithms to help reduce traffic jams by monitoring every vehicle in the city. Additionally, Alibaba, through its cloud computing division called Alibaba Cloud, is helping farmers monitor crops to improve yield and cuts costs with artificial intelligence.

2.   Alphabet – Google

Alphabet is Google’s parent company. Waymo, the company’s self-driving technology division, began as a project at Google. Today, Waymo wants to bring self-driving technology to the world to not only to move people around, but to reduce the number of crashes. Its autonomous vehicles are currently shuttling riders around California in self-driving taxis. Right now, the company can’t charge a fare and a human driver still sits behind the wheel during the pilot program. Google signaled its commitment to deep learning when it acquired DeepMind. Not only did the system learn how to play 49 different Atari games, the AlphaGo program was the first to beat a professional player at the game of Go. Another AI innovation from Google is Google Duplex. Using natural language processing, an AI voice interface can make phone calls and schedule appointments on your behalf. Learn even more about how Google is incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning into operations.

3.   Amazon
Not only is Amazon in the artificial intelligence game with its digital voice assistant, Alexa, but artificial intelligence is also part of many aspects of its business. Another innovative way Amazon uses artificial intelligence is to ship things to you before you even think about buying it. They collect a lot of data about each person’s buying habits and have such confidence in how the data they collect helps them recommend items to its customers and now predict what they need even before they need it by using predictive analytics. In a time when many brick-and-mortar stores are struggling to figure out how to stay relevant, America’s largest e-tailer offers a new convenience store concept called Amazon Go. Unlike other stores, there is no checkout required. The stores have artificial intelligence technology that tracks what items you pick up and then automatically charges you for those items through the Amazon Go app on your phone. Since there is no checkout, you bring your own bags to fill up with items, and there are cameras watching your every move to identify every item you put in your bag to ultimately charge you for it.

4.   Apple
Apple, one of the world’s largest technology companies, selling consumer electronics such as iPhones and Apple Watches, as well as computer software and online services. Apple uses artificial intelligence and machine learning in products like the iPhone, where it enables the FaceID feature, or in products like the AirPods, Apple Watch, or HomePod smart speakers, where it enables the smart assistant Siri. Apple is also growing its service offering and is using AI to recommend songs on Apple Music, help you find your photo in the iCloud, or navigate to your next meeting using Maps.

5.   Baidu
The Chinese equivalent of Google, Baidu, uses artificial intelligence in many ways. They have a tool called Deep Voice that uses artificial intelligence and deep learning that only needs 3.7 seconds of audio to clone a voice. They use this same technology to create a tool that reads books to you in the author’s voice—all automated with no recording studio necessary.

6.   Facebook
One of the primary ways Facebook uses artificial intelligence and deep learning is to add structure to its unstructured data. They use DeepText, a text understanding engine, to automatically understand and interpret the content and emotional sentiment of the thousands of posts (in multiple languages) that its users publish every second. With DeepFace, the social media giant can automatically identify you in a photo that is shared on their platform. In fact, this technology is so good, it’s better at facial recognition than humans. The company also uses artificial intelligence to automatically catch and remove images that are posted on its site as revenge porn.
7.   IBM
IBM has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence for years. It's been more than 20 years since IBM's Deep Blue computer became the first to conquer a human world chess champion. The company followed up that feat with other man vs. machine competitions, including its Watson computer winning the game show Jeopardy. The latest artificial intelligence accomplishment for IBM is Project Debater. This AI is a cognitive computing engine that competed against two professional debaters and formulated human-like arguments.
8.   JD.com
JD.com is the Chinese version of Amazon. Its founder Richard Liu expects and is driving toward having his company be 100% automated in the future. Right now, its warehouse is already fully automated, and they have been making drone deliveries of packages for the last four years. JD.com is driving business with artificial intelligence revolution, big data, and robotics while building the retail infrastructure for the 4th industrial revolution.
9.   Microsoft
Artificial intelligence is a term that appears on Microsoft's vision statement, which illustrates the company’s focus on having smart machines central to everything they do. They are incorporating intelligent capabilities to all its products and services, including Cortana, Skype, Bing, and Office 365, and are one of the world's biggest AI as a Service (AIaaS) vendors.
10. Tencent
Chinese social media company Tencent has incorporated artificial intelligence into its operations in its quest to become ""the most respected internet enterprise,"" Tencent relies on artificial intelligence. It has 1 billion users on its app WeChat, but has extended its reach to gaming, digital assistants, mobile payments, cloud storage, live streaming, sports, education, movies, and even self-driving cars. One of the company's slogans is ""AI in all."" Tencent acquires huge amounts of information and insights about its customers that it processes and leverages to the company’s advantage.

Hardly a week goes by without a report announcing the end of work as we know it.
In 2013, Oxford University academics Carl Frey and Michael Osborne were the first to capture this anxiety in a paper titled: “The Future of Employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?”.
They concluded 47% of US jobs were threatened by automation. Since then, Frey has taken multiple opportunities to repeat his predictions of major labour market disruptions due to automation. 
In the face of threats to employment, some progressive thinkers advocate jettisoning our work ethic and building a world without work. 
If machines can do our work, why not reduce the working week drastically? We should be mature enough to decide what truly matters to us, without tying our identity to a job, or measuring happiness in dollars and professional status. Right?
Not quite. 
The reality is that work is tied to our constitution as a species. And this fact is too often overlooked in discussions about the future of work.  
Work is a feature of the human species
Recent studies have raised alarms that advances in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will leave all sectors open to the threat of machines replacing human workers.
The power of AI will supposedly, according to these studies, even make high-skilled specialists redundant - threatening medical practitioners, bank associates, and legal professionals.

      The benefits of job automation are not likely to be shared equally




Predictions about the rise of the robots 
either take a pessimistic stance, focusing on disruptions to economic organisations, or view “undoing work” as an opportunity to move to a fairer social model.
However, these views disregard the central role work has played in humanity’s development.
Working on environments
Philosophers including Karl Marx, Henri Bergson, and John Dewey argued that working is a defining trait of humans.  
Findings over the past two decades have confirmed that features of modern Homo sapiens are directly tied to their tendency to work. 
Three basic ideas of the old philosophers are reaffirmed by contemporary research in archaeology, anthropology and genetics.
First, humans haven’t evolved to fit into their environments as seamlessly as other animals. Humans have had to compensate for a lack of fit. 
They did this by learning about the ecosystems around them, the plants and animals they could eat, and the natural processes they could use, or should avoid. This knowledge was applied to create instruments, tools and weapons.

      Resume robot wars: how employees could match employers' use of tech in job applications




Very early on, humans mobilised their knowledge and skills to shape their immediate surroundings and become the dominant animal. 
Knowledge of nature, technical skills and intervention in the environment are all characteristics of humans’ capacity to work. These allowed us to adapt to highly diverse geographies and climates.
Working on ourselves, and with others
Each new generation has to learn the skills and knowledge that will enable it to sustain its particular mode of survival. 
Australian philosopher Kim Sterelny has shown in detail how evolution selected genetic traits that sustain humans’ capacity to learn, specifically by enhancing social behaviour and tolerance towards the young. 
And as humans worked on nature, they also worked in ways that influenced their minds, and their bodies.
It has been demonstrated that cooperation in humans reaches a level unknown in other species. This cooperative capacity has its roots in each individual’s dependency on the knowledge, skills and efforts of others. 
No human is able to sustain themself on their own, and collaboration exceeds what each person can produce alone. Even the most brilliant astrophysicist calls the plumber to fix a broken toilet. 
Humans have to work to survive, and this entails working with, and for, others.
The future of work
Acknowledging the anthropological depth of work means admitting current scenarios advocating “the end of work” are not the right answer. They take an unrealistic view of who we are. 
We need to recognise work as a human need. As Marx said: 

… labour has become not only a means of life, but life’s prime want. 

The question should not be whether there’s room for human work in an automated future. The question should be: how will human work find its place next to machines and robots?
Even if automation becomes widespread, we’ll still apply our minds, bodies and hands to productive tasks. We’ll still experiment and learn from others.
If machines could truly do all human work, then they’d make humans redundant, as 2001: A Space Odyssey anticipated back in 1968. While this isn’t a pleasant scenario, it’s not a likely one either.  
Automation might bring major social and economic disruptions in the short-term, but it won’t get rid of the need for humans to work. 




      Read more:
      Don’t be alarmed: AI won’t leave half the world unemployed




Human needs are also infinitely complex. Nobody can foretell what new activities, techniques, and consequent modes of working will fulfil future needs.
Even if we reject the modern work ethic, we’ll still find ways to learn through action and emulate experts. 
Human intelligence is geared towards producing useful goods, so we’ll continue to look for purposeful activities, too. And we’ll seek collaboration with others for mutual benefit. 
This is the influence of work on us. We are heir to thousands of years of evolution, and it would be pretentious to assume evolution could stop with us.

Last week, the House Financial Services Committee’s Task Force on Artificial Intelligence conducted a meeting with university academics and Wall Street financial services professionals to discuss the impact of AI on trading, robo-advisory, market surveillance and other activities within the financial services sector. To set the tone, the report by Wells Fargo predicting 200,000 banking jobs in the U.S. will be lost over the next decade—due to the introduction of new technologies—was cited by the chairman of the AI Task Force, Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill).

According to Marcos Lopez de Prado, the former head of machine learning at AQR Capital Management, algorithms in electronic markets have already automated the jobs once dominated by thousands of traders.

Look around any trading floor today and you’ll only hear a slight hum and see the flickering lights of the Bloomberg terminals and computer screens. Only a short while ago, you would have heard the the vibrant, rambunctious atmosphere of sales and traders crying out to customers and counterparts. When you see footage on cable news about the stock market, they’ll usually show a busy, open-outcry market on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. It's really a Potemkin village. The cameras shoot where there are some live traders and support staff herded into one small area. In reality, the New York Stock Exchange floor is devoid of humans and runs primarily on technology conducting the electronic trading activities. 

Lopez de Prado, who is now a Cornell University professor, testified in Washington on the adverse impact of artificial intelligence on capital markets and jobs. He spoke of the algorithms automating the jobs of traders and displacing thousands of people. Lopez de Prado told the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, “Financial machine learning creates a number of challenges for the 6.14 million people employed in the finance and insurance industry, many of whom will lose their jobs—not necessarily because they are replaced by machines, but because they are not trained to work alongside algorithms.""

Investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs, now seek people who have the math, technology, software, coding, data analytics and related skills to work along with electronic trading. The need for real-life traders are done and over with. It used to be a fantastic and well-paying job to be a trader—not any longer! There was a time when street kids from the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn could get an in on the trading floor from a father, family friend or relative. No college degrees were required. It was a rough and tumble place. If they had a knack for trading, the stomach for taking risks and a strong desire to make money, they could—and did—earn large incomes. The doors to that opportunity have now closed due to the ascension of algo-driven trading. The working-class traders are no longer welcome, but the door remains wide open for Ivy-League Ph.D.s who write the codes.

Compliance people run the risk of being replaced too. “As bad actors become more sophisticated, it is vital that financial regulators have the funding resources, technological capacity and access to AI and automated technologies to be a strong and effective cop on the beat,” said Martina Rejsjö, head of Nasdaq Surveillance North America Equities.

Nasdaq, a tech-driven trading platform, has an associated regulatory body that offers over 40 different algorithms, using 35,000 parameters, to spot possible market abuse and manipulation in real time. “The massive and, in many cases, exponential growth in market data is a significant challenge for surveillance professionals,"" Rejsjö said. “Market abuse attempts have become more sophisticated, putting more pressure on surveillance teams to find the proverbial needle in the data haystack."" In layman's terms, she believes that the future is in tech overseeing trading activities, as the human eye is unable to keep up with the rapid-fire, sophisticated global trading dominated by algorithms. 
When people say not to worry, that’s the precise time to worry. Companies—whether they are McDonald’s, introducing self-serve kiosks and firing hourly workers to cut costs, or top-tier investment banks that rely on software instead of traders to make million-dollar bets on the stock market—will continue to implement technology and downsize people in an effort to enhance profits and cut down on expenses. This trend will be hard to stop and have serious future consequences for the workers at all levels and salaries.

By now there’s no doubt we’re experiencing seismic shifts in the workplace that represent another industrial revolution. Technology has sparked quantum leaps before, but this one is different. This revolution is redefining the very nature of work, which means the professional skills required in a dynamic workplace are quickly changing, too. Meanwhile, only half of today’s chief human resources officers say they’ve built out a future workforce strategy.Dire circumstances? I don’t think so. As in any other time of great change, this presents us with a great opportunity. I believe the future of work will remain essentially human, with an (increasing) assist from technology. This isn’t a new idea. Technology has historically created more jobs than it destroyed, often helping people do their jobs better, not replacing them. In the healthcare sector, artificial intelligence isn’t taking jobs from doctors; it’s helping them better diagnose and care for their patients. Just as ATMs didn’t replace bank tellers; they freed up the tellers to do more personalized work with clients.    Today, some of the strongest cases for a machine-supported workplace involve customer service. Chatbots, for instance, can handle simple or recurring issues, curbing long hold times. Emerging technologies provide human agents more time for high-touch interactions, using exclusively human skills like communication, empathy and creativity that can not only turn a customer experience into a human experience but strengthen a business and brand. In other words, a win-win scenario.Companies are beginning to use artificial intelligence to personalize their responses to customers and talk to them where they’re most active. The result is real-time experiences that are contextualized and consistent across media, web, mobile, social and beyond.  Creatives are harnessing machine learning to make targeted content that serves the customer and the business better.  This kind of machine assistance is helping create a new model for creativity in the workplace where teams, supported by data, can create content at the speed of culture. Workflows are also changing to support this model, with insights being applied in new and agile ways. It’s still early days, and we constantly ponder what the right data is and what customers are feeling. But creatives are harnessing machine learning to make targeted content that serves the customer and the business better.    What’s more, collaboration isn’t limited to machines and people. In an ecosystem-based economy, partnering outside your organization with customers and strategic alliances can deliver big returns. Traditional boundaries between companies are disappearing, creating an unprecedented combination of new business models. Brands are transforming from being solo entities to becoming members of far-reaching ecosystems.This new world of collaborative creation is accelerating connectivity, integrating capabilities and evolving talent models to create new solutions to previously unsolved problems. Forward-looking marketers are building engagement tools that integrate cognitive capabilities to transform contextualized customer journeys across channels by actioning data insights. Growth marketers are facilitating true customer engagement and increasing lifetime value by leveraging sophisticated mar-tech stacks that unite data, insights and decisions with a focus on business impact. This modern mindset connects marketing to revenue, embeds ROI into the fabric of marketing and shares direct ownership to help organizations stay relevant to customers.What role can you play to help your workforce navigate these changes? A recent Gartner study found that only 20% of employees feel they have the skills needed for future—or even current—roles. But there’s a path forward. More than ever, professional development requires creativity, thoughtfulness and agency.    First, encourage your employees to embrace a work life of continuous learning. That is to say, one of continuous change and to seek opportunities to collaborate with peers and partners up, down and across the organization. Disruptive technologies won’t slow down or get less complex, so help them adopt an agile mindset, make time for that learning and prioritize it. Learning as they go and being adaptive to changing business needs will help them hone their skills.Next, help them understand that now more than ever they can expect to be assessed on their ability to make an impact on the business, including the ability to build strategic relationships and contribute to human-powered innovation. Then help them increase and maintain their technical fluency. Most future jobs will involve technology, so employees need to understand when and how future tech will affect the business.And finally, encourage them to embrace their creativity and humanity. Since everyone has access to raw knowledge now, IQ and content expertise are often less important than imagination, emotional intelligence, curiosity and reflection. These are exclusively human talents, and they’re often viewed as the most important assets we can bring to this new era of human and machine collaboration.    While the nature of work is changing, I believe it’s an opportunity to demonstrate how collaboration will drive inclusive growth. It’s time to take control of our own narratives and futures. Leaders can do so by designing a workplace that values and rewards creativity and discovery; workers can do it by engaging in lifelong learning, shaping their own career paths and leaning into their passions.We’re in a new industrial revolution, but look again. Treat it as your own learning revolution, and you can prepare yourself for the road ahead.

Artificial Intelligence threatens finance jobs on Wall Street

The rise of machine learning is set to reshape the workforce in the financial sector and could disrupt not only routine jobs, but also hit some of the highest paying ones.

The rise of machine learning is set to reshape the workforce in the financial sector and could disrupt not only routine jobs, but also hit some of the highest paying ones.
The warning was voiced by Dr. Marcos Lopez de Prado, professor at Cornell University’s School of Engineering, as he testified before the US House Committee on Financial Services on Friday, at a hearing to determine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on сapital markets.

https://twitter.com/AnnaAnthro/status/1203636202433327105
The professor said that, while tech firms started distributing data and crowdsourcing the jobs of data analysts through special tournaments, any investment challenge could be solved by an army of data scientists without financial background.
Thus “the highest paying jobs in finance” could be put at risk, he noted, adding that asset managers could crowdsource their entire research function, while insurance companies could do the same with their actuarial models.
“Financial ML [machine learning] creates a number of challenges for the 6.14 million people employed in the finance and insurance industry, many of whom will lose their jobs – not necessarily because they are replaced by machines, but because they are not trained to work alongside algorithms,” Lopez de Prado told the сommittee.Read more: Wall Street bigwig loses over a billion dollars after sexist comments
While some of other witnesses also voiced concerns on how automated markets are reshaping the workforce, other invited specialists in investment and finance believe that AI could unlock many opportunities. One thing is clear, while the sphere is going to change, the question is if people are ready for it.
Rebecca Fender, Senior Director of the Future of Finance at the CFA Institute, an association of investment professionals, told the members of the task force that 43 percent of CFA members and candidates expect significant change in their roles in the next 5-10 years.
The three roles “most likely to disappear” are sales agents, traders and performance analysts, she said, citing the result of a survey of more than 3,800 respondents.

Meanwhile, Kirsten Wegner, CEO of Modern Markets Initiative, said that policymakers are better to encourage the transformation to automatization, instead of impeding it, as it opens the door to many tech professionals.
“There are countless job opportunities popping up in coding, cybersecurity, data storage and management, quantitative reasoning and other technology verticals that Wall Street plans to prioritize,” she said, adding that employment opportunities could stem from blockchain, e-banking, robo-advising and new cryptocurrencies.

This transition may be due to the extensive demand for digital literacy across job roles as the demand for qualitative and quantitative proficiency has increased. Companies are hiring management interns with engineering background — especially in the computer science and electronics domain.With the advent of digitisation, management graduates from top b-schools — including Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) — are taking up technical job roles over management consulting and investment banking. “Technology is creating opportunities , making way for newer jobs — many of them still unknown to us. The convergence of Big Data with Artificial Intelligence has emerged as the single most important development that is shaping the future of how firms drive business value from their data and analytics capabilities,” Neeti Sharma, Senior Vice President, TeamLease Services told Business Insider.A study by talent solutions company Xpheno predicted that companies are expected to hire almost a third of management students for tech profiles. This transition may be due to the extensive demand for digital literacy across job roles as the demand for qualitative and quantitative proficiency has increased. In addition to this, consulting and i-banking multinationals banking on technologies like data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) offer higher remuneration for innovation skills. Nearly 68 management students were hired for IT and analytics profiles at Indian Institute of IIM Bangalore from companies like Ola, Oyo Rooms and United Health Group among others. The employer’s sideOn the employers front too, automation has restrained the demand for traditional i-banking roles. They are also looking for more diverse candidates. Companies are hiring management interns with engineering background — especially in the computer science and electronics domain. With automation making inroads in the Indian job market, humans are competing with machines to keep up. According to Microsoft, every business is going to be a Software business, build applications, use advanced analytics. Given that, companies are now looking at hiring employees that bring in AI and ML skills.“AI &amp; ML tools are being used across the life cycles of workflows &amp; projects across organizations. Many MBA students are Engineering graduates and hence it is natural that companies hiring from campus look for candidates who have a background of both technical as well as managerial skills which will enable them to perform better at their jobs,” Neeti added.Banks going digital With digitisation, techno-functional managers have become essential to companies.Public sector banks Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank also recently announced that they will hire 5,000 fresh graduates with cybersecurity, technical skills.According to Sukhjit Singh Pasricha, chief human resource officer at Kotak Mahindra Bank, the banking industry has witnessed a sudden demand for professionals skilled in technologies like artificial intelligence, digital banking and analytics. “Legacy job categories such as Banking or Transaction Processing may be heavily impacted by the automation that AI brings to the business — replacing jobs. The banking industry is anticipated to grow by incorporating AI systems, machine learning &amp; big data. This includes automation of customer service with chatbots, improving risk models, understanding customer behavior, credit decisions, risk and compliance, fraud detection and anti-money-laundering to name a few,” Anne Soumya, HR Director of The Adecco Group India told BI.

San Francisco
CNN Business
         — 
    


            In 2010, artificial intelligence was more likely to pop up in dystopian science-fiction movies than in everyday life. And it certainly wasn’t something people worried might take over their jobs in the near future.
    

            A lot has changed since then. AI is now used for everything from helping you take better smartphone photos and analyzing your personality in job interviews to letting you buy a sandwich without paying a cashier. It’s also becoming increasingly common — and controversial — when used for surveillance, such as facial-recognition software, and for spreading misinformation, as with deepfake videos that purport to show a person doing or saying something they didn’t.
    

            How did AI come to invade so many different parts of our lives over the last decade? The answer lies in technological advancements in the field, combined with cheaper, easier access to more powerful computers.

            Much of the AI you encounter on a regular basis uses a technique known as machine learning, which is when a computer teaches itself by poring over data. More specifically, major developments over the last decade focused on a type of machine learning, called deep learning, that’s modeled after the way neurons work in the brain. With deep learning, a computer might be tasked with looking at thousands of videos of cats, for instance, to learn to identify what a cat looks like (and, in fact, it was a big deal when Google figured out how to do this reliably in 2012).
    

            “Ten years ago, deep learning was not on anybody’s radar, and now it’s in everything,” said Pedro Domingos, a computer science professor at the University of Washington.
    

            AI is still quite simplistic. A machine-learning algorithm, for instance, typically does just one thing and often requires mountains of data to learn how to do it well. A lot of work in the field of AI focuses on making machine learning systems better at generalizing and learning from fewer examples, Domingos said. 
    

            “We’ve come a thousand miles, but there’s a million miles still to go,” he said.
    

            With a nod to those thousand miles already in the technological rear-view mirror, CNN Business took a look back at the last 10 years of AI’s journey, highlighting six of the many ways it has impacted our lives.
    

        Smartphones


            These days, artificial intelligence is all over smartphones, from facial-recognition software for unlocking the handset to popular apps like Google Maps. Increasingly, companies like Apple and Google are trying to run AI directly on handsets (with chips specifically meant to help with AI-driven capabilities), so activities like speech recognition can be performed on the phone rather than on a remote computer — the kind of thing that can make it even faster to do things like translate words from one language to another and preserve data privacy.

            One deceptively simple-sounding example of this popped up in October, when Google introduced a transcription app called Recorder. It can record and transcribe, in real time. It knows what you’re saying and identifies various sounds like music and applause; the recordings can later be searched by individual words. The app can run entirely on Google Pixel smartphones. Google said this was difficult to accomplish because it requires several pieces of AI that must work without killing the phone’s battery life or taking up too much of its main processor. If consumers take a shine to the app, it could lead to yet more AI being squeezed onto our smartphones.
    

        Social networks


            When Facebook began in 2004, it focused on connecting people. These days, it’s fixated on doing so with artificial intelligence. It’s become so core to the company’s products that a year ago, Facebook’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, told CNN Business that without deep learning the social network would be “dust.”

            After years of investment, deep learning now underpins everything from the posts and ads you see on the site to the ways your friends can be automatically tagged in photos. It can even help remove content like hate speech from the social network. It’s still got a long way to go, though, particularly when it comes to spotting violence or hate speech online, which is tricky for machines to figure out.
    

            And Facebook isn’t the only one; it’s simply the biggest. Instagram, Twitter, and other social networks rely heavily on AI, too. 
    

        Virtual assistants


            Any time you talk to Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, or Google’s Assistant, you’re having an up-close-and-personal interaction with AI. This is most notable in the ways these helpers understand what you’re saying and (hopefully) respond with what you want.

            The rise of these virtual assistants began in 2011, when Apple released Siri on the iPhone. Google followed with Google Now in 2012 (a newer version, Google Assistant, came out in 2016).
    








Amazon



            But while many consumers took a shine to Apple’s and Google’s early computerized helpers, they were mostly confined to smartphones. In many ways, it was Amazon’s Alexa, introduced in 2014 and embodied by an Internet-connected speaker called the Amazon Echo, that helped the virtual assistant market explode –— and brought AI to many more homes in the process.
    

            Consider this: During just the third quarter of 2019, Amazon shipped 10.4 million Alexa-using smart speakers, making up the biggest single chunk (nearly 37%) of the global market for these gadgets, according to data from Canalys.
    

        Surveillance


            As AI has improved, so have its capabilities as a surveillance tool. One of the most controversial of these is facial recognition technology, which identifies people from live or recorded video or still photos, typically by comparing their facial features with those in a database of faces. It’s been used in many different settings: at concerts, by police, and at airports, to name a few.

            Facial recognition systems have come under growing scrutiny, however, due to concerns about privacy and accuracy. In December, for instance, a US government study found extensive racial bias in almost 200 facial recognition algorithms, with racial minorities much more likely to be misidentified than whites.
    

            In the US, there are few rules governing how AI in general, and facial recognition in particular, can be deployed. So in 2019, several cities, including San Francisco and Oakland in California and Somerville in Massachusetts, banned city departments (including police) from using the technology.
    

        Healthcare


            AI is increasingly being used to diagnose and manage all kinds of health issues, from spotting lung cancer to keeping an eye on mental health problems and gastrointestinal issues. Though much of this work is still in the research or early-development stages, there are startups — such as Mindstrong Health, which uses an app to measure moods in patients who are dealing with mental health issues — already trying out AI systems with people.

Two startups in the midst of this are Auggi, a gut-health startup building an app to help track gastrointestinal issues, and Seed Health, which sells probiotics and works on applying microbes to human health. In November, they started collecting photos of poop from the general public that they intend to use to make a data set of human fecal images. Auggi wants to use these pictures to make an app that can use computer vision to automatically classify different types of waste that people with chronic gut-related problems — such as irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS — usually have to track manually with pen and paper.
    

        Art


            Can AI create art? More and more often the answer is yes. Over the last 10 years, AI has been used to make musical compositions, paintings and more that seem very similar to the kinds of things humans come up with (though the jury is still out on whether a machine can actually possess creativity). And sometimes, that art can even be a big money maker.

            Perhaps the clearest indication that AI-generated art is gaining popularity came in late 2018, when a blurry, Old Masters-esque piece called “Edmond de Belamy” became the first work produced by a machine to be sold at auction.
    

            The print was created using a cutting-edge technique known as GANS, which involves two neural networks competing with each other to come up with something new based on a data set. In this case, the data set was a slew of existing paintings, while the new thing was the computerized artwork. GANS is also gaining popularity because it can be used to make deepfakes.

More specifically, major developments over the last decade focused on a type of machine learning, called deep learning, that’s modeled after the way neurons work in the brain. With deep learning, a computer might be tasked with looking at thousands of videos of cats, for instance, to learn to identify what a cat looks like (and, in fact, it was a big deal when Google figured out how to do this reliably in 2012). “Ten years ago, deep learning was not on anybody’s radar, and now it’s in everything,” said Pedro Domingos, a computer science professor at the University of Washington. AI is still quite simplistic. A machine-learning algorithm, for instance, typically does just one thing and often requires mountains of data to learn how to do it well. A lot of work in the field of AI focuses on making machine learning systems better at generalizing and learning from fewer examples, Domingos said.  “We’ve come a thousand miles, but there’s a million miles still to go,” he said. With a nod to those thousand miles already in the technological rear-view mirror, CNN Business took a look back at the last 10 years of AI’s journey, highlighting six of the many ways it has impacted our lives. Smartphones These days, artificial intelligence is all over smartphones, from facial-recognition software for unlocking the handset to popular apps like Google Maps. Increasingly, companies like Apple and Google are trying to run AI directly on handsets (with chips specifically meant to help with AI-driven capabilities), so activities like speech recognition can be performed on the phone rather than on a remote computer — the kind of thing that can make it even faster to do things like translate words from one language to another and preserve data privacy. One deceptively simple-sounding example of this popped up in October, when Google introduced a transcription app called Recorder. It can record and transcribe, in real time. It knows what you’re saying and identifies various sounds like music and applause; the recordings can later be searched by individual words. The app can run entirely on Google Pixel smartphones. Google said this was difficult to accomplish because it requires several pieces of AI that must work without killing the phone’s battery life or taking up too much of its main processor. If consumers take a shine to the app, it could lead to yet more AI being squeezed onto our smartphones. Social networks When Facebook began in 2004, it focused on connecting people. These days, it’s fixated on doing so with artificial intelligence. It’s become so core to the company’s products that a year ago, Facebook’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, told CNN Business that without deep learning the social network would be “dust.” After years of investment, deep learning now underpins everything from the posts and ads you see on the site to the ways your friends can be automatically tagged in photos. It can even help remove content like hate speech from the social network. It’s still got a long way to go, though, particularly when it comes to spotting violence or hate speech online, which is tricky for machines to figure out. And Facebook isn’t the only one; it’s simply the biggest. Instagram, Twitter, and other social networks rely heavily on AI, too.  Virtual assistants Any time you talk to Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, or Google’s Assistant, you’re having an up-close-and-personal interaction with AI. This is most notable in the ways these helpers understand what you’re saying and (hopefully) respond with what you want. The rise of these virtual assistants began in 2011, when Apple released Siri on the iPhone. Google followed with Google Now in 2012 (a newer version, Google Assistant, came out in 2016). But while many consumers took a shine to Apple’s and Google’s early computerized helpers, they were mostly confined to smartphones. In many ways, it was Amazon’s Alexa, introduced in 2014 and embodied by an Internet-connected speaker called the Amazon Echo, that helped the virtual assistant market explode –— and brought AI to many more homes in the process. Consider this: During just the third quarter of 2019, Amazon shipped 10.4 million Alexa-using smart speakers, making up the biggest single chunk (nearly 37%) of the global market for these gadgets, according to data from Canalys. Surveillance As AI has improved, so have its capabilities as a surveillance tool. One of the most controversial of these is facial recognition technology, which identifies people from live or recorded video or still photos, typically by comparing their facial features with those in a database of faces. It’s been used in many different settings: at concerts, by police, and at airports, to name a few. Facial recognition systems have come under growing scrutiny, however, due to concerns about privacy and accuracy. In December, for instance, a US government study found extensive racial bias in almost 200 facial recognition algorithms, with racial minorities much more likely to be misidentified than whites. In the US, there are few rules governing how AI in general, and facial recognition in particular, can be deployed. So in 2019, several cities, including San Francisco and Oakland in California and Somerville in Massachusetts, banned city departments (including police) from using the technology. Healthcare AI is increasingly being used to diagnose and manage all kinds of health issues, from spotting lung cancer to keeping an eye on mental health problems and gastrointestinal issues. Though much of this work is still in the research or early-development stages, there are startups — such as Mindstrong Health, which uses an app to measure moods in patients who are dealing with mental health issues — already trying out AI systems with people. Two startups in the midst of this are Auggi, a gut-health startup building an app to help track gastrointestinal issues, and Seed Health, which sells probiotics and works on applying microbes to human health. In November, they started collecting photos of poop from the general public that they intend to use to make a data set of human fecal images. Auggi wants to use these pictures to make an app that can use computer vision to automatically classify different types of waste that people with chronic gut-related problems — such as irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS — usually have to track manually with pen and paper. Art Can AI create art? More and more often the answer is yes. Over the last 10 years, AI has been used to make musical compositions, paintings and more that seem very similar to the kinds of things humans come up with (though the jury is still out on whether a machine can actually possess creativity). And sometimes, that art can even be a big money maker.  Perhaps the clearest indication that AI-generated art is gaining popularity came in late 2018, when a blurry, Old Masters-esque piece called “Edmond de Belamy” became the first work produced by a machine to be sold at auction. The print was created using a cutting-edge technique known as GANS, which involves two neural networks competing with each other to come up with something new based on a data set. In this case, the data set was a slew of existing paintings, while the new thing was the computerized artwork. GANS is also gaining popularity because it can be used to make deepfakes.",,,,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/191115110957-data-privacy-phone-file.jpg?q=w_3000,h_1918,x_0,y_0,c_fill","[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'dateModified': '2019-08-24T14:03:57Z', 'uploadDate': '2019-05-01T13:21:50Z', 'embedUrl': 'https://fave.api.cnn.io/v1/fav/?video=business/2019/05/01/artificial-intelligence-changing-work-orig.cnn-business&stellarUri=archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/video-resource/instances/h_6fe67f94109b7aea0f837afe9e3c3da9@published&stellarUdk=rn06132f&customer=cnn&edition=domestic&env=prod', 'duration': 'PT00H01M11S', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'name': 'How AI is changing the way we work', 'headline': 'How AI is changing the way we work', 'description': 'Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize many parts of business, from marketing to supply chain.

The Artificial Inventor Project

December  2019

   
   
   
   




By Ryan Abbott, MD, JD, MTOM, Professor of Law and Health Sciences at University of Surrey, UK, and Adjunct Assistant Professor of Medicine at UCLA, California, USA
In August 2019, our team (see below) announced two international patent filings for “AI-generated inventions.” That is to say, inventions generated autonomously by an artificial intelligence (AI) under circumstances in which we believe that no natural person, as traditionally defined, qualifies as an inventor. These applications list the AI as the inventor and the AI’s owner as the patent applicant and the prospective owner of any issued patents. The European Patent Office (EPO) and United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) have already evaluated these applications on their merits. Both offices found that the applications meet the requirements of patentability to the extent possible prior to the publication of the applications. The applications have also been filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty – which facilitates the process of obtaining patent protection in over 150 countries – and are currently pending examination in a growing number of patent offices.

In 2019, the Artificial Inventor Project team submitted patent applications listing DABUS (a type of AI-based “creativity machine”) as the inventor. This is notable because most jurisdictions only recognize humans as inventors. Their aim? To challenge established norms around inventorship. (Photo: PhonlamaiPhoto / iStock / Getty Images Plus)

The state of play
People have claimed to have secured patents for AI-generated inventions since at least the 1980s, but no one has ever disclosed an AI’s role in such a patent application. Patent offices will not generally object to self-reported inventorship; some of the earliest applicants for AI-generated inventions say their attorneys advised them to list themselves as inventors.

It is important that appropriate policies are put in place to deal with AI-generated works.

There is almost no law on AI-generated inventions. Most jurisdictions  require patent applications to disclose an inventor who is a natural person. This requirement is designed to protect and acknowledge the rights of human inventors. Yet, inventors do not necessarily own their patents; in fact, most patents are owned by businesses. Ownership rights can pass from an individual to a company by contractual assignment or otherwise by virtue of law. For example, in many jurisdictions, ownership passes automatically to an employer if an invention is created within the scope of employment. Even when an inventor does not own a patent, laws requiring a natural person to be listed as an inventor ensure that people receive due credit. However, these laws were created without regard to the future possibility of inventive activity by machines.
Recent developments in copyright law with respect to AI
There has been more discussion about AI-generated works and copyright law. In 1988, the United Kingdom became the first country to provide explicit copyright protection for AI or “computer-generated” works. In circumstances where an otherwise copyrightable work is created but no natural person qualifies as an author, the “producer” of the work is deemed to be the author.
The United States Copyright Office has taken the opposite approach. Since at least 1973, it has applied a “human authorship policy” that prohibits copyright protection of works that are not generated by a human author. That makes it very tempting to take credit for an AI-generated work, such as a song or an artwork, that you think has commercial value – the AI is unlikely to complain.

In IP as well as many other areas of the law, the phenomenon of AI stepping into the shoes of people promises to be profoundly disruptive.

The human authorship policy came into public view with the “Monkey selfies” case , which involved a series of images taken by an Indonesian crested macaque named Naruto. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) sued on Naruto’s behalf, arguing he should own the copyright in the photographs. However, the case was dismissed because the United States Congress had not authorized animals to sue under the Copyright Act. As a result, the merits of the human authorship requirement have never been tested in court.
Why patent protection for AI-generated inventions is necessary
Patent protection should be available for AI-generated works because it will incentivize innovation. The prospect of holding a patent will not directly motivate an AI, but it will encourage some of the people who develop, own, and use AI. Allowing patents on AI-generated works, therefore, will promote the development of inventive AI, which will ultimately result in more innovation for society.
Also, patents can promote disclosure of information and the commercialization of socially valuable products. Patents for AI-generated works will accomplish these goals as well as any other patents. By contrast, failing to allow protection for inventions generated by AI would mean that, in the future, businesses may not be able to use AI to invent, even when it becomes more effective than people in solving certain problems. Such a scenario would also encourage gamesmanship with patent offices by failing to declare a filing is based on an AI-generated invention.
Beyond providing protection for AI-generated inventions, AI should be listed as an inventor when it is functionally inventing because this will protect the rights of human inventors. Allowing a person to be listed as an inventor for an AI-generated invention would not be unfair to an AI, which has no interest in being acknowledged, but allowing people to take credit for work they have not done would devalue human inventorship. It would put the work of someone who merely asks an AI to solve a problem on an equal footing with someone who is legitimately inventing something new.
Of course, an AI would not own a patent. We have never suggested this, and I am not aware of anyone seriously making such an argument. AI systems lack both legal and moral rights and thus the ability to own property. Moreover, there would be significant costs and no obvious benefits to changing laws to allow AI ownership.  Nevertheless, many of the objections to the Artificial Inventor Project have unfortunately focused on AI ownership.
Again, listing an AI as an inventor is not a matter of providing rights to machines, but it would protect the moral rights of traditional human inventors and the integrity of the patent system. As discussed earlier, it is frequently the case that the inventor of a patent is not its owner. We also believe that an AI’s owner should own any patents on AI-generated inventions, in line with general principles of property ownership as well as rules that apply to other areas of intellectual property (IP) law such as trade secret protections.
Natural persons, AI and inventorship
The argument has been made that for any AI-generated work there is a natural person that qualifies as an inventor. That argument is not persuasive. When someone instructs an AI to solve a problem, that person may qualify as an inventor if he or she formulates or structures a problem in a manner that requires inventive skill but not where a problem is obvious or already understood.
Similarly, a programmer or AI developer might qualify as an inventor where he or she has designed an AI to solve a specific problem or where he or she has been required to skillfully select training or input data. But a programmer is probably not an inventor where he or she has merely contributed to an AI’s general problem-solving capabilities without being aware of the specific problem the AI is being applied to or its ultimate output. The connection is even more tenuous where many programmers spread over time and space are involved in developing an AI.
Finally, the person who recognizes the relevance of an AI’s output may also qualify as an inventor, particularly if the AI suggests many possible options and a person has to use inventive skill to select an optimal solution. However, that does not seem appropriate where the importance of an AI’s output is obvious and no further human activity is necessary.

The creativity machine, DABUS (outlined above) was responsible for generating two inventions, which are the subject of patent applications: a plastic food container based on fractal geometry; and a flashing light (or “neural flame”) to alert emergencies. (Photo: Courtesy of Dr. Stephen Thaler)

The need for appropriate policies to address IP challenges
It is important that appropriate policies are put in place to deal with AI-generated works. Today, inventive AI may be a relatively insignificant part of innovation in economic terms. But AI is improving exponentially, and human researchers are not. Even in the short-to-medium term, this means that inventive AI may become a significant part of research and development. When it does, it will be seriously problematic if we lack clear rules on whether AI-generated inventions can be protected, who, or what, should be listed as an inventor, and who owns these inventions and related patents.

Listing an AI as an inventor is not a matter of providing rights to machines, but it would protect the moral rights of traditional human inventors and the integrity of the patent system.

Inventive AI presents novel challenges to other areas of IP law, such as the standard of the “person skilled in the art” used to evaluate inventive step, a key measure of the patentability of an invention. More on this in Everything Is Obvious (Ryan Abbott, 66 UCLA L. REV. 2, 23-28 (2019)). That test essentially asks whether an average researcher would find a patent application obvious in light of existing relevant information, and if so, the application will be denied. As AI increasingly augments the capabilities of average workers, they will become more sophisticated and knowledgeable. This evolution of the skilled person, in turn, should raise the bar for patentability similar to how, in Europe, the concept has evolved to include skilled persons where team-based approaches to research are the norm.
At some point in the future, when AI transitions from automating human researchers to automating inventive activity on a broad scale, inventive AI might even represent the skilled person. AI capable of routinely automating research will likely find more that is obvious than today’s skilled person. It may be difficult, however, to reason cognitively about what an AI would find obvious. This may require changing the test for inventive step to focus on economic rather than cognitive factors such as long-felt but unsolved needs, concurrent invention, professional skepticism, and so forth. It may even require focusing on the ability of AI to reproduce the subject matter of a patent application. Moving further forward in time, with no obvious limit to the future intelligence of machines, someday everything may be obvious to a super-intelligent AI.
In IP as well as many other areas of the law, the phenomenon of AI stepping into the shoes of people promises to be profoundly disruptive. In my forthcoming book, The Reasonable Robot: Artificial Intelligence and the Law (mid-2020, Cambridge University Press), I consider more broadly how AI behaving in human-like ways will challenge existing legal standards designed to regulate the behavior of people. I argue that a principle of AI legal neutrality, by which the law does not discriminate between people and AI when they are performing the same activities, will tend to improve human well-being.
In addition to myself, the Artificial Inventor Project team includes Robert Jehan at Williams Powell, Malte Koellner at Dennemeyer, Reuven Mouallem at Flashpoint IP, Markus Rieck at Fuchs IP, and Peggy Wu at Top Team. The artificial inventor for these applications, DABUS, was developed by Dr. Stephen Thaler.

Call for comments: impact of AI on IP policy
WIPO:
WIPO is seeking to develop, through an open process, a list of issues concerning the impact of artificial intelligence (Al) on intellectual property (IP) policy that might form the basis of future structured discussions.
Member states and all other interested parties are invited to provide comments and suggestions on a Draft Issues Paper. Comments are welcome on any aspect of the IP system affected by AI.
United States Patent and Trademark Office
In late 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) also announced a request for public comments with respect to both patent and copyright protection for AI-generated works to inform policymaking in these areas.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), automation and machine learning within business practices and how these technologies will affect and influence our workforce has become a common theme of discussion.But the time for talk has passed; now we must act.As business leaders, we understand that implementing these technologies is crucial to remaining competitive. There is no “if” – only “when” and “how much”. Today, we all agree that AI, automation, and machine learning bring tremendous value, in terms of efficiency, speed and flexibility, and we must ensure that our companies implement these technologies to remain ahead of the curve and the competition. Have you read?What skills does the future workforce need?The future of your workforce, so how do you attract millennials? As we integrate these tools into our businesses, it is our duty – and, I might argue, our moral obligation – to also provide our employees with the new skills they need to adapt. This month, as we approach the 50th Annual Meeting in Davos and a new decade, we find ourselves – business leaders from different industries and countries alike – charged with a significant challenge: in the face of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, how do we build a sustainable workplace that marries this adoption of technology with the changing roles of our employees? I propose we start here – the four areas in which business leaders must focus their attention in order to build a more sustainable workforce: 1. Become advocates for a modernized education system.  I’ve previously said – and I strongly believe – that our education system itself needs to evolve to embrace not only traditional four-year universities but also vocational schools and apprenticeships. By properly investing in educational frameworks that allow for new avenues of learning and skills-gathering, we can make flexible education systems an intrinsic part of the cultural norm and arm employees with the complementary skillsets they’ll inevitably need for sustainable careers. Today, many colleges are focused on honing one’s hard tech skills, but in this digitally native culture, success is built on possessing myriad talents. It’s therefore critical we advocate for curriculums that include both hard and soft skills, such as emotional intelligence, and self-efficacy. We must work to dispel long-held cultural beliefs that education ends at a person’s commencement ceremony. Consider LinkedIn’s 2019 Workforce Learning Report, in which 94% of employees said they’d stay at a company longer if that company invested in helping them learn. If today’s workforce values continuous, multi-faceted learning, our education system must too.What skills will be in demand and which will be in decline by 2022?2. Implement fluid and seamless learning opportunities. The modern workplace will continuously require us to learn new solutions for a variety of fresh challenges and successful businesses will be those that both recognize and cater to employee hunger for lifelong learning. But we need to go beyond simply making education and training available. Gone are the days of large group day-long sessions and lengthy instructional videos; instead, employers must meet employees on the platforms that best align with their habits – encouraging them to pursue skills development programmes that are right for them, at their own pace, and through mediums that are best suited to their learning style. Whether it is webinars, online games, or in-person mentor programmes, we must find ways to seamlessly integrate organic reskilling moments at work, so it does not feel like a “chore,” but rather becomes a fluid and natural aspect of the holistic work experience.The number of days of extra learning required3. Instil a top-down approach to learning. Executives need to “walk the walk” when it comes to reskilling employees whose roles are destined to change – laying the groundwork for a culture of curiosity and continuous learning. The best way to accomplish this is to instill change from the top down. In order to build a sustainable workforce, leaders themselves should show they are not immune to change and should participate in training alongside their direct reports. In fact, data suggests that the number one way learners discover the skills they need to improve in their roles is when their manager provides specific direction or hands-on guidance. At the same time, CEOs can’t be afraid to ask questions or learn from those around them. It is in being vulnerable and curious that we can create a larger company culture wherein workers are encouraged to exhibit more trainable and curious mindsets. Participating in regular skill development and retraining programmes allows all of us to feel more aptly prepared to embrace the workplace of tomorrow. 4. Take advantage of AI and machine learning to optimize reskilling. In the age of AI, success in business will increasingly be linked to the relationship between people and machines, and employee reskilling is no different. Our research suggests that workers are highly receptive to AI-related training, with 80% willing to learn new skills to take advantage of AI in their current jobs. So as AI and machine learning technologies change the types of jobs employees will have, these same technologies can be used to power the training systems and tools that can efficiently reskill employees. Reskilling tools powered by these technologies are scalable, available 24/7 and extremely cost-effective. Rate of automation in the workforceThis is not simply about prioritizing digital technologies to gain a competitive edge – there will always be tasks that simply cannot be accomplished without a human touch. It relates instead to our inherent duty as industry leaders and global stakeholders to better invest in education systems wherein our employees can augment skills for sustainable careers and business leaders can develop a more enriched internal talent pool.Don't miss any update on Future of WorkSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Jobs and the Future of WorkEducation and SkillsFourth Industrial RevolutionForum InstitutionalShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Cancer care 2035: multi-disciplinarity is key
An enthralling insight into the care that could be offered to cancer patients of the future was presented by cancer imaging expert Professor Regina Beets-Tan during her a keynote presentation at the recent British Institute of Radiology congress.
Report: Mark Nicholls





In the session ‘Oncologic imaging: Future perspectives’, the professor outlined what a Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) of the future – a team in 2035 – would look like in an era where cancer care will centre on patients, precision medicine, screening and detection of early tumours, minimally-invasive treatment, targeted therapies and imaging, and prolonged survival for patients with metastatic disease. Treatment, she suggests, will feature image-guided precision radiotherapy, surgery, and effective targeted therapies and immunotherapy.

Beets-Tan predicts that the MDT meeting of 2035 would consist of the treating physicians and interventional radiologist along with other diagnostic specialists, to include a geneticist, pathologist, and computer scientist. Such a team will deliver an integrated approach to diagnosis and an integrated solution to a clinical question. ‘The radiologist will be a full arm of his clinical partners and will be working side by side to give best care to the patient, who will be engaged in the treatment decision-making after the risks and benefits had been explained,’ she envisions. ‘Minimally-invasive treatment and organ-preserving treatment, which will improve quality of life, will become part of the spectrum of treatment options because we will see more complete responses to the highly-effective local and targeted therapies.’The radiologist will work together with computer scientists and software engineers to validate Artificial Intelligence (AI) work on high volume, non-complex diagnosis, leaving the radiologist with more time to focus on complex cases and interact closely with clinicians. The interventional radiologist and surgeon will work closely together in image-guided intervention and surgery to provide good local control with less collateral damage. ‘This paradigm shift in personalised medicine will be a move from tissue to molecular risk profiles; from imaging the tumour to imaging the tumour micro-environment,’ she added. ‘Mutation in genes are the drivers of cancer growth and that is what you want to target. Mutational burden and molecular profiles of tumours become the key factor in cancer treatment.’Beets-Tan also discussed the potential of AI to prevent over-treatment with immunotherapy. Costs of immunotherapy and risk of toxicity with combination therapy are high, so AI-powered accurate prediction models of outcome will play an important role.



Fast AI predictionBorders between disciplines will fade; it will be about patients and patient-shared decision-making and the best outcomeRegina Beets-Tan‘Our work in radiomics has shown that AI can predict response to anti-PD-1 at first follow-up. First studies have shown that tracer imaging has the potential to non-invasively map the entire tumour heterogeneity and its response to treatment, which cannot be captured by a single biopsy of only one lesion. We need to keep searching for non-invasive advanced tools that can drive precision,’ Beets-Tan concluded. ‘Borders between disciplines will fade; it will be about patients and patient-shared decision-making and the best outcome. We will have a role as a radiologist that is different from now; we are going to combine our skills in technology with our knowledge of treatment. It is an exciting future for those working in oncology because the new beginning has just begun.’The treatment possibilities she outlined are the future, she stressed but, in 2035, ‘the present’ is a mere 15 years away.Profile:Regina Beets-Tan is Professor of Radiology at the University of Maastricht and the University of Southern Denmark, and also chairs the department of radiology at The Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam.

So what exactly is a 'good job,' anyway?




Another take on gigs: Just making ends meet




Scorecard: Nine traits of a good job 








December 19, 2019 04:05 PM











A generation ago, when hulking robots were wheeled en masse onto factory floors and positioned along the assembly line, it was the opening salvo in a long, slow invasion: Automation was coming for our jobs.
The latest front in the workplace revolution isn't the shop floor, however. It's the office—thanks to productivity-boosting software poised to leap forward in coming years with the advance of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
This time it won't be blue-collar workers forced to adapt. College graduates have exponentially greater exposure to the AI revolution than their less-educated counterparts, according to a growing body of research that includes studies by the Brookings Institution, McKinsey and the Pew Research Center.
The list of the most AI-exposed occupations includes the highly paid, from marketers and research analysts to bankers, sales managers and software engineers—even doctors and lawyers.



Yet, unlike the factory-floor takeover in the 1980s, knowledge workers are less likely to see the digital coup coming.
""At first, the (technology) is complementary, because it makes the people in these white-collar jobs more and more productive,"" says Hyejin Youn, an assistant professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. ""But there is a peak to that productivity, and after that you reach the danger of substitution by automation, where it costs you your job.""











The threat is inspiring global debate about the value created from automation—and what to do about a workforce that could be massively displaced. It has emerged in the Democratic presidential campaign, as a central element in technologist Andrew Yang’s long-shot bid. He and others believe a universal basic income will be necessary to offset job losses.
Others think the economy will adapt and new jobs will be created around the capabilities introduced by artificial intelligence. Regardless, a painful period of adjustment seems likely.



 








That prospect can seem far off given the current state of AI, which thrives on crunching large datasets with defined boundaries, and on executing repeatable processes. Right now, that makes it perfect for handling rote busywork.
""It's the stuff where you hear people say, 'I didn't go to college for four years so I could do this,' and that represents a really embarrassingly large percentage of office work today,"" says Sean Chou, CEO of West Loop AI startup Catalytic.
But that's just the first fruits.
AI also can use that analytical acumen for advanced pattern matching, poring through reams of data to draw obscure correlations and make canny predictions. If that reminds you of a financial analyst predicting a company's market performance, or of a legal team searching for a precedent, or of a doctor matching a list of symptoms against a catalog of known ailments—well, you get the idea.
""When parents were encouraging their children to go into the field of medicine or law, they weren't thinking that robots were going to replace some portion of that work one day,"" says Chou. ""But I think that's really going to happen, because when you look at these fact-based professions that draw on patterns, you get into this category where AI is just going to have a tremendous advantage.""
THE PATENTS ARE COMING
To isolate AI from traditional automation, a new Brookings Institution report relied—not without irony—on an algorithm that searched for AI-related patents that could be tied to specific industries.
According to Brookings, one of the sectors with the strongest correlation is professional services. That doesn't necessarily mean that accounting and consulting jobs are doomed, but experts generally agree that even the most optimistic take on AI—the version in which machine learning generates productivity gains that lead to more relaxed work schedules and also creates new, unforeseen job categories that make up for those it devours—will cause substantial temporary upheaval.
The shakeup, according to Brookings' data, will disproportionately affect some demographics that have previously been fairly immune to such trends: men, workers in the prime of their careers, whites and Asians.
Why? Each is overrepresented in the sort of analytical, technical roles that AI seems particularly apt to influence.
""These are things that have been hitherto ground out by well-paid, midlevel executives and their teams but that may now be more easily and accurately produced by AI tools,"" says Mark Muro, the Brookings study's lead author.
In contrast, women are statistically overrepresented in fields such as education and health care, where they are more likely to perform the sort of interpersonal tasks that computers struggle to pull off.
Some sectors of the economy that were heavily affected by the first wave of automation, such as retail and food service, may get a pass during the AI revolution.
Manufacturing, however, is again likely to be heavily affected, which is the chief reason a group of heartland states touching Illinois—Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Kentucky—are among six that Brookings says have the most overall exposure.
Indiana has the highest exposure in the country, according to the report, while Illinois ranks 11th. Chicago ranks 29th among metro areas, while two Michigan cities, Grand Rapids and Detroit, rank third and sixth nationally.
The AI revolution may play out in slow motion. Chou, for example, says, ""Every day, there's something new in AI that's amazing and also something that's so comically bad that you realize we're still really far off.""
For every startling advance, there's a Reddit meme showing self-propelled, robotic vacuums getting hopelessly entangled in toilet paper. There also are examples in history where things didn't work out according to the worst-case scenario: Past economic upheavals, such as the industrial revolution, typically have resulted in new jobs offsetting those lost.
But that doesn't mean it's too early for a reckoning based on AI's potential.
In Britain, politicians have floated the notion of a four-day workweek in response to the efficiency gains brought on by AI and similar technologies, and Yang isn't the only one in the U.S. beating the drum for universal basic income. But thus far, the question of what to do if AI blows up the economy has been largely unexplored.
""There will be individuals who find even more meaningful work than what they had previously and others who don't find work at all,"" says Mike Evans, co-founder of Grubhub and now CEO of Fixer, a tech-enabled home repair service that Evans says he created in part to address the coming labor market upheaval. ""The more meaningful options we're able to create, the less disruptive this will be. This is one of the major challenges our society is going to face in the next one or two generations—it's a massive problem coming at us very quickly.""
Those wishing for a coordinated response can hope that AI's impact on high-status workers gets the attention of boards and investors in a way that past working-world upheavals have not.
""Perhaps there's a greater common cause or common involvement (between executives and affected workers) that may help us think about this more clearly as a society,"" says Brookings' Muro.
Much more certain is that an automated future is coming, whether we're ready or not.
""We can have this philosophical, sociological discussion about whether this is good or bad, or whether we even need to have jobs to be human beings, or whether we can just leave it to the machines and feel good about it,"" says Youn, the Kellogg professor. ""But it's also important to take a step back and see that this really is happening—the things we thought could not be accomplished by machines will be. It's just a matter of time.""
Workers are beginning to take that idea to heart.
""What's most frightening to me is that we're ignoring it,"" says Joy McKinney, a personal financial adviser from Pleasant Prairie, Wis., who attended a December Yang rally in Chicago. ""It hasn't disrupted my business yet, but I'm not naive enough to think it doesn't have that potential. It's like a tsunami that's on course to hit us, and if we're not prepared, there will be casualties.""

So what exactly is a 'good job,' anyway?



Creating and sustaining good jobs is crucial for the Chicago region’s success, as the divide widens between the earnings of those with college degrees and those without. The city has fewer working-class jobs, and a boom in health care and social services has not offset our loss of manufacturing work.

In this Future of Design iteration, Maria Mingallon explains how we can utilise the data we have about our building decisions to make predictions using machine learning.








The third in our Future of Design series – which looks at how new and changing technologies are affecting the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries – sees Maria Mingallon explore what artificial intelligence and machine learning are and what some of the potential benefits may be for the future.


Like electricity or the internet, artificial intelligence (AI) is considered a general purpose technology with the potential to transform productivity, accelerate economic growth and improve wellbeing across the whole of society. It has started, and will continue to, drastically transform the way we work and live. At least, this is what the report ‘Towards Our Intelligent Future’ published by New Zealand AI Forum earlier this year affirms. The report represents over nine months of collaborative work on parallel streams exploring AI adoption, policy and strategy in New Zealand and around the world. It highlights the value of AI for achieving New Zealand’s wellbeing, sustainability and economic goals.
If AI is so great and can do so much for humanity, why does it also provoke such strong reactions against it? Science-fiction thrillers have probably not contributed to promoting the good intentions behind AI. Thinking of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator as a cyborg assassin fighting against AI dominance is an almost inevitable reaction for most of us. After all, who is interested in making a movie about the number of times we benefit from the use of AI-based algorithms when discovering a new song we like? 
Ok, let’s give Hollywood a chance. Do you remember the movie Moneyball? It starred Brad Pitt in the role of Billy Bean who follows the advice of Peter Brand, a young Yale-educated research geek, with a degree in economics who is capable of crunching numbers to come up with suggestions about finding true baseball stars, based purely on data analytics and statistics.
While that is not (yet) AI, the movie does a great job of illustrating the benefits of data analytics, which are the foundation of any AI application. It also demonstrates how toxic our own bias can be, particularly inside boardrooms. Intrigued? This Forbes article expands on why business leaders need to take a proactive approach towards data analytics.
Despite its potential and wide usage, AI suffers from being a ‘suitcase term’ used to refer to everything from complex statistical algorithms to autonomous robots. The difficulty in describing AI succinctly might be one of the reasons why people react poorly to it. They simply don’t understand it. Almost all definitions I have come across include unnecessary verbiage which only contributes to mystifying a technology which, if conveniently democratised, has the potential to help resolve the many crises our planet suffers from.
We often fear what we do not understand; our best defense is knowledge. – Tuvok (Star Trek: Voyager)
We humans fear and criticise what we can’t understand. Nobel Laureate, Bob Dylan, referred to it in his lyrics of ‘The Times are A-Changin’. As Tuvok from Star Trek puts it, knowledge is a great strategy to overcome the fear that comes with novelty. On top of this, education is frequently identified as a barrier to the expansion of almost any new technology. In 2018, AI Forum of New Zealand reported that 44 per cent of survey respondents identified (lack of) education as a key barrier to AI adoption. Kaggle’s 2017 data in Figure 1 below also reports that “lack of data science talent” is the second largest barrier faced at work by data scientists.

Besides AI practitioners, leaders who understand the business context and potential of AI will have a clear competitive advantage. As a McKinsey puts it in their AI guide for executives: “It’s no longer the preserve of artificial-intelligence researchers and born-digital companies like Amazon, Google, and Netflix.” AI is a technology which can and will help anyone who understands how to best make use of it.
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Without using unnecessary technical language, AI is a technology which aims to replicate how a human brain thinks. In essence, it seeks to replicate how we perceive the world, extract data, analyze it and make decisions based on such data. It is all about how our brains create patterns that merge and join data to construct a version of the world within which we make decisions to take one direction or another.
So, data and data analytics are at the core of any AI application. That is actually the key difference between AI and traditional computing consisting of explicit programming instructions, such as ‘do’ something, ‘if’ a condition is ‘True’. Artificial Intelligence algorithms are fuelled on data. Between raw data and making intelligent informed decisions, there is first training and then learning. That is where machine learning comes in. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI which uses statistical analysis and algorithms to extract insights from large volumes of data. ML is essentially acquiring knowledge based on what has happened in the past.

Think for a moment about how you first learned about the world. When you were a kid, your parents repeated the words ‘daddy’ and ‘mummy’ to you. They did it again and again and again, with slightly different variations such as wearing different clothes, being at the dinner table or while playing with you. They passed on their ‘image’ and the word associated with such image to you until you started pronouncing something that was a ‘good guess’ of what they were actually saying to you. They then smiled and reinforced your behaviour. They were ‘training’ you.
Training of a machine learning model happens in a similar way. Let’s call our ML experiment the ‘family member detection algorithm’. Each data point represents an instance when a family member met you and introduced themselves as ‘mummy’, ‘daddy’, ‘grandad’ and so on. Each time they might have worn different clothes, been in a different location, et cetera. By exposure to these different settings (features) you started recognising what remained constant: the facial traits of the family member in question and their associated position in the family. At some point in your infancy, you were able to recognise your mum and dad and, most importantly, distinguish them from a stranger.

Making predictions
Let me give you another example. Imagine that you would like to buy a home (hopefully not in Auckland where it is pretty difficult to afford anything reasonable). You know that the price of a property is normally directly proportional to the floor area. If you plot those two features you would most likely be able to visualise a ‘trend’, such as the one in Figure 4 below. You could in essence draw a straight line – a linear regression prediction – which, for a given floor area, would give you an idea of the price to expect. You could also choose to plot the points with a different colour based on the number of rooms.



Figure 4: Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the area of a dwelling, the number of rooms and the average house price. Source: Mike O’Connor on Medium
Of course, it is not so simple. There are many other factors that come into play such as number of bathrooms, parking spaces, garden area, neighbourhood, walkability index and perhaps even whether it has a fireplace. These are all ‘features’ of a data set in machine learning terms. Now, instead of plotting just two features as we did above, imagine you plot them all, using a correlation matrix. Have a look at Figures 5 and 6 to visualise the inner relationships between the typical features affecting the price of a house. The ones which are closer to 1.0 indicate a larger impact on the sale price.

Once you have a decent understanding of your dataset, you can start training your model. How do you do that? You basically slice the dataset into two: the test and the training set. There are a number of papers on the subject of how many data entries should go to each set, but a good rule of thumb is 70 per cent for testing, the rest for training. As you may have guessed, the larger and the more accurate your dataset is, the easier it is to train your ML model and the higher the certainty of the predictions it would be able to make. The process of training the model is, in essence, passing on the data entries from the test set and comparing it to the training set, so that when a new entry comes in, it can make an informed guess: a prediction. That is what machine learning is in simple terms.
Hopefully you are still reading because the best part is yet to come. If you’re not a data scientist or a computer programmer, rest assured that almighty Bill Gates still has you in his thoughts! Microsoft Azure has recently launched a tool capable of undertaking machine learning on the cloud without any coding required. They recommend (or even choose for you) the ML algorithm best suited for your needs alongside the cloud computing processing power you would require to execute it.
All you need is to provide your datasets and of course, a clear formulation of what you are trying to predict from your data. A great tutorial from ‘Towards Data Science’ – a blog I recommend you start following – in case you are interested in giving it a go is available here.

Thus, we always come back to the data. Think about the data you have produced today. If you are a designer working in the AEC industry, it is quite likely that you have made decisions as to where to position a grid line, a window, a door, a pipe and what size they needed to be, et cetera. How are those decisions documented? You probably have it in front of you.
Your building information models (BIMs) are much more than mere representations of objects in the three dimensional space. They hold all of your design decisions. For example, the ratio between the location of a window and the overall dimensions of a room might come from past experience or perhaps the results of a sophisticated daylight simulation. Either way, the ratio between those elements is data your BIM hosts.
If you use BIM to document your projects, you are effectively in possession of a data mine, which is still hidden for most. What’s even better, think of all of those other projects you have done this year using BIM. If you were to put them all together, side by side, you would certainly be able to identify patterns, in particular if they are from the same sector (e.g. schools, hospitals). If you used BIM for all of them, chances are you can aggregate them to build your own dataset for training a machine learning algorithm which, next time, can help you predict where a window or a pipe should go and how big they need to be to be code compliant without necessarily running a single simulation.
Okay, that might sound like too big of a dream for now, but one thing is certain and that is the importance of curating your data. Refer to Figure 1 if you need proof. The results of the survey undertaken last year by AI Forum of New Zealand identified ‘dirty data’ as the highest barrier to AI adoption[1]. So showing a little love for those models which host your data assets will certainly pay off in the future. How well you curate your data today matters more than ever before.
Hungry for more? I shall come back to you in the new year with examples of AI in the AEC industry. Until then, I leave you one last resource which will help you in your personal quest to conquer the heart of machine learning: a starting point from the aforementioned Towards Data Science. As the proverb goes in Spanish, “nunca es tarde si la dicha es buena”. Funnily enough, Google Translate AI algorithms have not (yet) been able to grasp a decent translation of such proverb.

Machine intelligence (also known as artificial intelligence) is going to have both an awesome and unfortunate impact on our posterity. Let’s explore one possible way AI may impact the future of work and how it may dramatically change how we train our workforce.The graphic arts departmentA brand manager needs an advertisement. So, the brand manager sends a brief to the senior art director (in-house or at an agency) and asks for something amazing to be created. On or before the deadline, the brand manager and the art director meet to review the work. The brand manager is presented with three approaches, and after a number of meetings, a number of revisions and revelations, they agree on a final product.This is a process that has repeated itself for more than a century, and AI is not going to stop it.    After getting approvals from senior management, the art director must execute the work and deliver all of the versions and variations required. A list of deliverables can have hundreds of variations, each requiring subtle compositional changes, revised typography and resizing of images.Today, the senior art director hands this project to a group of junior art directors and graphic artists. This work is not tough; it’s just tedious, and there is a lot of it. Anywhere from a few hours to a few days to a few weeks later (depending on the length of the deliverables list), the junior art directors submit their finished work to the senior art director for final approval.  There is only one thing you can do about this: Become the very best AI coworker you can become.  The senior art director makes some subtle changes to the deliverables that are not quite right, and the junior art directors are taught why the changes had to be made. Of course, some of the work is perfect, and it takes only a second for the senior director to approve those. All in, a major campaign might take a 10-person art department a week or so to deliver.    The AI-assisted graphic artistNow, let’s imagine the same process in a slightly different way where the senior art director has an AI coworker (an AI system designed and trained to version graphic artwork). Instead of harnessing a team of junior art directors to build the deliverables, the senior art director clicks a button and the AI coworker builds every required deliverable in seconds.Unlike handing the work to a junior team and waiting hours, days or weeks, the work is ready immediately for review. The senior art director will still have to page through each version to give its final approval and might even have to tweak a few of the versions to get them just right. But the basic work—the work of 10 junior art directors—will be eliminated, and so will their jobs.From a fiscal management point of view, the senior art director’s productivity has increased exponentially. The ROI is easy to calculate, too. Remove 10 junior people from payroll who earn between a quarter and a half of the wages their supervisor earns. The unit will enjoy a three- to five-fold reduction in annual payroll expense, maybe more. This is an excellent path to value creation (for the shareholders).    Some things won’t change for a whileThe process between the brand manager and the senior art director will remain unchanged for a while. Creativity and collaboration are human traits that have a magical quality. Hits are a mystery. And while this may not always be true, today we rely on inspired, talented, uncompromising humans to create groundbreaking graphic art.But what about the junior art directors? They will be deprived of the mentorship, remediation and education. In a world filled with senior art directors that are augmented with AI coworkers, junior art directors need not apply.Multiply this scenario by every department where productivity can be increased with human and machine partnerships, and it’s easy to imagine millions of jobs being eliminated. Many of them will be people who trained a lifetime to achieve their positions. As each new purpose-built AI system comes online, the work for less productive humans will evaporate practically overnight.    Almost every CEO will insist on using AI to push productivity to its limits. The competitive advantage is too great if you’re first, and if you’re unfortunate enough to be a follower, fast or otherwise, an AI-augmented workforce will become table stakes. Nothing is going to stop this.What we really need to figure outFor me, the most devastating aspect of this future vision is what happens to the farm team. I would not be where I am were it not for a series of amazing mentors, role models and masters that I have been lucky enough to work for. For all practical purposes, my capabilities are directly attributable to my teachers (academic and professional). If our hypothetical senior art director doesn’t need junior art directors or if the corporation will not allow the hiring of humans who are not expert AI coworkers, how will the junior art directors learn enough to become senior?The logical conclusionIf you follow this hypothesis to its logical conclusion, at some point, the senior art directors are replaced by AI systems that have seen enough awesome graphic art to create artwork that is good enough from scratch. To be fair, the vast majority of work product created by journeymen across all disciplines is not at a masterpiece level.    I like to think that the full replacement of creative workers and production workers is still far away, but I know differently.What you can do about itThere is only one thing you can do about this: Become the very best AI coworker you can become. No matter how smart you think you are, there are things a well-trained AI system can do better than you can. It can look at more data, it can see the world differently, it can augment your capabilities.How do you become a best-in-class AI coworker? Start by learning to use the existing tools, inject yourself in the process and become a lifelong student of your art and the AI tools at the cutting edge of your profession.This approach may not save your human co-workers, but it will position you to survive and prosper in our exponentially changing world.

The graphic arts department
A brand manager needs an advertisement. So, the brand manager sends a brief to the senior art director (in-house or at an agency) and asks for something amazing to be created. On or before the deadline, the brand manager and the art director meet to review the work. The brand manager is presented with three approaches, and after a number of meetings, a number of revisions and revelations, they agree on a final product.

This is a process that has repeated itself for more than a century, and AI is not going to stop it.

After getting approvals from senior management, the art director must execute the work and deliver all of the versions and variations required. A list of deliverables can have hundreds of variations, each requiring subtle compositional changes, revised typography and resizing of images.

Today, the senior art director hands this project to a group of junior art directors and graphic artists. This work is not tough; it’s just tedious, and there is a lot of it. Anywhere from a few hours to a few days to a few weeks later (depending on the length of the deliverables list), the junior art directors submit their finished work to the senior art director for final approval.

[kickout id=""1""]

The senior art director makes some subtle changes to the deliverables that are not quite right, and the junior art directors are taught why the changes had to be made. Of course, some of the work is perfect, and it takes only a second for the senior director to approve those. All in, a major campaign might take a 10-person art department a week or so to deliver.
The AI-assisted graphic artist
Now, let’s imagine the same process in a slightly different way where the senior art director has an AI coworker (an AI system designed and trained to version graphic artwork). Instead of harnessing a team of junior art directors to build the deliverables, the senior art director clicks a button and the AI coworker builds every required deliverable in seconds.

Unlike handing the work to a junior team and waiting hours, days or weeks, the work is ready immediately for review. The senior art director will still have to page through each version to give its final approval and might even have to tweak a few of the versions to get them just right. But the basic work—the work of 10 junior art directors—will be eliminated, and so will their jobs.

From a fiscal management point of view, the senior art director’s productivity has increased exponentially. The ROI is easy to calculate, too. Remove 10 junior people from payroll who earn between a quarter and a half of the wages their supervisor earns. The unit will enjoy a three- to five-fold reduction in annual payroll expense, maybe more. This is an excellent path to value creation (for the shareholders).
Some things won’t change for a while
The process between the brand manager and the senior art director will remain unchanged for a while. Creativity and collaboration are human traits that have a magical quality. Hits are a mystery. And while this may not always be true, today we rely on inspired, talented, uncompromising humans to create groundbreaking graphic art.

But what about the junior art directors? They will be deprived of the mentorship, remediation and education. In a world filled with senior art directors that are augmented with AI coworkers, junior art directors need not apply.

Multiply this scenario by every department where productivity can be increased with human and machine partnerships, and it’s easy to imagine millions of jobs being eliminated. Many of them will be people who trained a lifetime to achieve their positions. As each new purpose-built AI system comes online, the work for less productive humans will evaporate practically overnight.

Almost every CEO will insist on using AI to push productivity to its limits. The competitive advantage is too great if you’re first, and if you’re unfortunate enough to be a follower, fast or otherwise, an AI-augmented workforce will become table stakes. Nothing is going to stop this.
What we really need to figure out
For me, the most devastating aspect of this future vision is what happens to the farm team. I would not be where I am were it not for a series of amazing mentors, role models and masters that I have been lucky enough to work for. For all practical purposes, my capabilities are directly attributable to my teachers (academic and professional). If our hypothetical senior art director doesn’t need junior art directors or if the corporation will not allow the hiring of humans who are not expert AI coworkers, how will the junior art directors learn enough to become senior?
The logical conclusion
If you follow this hypothesis to its logical conclusion, at some point, the senior art directors are replaced by AI systems that have seen enough awesome graphic art to create artwork that is good enough from scratch. To be fair, the vast majority of work product created by journeymen across all disciplines is not at a masterpiece level.

I like to think that the full replacement of creative workers and production workers is still far away, but I know differently.
What you can do about it
There is only one thing you can do about this: Become the very best AI coworker you can become. No matter how smart you think you are, there are things a well-trained AI system can do better than you can. It can look at more data, it can see the world differently, it can augment your capabilities.

How do you become a best-in-class AI coworker? Start by learning to use the existing tools, inject yourself in the process and become a lifelong student of your art and the AI tools at the cutting edge of your profession.

This approach may not save your human co-workers, but it will position you to survive and prosper in our exponentially changing world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The very same warehouse workers once predicted to be losing their jobs to mechanical replacements.But doing your job side-by-side with robots isn’t easy. According to their makers, the machines should take on the most mundane and physically strenuous tasks. In reality, they’re also creating new forms of stress and strain in the form of injuries and the unease of working in close quarters with mobile half-ton devices that direct themselves.“They weigh a lot,” Amazon worker Amanda Taillon says during the pre-Christmas rush at a company warehouse in Connecticut. Nearby, a fleet of 6ft-tall roving robot shelves zipped around behind a chain-link fence.Taillon’s job is to enter a cage and tame Amazon’s wheeled warehouse robots for long enough to pick up a fallen toy or relieve a traffic jam. She straps on a light-up utility belt that works like a superhero’s force field, commanding the nearest robots to abruptly halt and the others to slow down or adjust their routes.“When you’re out there, and you can hear them moving around, but you can’t see them, it’s like, ‘Where are they going to come from?’,” she says. “It’s a little nerve-racking at first.”'Antiquities' carved by robotsShow all 191/19'Antiquities' carved by robots'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYCTodd White 'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYCTodd White 'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYCTodd White 'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYC'Antiquities' carved by robotsArtwork courtesy of bitforms gallery NYCAmazon and its rivals are increasingly requiring warehouse employees to get used to working with robots. The company now has more than 200,000 robotic vehicles it calls “drives” that are moving goods through its delivery fulfillment centres around the US. That’s double the number it had last year and up from 15,000 units in 2014.Its rivals have taken notice, and many are adding their own robots in a race to speed up productivity and bring down costs.Without these fast-moving pods, robotic arms and other forms of warehouse automation, retailers say they wouldn’t be able to fulfill consumer demand for packages that can land on doorsteps the day after you order them online.But while fears that robots will replace human workers haven’t come to fruition, there are growing concerns that keeping up with the pace of the latest artificial intelligence technology is taking a toll on human workers’ health, safety and morale.Warehouses powered by robotics and AI software are leading to human burnout by adding more work and upping the pressure on workers to speed up their performance, says Beth Gutelius, who studies urban economic development at the University of Illinois at Chicago and has interviewed warehouse operators around the US.A robotic arm lifts a pallet of merchandise inside an Amazon Fulfillment Center (Getty)It’s not that workers aren’t getting trained on how to work with robots safely. “The problem is it becomes very difficult to do so when the productivity standards are set so high,” she says.Much of the boom in warehouse robotics has its roots in Amazon’s $775m (£591m) purchase of Massachusetts start-up Kiva Systems in 2012. The tech giant rebranded it as Amazon Robotics and transformed it into an in-house laboratory that for seven years has been designing and building Amazon’s robot armada.Amazon’s Kiva purchase “set the tone for all the other retailers to stand up and pay attention”, says Jim Liefer, CEO of San Francisco start-up Kindred AI, which makes an artificially intelligent robotic arm that grasps and sorts items for retailers such as The Gap.A rush of venture capital and private sector investment in warehouse robotics spiked to $1.5bn (£1.1bn) a year in 2015 and has remained high ever since, says Rian Whitton, a robotics analyst at ABI Research.Canadian e-commerce company Shopify spent $450m (£343m) this fall to buy Massachusetts-based start-up 6 River Systems, which makes an autonomous cart nicknamed Chuck that can follow workers around a warehouse. Other mobile robot startups are partnering with delivery giants such as FedEx and DHL or retailers such as Walmart.A Scout robot is being tested near Amazon’s Seattle headquarters (Amazon)Amazon this year bought another warehouse robotics start-up, Colorado-based Canvas Technology, which builds wheeled robots guided by computer vision. Such robots would be more fully autonomous than Amazon’s current fleet of caged-off vehicles, which have to follow bar codes and previously mapped routes within warehouses.The tech giant is also still rolling out new models descended from the Kiva line, including the Pegasus, a squarish vehicle with a conveyor belt on top that can be found working the early-morning shift at a warehouse in the Phoenix suburb of Goodyear, Arizona. A crisscrossing fleet of robots carries packaged items across the floor and drops them into chutes based on the zip code of their final destination.All of this is transforming warehouse work in a way that the head of Amazon Robotics says can “extend human capability” by shifting people to what they are best at: problem-solving, common sense and thinking on their feet.Robots sends packages down a chute which will deliver them to workers (AP)“The efficiencies we gain from our associates and robotics working together harmoniously – what I like to call a symphony of humans and machines working together – allows us to pass along a lower cost to our customer,” says Tye Brady, Amazon Robotics’ chief technologist.Brady says worker safety remains the top priority and ergonomic design is engineered into the systems at the beginning of the design stage. Gutelius, the University of Illinois researcher, says that the aspiration for symphonic human-machine operations is not always working out in practice.“It sounds quite lovely, but I rarely hear from a worker’s perspective that that’s what it feels like,” she says.Gutelius co-authored a report published this fall that found new warehouse technology could contribute to wage stagnation, higher turnover and poorer quality work experiences because of the way AI software can monitor and micro-manage workers’ behaviours.A worker stows packages into special containers after robots deliver them separated by postcode (AP)A recent journalistic investigation of injury rates at Amazon warehouses from The Centre for Investigative Reporting’s Reveal found that robotic warehouses reported more injuries than those without.Reveal looked at records from 28 Amazon warehouses in 16 states and found that the overall rate of serious injuries was more than double the warehousing industry average. Amazon has countered it is misleading to compare its rate with rivals because of the company’s “aggressive stance on recording injuries no matter how big or small”.The Reveal report also found a correlation between robots and safety problems, such as in Tracy, California, where the serious injury rate nearly quadrupled in the four years after robots were introduced.Melonee Wise, CEO of California-based Fetch Robotics – which sells its autonomous robotic carts to retailers and other clients – credits Amazon’s Kiva acquisition for propelling innovation in the industry.Support free-thinking journalism and attend Independent eventsBut she says that Amazon’s system forces workers to do “un-ergonomic moves” such as reaching up high or crouching down to pick out and stow inventory into the shelves-on-wheels.“They have robots that live in cages,” she says. “Our robots are designed to work safely around people, which is a very large distinction between the two systems.”Amazon hasn’t disclosed how its safety record at robot-powered warehouses compares to those without. But company officials remain optimistic that Amazon workers are adapting to the new technology.At a visit with a reporter earlier in December to the warehouse in North Haven, Connecticut, Brady was explaining the workings of a powerful robotic arm called a “palletiser” when crates it was stacking on a pallet started tumbling over. Unfazed by the temporary malfunction, he watched as an employee disabled the machine, discovered an apparent structural weakness in the pallet, adjusted the stack of crates and let the robot get back to work.“His ability to problem-solve that was like this,” Brady says, enthusiastically snapping his fingers. “What I love about that is it’s humans and machines working together.”Associated PressMore aboutAmazonartificial intelligenceRoboticsTechnologyWorkers RightsJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/5Are warehouse robots causing more harm than good?Are warehouse robots causing more harm than good?A robotic arm lifts a pallet of merchandise inside an Amazon Fulfillment CenterGettyAre warehouse robots causing more harm than good?A Scout robot is being tested near Amazon’s Seattle headquartersAmazonAre warehouse robots causing more harm than good?Robots sends packages down a chute which will deliver them to workersAPAre warehouse robots causing more harm than good?A worker stows packages into special containers after robots deliver them separated by postcodeAPAre warehouse robots causing more harm than good?Machines ‘creating new forms of stress’ and causing increasing injuries, experts say ✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Why humans should work with machines rather than against them

December 28, 2019 















































 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is not a new technology but has been around for the past 60 years. 
With the growth of data rising in the computing ecosystem and talent growth, it is nearly everywhere in the form of chatbots, internet search engines, product recommendations or in security platforms. 
At present, much of the investment in AI is done by a handful of international companies, which are leading the way in demonstrating to the rest of the world how to harness the full potential of these new technologies. 
AI has the potential to do so much more yet there is a tremendous amount of skepticism about the technology – the economics of it is quite hazy, for instance – and its usefulness to humans. 
In this piece, we will explore some of the possible human concerns regarding AI and examine the merit of these concerns. But before that let’s understand how AI and machine learning are related – AI means getting a computer to mimic human behaviour in some form or manner, and machine learning is a subset of AI – it constitutes systems that enable computers to analyse data and deliver AI applications.
Human concerns regarding AI 
The most common fears surrounding AI today are:
* Machine learning being synthetic as it is passed from humans and not all of the human knowledge can be infused into a machine 
* Machine-based decisions are biased and could be non-inclusive in nature by favouring a particular section of the society 
* Machine-based decisions are difficult to explain and may not stand in the court of law 
* When machines start to learn by themselves, humans would lose control and machines may take over humanity 
These are some important ones, though the list could go on. Let’s examine the implications of these in the society.
If machine intelligence is artificial, human intelligence is more artificial. No one is born with intelligence. Human intelligence is an accumulation of knowledge over time and from different sources. 
The idea of AI is to pass the collective confirmed human intelligence to machines for doing the routine tasks traditionally done by humans. 
It’s a misunderstanding that AI is a panacea for all problems, but it certainly can bring scale and efficiency to certain mundane activities. The machine learns from the data, and more the data, smarter the machine. This is the true potential of AI technologies. It is therefore important that we understand and leverage the technology in an appropriate way.
Another concern is that machine-based decisions are biased and non-inclusive. Humans have strong bias around income groups, race and gender.
They also have cognitive biases which cloud their judgement and decision making. AI learns from societal actions and if that’s biased then how can you expect AI algorithms to be bias-free? This is not a flaw of technology but a reflection of conscious/unconscious bias and prejudice that exists in the society. 
In fact, the AI technology is mirroring the society and that helps us to better identify societal shortcomings. The upside is that AI connects unconnected to the mainstream world. Its gives access to information, product and services which the unconnected segment might not have imagined in their current lifetime. For some of us, AI is deeply inclusive, both economically and socially. AI, if implemented in the right way, can help us reducing bias from our day to day decisioning process.
Another thing that makes humans uneasy about this new technology is that it is inexplicable in nature. AI models are known as black-box algorithms – higher the complexity, better the accuracy and hence harder to interpret. If we are using a tool for taking certain critical decisions, it is important to know what drives those decisions. Without this clarity, there is bound to be anxiety around the technology. 
The AI community is well aware of these deficiencies, and the next wave of AI will be about addressing the inexplicable factor surrounding this technology without necessarily exposing the commercial secrets. It is important to note that this technology is still in a nascent stage, and these doubts and fears should not hold us back from experimenting and benefitting from it.
Machines are getting smarter by the day and there is fear that smart machines will may take over human jobs in future. In a recent conference held in Shanghai, Elon Musk claimed that smart machines will surpass humans in every single way, while Jack Ma argued that humans will always be in charge of their destiny when it comes to technology – the truth may be somewhere in between. 
Experience so far tells us that machine have not been creative enough to learn anything outside data and hence there is limited possibility that machines will take over human talent in the foreseeable future. While AI may displace some jobs, it will also create jobs. PwC predicts that AI will create over 7.2 million jobs in the UK alone over the next two decades.
Machines and humans can co-exist for a smarter future
The first three industrial revolutions have transformed our society with digital technology playing an integral role. The fourth industrial revolution will see smart machines and humans collaborating further – driving hybrid decision making and producing better results. We need to place more accountability in the hands of the algorithm experts to produce benevolent smart machines which can create ethically sound, socially conscious, politically acceptable and economically viable decisions. 
But, in the meantime, lets learn how to work with machines rather than against them.

From The Reading ListArtnome: ""AI Artist Robbie Barrat And Painter Ronan Barrot Collaborate On 'Infinite Skulls' "" — ""It is early in the year, but the most compelling show for art and tech in 2019 may already be happening. AI artist and Artnome favorite Robbie Barrat has teamed up with renowned French painter Ronan Barrot for a fascinating show that lives somewhere in the margin between collaboration and confrontation.""The L'Avant Galerie Vossen emailed Robbie last April after seeing his AI nude portraits and asked if he would be willing to fly out to Paris to work with Ronan. Robbie agreed and flew out last July to meet with Ronan, and the two have been working together ever since. The show titled 'BARRAT/BARROT: Infinite Skulls' opens Thursday, February 7th, and literally features an 'infinite' number of skulls.""For the last two decades, it has been artist Ronan Barrot’s tradition to use the remaining paint on his palette to paint a skull each time he stops, interrupts, or finishes a painting. As it was explained to me, the skulls are like a side process of the main painting, it’s like when you clean out your motor after driving for miles and miles. Ronan now estimates that he has painted a few thousand of these, and this massive visual data set of painted skulls was perfect for AI artist Robbie Barrat to use in training his GANs (generative adversarial networks).""GANs are comprised of two neural networks, which are essentially programs designed to think like a human brain. In our case, we can think of these neural networks as being like two people: first, a 'generator,' whom we will think of as an art forger, and second, as a 'discriminator,' whom we will think of as the art critic. Now imagine that we gave the art forger a book with 500 skulls painted by Ronan as training material that he could use to create a forgery to fool the critic. If the forger looked at only three or four of Ronan’s paintings, he may not be very good at making a forgery, and the critic would likely figure out the forgery pretty quickly. But after looking at enough of the paintings and trying over and over again, the forger may actually start producing paintings good enough to fool the critic, right? This is precisely what happens with GANs in AI art.""AdvertisementWBGO: ""With 'Natural Machines,' Pianist Dan Tepfer Brings Coding and VR Into an Improv Arena"" — ""Dan Tepfer is a jazz pianist whose newest project, Natural Machines, brings virtual reality and algorithmic learning into the realm of the concert hall. He appears next Tuesday at National Sawdust in Brooklyn, where his audience will join him in an immersive audiovisual saga.""What kind of music J.S. Bach might be making today? Tepfer has long been obsessed with that composer’s famous Goldberg Variations — making it the subject of his 2011 album, Golberg Variations / Variations — and recently started thinking about how the same idea could propel a state-of-the-art musical idea.""Tepfer, who was formally trained as an astrophysicist but self-taught as a computer programmer, writes his own code for a Yamaha Disklavier, enabling the digital player piano to react to his improvisations in real time.""This program aired on December 30, 2019.Thank you for choosing journalism from WBUR and On Point.

Some the works are still images, while others are videos.At first glance, none of it seems to make any kind of sense.“People freeze. They’re mesmerized. They literally won’t move,” Morton said. “It’s like they have to look, and from what I’ve been told, get their bearings.”Morton’s work is part of a budding art form — one that uses artificial intelligence to generate images and visuals.VIDEO: An Austin artist explains how AI is used to create artDubbed generative art, the works are created through non-human systems, such as computers.Artists have used algorithms and computers to generate art as early as the 1950s. University of Texas art historian and curator Taylor Bradley said the infusion of AI into the generative art genre is a relatively new development.“Across the country, there are shows going up all the time about digital art, AI-generated art, smart technologies and what have you,” she said. “I think there is plenty of acceptance and excitement over this new medium.”Despite its recent arrival on the scene, Bradley said the practice of using AI to create art reminds her of a period in art history when artisans and craftsman used to hone their various skills to create beautiful vases and furniture.“I think artists have always been engineers who are inventing, innovating and pushing the limits of technology,” Bradley said.Before Morton opened her East 6th Street gallery — named the Generative Art Project — she was entrenched in the world of fashion. She has also worked as an art columnist in New York.Morton said the new brand of AI-powered generative art forces people to look inward for meaning rather than using external context.“For the first time in my life in a very overarching way, this work is arousing our self-awareness of our animalistic nature,” Morton said.Many of the artists whose works are featured in the gallery will first collect data sets found in the real world. Then, through the use of artificial intelligence, artists find patterns in data sets that can be incorporated into their work through visualization tools.Because the data is grounded in reality, Morton said, people gain a sense of familiarity even in generative art that looks completely abstract.“You get a feeling that you’re in the presence of a living, real thing,” Morton said. “And that changes both how you experience the work as well as how you try to understand it.”Morton’s husband, James Pricer, is a local artist who creates art with the help of artificial intelligence.For one of his works, Pricer used data that he collected from a person’s life, including their blood pressure, heart rate and genetic information.Though his art is largely enabled by the analysis powered by artificial intelligence, Pricer says the final part of his process depends on something much more human.“What tells me that I’m finished is when I have a very strong emotional reaction,” he said.Pricer, who has a background in data science, says he had long wanted to find out a way to communicate to others the meaning he found in numbers.“Traditionally in the art world, you either had representational art or abstract art. Just like bridging tech and art, I thought if I could bridge representation and abstraction, that would make it possible for me to communicate what I see and feel in the data, and it’s turning out to be true,” Pricer said.João Beira is the founder of Datagrama Visuals, a company based in Austin that organizes performances and exhibitions using AI-generated art.Beira came to the United States from his native Portugal about 10 years ago to pursue a doctoral degree in digital media at the University of Texas at Austin.“I realized that even though Austin is in touch with the musical experience, visually, there was not really much going on in terms of bringing new ideas and doing things outside the norm,” Beira said.Beira said the lack of an existing community is not necessarily a hindrance. Rather, he said it presents more of a blank canvass that he and other generative artists can fill.“Austin might not be the first city you think about when you think about this technology, but the fact that the scene does not yet exist helps us build a foundation to build something here,” Beira said.Beira said he finds meaning in generative art that is inspired by nature.“You can find, for example, how trees grow and how they generate branches, or how the scales of a fish are organized,” Beira said. “You can actually replicate these different patterns and algorithms, and you can generate them in real-time.”Beira uses different programs to create his works, such as “DeepDream” — an artificial intelligence-enabled software created by Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev that studies patterns in images and generates its own shapes and colors in based on the patterns that it has identified.Beira’s company also uses software created by an Austin-based company called “Synesthesia Live,” to create visualizations at live music performances.None of the visuals are pre-programmed by Beira to look a specific way.The added element of unpredictability, Beira said, is what makes AI-generated art exciting for him. Beira said he hopes his art can help people gain a better understanding of human consciousness, and in the process, themselves.“It’s not so much me being the creator and the ideas I have in my head,” Beira said. “It’s more about me being an architect, pulling all these things together and seeing where it takes me because it’s completely unpredictable how the machine learns to see the world, just like a child when it first starts to look around the world and begins making the notion of their own world.”Want to hear Austin’s top news every weekday morning?

Making predictions about tech is a tough game — remember, plenty of people predicted that the iPhone would be a massive failure.  So, it's not exactly surprising that tech innovations didn't go where everyone thought they would over the decade. Some moves in tech that had the biggest effects on daily life, like a few big tech companies dominating the internet and ad revenue, and the rise of digital surveillance, were widely predicted.

Of course, not every event of the 2010s was so clear. Most of these predictions that didn't work out are about scale and adoption, rather than predictions of technology that failed to manifest at all. Here are 5 that didn't happen, at least not yet.

1. Wearables went mainstream, but AR glasses like Google Glass and Snap Spectacles  aren't as big a deal as tech companies thought they'd be.











                                                  Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
                                                


In 2009, futurist Ross Dawson predicted that in the coming decade we could see ""augmented humans"" with AR glasses or contacts allowing us to control machines. Instead, Google Glass and Snap Spectacles both made Business Insider's list of ""Worst Tech of the Decade.""Something about the tech just didn't resonate with people, beyond the few superfans who tried them. Shortly after Google Glass was released, Google even had to warn wearers not to be ""creepy or rude (aka, a 'Glasshole')."" The company ended consumer sales of Glass in 2015.







2. Augmented reality, in general, isn't as advanced as experts predicted 10 years ago. Breakouts like Pokémon Go were big hits, but other consumer products haven't gone far.











                                                  Reuters
                                                


Futurist Gerd Leonhard predicted that tablets would usher in an era of augmented reality's dominance, which would be a ""huge boon"" to content production. AR has allowed for fun Snapchat effects and games like Pokemon Go, but it hasn't changed daily life in the way that people thought it would — at least not yet.

3. Self-driving cars have gotten more advanced, but they're not about to take over the roads anytime soon.











                                                  Mark Matousek/Business Insider
                                                


Autonomous vehicle technology from companies like Tesla has definitely improved, and reports of drivers falling asleep at the wheel have mostly been without injuries as the cars were able to compensate. But Tesla still says that autopilot mode requires ""active driver supervision,"" and a Tesla in autopilot mode earlier this month crashed into a police car, proving that the system is far from perfect. Self-driving tech from Alphabet and Uber have also yet to see a wide launch, and largely remain in the testing phase.

4. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were supposed to be the future, but they haven't been widely adopted, and Facebook's Libra currency has caused headaches for the company.

The last decade has seen plenty of highs and lows for cryptocurrencies. Investing in bitcoin early could have made you very wealthy by now, but many analysts see it as a bubble or niche financial product.Cryptocurrency exchanges have been hacked, sometimes leading to investors losing their holdings. Some early investors have made millions, others trying to get in on the craze have seen their investments fall to a fraction of their value as crypto prices fluctuate wildly.Facebook is working on the launch of its Libra cryptocurrency, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified on the subject before the House Financial Services Committee in October. Lawmakers have been critical of the project, and many major backers including PayPal and Visa have dropped out.

5. Some scientists and researchers predicted that artificial intelligence would help us avoid human shortcomings, like bias, but while the technology shows promise, it's far from perfect.











                                                  Fabrizio Bensch/ Reuters
                                                


Incorporating AI into sectors like policing was predicted to to help us avoid prejudice, but even as AI plays an increasingly important role in daily tasks, bias among AI exists. In fact, researchers keep finding evidence that AI is far from perfect and can introduce similar biases as those held by people. From an AI algorithm that kept black patients from getting the same quality of medical care as white patients, to hiring algorithms that learned to prefer male candidates, it's clearly early days for the technology.

Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Indian Market

By Electronics Media -   December 27, 2019

NITI Aayog’s roadmap for the national Artificial Intelligence (AI) program has given wings to the technology revolution in India. AI offers opportunities to complement human intelligence and enrich the way people live and work. India is recognising the potential of AI to change economies. India’s approach to implementation of AI has to be guided by optimisation of social goods, rather than maximisation of topline growth.
Let us explore the impact or changes AI has made on several sectors in India.
Role of AI in Indian Farming



Agriculture is a vibrant part of the Indian economy. AI has entered the Indian agriculture sector though lately but progressively. AI together with the Internet of Things and sensor technology can be the great enabler of precision agriculture. AI can also play a critical role along with remote sensing technology in the wide-scale implementation of Climate-Smart Agriculture. Some of the AI Techniques like Mobile-based Recommender Systems and Expert Systems can drastically increase the adoption rate of agriculture technologies like high yielding or disease-resistant varieties, innovative farm implements thereby help in increasing farmer’s income. 



Microsoft is addressing the problems in farming by detecting plant diseases, predicting climate changes and helping farmers to increase crop yields. Microsoft and International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics developed an AI Sowing App. The app states the right time to sow crops which is often the challenge for Indian farmers where drought and excess rainfall are serious challenges. The app uses machine learning andbusiness intelligence from the Microsoft Cortana Intelligence Suite.



IIT-Bombay alumnus Milan Sharma company,  Intello Labs claims to provides advanced image recognition technology that can recognize objects, faces, flora fauna and tag them in any image. The company claims to use deep learning algorithms on which a new generation of intelligent applications are being built for applications including agriculture. 



The company’s image based solutions provide insights into the crops’ health during the growing season and its final harvested quality by a click of a photograph.Gobasco, another company, uses AI and related technologies in the various stages of the agriculture supply chain to ensure it is efficient and fast. It claims to employ real-time data analytics on data-streams coming from multiple sources across the country aided with AI- optimized automated pipelines to dramatically increase the efficiency of the current agriculture supply chain.
AI in Indian Defense



Artificial Intelligence has been used mainly for commercial work and yet to dominate defence sector in India. Addressing the Army Technology Seminar Army chief said the next revolution in military affairs will be defined by technology and innovations in technology. “We need to address, how can we incorporate AI and big data into our system. If we don’t start now, it will be too late.” Army Chief Gen. Bipin Rawat.The process of preparing Indian defense forces for the use of AI has already been started by the ministry of defense.  In February 2018, a multi-stakeholder task force on Strategic Implementation of Artificial Intelligence for National Security and Defence was constituted.The objective of the task force is to study the whole range of issues on the implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on National security and defense needs. It has studied research and innovation in Artificial Intelligence and how it can be adopted in the defense sector.



The Defence Public Sector Undertakings and ordnance factories have been asked to develop AI-enabled products. A project has been sanctioned to the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR), a DRDO based laboratory.



CAIR has developed self-directed technology-based products to focus on strategic command control in communication systems. CAIR has developed snake robots, sentries and Hexa-robots for surveillance and investigation purposes.Some of the projects take account of AI-based solutions to signal intelligence for enhancing intelligence collation and analysis capabilities to the armed forces.Another project named, Energy Harvesting Based Infrared Sensor Network for Automated Human Intrusion Detection (EYESIRa) is another project. AI-based tools would aid the defense forces constructively in areas of decision support, sensor data analysis, predictive maintenance, situational awareness, accurate data extraction, security, etc. These tools will assist the defense personnel in better operations, maintenance, and logistics support.As reported, the Army Design Bureau has built an AI-based night vision device that will be mounted on helmet and wristband which is attached to it, vibrates when the device picks up on movement in the area. This will warn soldiers of unusual activity across different terrains and in high altitude areas.
 AI In Healthcare 



Indian government’s Niti Aayog has placed healthcare among one of the focus areas for AI  intervention. The Indian healthcare industry has faced many challenges and still struggling. As a country with over 1.3 billion population suffers from an acute shortage of doctors, doctors unwillingness to practice in rural areas and many more. AI startups and private players are working towards the adoption of AI in healthcare. AIIMS has already incorporated AI and Machine Learning into their research. Researchers from Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, (IIIT-D) and AIIMS collaborated for a project that uses thermal images and AI to predict hemodynamic shock or insufficient oxygen supply to organs leading to multi-organ failure in children even before doctors can diagnose the condition. 



In another case, researchers from the National Brain Research Centre (NBRC), and Neuroimaging and Neurospectroscopy Laboratory (NINS) used AI for early detection of Alzheimer’s.Medical education has not been untouched by the advent of AI. The Supreme Court suggested that advanced technologies like AI and ML should be leveraged to look into verification of medical colleges by the Medical Council of India (MCI) to grant permissions.Microsoft India and Apollo Hospital Group have collaborated to set up a National Clinical Coordination Committee (NCCC) which will work for the AI-powered Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Score API designed to foresee the risk of CVD in the population of the country.



Though Indian companies have made progress in the direction of embedding AI/ML capabilities into some of the diagnostic systems and treatment protocols, these are restricted to pilots and in high-end hospitals. Medicine is convoluted and it keeps changing. Artificial intelligence may not replace doctors in the near future but they can be a reliable assistant.

AI in Indian Transportation System



The growing Indian population has catalyzed the higher demand for mobility. Delhi government is planning to invest around ₹1,000 crore in the intelligent traffic management system, to fix the existing traffic system in India’s capital. The new system will work on radar-based monitoring with the help of AI. There have been also instances where these intelligent services have been extended to crowd management and service delivery as well. Allahabad police have already used new tech to manage vehicular and transportation traffic at the Kumbh Mela, one of the world’s largest religious gatherings. Indian Railways will use AI to find digital innovations for better customer interface and better service delivery. India’s Railway minister Piyush Goyal had said, “AI can transform Indian Railways in terms of safety, passenger amenities, better revenues, growth and efficiency.” AI forecasting application can predict train delays, maintenance of tracks. AI can solve oﬄine planning problems for a railway network, rescheduling, freight scheduling and many more.



Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka are the two Indian states to use Artificial Intelligence in the public transport systems. The states are set to install AI-powered anti-collision systems with two sensors to be fitted in the front bumper and the second near the headlight switch of the buses to avoid the accidents by continuously tracking and observing the object within the range up to 180 feet and indicating the bus driver in case of his being sleepy and inattentive.



NITI Aayog and International Road Federation, Genrva signed an agreement to cooperate in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems and to design a policy framework for the same. Pune has already planned an ITS implementations focussing on signal priority, vehicle tracking and automatic fare collection.  Delhi, parking lot at Palika Bazar has simplified the parking issue of 1,050 cars and 500 two-wheelers with the help of electronic parking guidance and VMS smart cards. 
AI in Banking Sector

ICICI Bank: In the month of February this year, ICICI bank has launched its AI-based chatbot, named iPal to interact with the customers to answer their queries. It has been reported that the iPal has interacted with 3.1 million customers and answered about 6 million queries with 90% accuracy rate.  ICICI Lombard General Insurance is not only using Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning to improve claims processing and settlement but also to detect frauds in motor and health insurance segments. With the application of AI and machine learning the insurer is able to check whether a hospital is sending claims for a particular illness at a particular price or not with greater efficiency and accuracy. Earlier AI was used to sanction straight forward cases like cataract and maternity but now it will be also used for complex cases like dengue. The company is looking forward to using AI in other various operations too. State Bank Of India: SBI has started AI to reduce additional cost, improve efficiency and detect human behavior. SBI has ‘SBI Intelligent Assistant’ (SIA)- a smart chat assistant which is evolved from the ‘cutting edge technology of AI’ that resolves the queries of NRI customers in an efficient manner like a bank representative.

HDFC Bank: HDFC’s Bank chatbot EVA (Electronic Virtual Assistant) is India’s first and largest AI-powered banking chatbot. EVA is available 24 hours and uses the latest in AI and natural language processing to understand customers’ queries and fetch the relevant information in just a millisecond.

Escher's artwork was an inspiration for Douglas Hofstadter's 1979 book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach: An ... [+] Eternal Golden Braid"", sometimes referred to as the Bible of artificial intelligence.M.C. Escher
The field of artificial intelligence has never been the subject of more attention and analysis than it is today. Almost every week, it seems, a new bestselling book comes out examining the technology, business or ethics of AI.


Yet few of the topics and debates at the center of today's AI discourse are new. While not always recognized by commentators, artificial intelligence as a serious academic discipline dates back to the 1950s. For well over half a century, many of the world's leading minds have devoted themselves to the pursuit of machine intelligence and have grappled with what it would mean to succeed in that pursuit.

Much of the public discourse around AI in 2019 has been anticipated—and influenced—by AI thought leaders going back decades.

Below is a selection of seven classic books about intelligence: what it is, how we might build machines that have it, and what that would mean for society. These books have played a formative role in the development of the field of AI; their influence continues to be felt today. For anyone seeking a deep understanding of AI's complexities, challenges, and possibilities, they are essential reading.

PROMOTED

Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (Douglas Hofstadter, 1979)
Gödel, Escher, Bach is sometimes referred to as “the Bible of artificial intelligence” (though Hofstadter himself rejects the label).
The book's central theme is that, through self-reference and “strange loops”, systems comprised of independently meaningless elements can acquire meaning and intelligence. Hofstader identifies versions of such recursive systems in fields as diverse as mathematics, music, art and computer science.

To sketch out his subtle thesis, Hofstadter takes his reader into the depths of number theory, classical music and the computing technology stack; he employs fanciful dialogues between fictional characters in the style of Lewis Carroll; he structures the book’s chapters, paragraphs and sentences to themselves embody his points about recursion.

The Society of Mind (Marvin Minsky, 1986)
Marvin Minsky is one of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence. In The Society of Mind, his most famous and readable work, he lays out his perspectives on how the human mind works and how we might build machines that simulate it.
Minsky's overarching thesis is that the human mind is not one coherent entity but rather a society of countless smaller “agents”, each devoted to a narrow set of tasks, functioning in synchrony to produce intelligent behavior.
Mirroring this thesis, the book is structured as 270 one-page essays. Each essay is a piece of the puzzle; as the reader progresses through the book, Minsky’s overall theory of mind emerges.
“What magical trick makes us intelligent?” he writes at the end of the book. “The trick is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle.”

On Intelligence (Jeff Hawkins, 2004)
In On Intelligence, Jeff Hawkins posits that a single fundamental “algorithm” underlies all information processing in the human brain: a feedforward mechanism that predicts future states.
Hawkins’ theory of intelligence has been highly influential across neuroscience, machine learning and philosophy over the past 15 years. It has also been regularly criticized. In 2005 Hawkins founded the AI startup Numenta with Dileep George to pursue these principles.

Alan Turing: The Enigma (Andrew Hodges, 1983)
It is only a slight overstatement to say that Alan Turing created the computer and the field of artificial intelligence. His seminal 1936 paper, vastly ahead of its time, laid the conceptual groundwork for the entire field of digital computing. He was one of the first thinkers to take the idea of artificial intelligence seriously. His 1950 paper—which famously opens with the line “I propose to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’”—introduced the Turing Test, which remains a touchstone in the AI literature today.
Andrew Hodges’ 1983 work is the authoritative biography of Turing's life. Prior to its publication, Turing's accomplishments were not widely known, due largely to the total secrecy that for decades surrounded his wartime work on cryptography for the Allies at Bletchley Park. Hodges’ book played a pivotal role in bringing Turing’s ideas to light and establishing him at the forefront of the pantheon of machine intelligence pioneers.
On the topic of AI, Turing made it clear where he stood. Generations ahead of his time, in words that would still be provocative today, Turing wrote in 1951: “It is customary to offer a grain of comfort, in the form of a statement that some peculiarly human characteristic could never be imitated by a machine. I cannot offer any such comfort, for I believe that no such bounds can be set.”

The Singularity is Near (Ray Kurzweil, 2005)
Perhaps no book or author presents a more relentlessly optimistic view of our technological future than Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near.
Grounding his arguments in the concepts of exponential growth and accelerating returns, Kurzweil anticipates a future in which runaway machine intelligence transforms everything about the world as we know it. He predicts this superintelligence will enable us to control our own genetics, master nanotechnology, and manipulate physical matter at will. Eventually, human and non-human intelligence will merge, transcend biology, and spread throughout the universe.
While his conclusions are startling, his approach is meticulously data-driven. As the New York Times put it, “Kurzweil's vision of our super-enhanced future is completely sane and calmly reasoned.”
The concept of the Singularity has inspired generations of technologists; it has also garnered plenty of ridicule for its fantastical, utopian overtones. Kurzweil did not invent the idea (credit goes to the legendary John von Neumann in the 1950s), but he and this book have played a major role in popularizing it.

Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain (Antonio Damasio, 1994)
Conventional wisdom has long held that, while the intellect is logic-based and objective, emotions make us irrational and cloud our judgment.
In Descartes’ Error, neurologist Antonio Damasio famously reconceptualized the relationship between emotion and intellect. The book argues that emotions in fact play an essential role in cognition and decision-making, and that without them our intellectual capabilities would not be possible.
This theory of intelligence has intriguing implications for AI. As Marvin Minsky once put it: “The question is not whether intelligent machines can have any emotions, but whether machines can be intelligent without any emotions.”

The Mind's I (Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett, 1981)
In The Mind's I, Hofstadter and Dennett undertake to examine the most fundamental of questions: what is thought, what is consciousness and what is the mind? They do so through an annotated anthology of pieces from contributors as diverse as Richard Dawkins, Jorge Luis Borges and Alan Turing.
The book contains rich insights about what it would mean for a machine to think, interweaving perspectives from psychology, engineering, philosophy and literature. But don’t expect to walk away with any straightforward answers. As they write in the preface: “We believe there are at present no easy answers to the big questions. This book, then, is designed to provoke, disturb, and befuddle its readers.”

Anne Carpenter is an Institute Scientist and Merkin Institute Fellow at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. Her research group develops algorithms and data analysis methods for large-scale experiments involving images. The team’s open-source CellProfiler software is used by thousands of biologists worldwide (www.cellprofiler.org). Carpenter is a pioneer in image-based profiling, the extraction of rich, unbiased information from images for a number of important applications in drug discovery and functional genomics. Carpenter focused on high-throughput image analysis during her postdoctoral fellowship at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and MIT’s CSAIL (Computer Sciences/Artificial Intelligence Laboratory). Her PhD is in cell biology from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Carpenter has been named an NSF CAREER awardee, an NIH MIRA awardee, a Massachusetts Academy of Sciences fellow (its youngest at the time), and a Genome Technology “Rising Young Investigator”. Anne Carpenter Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your institution? My name is Anne Carpenter and I am at the Broad Institute of Harvardand MIT(MA, USA). The Broad is a nonprofit academic institution that focuses on technology and collaboration. This means that we have a lot of software engineers, high-throughput screening instrumentation and collaborations among interdisciplinary scientists, which allows us to take on projects that are larger scale than that of a typical individual or academic lab. Can you tell us about your presentation coming up on Sunday? I will be focusing on several really interesting biological stories where we have uncovered more in images than biologists would have expected. For example, it’s difficult to tell what stage of the cell cycle cells are in when looking at bright-field images. Aside from some very obvious telophase, you generally can’t tell whether the cell is in G1 or G2 and whether it’s duplicated DNA or not. We discovered that if you take the bright-field and dark-field images of unlabeled cells, there is sufficient information to predict the amount of DNA that each cell has as well as some phases of mitosis. We can also tell the difference between a cell that’s in G1 versus G2 versus prophase versus metaphase and onward. This was pretty unexpected at the time. Originally, we did the experiment with classical machine learning. Then we subsequently did it with deep learning, to provide greater resolution. Now, we are going to test all kinds of different disease scenarios to see if this is true across the board. We want to look at whether we can detect for example leukemia in unlabeled cells. Leukemia is an example where, typically, pathologists are required to use specific antibodies that label specific biomarkers. It took years to figure out which biomarkers you label in order to tell whether a patient’s leukemia is responding to chemotherapy or not. Now we have this, we need to use these antibodies to label the cells, and these panels can be anywhere from four to ten different antibodies. Once again, we discovered that if you just look at the bright-field and dark-field images alone, the cell’s internal structure is telling you enough about its state that we can distinguish leukemic cells from non-leukemic.  New AI tech launched to drive drug discovery Artificial intelligence set to revolutionize cell imaging methods New technology provides insight into cell communication  Can you tell us a bit more about the machine- and deep-learning techniques you are using to uncover this information? Deep learning is definitely causing a revolution in the computer vision field and in a lot of commercial applications, but now it’s coming to biology as well. Typically, deep learning extracts features that humans may not have considered looking for. You can look at so many different combinations of features of cells that it can go beyond what we are able to articulate and engineer an algorithm to specifically measure. Letting deep learning algorithms loose on images is an unbiased way of taking the raw image data and converting it into a feature space that can go beyond what we can see by eye. Can you tell us more about the quantification tools that you have developed in your lab? Our original tool is CellProfiler. I wrote the first version of it 16 years ago, so it’s now quite a mature project and used by thousands of biologists around the world. It’s capable of handling high throughput experiments, which is why we originally wrote it, but some of the same things that make it robust and reliable for high throughput experiments also make it very handy for small-scale experiments. In fact, the majority of our users are doing small-scale experiments, where they want to quantify the results of what they see by eye. What challenges did you encounter when developing those software tools? I’d say the biggest challenge for software for biologists is funding. People are often surprised to learn that both CellProfiler and ImageJ, which are the two most popular open-source softwares for image analysis, both only have around one software engineer working on them over the past decades. You would think there’s a team of dozens that support these projects but it’s actually quite minimal, and even that one engineer is often hard to find. I think it’s really important to consider that, for all other domains of biological software, it doesn’t take much support to keep these projects going. They pay themselves back probably a hundred-fold in terms of how much time they save all the researchers that make use of these different software packages. “I don’t think there are any fundamental stumbling blocks in this space. There are a lot of bright people who are interested in this problem, who are beginning to work on it. It’s just a matter of letting people’s research unfold because these next few years are going to be pretty exciting.” Is there any information that you think remains locked away in cell images and image data that we can’t currently access due to limitations in the software? We’re definitely just scratching the surface of what is possible to extract in images. For the most part, biologists have moved from a microscopy experiment being purely qualitative and most people do quantify the phenomena that they see. However, I would say the vast majority only quantify the phenomena they already see by eye. I think, we should be seeing a shift towards more biologists using microscopy as a data source to look for things that they can’t necessarily see, but are nevertheless robust and reproducible. Because we’re just starting to do this kind of an experiment, I suspect there are tremendous improvements that can be made in the kinds of features that are extracted. Once a computer tells you that a set of patient cell lines A is different from B, the next question that biologists have is how are they different? That’s a question that is actually a little difficult to answer at times. There are various methods of taking the results of a deep learning model and interpreting them and understanding the mechanism or the meaning of them. I think that’s a crucial area for improvement so that when the computer does find interesting and unexpected things in images, we can translate that into some kind of deeper biological understanding of the system. Beyond funding, what needs to change in the field to be able to get to that next step of interpretation of the data? I don’t think there are any fundamental stumbling blocks in this space. There are a lot of bright people who are interested in this problem, who are beginning to work on it. It’s just a matter of letting people’s research unfold because these next few years are going to be pretty exciting. “It’s best if computational advancements come from a deep biological need.” Where do you see the field heading in the next 5 years? The current version of CellProfiler, for example, uses classical image processing algorithms. We are in the middle of this transition where within a few years biologists are going to be able to drag-and-drop their images into a web app and the software will automatically recognize a variety of structures within the cell without any training or tweaking or understanding how the image processing is working. If we can train models that are generalizable enough, we should be able to get to the point where image analysis becomes quite a lot easier for the biologists. What has been the main driver in your career path? The progression of my career, transitioning from a pure cell biologist and microscopist into the computational field, has been primarily driven simply by following the next step for various projects that I personally was working on. In general, it’s best if computational advancements come from a deep biological need. I would say that probably defines my career progression up until now. Do you have any advice for early career researchers starting out in a similar field? I think as you’re developing in your career, it’s great if you can identify an area that is underpopulated, is useful to your research and really makes you excited. I think following the combination of the biological need and your interest level can lead you to create a vision of the future that you can then pursue for many decades.",,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'Article', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/'}, 'author': {'name': 'Tristan Free', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/#/schema/person/4ee087aaf9a5736b165aec787f89af84'}, 'headline': 'Anne Carpenter on artificial intelligence in the cell imaging field', 'datePublished': '2019-12-23T09:00:49+00:00', 'dateModified': '2020-08-14T14:42:58+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/'}, 'wordCount': 1614, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/#organization'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mitotic-LLC-PK1-cells-fluorescence-microscopy-1.jpg', 'keywords': ['AI', 'ASCB 2019', 'cell imaging', 'Deep learning', 'machine learning', 'Software'], 'articleSection': ['Lab design and machinery'], 'inLanguage': 'en-GB'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/', 'url': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/', 'name': 'Advances in Cell Imaging Software with Anne Carpenter - BioTechniques', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mitotic-LLC-PK1-cells-fluorescence-microscopy-1.jpg', 'datePublished': '2019-12-23T09:00:49+00:00', 'dateModified': '2020-08-14T14:42:58+00:00', 'description': 'Computational microscopist Anne Carpenter discusses how artificial intelligence is changing cell imaging software and what to expect in the near future.', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/']}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mitotic-LLC-PK1-cells-fluorescence-microscopy-1.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mitotic-LLC-PK1-cells-fluorescence-microscopy-1.jpg', 'width': 840, 'height': 350}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Anne Carpenter on artificial intelligence in the cell imaging field'}]}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/#website', 'url': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/', 'name': 'BioTechniques', 'description': 'Powered by Taylor &amp;

For companies that rely on field service technicians, an efficient mobile work experience is essential. And these days the software your technicians use in the field better be intelligent as well.
Count Black and Veatch among a rising tide of companies transforming their field tech’s work experience, as the construction firm is leaning into artificial intelligence to automate tasks for field service technicians who support its construction of cell towers, fiber broadband networks and other critical infrastructure that telecommunications carriers require.

“We want our professionals to have a great experience at work,” says Bigelow, who left the company earlier this month. “Sometimes their experience outside of work, as consumers, is better than when they’re performing tasks, collaborating and analyzing on the job.”
B&V field service technicians travel to remote locations to perform and carefully document inspections, installations, maintenance or repairs on telecommunications and industrial equipment. The company’s injection of automation and artificial intelligence into its techs’ mobile work processes is helping them perform that work more efficiently.
 
 
 













 
 

AI fuels field service work
Figuring out ways to empower B&V technicians in the field falls to David Simmons, senior director of innovation and technology for B&V’s telecommunications unit. To facilitate this effort, Simmons has installed mobile software that pushes detailed information about designs, repairs and other content onto technicians’ smartphones.

Barbie Bigelow, former CIO, Black & Veatch

Dozens of applications provide similar capabilities, but Simmons says software he selected from startup Zinier automatically routes work order assignments, change orders and recordkeeping, creating a communications loop between the B&V’s back-office and front-office operations and the field. By pairing machine learning algorithms with historical data, Zinier anticipates when machines are likely to break down and recommends that B&V deploy technicians to fix them, Simmons says.
Adopting Zinier is part of B&V’s drive to get out in front of 5G, which will deliver faster data transfer speeds at lower latency, ushering a new wave of ubiquitous internet connectivity. But 5G requires major equipment upgrades to existing macro sites, as well as increased capacity using densification with small cells and oDAS (outdoor distributive antenna system) networks.
 
 
 













 
 

Out of the box, Zinier’s algorithms look for certain traits or characteristics, but they also learn from data generated daily by B&V’s operations, as well as from B&V worker feedback when they accept or reject its recommendations. “It takes in all these inputs to figure out the best parts of a workflow to automate, all depending on the use case the customer has configured,” says Arka Dhar, co-founder and CEO at Zinier, adding that customers can pick the algorithm and set data parameters.

Auto-generating work orders and repairs
Examples include auto-generating requests for building permits and work orders, and triggering updates to these requests on the fly. The software also automatically recognizes potential breaches of work order service-level agreements and adjusts schedules to address these issues. It can also auto-generate parts transfers when parts are low in trucks.

David Simmons, Senior Director of Innovation and Technology, Black & Veatch

Previously, much of this work was done via phone or in the flesh, with workers traveling across town to pick up building permits and other documents and checking and entering data on laptops they’d lug around in their trucks, Simmons says. Now the work orders are generated via an application on a smartphone in the technician’s pocket.
 
 
 













 
 

“Many offerings provide a sleek way to get data on a phone, but we ultimately chose Zinier because they stacked their technology atop algorithms for crowdsourcing the data,” Simmons tells CIO.com. “The differentiator is in getting data from upstream through intelligent automation into the hands of the field person.”
This appears to be the prevailing strategy for field service work. By 2022, over 50 percent of field service providers will offer a digital customer experience that enables two-way interaction and workflow initiation via multiple human and nonhuman channels, according to research Gartner published in December. AI will increasingly guide these digital services, according to Gartner, which expects that 30 percent of software vendors serving the field service market will infuse their platforms with AI by 2022.
Bigelow likens the Zinier technology to how Uber empowers its drivers with mobile software and analytics to serve their passengers. And she adds that B&V’s staff has embraced the company’s growing adoption of emerging technologies — which also includes exploring robotic process automation (RPA) and autonomous vehicles to lay fiber at construction sites — to foster a more service-oriented culture.
 
 
 













 
 

“We want to be proactive about the future of work because this is where things are headed,” Bigelow says. “The more tech savvy our workforce is, the better positioned our workforce is.”

Developers across every industry are encouraged to be innovative in their approach to work. In healthcare, however, experimentation can feel a bit more high stakes when a company's mission is tethered to improving the lives of thousands of patients.
This patient-first mentality drives developers from the following tech companies to experiment with technology like AI, genomic technologies and data science. From improving the navigation of the complex healthcare system to researching cures for cancer, the following companies’ missions are having a major impact on the healthcare space. Here’s what the future of the industry looks like:
The Future Of Healthcare The future of healthcare is largely driven by patient demand for affordable and accessible care. Technologies like machine learning and data processing will offer automated solutions to traditionally expensive and timely tasks while offering patients and healthcare providers more insight for developing personalized treatment plans. 
VillageMDVillageMD
VillageMD offers physicians analytics and care management tools they can leverage to provide better care to their patients.
CTO Mike Roberts said machine learning will play an increasingly large role in connecting physicians to patients in the future — no matter the location of either party — and the company is looking forward to using that technology in their own work. 
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like, and what technologies are helping to drive the industry’s evolution?
The future of healthtech will look far more like the consumer technologies that we use every day. From a patient’s perspective, the technology will be intuitive, personalized and facilitate an experience that reduces friction with how, when and where to utilize the healthcare system. 
Along with this, advancements in data processing, machine learning and timely insight delivery will continue to bring physicians and patients closer together regardless of location.

...some of the latest tech we’re excited about includes simpler machine learning tools.”
 

How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
We’ll stay on the cutting-edge in three ways. First, we’ll listen to our customers to ensure we’re solving for real problems. Second, we’ll continue to engage our employees and facilitate connectedness to our mission, our users and one another. Lastly, we will always use data to guide our decision-making process, including when we test new technologies. 
In terms of new capabilities that we’re incorporating into our work, we’re constantly prototyping, and some of the latest tech we’re excited about includes simpler machine learning tools, new mobile framework and context-aware bots.

higihigi
Jeff Bennett, CEO of higi, is working to keep connections strong between the health-tracking, data-focused kiosks they provide and their users. Bennett said user feedback influences whether the company chooses to adopt a new technology.
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like, and what technologies are helping to drive the industry’s evolution?
Consumer demand for affordable, accessible care at current or improved levels of quality is the driving force in the evolution of healthcare and the technologies behind it. 
To win, companies have to think of the consumer first and foremost, and build infrastructure to exceed their expectations across every facet of their experience. They should ultimately connect consumers to the healthcare resources and partners they care about in a way that feels seamless and modern. 
 

""Companies have to think of the consumer first and foremost...”

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
Everything we do starts by establishing how we are working in service of the millions of consumers who engage with our tech each month, and how that experience makes it easier for our users to engage with trusted healthcare organizations. Whether we partner with a new technology or develop our own, we prioritize how that new feature or functionality will better enable our users to engage with us, and in turn, with their health and healthcare partners.
 
outcome healthOutcome Health
Outcome Health provides patients and physicians with educational content on interactive devices for the point of care space. With their offerings coming at such a critical time within the healthcare journey, CEO Matt McNally said it’s important that patients and caregivers feel the technology they’re engaging with suits their situational needs.
To that end, the company is investing in technologies requested by their end-users: think more mobile integrations for patients and voice activation capabilities for physicians.
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like, and what technologies are helping to drive the industry’s evolution?
The future of healthcare technology, and more specifically the point-of-care space, must align with the needs of patients and physicians. We recently conducted extensive research to understand these needs. We discovered that patients, nurses and physicians all want more personalization and to feel like the technology they’re engaging with is empathetic to their unique experience. We’re using this research to guide our point-of-care content offering and the devices used to deliver information so that we can create an improved experience for the audience.
 

""We are committed to building tech that complements, not distracts.”

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
Everything that we do is in service to patients. We’re not trying to keep up with the latest trends in tech, we’d rather keep up with what patients need. 
Regarding new technologies, we are looking at voice activation in certain categories. We’ve received feedback from our physician partners that, oftentimes, they don’t want to leave the side of their patients when delivering certain news, but they do want to pull up models on products like our Exam Room Wallboard, which may be on an opposite wall. With voice activation, they can still be next to their patients and use our devices to support the conversation. 
We are committed to building tech that complements, not distracts. With the rise of telemedicine, we’re starting to think about how to innovate beyond patient rooms so that Outcome Health can be with patients on their mobile devices when they’re outside of their doctor’s office. 
 
Blink HealthBlink Health
As a population, we’ve mastered digital living. We get our groceries delivered straight to our front doors, order clothes from the comfort of our phones and bank directly from our laptops. So why are so many of us still picking up prescriptions at pharmacies?
Blink Health is all about bringing medication distribution into the 21st century. Eytan Seidman, EVP of product, told us how they do so using mobile. 
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
In the digital pharmacy space, the future of healthcare revolves around reducing medication costs and improving the overall pharmacy experience. At Blink Health, that means developing innovative and intuitive digital tools that increase transparency and ensure patients can access doctors’ prescriptions when they need them.
Today, one of our specific focuses is improving our mobile experience. Mobile represents a major portion of how customers interact with Blink Health, but the healthcare industry has not yet fully realized the capabilities of smartphones. Harnessing the power of that supercomputer in every person’s pocket will continue to be a major driver in the near future.
 

""One of our specific focuses is improving our mobile experience.’’

With patented Pager technology, CEO Walter Jin wants every customer to feel like there’s a doctor in the family. Whether it’s a potentially twisted ankle or yet another migraine, expert advice is often exactly what peace of mind calls for.
The AI-first, mobile platform allows patients to voice or video chat with clinicians, schedule follow ups, accept referrals and more.   
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
Artificial intelligence and machine learning will drive the next wave of meaningful innovation in healthcare. Machine learning coupled with data science will synthesize enormous and disparate data sources from electronic health records, wearables and social determinants of health (SDOH) into tangible, actionable insights. AI will help automate costly and inefficient administrative labor into a digital workforce that is inexpensive, fast and scalable.
 

""Artificial intelligence and machine learning will drive the next wave of meaningful innovation in healthcare.’’

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
Pager is making significant investments in artificial intelligence to augment the patient-clinician experience, which we believe should remain the fundamental interaction in the delivery of care. Pager’s technology platform enables clinicians with superpowers to provide their patients with better access through virtual care, after-care follow-up and a personalized care experience; just like having a doctor in the family.
 

Zipari
Advances in machine learning and healthcare have come a long way. But according to David Levy, SVP of product engineering at Zipari, this is just the beginning.
Zipari simplifies the health insurance relationship between carriers and customers and offers a CRM Salesforce integration. 
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
It’s well accepted that the future of healthcare technology is in machine learning. What’s most interesting is where the data will come from. Wearables and smart devices are becoming ubiquitous, creating a wealth of new and powerful health insights.
The Internet of Things has already made a recognized impact on the cost and longevity of industrial equipment across sectors. By leveraging low-cost, low-power, interconnected sensors and continuous monitoring to understand normal and anomalous operation, it’s possible to detect and address problems much earlier; avoiding costly or even dangerous situations.
It’s just a matter of time before we see a flashpoint in healthcare where these devices become the norm, people become more engaged in the impact of their lifestyle on their bodies and minds, and new healthcare standards emerge.
 

""It’s well accepted that the future of healthcare technology is in machine learning.’’

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
Zipari stays on the cutting edge of healthtech because we love technology. For me, unending research is just a part of my life, whether through conferences, online publications or even better, getting my hands on something new (like a 3D printer to demonstrate prosthetics applications for fun).
In such a highly regulated field, we often have technology solutions well before we can leverage them for health consumers. A good example is cloud services. While we await regulatory advances, we stay on top of emerging standards and demand by networking with colleagues and customers. 
 
amplicareAmplicare
People like monogrammed mugs and pillows for a reason: personalization makes us feel important. The same is true for healthcare. Although, of course, a bit more is at stake.
CFO and Co-Founder Nathan Shanor recently told us how Amplicare, a decision-automation platform, personalizes their offerings so that pharmacies and patients alike see better results. 
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
Convenience and personalization will continue to drive the development of technologies that change the industry. Consumers want to be able to access their health information on demand. On top of this, only 12 percent of adults have proficient health literacy, so information must be digestible. We’re already seeing an increase in patients leveraging virtual assistant technologies, such as Alexa and Siri, for healthcare needs; be it finding a clinic or scheduling a physical doctor’s appointment or a digital visit via telemedicine.
On the pharmacy front, eCare (a documentation and communication process) will likely become more commonplace. It provides practitioners with a more robust picture of a patient’s health. Having access to this data will further improve the personalization of care.
 

""Convenience and personalization will continue to drive the development of technologies that change the industry.’’ 

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
We constantly receive feedback from our customers and keep a close eye on industry trends. Our flagship product Amplicare Match (formerly iMedicare) has evolved from being a reactive product that pharmacists would use when patients came in asking for Medicare Part D comparisons to a proactive one.
We now run millions of plan comparisons and identify patients most in need so pharmacies can target them for consultations. This saves their staff time and ensures maximum prescription drug savings for patients. We also created a patient-facing site to help users access this information from the convenience of their homes.
In the past few years, we have added more capabilities to our platform to address other aspects of care, such as nutrient depletion, immunizations, prescription adherence and patient communications. We partner with companies doing incredible work to provide pharmacies and patients an all-encompassing perspective of patient care. As we look toward the future, we will continue to enhance our solutions to be as convenient and personalized as possible.
 
Eden HealthEden Health
Joey Leingang, vice president of engineering at Eden Health, is thinking big picture when it comes to tech-related advancements in the healthcare field. And we understand why: the platform offers employers primary and mental health care as a direct employee benefit.
When your coworker doesn’t consistently seem to be coughing up a lung, your whole team (and company) wins. 
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
It’s uncontroversial to suggest that advancements like machine learning or increasingly personalized biotechnology will dramatically alter the future of healthcare. Technology should allow us to shrink the gap between population-level health measures and individual outcomes. For example, we’ll see more use of artificial intelligence in assisting physicians in managing chronic conditions. Or exciting developments in the behavior health space will increase access to a necessary type of care for more people than ever.
 

""The most important thing is to build a culture that strives for continuous improvement.’’ 

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
The most important thing is to build a culture that strives for continuous improvement. We try to measure ourselves qualitatively and quantitatively so that we can answer the hard questions around intent as well as expected outcomes. Doing this each sprint with every research spike and with every release allows us to learn new things and adjust all the time.

Genomic technologies are driving the industry’s evolution right now. To treat many diseases, including cancer, leveraging our understanding of the human genome will unlock better diagnosis and treatments. In addition, focusing on preventative care through the lens of DNA will help. We need to understand the nature of the DNA we inherited from our parents and how it impacts human health.
 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
We focus on innovation. We have created a culture that is passionate about patients, which motivates us to develop new products that provide hope and peace of mind. We set our standards high and focus on continuous improvement. We focus on the process, not the outcome, so we can scale and continue to innovate.
We have created a blood test that can quantify cancer in individual patients. This allows us to monitor therapy and adjust as needed with a simple noninvasive test.
 
GHXGHX
GHX allows for healthcare manufacturers and suppliers can easily connect via a cloud-based platform in order to better deliver patient care.
Senior Vice President of Global Product Management Chris Luoma explained how AI and data-driven technology is creating convenience and transparency for patients.
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution? 
Healthcare organizations (i.e. payors, providers, manufacturers and distributors) are experiencing a change in the industry at a pace never before seen. Every sector has an eye toward better patient outcomes at a better cost-to-value ratio. As these entities work to navigate this new business of healthcare, they are looking for technology infrastructures that support two overarching themes.
 
The first theme is supporting the consumerization of healthcare. Technology needs to drive convenience and transparency for patients. 
The second theme is driving the insights necessary to power data-driven decisions. As organizations evolve, expand and adapt, healthcare leaders need to know what’s working and what’s not across the continuum of care. Technology platforms must support the capture and analysis of data, plus the coordination and execution of changes in the business of healthcare. To support these needs, we are seeing organizations focus on mobile applications, seek faster insights from artificial intelligence and work to gain efficiency from machine learning and robotic process automation.
 

""We are exploring blockchain as a foundational technology...”

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
At GHX we are incorporating data science, machine learning and AI into our solutions to create scale, efficiency and drive the insights our customers need to operate in the new business of healthcare. We are exploring blockchain as a foundational technology that can support the demands facing our customers today and tomorrow.
 
SimplePracticeSimplePractice
SimplePractice provides health and wellness professionals with a platform that allows them to manage their patient networks more effectively. 
CEO and Co-founder Howard Spector discussed the importance of patients having seamless access to care, and said that implementing new mobile video communication is an increasingly viable way to do that. 
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
I think the easier we can make access to information for professionals and their patients, the better. This can mean things like moving away from manual data-sharing between providers and moving toward patient access via a secure client portal and mobile apps. 
Another important way technology is allowing better access is through telehealth. Using secure video technology allows people who live in rural areas to get help. It also provides continuity of care when circumstances arise that make it hard for individuals to see a professional.
 

""We never settle.”

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
There is always more we can do to make our platform and services better for our customers. We never settle, and we work intentionally to have productive communication with our engaged community of customers to keep us on the right path. So while 'new' is important, it’s just as important to make certain that even the 'old' features are doing what they need to do to best serve our customers.
 
Well healthWell Health
Well Health’s platform lets patients and their healthcare organizations communicate through text, phone, email and live-chat. 
The service makes tasks like confirming insurance and viewing lab results more efficient, and CEO Guillaume de Zwirek said the company and the industry as a whole are doubling down to produce even more patient-focused efforts. Well Health’s teams tapped into a huge pool of data to evolve the platform’s appointment scheduling tool for patients.
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
Healthcare is following the lead of many other industries in moving toward providing concierge-like experiences. Concierge service used to be reserved for the elite but the rise of mobile, AI, the internet of things and many other technological advances has started to level the playing field. 
For example, anyone can order a “personal driver” by calling an Uber or Lyft or benefit from a “travel planner” by texting a TripActions agent when a flight gets delayed. In healthcare, we’ll soon see things like personal device and smart-speaker data feeding back to physicians to predict disease. We’ll see prescriptions being delivered within the hour and in real-time, as well as asynchronous communication with medical teams available around the clock.
 

""Healthcare is following the lead of many other industries in moving toward providing concierge-like experiences.”

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
We look to our patients. Our platform processes over 150 million communications per year. This data gives us clear signals on what we should prioritize to best improve the patient experience. In a recent example, we analyzed millions of patient interactions and developed an automated self-rescheduling workflow that surfaces alternate appointment times when a patient requests to cancel or reschedule their appointment.

The Defense Department’s central artificial intelligence development effort wants to build an artificial intelligence-powered drone swarm capable of independently identifying and tracking targets, and maybe even saving lives.The Pentagon’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, or JAIC, issued a request for information to find out if AI developers and drone swarm builders can come together to support search and rescue missions.Search and rescue operations are covered under one of the four core JAIC research areas: humanitarian aid and disaster relief. The program also works on AI solutions for predictive maintenance, cyberspace operations and robotic process automation.The goal for the RFI is to discover whether industry can deliver a full-stack search and rescue drone swarm that can self-pilot, detect humans and other targets and stream data and video back to a central location. The potential solicitation would also look for companies or teams that can provide algorithms, machine training processes and data to supplement that provided by the government.The ideal result would be a contract with several vendors “that together could provide the capability to fly to a predetermined location/area, find people and manmade objects—through onboard edge processing—and cue analysts to look at detections sent via a datalink to a control station,” according to the RFI. “Sensors shall be able to stream full motion video to an analyst station during the day or night; though, the system will not normally be streaming as the AI will be monitoring the imagery instead of a person.”The system has to have enough edge processing power to enable the AI to fly, detect and monitor without any human intervention, while also being able to stream live video to an operator and allow that human to take control of the drones, if needed.The RFI contains a number of must-haves, including:
The ability to launch from air, sea and ground.
Capable of flying for at least two hours at a minimum of 50 knots airspeed.
Air droppable from another aircraft in flight.
Able to launch and fly to a predetermined search area and follow a predetermined pattern.
Capable of searching a geo-fenced area.
Sensors able to cover at least 100 square nautical miles.
A datalink enabling continuous communication with the ground station or launch platform.
The RFI also notes all training data will be government-owned and classified. All development work will be done using government-owned data and on secure government systems.Responses to the RFI are due by 11 a.m. Jan. 20.

Artificially Intelligent Smart Robots will not take our jobs. They are like elevators, the once smart robots, which carry people floor to floor and only boosted skyscrapers density.

The Proof: Hundred years ago any car of the period was nothing but the smartest robot boosted by the artificial intelligence of the combustion engine on how and when to spark, ignite and consume energy to achieve transportable mobility. Assisted by a driver, the mobility over century has now brought us to a critical crossroad; half of the world, confused with a smart phone in one hand as the most powerful and lowest priced robotic-device ever made by mankind and other entrapments of audio-video-augmented-virtual-reality giving us levitation in real time is now fearful. Now almost brainwashed and mesmerized most of us with tik-tok-controlled sensibility of time and tempo, shake in fear of the arrival of artificial-intelligence to come and take over our jobs, control our lives, steal our money, take way our children and runaway with our loved ones while some creep in our dimly lit bedrooms.
Hey Google, call a Robocop…
Total Nonsense: as Zombie-Nations are perpetually dead now Robot-Nations start invading our cinematically matured psyche, the Hollywood and Bollywood of sorts of the world are all freaked, stuffed and snuffed up on AI mythology… media of the world on such mumbling nonsense to allow vaporization of more fake news added to the mist of confusion.
Five ways to avoid AI nightmares
Start thinking how to achieve mastery over yourself and robots
Start deep study on critical thinking, new major changes and self-discovery
Start discovering independently available entrepreneurialism and lifelong learning
Stop the ignorant talk about how machines overtakes humans
Stop whatever keeps you very busy today for being not important or any value
Artificial Intelligence is nothing but man-made advanced programming. All designed by super-geniuses of our times, with smart algorithmic programming to work with sensory devices mesmerize human emotions. There is no such thing as man-made human-intelligence or artificially created intelligence of any kind to overtake humans. A robot crawling like a spider still 1,000 years away from making a web, unless pre-programmed with supplied strings and pre-selected-pattern. The world of today is half-subdued by the Hollywood fiction of Artificial Intelligence and other half-intoxicated by stock market over evaluations of any high tech innovation that move sideways. The race to achieve supremacy of artificial intelligence among nations getting tight, the Quantum Supremacy was a highly positive global news item. Simple, supreme smart performance by extremely smart machines promoted just like suntan lotion is nothing but Artificial Ignorance to fool masses and manipulate with Sci-Fi horror branding and stock-market sloganeering.
Artificially Intelligent Smart Robots will not take our jobs, because just like the elevators the once smart robots to carry people floor to floor only boosted skyscrapers density and brought massive automation to city cores of the world. Million other gadgets during last century from fork-lifts to train or even table clock to make sure we show up on exact time and not sometime before sunset.
Naseem Javed
Fact Check:
Can AI think like human?  No.
Can AI pretend to think like human? Yes
Let’s make a collect call to AI
What will steal our jobs is not Artificial Intelligence but Artificial Ignorance: our own mind and its own untapped supremacy of performance, like when our imagination a free flying out of control part of our brain, loves drifting, comfortable and lazy as couch-potato craves ghoulish ideas easily surrenders and allows overtaken by AI type notions, while on the other side suppressing logic and critical thinking the real hard working and treadmill exercising parts of the brain getting rusty failing to fully understand the new landscapes, battlefields unable to decipher intelligent advancements moves.
Deep processes of personal-self-discovery are essential to fully understand although living in highly technologically advanced society we still trapped in our basic human emotions and still not that much evolved. We crave for wild happiness even at mortality as costs, sadness drags us into oblivion, fear makes us shut down exploring new options, anger slowly destroys us…like babes in the woods we walk with curiosity but with trepidations and fears, excited with fireflies and cry at sunsets. There lies the facts that can only discovered with self-optimization via self-discoveries and lifelong learning, where the last decades made such discussions taboo in institutions of learning. We burdened with knowledge as slaves to serve markets but not enough to uplift our own self-discovery pointing to our own adventurous paths into the future. We now face issues of our own survival of new kind; where elevators to higher floors are less important over mind capable for achieving higher level understanding and deal with a complex world.
The dawn of critical thinking and emotional intelligence is around the corner.
For now, let obesity dance to slim-fits, let Viagra-sunrises have their climaxes, let cannabis high afternoons miss the clock, let Opioid-nights gasp under the red moons, let freedom of speech ring a bit longer, let technology advance to newer height…all but never allow fears, let’s have widely awaken nights on the advancements of artificial ignorance and worry more about the future confusion and recognize silence as sign of lack of strategy and solutions. Seek answers
FACTS:  The future is much brighter with technology and smart algorithms. Smart programming and automation will eliminate advanced while collar jobs around the world. A billion misplaced need immediate shift in course of rediscovery as their degrees will no longer shield them, it will be independent critical thinking, emotional intelligence and entrepreneurialism. Smart nations have real opportunities to do something manageable right now before this turns into restless citizenry embracing populism. Nations must decide, either to invest in riot-gears or invest in lifelong learning and national mobilization of entrepreneurialism. For a short while more, we will see life altering changes on global scale, the five billion connected Alpha Dreamers will change the world, a new sense of urgency will appear.
One more time, mankind will end-up against the wall; face the crisis and turn around as always survived calamites and tyrannies of sorts; this is just another such turn, now starved for nouveau-human-intelligence. This is when life-long learning and national mobilization of entrepreneurialism on platform economies will become mandatory as national survival strategy. 
An amazing futurism awaits for change savvy critical thinkers. 
A Very Happy New Year!

Through the use of robots and software agents, the machine may even perform these tasks alone or as a team member collaborating with humans. If we are going to build machines that play roles that simulate human reasoning, behaviour and activities, as a society we should ensure that those machines benefit all members of society, regardless of their age, gender, religion or status in society, rather than replicate human biases, perpetuate disparities or widen the gap between the haves and have nots.If AI is a simulation of human intelligence, who does it simulate and does it have a gender? Whether you view gender as socially constructed by one’s environment and culture, a biologically determined factor as in the essentialist perspective, or adhere to the theory of individual differences, gender plays a role in who we are.All too often it affects how we are perceived and what we can do. That can vary from opportunities to pursue a certain career to whether our car navigation system recognises or ignores our voice commands.In my area of AI research, female avatars are most commonly used to play virtual assistants and companions. This perpetuates a perspective that helping roles are best performed by women.These characters are friendly and empathic, but also submissive and there are no negative consequences for users who ignore them or even verbally abusive them. But more often AI represents males.I recall earlier this year at a Digital Health conference in Melbourne a medical specialist confessing that 25 years ago when he was a rural GP he misdiagnosed a female patient which nearly cost her life because he had never seen that condition in a female.The dataset he was operating from, his experience, was biased. Similarly, the bias within AI is due to the inherent bias in our world.It exists in the expertise we capture in knowledge based systems, in the datasets from which we develop predictive models and the software and hardware designed for and tested by (mostly) men who naturally operate from their own experiences and needs. To make matters worse, because the AI is doing the task, the bias becomes more hidden, particularly in methods like deep learning that are difficult for humans to interpret or understand.In order for AI technology to meet the needs of both men and women, both genders should be the target of innovation ns, involved in the design of these systems and represented in datasets and evaluations. For example, we need to avoid unconscious bias in deciding what features to include or exclude in the training of predictive models. But how can we deliver inclusive solutions given current gender gaps?Globally, women are underrepresented in Engineering and Information Technology classrooms and workplaces, with representation around 30% in India and significantly lower in other countries ; resulting in products and technology mostly designed with men in mind.In AI research, that percentage is closer to 10%, as I observed in 2018 at the joint-AI conference held in Stockholm with thousands of delegates, where I and another lady had the rare experience of walking straight into a toilet cubicle following the keynote speeches and watched with some amusement the long and winding queue emanating from the men’s bathroom.Governments, universities, industry and wider society need to work together to develop ethical frameworks that harness the benefits of AI without ignoring concerns such as cognitive degeneration, threats to autonomy, accountability, privacy, security, discrimination, societal implications and economic impacts.Five key principles found across existing frameworks mandate that AI technology should benefit the common good (beneficence); do no harm (non-maleficence); maintain human agency (autonomy); promote diversity and fairness (justice) and to ensure accountability, responsibility and transparency (explicability) with respect to the other principles.Particularly relevant to the gender question, the principle of justice aims to eliminate discrimination, minimise data bias and promote shared benefits.So back to our question. Does AI represent or favour a particular gender? Yes, currently it mirrors our world dominated by data, decisions and designs for and by males.Explainable AI, AI that can explain its goals, beliefs, reasoning and knowledge boundaries, provides a fresh opportunity to make this bias transparent.To bring the female voice to AI is another key solution that can be achieved through initiatives such as the women in STEM programs at Macquarie University situated in Sydney, Australia.

Frankly, I was hoping an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm would write this column for me, because who knows more about AI than the mysterious little gremlins that make “machine learning” possible? That, alas, didn’t happen; so I’m on my own.


Like most people in business, I don’t need any convincing that artificial intelligence (for most companies in many areas of their operations) will become a game-changer.

Still, it remains a fluid, if not amorphous, concept in many respects. What, exactly, can we expect AI to do for us that we’re not already doing—or how will it improve what we’re doing by doing it better, faster, cheaper, with greater insight or fewer errors?

As an important article (“Winning With AI”) in the MIT Sloan Management Review put it back in October, “AI can be revolutionary, but executives must act strategically. [And] acting strategically means deciding what not to do.” That’s not as easy as it sounds.

PROMOTED
The problem I have with most discussions of artificial intelligence is that they assume the reader or listener already understands the promises and perils of AI. But based on my conversations with a lot of very intelligent people I don’t think that’s always the case.
As Amir Husain, founder and CEO of the Austin, Texas-based machine learning company, SparkCognition, explained to Business News Daily last spring, “Artificial intelligence is kind of the second coming of software. It’s a form of software that makes decisions on its own, that’s able to act even in situations not foreseen by the programmers.”

AI is so ubiquitous we hardly even think about it. As the Business News Daily article pointed out: “Most of us interact with artificial intelligence in some form or another on a daily basis. From the mundane to the breathtaking, artificial intelligence is already disrupting virtually every business process in every industry.”

To one degree or another, they’re all based on or impacted by AI.

In other words, most of us are far more familiar with AI—intimately so—than we give ourselves credit for.
The business question is (as the Sloan article correctly put it): How can executives exploit the opportunities, manage the risks, and minimize the difficulties associated with AI? Put another way, how can they use it to their advantage, perhaps even in a transformative way, without turning the pursuit of AI advantage into a quixotic quest—keeping in mind that acting strategically involves “deciding what not to do” as well as pushing ahead and taking chances in some areas?
Some suggestions from the MIT Sloan Management Review article:
First: Don’t treat AI initiatives as everyday technology gambits. They’re more important than that. Run them from the C suite and closely coordinate them with other digital transformation efforts.
Second: Be sure to coordinate AI with the company’s overall business strategy. One of the surest ways to come up short—as most AI initiatives do [from 40% to 70%, according to the Sloan article]—is to focus AI narrowly on one set of priorities while the company is equally or more concerned with others. While AI can help companies reduce costs, for example, by identifying waste and inefficiencies, growing the business may be a higher priority.
The Hartford, Conn.-based insurance company, Aetna (now a subsidiary of CVS), for example, has been using AI to prevent fraud and uncover overpayments—typical insurance company concerns. It’s also been using AI to design products and increase customers and customer engagement. In one Medicare-related Aetna product, the article notes, designers used AI to customize benefits, leading to “180% growth in new member acquisition.” More long term, Aetna’s head of analytics, VP Ali Keshavarz, told the authors Aetna’s goal is to use AI to become the first place customers go when they “are thinking about their health.”  
Third: This may be obvious to the geeks among us, but perhaps less so to the more technology-challenged: Be sure to “align the production of AI with the consumption of AI.”
Fourth: “Invest in AI talent, data and process change in addition to (and often more so than) AI technology.” Recognize that every successful AI undertaking is the product of a great group of people. While some of this talent should be home grown, you’ll also have to hire from the outside: bring people in to develop and enhance your internal capabilities. That’s a fact of modern business life.
As with everything else in business, all companies are different. Their needs are different. Their available resources (financial, talent, patience) are different. And their goals and expectations should be different.
It’s important to take the time to understand how to maximize the promise and minimize the pitfalls of AI. If you do, you’re more likely to succeed.

This medical technology firm was working with the Chinese tech giant Tencent on a project to use artificial intelligence to diagnose Parkinson's Disease.This degenerative condition affects something like 10 million people worldwide. It has a whole range of symptoms and is pretty difficult to diagnose and then monitor as it progresses.Medopad's work involves monitoring patients via a smartphone app and wearable devices. It then uses a machine learning system to spot patterns in the data rather than trying to identify them by human analysis.In its offices we found one of its staff being filmed as he rapidly opened and closed his fingers - stiffness in these kind of movements is one of the symptoms of Parkinson's.As we filmed him being filmed, I stood there wondering whether I should step in front of the camera and try the same exercise. 1:53WATCH: How Rory manages Parkinson's at workFor some months, I had been dragging my right foot as I walked and experiencing a slight tremor in my right hand.Getting to gripsI had first dismissed this as just part of getting older, but had eventually gone to see my GP.She had referred me to a consultant neurologist, but at the time of filming I was still waiting for my appointment.As we left Medopad, I clenched and unclenched my fingers in the lift and reflected on what I had seen. A few days later my coverage of the project appeared on the BBC website.Three months on, in January this year, I finally met the consultant. She confirmed what I had long suspected - I was probably suffering from idiopathic Parkinson's Disease. The ""idiopathic"" means the cause is unknown.As I got to grips with the condition and started a course of medication, I quickly found out that there are all sorts of unknowns for people with Parkinson's. Why did I get it? How quickly will the various symptoms develop? What are the hopes of a cure? There are no reliable answers.My response has been to take a great interest in how the technology and pharmaceutical industries are investigating the condition. Developments in artificial intelligence, coupled with the availability of smartphones, are opening up new possibilities, and this week I returned to Medopad to see how far it had progressed. 1:28WATCH: Rory first visited Medopad in October 2018I asked the firm's chief executive, Dan Vahdat, whether he had noticed anything that suggested I might have a special interest in Parkinson's when I first visited. ""I don't think we noticed anything specifically,"" he said. ""But - and that's weird for me to tell you this - I had this intuition that I wanted to get you to do the test.""That, of course, did not happen but over the last year there has been a clinical trial involving London's King's College Hospital. People with Parkinson's have been given a smartphone app, which their relatives use to record not just that hand-clenching exercise but other aspects of the way they move.""We think this technology can help to quantify the disease,"" Dan explained. No instant impact""And if you can quantify the disease, it means you can see how the disease progresses. ""It gives you lots of opportunities, in terms of treatment adjustments, interventions at the right time, potentially screening a larger cohort of patients with the technology in ways that were not possible before.""This made me think about my own situation. Since February, I have been prescribed Sinemet - one of the most common Parkinson's drugs - in the form of two tablets taken three times a day.While some patients see an instant impact, I cannot say I notice much effect. If anything my main symptom, dragging my right foot, has got slightly worse. When I see my consultant every four months we discuss whether the prescription should be adjusted, but it is difficult for me to quantify my symptoms.Dan told me this was exactly the kind of scenario they are trying to address.""We think you will end up having a more continuous observation via machine and the doctors can look at it remotely. And with that they will be able to adjust your treatment, if needed, because potentially right now you're either overdosing or underdosing.""I am now going to get access to the trial app and look forward to finding out what it says about me.This is just one of many projects run by a variety of companies where real-time data is collected from people with Parkinson's and other conditions via their handsets. The search for a cure to Parkinson's goes on. We appear to be a long way off, but in the meantime quantifying a condition like mine could do a lot to improve how I and many others cope with the symptoms.What is exciting to me is that the smartphone revolution, which I have documented since watching Steve Jobs unveil the iPhone in 2007, now promises to change healthcare just as it has transformed many other aspects of our lives. And I hope to continue reporting on that revolution for many more years.BBC reporter urges 'openness' on Parkinson'sParkinson's diagnosis after live broadcastParkinson's AI to speed up diagnosisRory Cellan-Jones: Reporting the news with Parkinson's",,,,,,,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50675702,,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A354/production/_110021814_fcc481f8-795e-4669-b10b-d99e49c80e40.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unpacking the Black Box in Artificial Intelligence for Medicine 







Deep learning will radically change aspects of our medical care. How well do we need to understand how AI tools work?

In clinics around the world, a type of artificial intelligence called deep learning is starting to supplement or replace humans in common tasks such as analyzing medical images. Already, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, “every one of the 50,000 screening mammograms we do every year is processed through our deep learning model, and that information is provided to the radiologist,” says Constance Lehman, chief of the hospital’s breast imaging division.
In deep learning, a subset of a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning, computer models essentially teach themselves to make predictions from large sets of data. The raw power of the technology has improved dramatically in recent years, and it’s now used in everything from medical diagnostics to online shopping to autonomous vehicles.
But deep learning tools also raise worrying questions because they solve problems in ways that humans can’t always follow. If the connection between the data you feed into the model and the output it delivers is inscrutable — hidden inside a so-called black box — how can it be trusted? Among researchers, there’s a growing call to clarify how deep learning tools make decisions — and a debate over what such interpretability might demand and when it’s truly needed. The stakes are particularly high in medicine, where lives will be on the line.



Deep learning tools also raise worrying questions because they solve problems in ways that humans can’t always follow.



Still, the potential benefits are clear. In Mass General’s mammography program, for instance, the current deep learning model helps detect dense breast tissue, a risk factor for cancer. And Lehman and Regina Barzilay, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have created another deep learning model to predict a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer over five years — a crucial component of planning her care. In a 2019 retrospective study of mammograms from about 40,000 women, the researchers found the deep learning system substantially outperformed the current gold-standard approach on a test set of about 4,000 of these women. Now undergoing further testing, the new model may enter routine clinical practice at the hospital.
As for the debate about whether humans can really understand deep learning systems, Barzilay sits firmly in the camp that it’s possible. She calls the black box problem “a myth.”
One part of the myth, she says, is that deep learning systems can’t explain their results. But “there are lots of methods in machine language that allow you to interpret the results,” she says. Another part of the myth, in her opinion, is that doctors have to understand how the system makes its decision in order to use it. But medicine is crammed with advanced technologies that work in ways that clinicians really don’t understand — for instance, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that gathers the mammography data to begin with.

How Artificial Intelligence Could Help Doctors

That doesn’t answer the concerns of all physicians. Many machine learning tools are still black boxes “that render verdicts without any accompanying justification,” notes a group of physicians and researchers in a recent paper in BMJ Clinical Research. “Many think that, as a new technology, the burden of proof is on machine learning to account for its predictions,” the paper’s authors continue. “If doctors do not understand why the algorithm made a diagnosis, then why should patients trust the recommended course of treatment?”
And among computer scientists who study machine learning, “this discussion of interpretability has gone completely off the rails,” says Zachary Lipton, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. Often, models offered for interpretability simply don’t work well, he says, and there’s confusion about what the systems actually deliver.
“We have people in the field who are able to turn the crank but don’t actually know what they’re doing,” he adds, “and don’t actually understand the foundational underpinnings of what they’re doing.”

Deep learning tools build on the concept of neural networks, originally inspired by the human brain and composed of nodes that act somewhat like brain cells. Deep learning models assemble multiple layers of these artificial neurons into a vast web of evolving connections. And the models juggle data on levels far beyond what the human mind can follow.
Understanding how the models work matters in some applications more than others. Worries about whether Amazon is offering perfect suggestions for your aunt’s birthday gift aren’t the same, for example, as worries about the trustworthiness of the tools your doctor is using to detect tumors or oncoming heart attacks.
Computer scientists are trying many approaches to make deep learning less opaque, at least to their peers. A model of breast cancer risk, for example, can use a heat map approach, letting radiologists zoom into areas of the mammography image that the model pays attention to when it makes a prediction. The model can then extract and highlight snippets of text that describe what it sees.
Deep learning models can also present images of other regions that are similar to these targeted areas, and human experts can then assess the machine’s choices. Another popular technique applies math that is more immediately understandable to subsets of the data to approximate how the deep learning model is handling the full dataset.
“We will learn more about what explanations are convincing to humans when these models are integrated into care, and we can see how the human mind can help to control and validate their predictions,” Barzilay says.
In London, a team from Moorfields Eye Hospital and DeepMind, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet, also seeks to deliver explanations in depth. They have used deep learning to triage scans of patient eyes. The system takes in three-dimensional eye scans, analyzes them, and picks cases that need urgent referral — and it works as well as or better than human experts. The model gives and rates several possible explanations for each diagnosis and shows how it has labeled the parts of the patient’s eye.



“Increasingly, you wind up with people just throwing spaghetti at the wall and calling it explanations.”



As a general strategy in bringing deep learning to the clinic, “the key is to build the best system but then analyze its behavior,” says Anna Goldenberg, a senior scientist in genetics and genome biology at SickKids Research Institute in Toronto, who is partnering with clinicians to build a model that can predict cardiac arrests. “I think we want both. I think it’s achievable.”
Models like Mass General’s and Moorfields’ are well-designed, with doctor input and clinical results in peer-reviewed scientific publications, and they rest on solid technical foundations. But few attempts at interpretability will make it this far, Lipton says.
More often, such interpretations don’t show a real connection between the data that go in and what comes out. “Basically people have been looking at the pretty pictures and picking the one that looks like what they wanted to see in the first place,” Lipton adds. “Increasingly, you wind up with people just throwing spaghetti at the wall and calling it explanations.”

Even if computer scientists find a way to show how a deep learning tool works, doctors will have the final say on whether the explanations are sufficient. Doctors aren’t just interested in theoretical accuracy — they need to know the system works in the real world.
For example, when doctors are trying to spot a small tumor or early signs of an upcoming cardiac arrest, “false positives are not so problematic, because clinicians try to avoid detecting things late,” says Goldenberg. “But false negatives are a really big problem.” If the rate of false positives is too high, however, then doctors may not pay attention to the system at all.
When physicians see the clinical factors that are considered in the deep learning system, it’s easier for them to interpret the results. “Without understanding that, they’re suspicious,” Goldenberg says. “They don’t need to understand exactly how the system works or how deep learning works. They need to understand how the system would make a decision compared to them. So they will throw some cases against the system and see what it does and then see whether they trust it.”
Deep learning studies should begin by analyzing large numbers of suitable, existing medical records, experts say. In some cases, such as Goldenberg’s cardiac arrest model, she says the next step may be to run a trial where “we can let the system run, getting the real time inputs but not giving any feedback back to the clinician, and seeing the difference between the practice and what our system is predicting.”
“Before we point the finger too much at AI, we should look at all our other practices that are ripe with false positives and false negatives, and all other practices that are black boxes, based on publications that in reality few doctors read in detail,” says Isaac Kohane, a bioinformatician and physician at Harvard Medical School.

Because AI is just coming into practice, it hasn’t seen the same kind of vetting as some other technologies, Kohane adds. “And because it doesn’t look the same as a blood test or imaging test, the health care system or the regulatory authorities have not yet figured out the right way to make sure that we know it’s acceptably safe, whatever acceptably is.”
Kohane says his biggest concern is that no one really knows how well the new models work. “We should be more worried about what is a false positive rate and what is a false negative rate over time of these programs,” he adds, “so that even if they are used in black box fashion like the rest of medicine, they are sufficiently reliable.”
There is still a lot of work needed to assess the models’ performance. A 2019 study in Lancet Digital Health, which analyzed results from 69 studies on medical deep learning tools, found that the models performed as well as health care professionals. But the paper’s authors also cautioned that few of the studies pitted the models head-to-head against human experts on the same dataset.
Such studies also may miss many subtle but important issues, and they often rest on shaky assumptions, Lipton says. One major problem: A model’s accuracy is only as meaningful as the data on which it is based. “The truth is that you don’t even usually have historical data that is representative of any real-world process,” he says. “You have some kind of weird Frankenstein data that was cobbled together from a bunch of sources.”

Given deep learning’s growing power and the worries it incites, how will medical gatekeepers view the technology?
“The black box story gets a lot of emphasis,” says Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. “The question is, will we hold machines hostage to being explainable before they can be used in medicine? I don’t know the answer.”
If prospective trials validate these models, he says, there’s every reason to bring them forward to the clinic with the hope of achieving a happy symbiosis between doctors and machines — even if doctors have no idea why the models work.
“But whenever you lean on machines there’s a pushback, because doctors are used to controlling everything,” Topol says. “When you say: ‘The machine can do this as well as you, or potentially even better,’ there’s a bias against that. Overwhelming proof is one way to deal with that negative bias.”
Descriptions of the issue can carry their own bias. “The term ‘black box’ in itself has a bit of a negative turn,” says Lehman of Mass General. “We don’t know what’s there and we want to fill it with information. But I think the term is unfortunate.” While clinicians may not understand how the tools make every decision, she adds, if they can prove the tools work, “that itself can teach us new explanations. We just have to think differently.”



“Whenever you lean on machines there’s a pushback, because doctors are used to controlling everything.”



Today’s medicine abandons vast amounts of data in electronic health records, test tubes, and X-ray machines, Lehman points out. “If we can start to pull out that rich data and be more predictive for who is going to live and who’s going to die, who’s going to need this intervention and who needs that test,” she adds, “we can completely change the entire paradigm of health care.”
The effects will be most profound for people with little or no direct access to doctors, says Peter Thomas, director of digital innovation at Moorfields Eye Hospital. And Moorfields’ eye diagnostic tools, he adds, may help doctors focus on patients who most need their help.
Advocates see adoption coming, and soon. In tasks like analyzing mammograms at Mass General, “deep learning systems are already better than humans,” says Barzilay. “Way better than humans.”
“Our current models are really complex and they can capture visual patterns which are so subtle that the human eye may not be able to understand them,” she adds. “Does it really mean that we shouldn’t be benefiting from them because our visual capacity is limited?”
Once deep learning systems clearly demonstrate how well they work, “I don’t think that the interpretability will be an issue,” Barzilay says. “Many other reasons may prevent adoption, but the black box aspect will not be the main one.”

Artificial Intelligence refers to the theory of computer systems or human-made robots programmed with performing tasks as humans, such as learning, generalization, and reasoning. With this ability, AI has become a significant part of human lives. Similarly, AI and the education & tutoring web solutions are inseparable from being observed by the astounding inventions enabling machines to mimic human roles.

The most notable transitions can realize in the form of infusing more personalization and convenience in the academic world. Currently, AI holds a dominant power in the education industry, and the artificial intelligence solution providers are progressive in fuelling the AI development engine for the future.

According to a report, US education is forecasted to experience 48% growth in the artificial intelligence market by the year 2022. With such growth, AI solution providers will be able to provide integrated education and tutoring web solutions worldwide.

How AI will Shape the Future of the Education Industry
A new educational system will be the outcome of excessive integration of artificial intelligence, catering to student needs, and wants. Automation will be the most significant part of such a system. 

Here is a list for getting a better understanding of how the education industry's future can transform through artificial intelligence.

1. AI-powered personalization

AI systems can develop a learning profile of every student based on customization. This customization can module training materials for every student considering their experience, ability, and preferable learning mode. Personalization is necessary for the education industry since teaching for all students should not be the same when learning among them is highly distinct.

2. Automation of basic educational activities

Certain activities such as testing and grading have become tedious and time-consuming work for the teachers. Absolute replacement of human grading is impossible for AI, but it can reach pretty much close. AI-enabled grading is convenient for «fill in the blanks and multiple-choice tests,» but it seems complicated for writing tests. 

However, AI solutions are progressively researching and finding solutions to this drawback. This transformation can assist the teachers by saving a significant amount of time and invest it in a better place.

3. Connecting students with global classrooms



Technology means connecting with the world. Artificial intelligence solution providers have the opportunity to take advantage of supportive technological advancements for developing tools. These tools can enable the students to become a part of global classrooms wherein education is provided in a way understandable by all kinds of students.

4. AI-based tutors



Human Intelligence tutors can offer more things that an AI tutor can't. At current times, the AI tutors are programmed to teach basic writing, mathematics, and other subjects. But the AI solution providers are investing head-to-foot efforts for developing tutors that can completely replace human tutors.
 
Advanced tutoring systems are in the pipeline for the AI solution providers that enable with facilitating what the real-world requires, such as higher-level creativity and thinking. Students will avail support even from outside the classroom that constitutes the best part of AI tutors.

5. Sourcing of real-time feedback

Apart from customized training materials, the AI-driven programs are capable of offering real-time feedback by analyzing the students' performance accurately. The students and teachers get feedback when results are declared. Currently, the US schools have adopted an online dashboard using which the teachers can keep their eye on student performance. 

AI-driven Education Applications
With the educational applications empowered by AI, the students receive harness power for learning improvement. AI targets learning improvement among the students from primary school to college or university. Also, it exhibits excellent avenues and empowerment for teachers and learners to arrive at their educational goals.

The forecasting report identified that the AI-driven e-learning tools will experience a vast market size of US$ 6 billion by the end of 2024. Let's gain an understanding of what AI-enabled educational applications have emerged yet.

MATHiaU: This application was designed for the students feeling bored or lost in their lecture-sized classrooms. Developing by Carnegie Learning, this application undertakes multi-tasking, including a unique learning process for students, notifying about everyday progress, and developing tailor-made lessons considering students' needs and struggles.

Brainly: Brainly offers students an open platform where they can place their homework-related queries, and in return, fellow students provide them with verified and automated answers. It takes help from machine learning algorithms for filtering spam. It makes students independent for finding their solutions by establishing collaboration with other students.

Netex Learning: Tags as an easy-to-use platform, Netex Learning enables teachers to develop and integrate curriculum and to design tailor-made content for students capable of getting published in countless digital platforms. Teachers are allowed to monitor and track student's progress in visual representation by using tools such as digital discussions, learning analytics and video conferencing, and so on.

Thinkster Math: Thinkster Math is an ideal combination of a personalized style of teaching and a real math curriculum. With the assistance of machine learning and artificial intelligence, this tutor app creates a visualization for the tutor of student thinking while solving a problem. It enables the tutor to identify the point in no time where the student got trapped.

Risks of Artificial Intelligence in the Education Industry
No technology comes without the adverse effects irrespective of industrial type. Although artificial intelligence is indeed creating a buzz in the education industry by improved and efficient learning and teaching tools, it should not ignore how disruptions can create by this technological advancement.


The incurrence of high power cost
Stimulation in unemployment
Quality compromise
Absence of personal engagement and interaction
Broadening the gap of rich-poor
The unclear learning ability of children from a virtual assistant
Boosting the technology addiction of students

To Sum Up
It is difficult to judge the efficiency of artificial intelligence services in the education industry due to its pros and cons. AI software and applications will remove certain limitations for the students in accessing education. Their impact will soon be visible from the lower-level to higher-level institutions.CloseTags:artificial intelligenceeducationmachine learningHubs:Machine learningArtificial Intelligence",,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://habr.com/en/articles/478736/'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['h_machine_learning', 'h_artificial_intelligence', 'f_develop', 'f_popsci']",,,,,,,

Scientists from the Case Western Reserve University digital imaging lab, already pioneering the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to predict whether chemotherapy will be successful, can now determine which lung-cancer patients will benefit from expensive immunotherapy.
And, once again, they’re doing it by teaching a computer to find previously unseen changes in patterns in CT scans taken when the lung cancer is first diagnosed compared to scans taken after the first two to three cycles of immunotherapy treatment. And, as with previous work, those changes have been discovered both inside—and outside—the tumor, a signature of the lab’s recent research.
“This is no flash in the pan—this research really seems to be reflecting something about the very biology of the disease, about which is the more aggressive phenotype, and that’s information oncologists do not currently have,” said Anant Madabhushi, whose Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics (CCIPD) has become a global leader in the detection, diagnosis and characterization of various cancers and other diseases by meshing medical imaging, machine learning and AI.
Currently, only about 20% of all cancer patients will actually benefit from immunotherapy, a treatment that differs from chemotherapy in that it uses drugs to help your immune system fight cancer, while chemotherapy uses drugs to directly kill cancer cells, according to the National Cancer Institute.
Madabhushi said
the recent work by his lab would help oncologists know which patients would
actually benefit from the therapy, and who would not.
“Even though
immunotherapy has changed the entire ecosystem of cancer, it also remains extremely
expensive—about $200,000 per patient, per year,” Madabhushi said. “That’s part
of the financial toxicity that comes along with cancer and results in about 42%
of all new diagnosed cancer patients losing their life savings within a year of
diagnosis.”
Having a tool based on the research being done now by his lab would go a long way toward “doing a better job of matching up which patients will respond to immunotherapy instead of throwing $800,000 down the drain,” he added, referencing the four patients out of five who will not benefit, multiplied by annual estimated cost.
New research published ﻿

The figure above shows differences in CT radiomic patterns before and after initiation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
The new research, led by co-authors Mohammadhadi Khorrami and Prateek Prasanna,  along with Madabhushi and 10 other collaborators from six different institutions was published in November in the journal Cancer Immunology Research. 
Khorrami, a
graduate student working at the CCIPD, said one of the more significant
advances in the research was the ability of the computer program to note the
changes in texture, volume and shape of a given lesion, not just its size.
“This is important
because when a doctor decides based on CT images alone whether a patient has responded
to therapy, it is often based on the size of the lesion,” Khorrami said. “We
have found that textural change is a better predictor of whether the therapy is
working. 
“Sometimes, for
example, the nodule may appear larger after therapy because of another reason,
say a broken vessel inside the tumor—but the therapy is actually working. Now,
we have a way of knowing that.” 
Prasanna, a
postdoctoral research associate in Madabhushi’s lab, said the study also showed
that the results were consistent across scans of patients treated at two different
sites and with three different types of immunotherapy agents.
“This is a
demonstration of the fundamental value of the program, that our machine-learning
model could predict response in patients treated with different immune
checkpoint inhibitors,” he said. “We are dealing with a fundamental biological principal.”
Prasanna said the initial study used CT scans from 50 patients to train the computer and create a mathematical algorithm to identify the changes in the lesion. He said the next step will be to test the program on cases obtained from other sites and across different immunotherapy agents. This research recently won an ASCO 2019 Conquer Cancer Foundation Merit Award.
Additionally,
Madabhushi said, researchers were able show that the patterns on the CT scans which
were most associated with a positive response to treatment and with overall patient
survival were also later found to be closely associated with the arrangement of
immune cells on the original diagnostic biopsies of those patients.
This suggests that
those CT scans actually appear to capturing the immune response elicited by the
tumors against the invasion of the cancer—and that the ones with the strongest
immune response were showing the most significant textural change and most
importantly, would best respond to the immunotherapy, he said.
Madabhushi established
the CCIPD at Case Western Reserve in 2012. The lab now includes nearly 60
researchers. 
Some of the lab’s most recent work,
in collaboration with New York University and Yale University, has used AI to
predict which lung cancer patients would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy
based on tissue-slide images. That advancement was named by Prevention Magazine as one of the top 10 medical breakthroughs of
2018.

Before joining Vox, she worked for TheStreet.FacebookLinkTo find out how 2020 Democratic candidates would use their presidential powers to address different aspects of technology, we sent seven key questions to every campaign. This post includes six candidates’ answers to the fifth question. You can find answers to the other six questions on the landing page. How, if at all, should tech companies be held responsible for the jobs they eliminate with their innovations?Bernie Sanders: [I] will tell corporate America that artificial intelligence and robotics are not going to be used just to throw workers out on the street. This exploding technology must serve human needs, not just corporate profits. As president, [I] will require firms to convey shares to workers who are laid off due to offshoring or automation.[I] will work to prevent workers from being displaced by automation in the first place. We will end tax breaks that encourage companies to replace American workers with robots. Trump’s recent tax bill expanded one of those tax breaks; we are going to close it.[My] Corporate Accountability and Democracy plan would mandate that corporations with more than $100 million in revenue appoint workers to 45 percent of their board seats and issue 20 percent of the corporation’s stock to a worker-controlled fund. When workers have an ownership stake in their company and a say in the decisions that are made, they will not automate their own jobs to increase profits. When workers have more say in their workplace, they will be better able to balance increased productivity and work-saving technology and the interests of the workers that may be replaced. But whether it is coal miners transitioning to jobs in a clean energy economy or manufacturing workers displaced by corporate greed and automation, [I] will protect workers and the communities in which they live. We will create a sustainable future for all and good-paying union jobs right here in America. We will ensure workers in transition have the opportunities, benefits, and supports they need to thrive. Job guarantees, job training, housing, pensions, health care, and more. No one will be left behind. We will pass a federal jobs guarantee to ensure that those who work in industries likely to see major impacts of automation or innovation are able to work elsewhere. [I] will make public colleges, universities, and trade schools tuition-free to ensure all are able to get a higher education if they choose to pursue it. [My] Green New Deal will create 20 million jobs needed to save the planet. We will address the shortage of teachers and caregivers in this country. There is plenty of work to be done. We will ensure that work is done and that people are paid well to do it.Elizabeth Warren: We need to pass my Accountable Capitalism Act. Among other things, it will require large companies to let workers elect board members. This will give workers more control over corporate decisions, including on introducing new technology and how affected workers are compensated.I’ve also introduced a wealth tax on giant fortunes of more than $50 million to bring in the revenue we need to give every kid an opportunity to build a future by investing in universal child care, public education, universal free college, and student debt cancellation for 42 million Americans. I’ve introduced a Real Corporate Profits tax on the profits very large American companies report to their investors with no loopholes or exemptions. It will make our biggest and most profitable corporations pay more so they don’t get away with paying $0 in taxes ever again. We’ll use this money to invest in green research, manufacturing, and exporting — linking American innovation directly to American jobs. Pete Buttigieg: Despite the fact that innovation has driven roughly half of all economic growth since World War II, new technologies that create new jobs can also disrupt or destroy old ones. As technological innovation continues to accelerate, the impacts may be broader and swifter than at other points in history. As a result, we must proactively adopt policies that not only ensure that America leads in the creation of new jobs and industries but that also make sure change works for all of us — not just a few.First, because what you learn is often associated with what you can earn, we need to make sure that every student can develop basic digital and lifelong skills that are increasingly necessary for the new jobs of the future. That is why my Internet for All plan will ensure that every child — regardless of where they live or how much their parents make — can take full advantage of digital learning opportunities. And that’s why I will invest $500 billion to make college affordable for working and middle-class families.Second, we need to ensure that there are appropriate safety nets in place for those whose jobs are disrupted by innovation, so that they can continue to lead productive and fulfilling lives. As technological transformations shift the nature of our job market, we must be able to provide adequate support and retraining to workers to ensure that American workers work in good jobs and earn a fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work. That is why my economic plan invests $50 billion in workforce training and lifelong learning — investing federal dollars into eight key programs so that incomes can grow for all workers, whether or not they have a college degree.Third, when people do get jobs in the tech industry, companies must treat them fairly and be responsible for the workers they hire. I have proposed a bold agenda to tackle this problem, titled A New Rising Tide, which guarantees gig workers the right to unionize through codifying the “ABC” test, and cracks down on companies that misclassify workers as independent contractors. Tech companies should be partners in these policies, not barriers to them.Andrew Yang: [I] frequently talk about the Fourth Industrial Revolution — the greatest technological and economic shift of all time. A driving force behind that is the automation of jobs. As we undergo this transition, we need to ensure that Americans get a slice of every Amazon transaction, Facebook ad, Google search, and self-driving truck mile. By implementing a [value-added tax] at half the European rate and making these companies pay their fair share, we can implement a Freedom Dividend of $1,000 per month for all American adults to help them transition through this difficult time. Tom Steyer: The American economy should reward innovation, ingenuity, and productivity. If our country, however, wants to generate sustained economic growth, we also have to provide opportunity, and ensure the health and welfare of the American worker. That means guaranteeing every American an education and a livable wage. It means providing workers with better and lower-cost health care, clean air and water, and retirement security. It also means that we are going to make a federal tax system that is more equitable, so Americans can fulfill their potential and live in dignity. Michael Bennet: Companies have a responsibility to consider how their innovations will affect the workforce and society more broadly, and wherever possible, invest in training existing and future employees for jobs that will be available well into the future. At the same time, government needs to develop sensible, forward-thinking policy to harness innovations so that they lead to more jobs with better wages and working conditions, rather than fewer jobs with worse pay and conditions. At a minimum, government should invest far more in K-12 education, proven apprenticeships, community college, and other opportunities to gain the skills for good-paying jobs in the modern economy.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

The technology is based on two decades of research by  Maryellen Giger, PhD, Professor of Radiology and a world-renowned pioneer in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD).
Each year, TIME lists 100 groundbreaking inventions that &ldquo;are changing the way we live, work, play and think about what&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo; Nominations are evaluated based on factors such as &ldquo;originality, creativity, influence, ambition and effectiveness.&rdquo;
QuantX analyzes breast magnetic resonance images (MRIs) using artificial intelligence and a large reference data base to help radiologists interpret medical images in the assessment of cancerous and non-cancerous breast lesions. The FDA cleared the new technology in 2017 after a clinical study showed QuantX improved the detection of cancerous breast tumors by 39%, and increased overall diagnostic improvement by 20%.
Giger's lab specializes in gleaning information from medical images by developing novel computer vision algorithms, thus allowing AI to augment radiologists&rsquo; interpretations. &ldquo;This type of technology, together with radiologists, will clearly lead to improved outcomes for patients and efficiency,&rdquo; said Aytekin Oto, MD, MBA, interim chair of radiology at UChicago Medicine.
Oto noted the Department of Radiology&rsquo;s unique structure, which brings MDs and PhDs together under one academic department, fosters the research and innovation needed to bring new technology to the bedside.
The breast radiology team at UChicago Medicine is now evaluating QuantX and considering it for future patient use, as is a team at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Similar AI-enabled software could eventually be developed for use in diagnosing prostate, lung, and other types of cancers.
Translation of Giger's National Cancer Institute-funded research was further made possible through collaboration with the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Chicago. Giger is the co-founder of Quantitative Insights, Inc., which produced QuantX and placed as a finalist among more than 100 competitors in the Polsky Center&rsquo;s 2009-2010 New Venture Challenge. Her lab&rsquo;s research was commercialized as QuantX within the UChicago startup Quantitative Insights, which was incubated at the Polsky Center, until the assets were sold in 2019 to Paragon Biosciences. A subsidiary, Qlarity Imaging, is commercializing QuantX.

Reader question: Jeff, I am wondering if you have advice for someone wanting to explore the AI/ML [artificial intelligence/machine learning] field. I have been interested in pursuing education down this road to make a career change. I read your Bleeding Edge and Near Future Report, and I feel, as you do, that this is an industry with serious growth prospects.
What would be the best approach for this? Most colleges do not have majors focused on it, and they are exceedingly expensive. I have read you mention Udacity before, and I am curious if that is the best approach.

– Michael H. (Legacy Research member)
Jeff’s answer: First off, thanks for being a reader. This has been a popular question in our mailbag in the past. And I’m always happy to answer questions from readers looking to continue, or even begin, their education in the field of high technology.
And I can tell you that if you are able to develop the skills for this field, you will absolutely have work. I’ve shared the below chart before. But it perfectly illustrates this.


Simply put, AI will be the hottest area for jobs over the next 20 years.
The field is so hot that AI specialists with little to no industry experience can expect to make between $300-$500K per year (in salary and stock), on average.
And as you can see, there are about 2.9 times more job openings than there are applicants to fill those positions. It’s a job-seeker’s market.
Udacity is certainly one place you could start to seek out additional training. For readers who don’t know, Udacity is a company that offers “nanodegrees.” We can think of these as highly specialized certifications for very specific techniques. This could become something that we do on a frequent basis – perhaps earning a nanodegree every few years.
Udacity offers nanodegrees in everything from AI programming… deep-learning technology… and natural language processing. It also offers an “Intro to Machine Learning” course. These courses typically cost anywhere between $450 to $1,300.
And if you’re looking for free resources to continue learning, I’d recommend you look at edX (www.edX.org). A lot of the content is free, and edX is backed by MIT, one of the hot spots for AI/ML.
Coursera is another site for online learning, and there are several AI/ML courses from famous professors at Stanford available (www.coursera.org/stanford).
And in the event that you might want to earn a full degree, AI/ML specializations can be earned within the computer science school of major universities. The prerequisite to taking specialized courses is computer programming skills, which can be learned in a university program, or in specialized programming boot camps like Flatiron School, Hack Reactor, Fullstack Academy, or General Assembly.

Next up… Nick Giambruno and Dave Forest team up to tackle a Cut reader’s question about uranium prices.


Reader question: For Nick and/or Dave.
Hello – much is being talked about gold, but I’d appreciate your thoughts on uranium prices.
Much has been said about the supply shortage and inevitable spike in prices. What is the status on this?
Could you please provide your thoughts on uranium and when we should expect uranium prices to spike, and provide the significant gains you predict? Thanks.

– Jose P. (Legacy Research member)
Nick’s answer: Nuclear power delivers immense value to its users, there’s no substitute for uranium, and production is falling while demand rises.
This situation only has two possible outcomes:


Uranium prices don’t go up. Miners have no incentive to produce. Nuclear power plants run out of uranium, and the lights go out for billions of people.


Uranium prices go up and incentivize enough production to meet the demand.


There are no other options.
Uranium is a “when, not if” situation. Of course, the big question is when. The truth is… nobody knows for sure.
That’s the thing about speculations… they work on their own schedule.
I am confident that uranium will reward patient speculators. In fact, just this week I added to my own personal positions in uranium.
Dave’s answer: The fundamental setup for uranium is excellent. Current spot prices are WAY below the costs of production for most uranium mines. It’s so bad, many companies have stopped mining because it’s cheaper to buy other people’s uranium on the spot market to fulfill long-term contracts.
You can guess that’s not sustainable for long. Eventually, there will be no more spot supply. Then, we’ll need prices to rise so mines can reopen.
How long will that take? Hard to say. Uranium stockpiles are notoriously hard to estimate, because you’re dealing with opaque countries like Russia and Kazakhstan. But it will happen.
One note on timing: Right now, uranium is the most crowded “contrarian” play I’ve ever seen. There are lots of investors who love the sector, very vocally. To me, that suggests we’re not quite at a turning point. When all those bulls give up (many of them have been waiting years by now), we’ll be close.

Now, let’s shift our focus to “funny money”…
Faithful fans (and haters) of Bill Bonner will know what we mean by “funny” or “fake” money. But if that’s a new term to you, don’t worry… There’s an easy explanation…
All the dollars, euros, pesos, rubles, and other national currencies are “fake” because they’re no longer backed by gold or anything with actual value… They’re backed only by government promises. So that means they’re no longer real money.
Now, if you want to know how all that happened, here are two great essays from Bill:
Executive Order 6102 Led to the Fall of America’s Money System
The Extinction of the Fiscal Conservative
But for today’s mailbag, the short explanation is enough to set the stage for our next question… And Jeff Clark steps up with the answer.


Reader question: I have a question regarding the markets from your perspective. With all the new funny money coming in, can you still trust your go-to indicators?
What does this money from nowhere do to the markets?
I am aware that the funny money has been coming in for a long time. I guess my real question is… In all the years you have been watching the market, has its natural cycle changed as a result of this funny money?

– David S. (Legacy Research member)
Jeff’s answer: Hi David. Thanks for the question. The simple answer is: Yes, the natural financial cycles have changed as a result of “funny money.”
Remember, though, market cycles are always evolving and adjusting. The typical patterns that worked yesterday may not work tomorrow. That’s why technical analysis is more of an art than a science.
Naturally, the more money that is available, the more likely that money will find a home in stocks and will keep bullish trends intact longer. Perhaps that’s why our stock market is enjoying the longest bull run in history.
For my purposes, though, funny money really doesn’t impact the short-term activity – which is based more on market psychology. Stocks are still likely to pull back from overbought conditions. And they’re still likely to rally off of oversold conditions. And, most of the indicators I’ve been using for years to identify overbought and oversold conditions are – for the most part – still quite reliable.

For our last question and answer of the week, we turn to the most controversial topic in The Daily Cut this week – CBD.
Teeka Tiwari provides the answer…


Reader question: Hi Chris [Lowe]. It’s Andrea, the one from the conference… When they served tea and cakes, and you said, “What is this?”… I said, “It’s sugar.” You responded, “That’s a high-level answer.” You probably don’t remember.
Anyway… anyone that has read Doug Casey’s books already knows how corrupt the FDA is and how it accomplishes its dirty work. That part of Doug’s book [Right on the Money] ain’t no fiction.
I am thinking it’s the alcohol, tobacco, and mainly pharmaceutical companies who are paying the FDA to propagate these lies about cannabis… What do you think?
I’m a lifetime Legacy member… that’s if you stay interesting and entertaining enough.

– Andrea L. (Legacy Research member)
Teeka’s answer: Big Pharma isn’t the only one targeting cannabis, either. Dozens of politicians and insiders have publicly attacked cannabis, too…
Yet they’re now investing in it – in record numbers. And that’s why I recently sat down with one of President Trump’s close friends, Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro, to expose them.
What we discussed could make you uncomfortable… perhaps even angry. But it could also make you more money than you’ve ever dreamed possible.

That’s all for this week.
But if you’d like to watch Teeka’s full interview with Judge Pirro, you can catch it here.

Neural networks trained on real-world examples churn out results that are as close as possible to those original examples. In this case, it seems like the algorithm found a shortcut.Futurism reviewed at least five résumés generated by the website, each of which provided an email address for their fictional subject that turned out to be registered in real life.Futurism also found that the résumés provided the links to real Facebook and Instagram accounts, suggesting that the résumés generator might be simply reproducing real people's names and contact information. By press time, none of those people have responded to Futurism's request for a comment, so the résumé with an active Facebook link has been excluded from this article.The headshots provided on some résumés, however, are randomized and generated by a similar website that uses AI to generate fake photos, according to an FAQ section on the résumé site.Shallow PoolAside from reproducing contact information, the AI-generated résumés don't always paint applicants in the best light. The job descriptions highlight AI's ongoing struggle to recognize context and the actual meaning of words.For example, a résumé for a fictional person named Darren Charles boasts that ""…I am activities and learn new things and I do noticity."" Another résumé's summary reads ""I am a passionate software developer who loves to preparo many talent"" and says that the person spends over a quarter of their time ""getting too little sleep.""If this algorithm's HR skills are any indication, it looks like the job search and hiring process will still need a human touch.More on AI-generated media: This Site Uses Deep Learning to Generate Fake Airbnb ListingsShare This ArticleRead This NextSorting HatMcDonald’s Making Job Applicants Take Weird AI Personality TestsFuturismWas That Script Written By A Human Or An AI?

But is it up to the task?by  Rebecca HeilweilDec 12, 2019, 8:00 AM ESTFacebookLink Christina Animashaun/VoxRebecca Heilweil covered emerging technology, artificial intelligence, and the supply chain.FacebookLinkWith parents using artificial intelligence to scan prospective babysitters’ social media and an endless slew of articles explaining how your résumé can “beat the bots,” you might be wondering whether a robot will be offering you your next job. We’re not there yet, but recruiters are increasingly using AI to make the first round of cuts and to determine whether a job posting is even advertised to you. Often trained on data collected about previous or similar applicants, these tools can cut down on the effort recruiters need to expend in order to make a hire. Last year, 67 percent of hiring managers and recruiters surveyed by LinkedIn said AI was saving them time.But critics argue that such systems can introduce bias, lack accountability and transparency, and aren’t guaranteed to be accurate. Take, for instance, the Utah-based company HireVue, which sells a job interview video platform that can use artificial intelligence to assess candidates and, it claims, predict their likelihood to succeed in a position. The company says it uses on-staff psychologists to help develop customized assessment algorithms that reflect the ideal traits for a particular role a client (usually a company) hopes to hire for, like a sales representative or computer engineer. Output of an Artificial Intelligence system from Google Vision, performing facial recognition on a photograph of a man in San Ramon, California on November 22, 2019. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesThat algorithm is then used to analyze how individual candidates answer preselected questions in a recorded video interview, grading their verbal responses and, in some cases, facial movements. HireVue claims the tool — which is used by about 100 clients, including Hilton and Unilever — is more predictive of job performance than human interviewers conducting the same structured interviews.But last month, lawyers at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a privacy rights nonprofit, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, pushing the agency to investigate the company for potential bias, inaccuracy, and lack of transparency. It also accused HireVue of engaging in “deceptive trade practices” because the company claims it doesn’t use facial recognition. (EPIC argues HireVue’s facial analysis qualifies as facial recognition.) The lawsuit follows the introduction of the Algorithmic Accountability Act in Congress earlier this year, which would grant the FTC authority to create regulations to check so-called “automated decision systems” for bias. Meanwhile, the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC) — the federal agency that deals with employment discrimination — is reportedly now investigating at least two discrimination cases involving job decision algorithms, according to Bloomberg Law. AI can pop up throughout the recruitment and hiring processRecruiters can make use of artificial intelligence throughout the hiring process, from advertising and attracting potential applicants to predicting candidates’ job performance. “Just like with the rest of the world’s digital advertisement, AI is helping target who sees what job descriptions [and] who sees what job marketing,” explains Aaron Rieke, a managing director at Upturn, a DC-based nonprofit digital technology research group. And it’s not just a few outlier companies, like HireVue, that use predictive AI. Vox’s own HR staff use LinkedIn Recruiter, a popular tool that uses artificial intelligence to rank candidates.Similarly, the jobs platform ZipRecruiter uses AI to match candidates with nearby jobs that are potentially good fits, based on the traits the applicants have shared with the platform — like their listed skills, experience, and location — and previous interactions between similar candidates and prospective employers. For instance, because I applied for a few San Francisco-based tutoring gigs on ZipRecruiter last year, I’ve continued to receive emails from the platform advertising similar jobs in the area. Join the Open Sourced Reporting NetworkChristina Animashaun/VoxOpen Sourced is Recode by Vox’s year-long reporting project to demystify the world of data, personal privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. And we need your help. Fill out this form to contribute to our reporting.Overall, the company says its AI has trained on more than 1.5 billion employer-candidate interactions.Platforms like Arya — which says it’s been used by Home Depot and Dyson — go even further, using machine learning to find candidates based on data that might be available on a company’s internal database, public job boards, social platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, and other profiles available on the open web, like those on professional membership sites. Arya claims it’s even able to predict whether an employee is likely to leave their old job and take a new one, based on the data it collects about a candidate, such as their promotions, movement between previous roles and industries, and the predicted fit of a new position, as well as data about the role and industry more broadly. Another use of AI is to screen through application materials, like résumés and assessments, in order to recommend which candidates recruiters should contact first. Somen Mondal, the CEO and co-founder of one such screening and matching service, Ideal, says these systems do more than automatically search résumés for relevant keywords.For instance, Ideal can learn to understand and compare experiences across candidates’ résumés and then rank the applicants by how closely they match an opening. “It’s almost like a recruiter Googling a company [listed on an application] and learning about it,” explains Mondal, who says his platform is used to screen 5 million candidates a month. But AI doesn’t just operate behind the scenes. If you’ve ever applied for a job and then been engaged by a text conversation, there’s a chance you’re talking to a recruitment bot. Chatbots that use natural-language understanding created by companies like Mya can help automate the process of reaching out to previous applicants about a new opening at a company, or finding out whether an applicant meets a position’s basic requirements — like availability — thus eliminating the need for human phone-screening interviews. Mya, for instance, can reach out over text and email, as well as through messaging applications like Facebook and WhatsApp. Another burgeoning use of artificial intelligence in job selection is talent and personality assessments. One company championing this application is Pymetrics, which sells neuroscience computer games for candidates to play (one such game involves hitting the spacebar whenever a red circle, but not a green circle, flashes on the screen). These games are meant to predict candidates’ “cognitive and personality traits.” Pymetrics says on its website that the system studies “millions of data points” collected from the games to match applicants to jobs judged to be a good fit, based on Pymetrics’ predictive algorithms. Proponents say AI systems are faster and can consider information human recruiters can’t calculate quicklyThese tools help HR departments move more quickly through large pools of applicants and ultimately make it cheaper to hire. Proponents say they can be more fair and more thorough than overworked human recruiters skimming through hundreds of résumés and cover letters.“Companies just can’t get through the applications. And if they do, they’re spending — on average — three seconds,” Mondal says. “There’s a whole problem with efficiency.” He argues that using an AI system can ensure that every résumé, at the very least, is screened. After all, one job posting might attract thousands of applications, with a huge share from people who are completely unqualified for a role. Such tools can automatically recognize traits in the application materials from previous successful hires and look for signs of that trait among materials submitted by new applicants. Mondal says systems like Ideal can consider between 16 and 25 factors (or elements) in each application, pointing out that, unlike humans, it can calculate something like commute distance in “milliseconds.”“You can start to fine-tune the system with not just the people you’ve brought in to interview, or not just the people that you’ve hired, but who ended up doing well in the position. So it’s a complete loop,” Mondal explains. “As a human, it’s very difficult to look at all that data across the lifecycle of an applicant. And [with AI] this is being done in seconds.” These systems typically operate on a scale greater than a human recruiter. For instance, HireVue claims the artificial intelligence used in its video platform evaluates “tens of thousands of factors.” Even if companies are using the same AI-based hiring tool, they’re likely using a system that’s optimized to their own hiring preferences. Plus, an algorithm is likely changing if it’s continuously being trained on new data.Another service, Humantic, claims it can get a sense of candidates’ psychology based on their résumés, LinkedIn profiles, and other text-based data an applicant might volunteer to submit, by mining through and studying their use of language (the product is inspired by the field of psycholinguistics). The idea is to eliminate the need for additional personality assessments. “We try to recycle the information that’s already there,” explains Amarpreet Kalkat, the company’s co-founder. He says the service is used by more than 100 companies. Proponents of these recruiting tools also claim that artificial intelligence can be used to avoid human biases, like an unconscious preference for graduates of a particular university, or a bias against women or a racial minority. (But AI often amplifies bias; more on that later.) They argue that AI can help strip out — or abstract — information related to a candidate’s identity, like their name, age, gender, or school, and more fairly consider applicants. The idea that AI might clamp down on — or at least do better than — biased humans inspired California lawmakers earlier this year to introduce a bill urging fellow policymakers to explore the use of new technology, including “artificial intelligence and algorithm-based technologies,” to “reduce bias and discrimination in hiring.”AI tools reflect who builds and trains themThese AI systems are only as good as the data they’re trained on and the humans that build them. If a résumé-screening machine learning tool is trained on historical data, such as résumés collected from a company’s previously hired candidates, the system will inherit both the conscious and unconscious preferences of the hiring managers who made those selections. That approach could help find stellar, highly qualified candidates. But Rieke warns that method can also pick up “silly patterns that are nonetheless real and prominent in a data set.” One such résumé-screening tool identified being named Jared and having played lacrosse in high school as the best predictors of job performance, as Quartz reported.If you’re a former high school lacrosse player named Jared, that particular tool might not sound so bad. But systems can also learn to be racist, sexist, ageist, and biased in other nefarious ways. For instance, Reuters reported last year that Amazon had created a recruitment algorithm that unintentionallytended to favor male applicants over female applicants for certain positions. The system was trained on a decade of résumés submitted to the company, which Reuters reported were mostly from men.A visitor at Intel’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Day walks past a signboard in Bangalore, India on April 4, 2017. Manjunath Kiran/AFP via Getty Images(An Amazon spokesperson told Recode that the system was never used and was abandoned for several reasons, including because the algorithms were primitive and that the models randomly returned unqualified candidates.)Mondal says there is no way to use these systems without regular, extensive auditing. That’s because, even if you explicitly instruct a machine learning tool not to discriminate against women, it might inadvertently learn to discriminate against other proxies associated with being female, like having graduated from a women’s college. “You have to have a way to make sure that you aren’t picking people who are grouped in a specific way and that you’re only hiring those types of people,” he says. Ensuring that these systems are not introducing unjust bias means frequently checking that new hires don’t disproportionately represent one demographic group.But there’s skepticism that efforts to “de-bias” algorithms and AI are a complete solution. And Upturn’s report on equity and hiring algorithms notes that “[de-biasing] best practices have yet to crystallize [and] [m]any techniques maintain a narrow focus on individual protected characteristics like gender or race, and rarely address intersectional concerns, where multiple protected traits produce compounding disparate effects.” And if a job is advertised on an online platform like Facebook, it’s possible you won’t even see a posting because of biases produced by that platform’s algorithms. There’s also concern that systems like HireVue’s could inherently be built to discriminate against people with certain disabilities.Critics are also skeptical of whether these tools do what they say, especially when they make broad claims about a candidates’ “predicted” psychology, emotion, and suitability for a position. Adina Sterling, an organizational behavior professor at Stanford, also notes that, if not designed carefully, an algorithm could drive its preferences toward a single type of candidate. Such a system might miss a more unconventional applicant who could nevertheless excel, like an actor applying for a job in sales.“Algorithms are good for economies of scale. They’re not good for nuance,” she explains, adding that she doesn’t believe companies are being vigilant enough when studying the recruitment AI tools they use and checking what these systems actually optimize for. Who regulates these tools?Employment lawyer Mark Girouard says AI and algorithmic selection systems fall under the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, guidance established in 1978 by federal agencies that guide companies’ selection standards and employment assessments.Many of these AI tools say they follow the four-fifths rule, a statistical “rule of thumb” benchmark established under those employee selection guidelines. The rule is used to compare the selection rate of applicant demographic groups and investigate whether selection criteria might have had an adverse impact on a protected minority group. But experts have noted that the rule is just one test, and Rieke emphasizes that passing the test doesn’t imply these AI tools do what they claim. A system that picked candidates randomly could pass the test, he says. Girouard explains that as long as a tool does not have a disparate impact on race or gender, there’s no law on the federal level that requiresthat such AI tools work as intended.In its case against HireVue, EPIC argues that the company has failed to meet established AI transparency guidelines, including artificial intelligence principles outlined by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development that have been endorsed by the U.S and 41 other countries. HireVue told Recode that it follows the standards set by the Uniform Guidelines, as well as guidelines set by other professional organizations. The company also says its systems are trained on a diverse data set and that its tools have helped its clients increase the diversity of their staff.At the state level, Illinois has made some initial headway in promoting the transparent use of these tools. In January, its Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act will take effect, which requires that employers using artificial intelligence-based video analysis technology notify, explain, and get the consent of applicants. Still, Rieke says few companies release the methodologies used in their bias audits in “meaningful detail.” He’s not aware of any company that has released the results of an audit conducted by a third party. Meanwhile, senators have pushed the EEOC to investigate whether biased facial analysis algorithms could violate anti-discrimination laws, and experts have previously warned the agency about the risk of algorithmic bias. But the EEOC has yet to release any specific guidance regarding algorithmic decision-making or artificial intelligence-based tools and did not respond to Recode’s request for comment. Rieke did highlight one potential upside for applicants. Should lawmakers one day force companies to release the results of their AI hiring selection systems, job candidates could gain new insight into how to improve their applications. But as to whether AI will ever make the final call, Sterling says that’s a long way’s off.“Hiring is an extremely social process,” she explains. “Companies don’t want to relinquish it to tech.”Open Sourced is made possible by Omidyar Network.

You might imagine that artificial intelligence is only something the big tech giants are focused on, and that AI doesn't impact your everyday life. In reality, artificial intelligence is encountered by most people from morning until night. Here are 10 of the best examples of how AI is already used in our everyday lives.
The 10 Best Examples Of How AI Is Already Used In Our Everyday LifeAdobe Stock

1.   Open your phone with face ID

One of the first things many people do each morning is to reach for their smartphones. And, when your device gets unlocked using biometrics such as with face ID, it's using artificial intelligence to enable that functionality. Apple’s FaceID can see in 3D. It lights up your face and places 30,000 invisible infrared dots on it and captures an image. It then uses machine learning algorithms to compare the scan of your face with what it has stored about your face to determine if the person trying to unlock the phone is you or not. Apple states the chance of fooling FaceID is one in a million.  

2.   Social media

After unlocking their phones, what's next? Many people check out their social media accounts, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and more, to get updated on what happened overnight. Not only is artificial intelligence working behind the scenes to personalize what you see on your feeds (because it's learned what types of posts most resonate with you based on past history), it's figuring out friend suggestions, identifying and filtering out fake news and machine learning is working to prevent cyberbullying.

3.   Send an email or message
Every day most of us will send an email (or several). Tools such as Grammarly and spell check activate when you compose your email to help you draft messages free from errors. These tools use artificial intelligence and natural language processing. On the receiving end of your messages, spam filters use artificial intelligence to either block emails that are suspected as spam or identify an email as something your recipient would like to receive in their inbox. Anti-virus software uses machine learning as well to protect your email account.

4.   Google search
Most of us can’t go a day without searching Google for an answer or a product we can’t live without. Search engines couldn’t scan the entire internet and deliver what you want without the assistance of artificial intelligence. Those ads that seem to follow you around? Yep, those are enabled by AI, are based on your search history and are personalized to you with the goal of getting items in front of you that the algorithms believe you will value.

5.   Digital voice assistants
From getting directions to your lunch spot to inquiring about the weather for your weekend getaway, digital voice assistants are quickly becoming our can’t-live-without co-pilots through life. These tools from Siri and Alexa to Google Home and Cortana, use natural language processing and generators driven by AI to return answers to you.

6.   Smart home devices
Our homes are increasingly becoming ""smart."" Many of us now have ""smart"" thermostats such as the Nest that learn about our heating/cooling preferences and daily habits to adjust the temperature to our liking in time for our return home. There are smart refrigerators that create lists for what you need based on what's no longer in your fridge, as well as offer wine recommendations that would go with your dinner. Of course, smart appliances will continue to be more common.
7.   Commuting to work
The travel aids enabled by artificial intelligence include more than maps. Google maps and other travel apps use AI to monitor traffic to give you real-time traffic and weather conditions as well as suggest ways to avoid gridlock. The car you drive to work might have driver-assist technology, and in places such as Mountain View, California, you can request a self-driving car through Google's sister company Waymo to drive you to and from work.
8.   Banking
There are many ways artificial intelligence is deployed in our banking system. It's highly involved in the security of our transactions and to detect fraud. If you deposit a check by scanning it with your phone, get a low-balance alert, or even log on to your online banking account, AI is at work behind the scenes. If you visit a shop at lunch and purchase a new pair of pants, artificial intelligence will verify the purchase to determine if it's a ""normal"" transaction to either validate or decline the transaction for fear someone unauthorized is using your credit card.
9.   Amazon recommendations
Speaking of shopping, America’s largest online retailer Amazon is another way many people are exposed to artificial intelligence regularly. The retailer’s AI algorithms learned what you like and what other people who are like you purchased to deliver to your Amazon feed recommendations for what you might like in your carts. Amazon is so confident in its predictive analytics and algorithms that it will ship products towards you even before you “click to buy” with its anticipatory shipping algorithm.
10. Netflix
At the end of the day, when it's time to kick back and relax, many of us turn to streaming services such as Netflix. The company's recommendation engine is powered by artificial intelligence and uses your past viewing history to deliver suggestions for what you might want to watch (including genres, actors, time periods, and more). Its tool gets as specific as what time of day you were watching and what you traditionally like during that timeframe. In fact, 80% of what we're watching is driven by Netflix's recommendations.
Soo, it will be hard to imagine any of our daily routines without the help of AI.

What will be the
effects of the digital transformation on jobs? Job creation outnumbering digital job destruction is part and parcel of
standard artificial-intelligence (AI) prophecy. But the extent to which work tasks are upgraded—rather than downgraded or
even replaced—is determined by at least two dimensions: the technical side and
the work aspect. 
Today, in the
production and service sectors ‘digitalisation’ in most cases means the use of
smartphones and tablets. These devices undoubtedly are operated by complex
technology—such as AI. But full automation is not yet the main reality.

Nevertheless, the robot—another
smart device—is already replacing human work, which has negative effects on wages.
Middle- and low-skilled jobs in particular have been affected by information
and communication technology (ICT) and robots since the 1970s and 80s. The
consequences are decreasing wages on the one hand, and productivity growth and
rising ‘digital dividends’ on the other. These dividends, however, are mainly
received by the capital owner and explain (in part) the shrinking wage share. 
In a country such as Germany,
robots are certainly common but in industry they are very concentrated, especially
in automotive manufacturing. The vast majority of studies therefore conclude
that digitalisation drives the automation of work tasks in certain domains, but
also creates much—or even more—work in other, less automated areas, primarily in
the service sector.
Daring assumption
Believing that digitalisation
must have automatic positive effects on total employment, however, would be
quite daring. It depends on the assumption that demand for work lost is
(over)compensated by new demand for work elsewhere.

The more precisely
this presumed multiplier effect is broken down, the more pronounced the doubts
about the associated technology optimism become. The promise is that sectoral
productivity gains through digitalisation lead to ‘prosperity for all 4.0’. Yet
not only have such ‘trickle-down’ claims gone through a credibility crisis in
the last 30 years; they also present a very demanding scenario when it comes to
digitalisation.
On the one hand, the
assumption is correct that demand for services—or, put more generally, for
manual tasks—will increase if some employees receive higher wages because they benefit
from digitalisation. On the other hand, these tasks are relatively price-inelastic,
so if their price falls due to the use of technology, demand for them will not grow
to the same extent. 
Technology will not
automatically lead to a general increase in prosperity. Instead of focusing on
the side of technology and associated investments, a social technology
assessment is required, in which the distributional effects of digitalisation are
carefully considered. Without
controlling AI’s differential effects on the labour market, inequality will
continue to rise.
Tacit knowledge
Luckily, the scenario
of a highly automated industry remains a vision for the future, mainly because
of the complexity of even simple work. Each job comprises a whole bundle of
experiences—no matter how routinised the tasks may be. The capacity to work generally
requires tacit knowledge about how to deal not only with complexity but also
uncertainty, which is out of reach for ‘tool’ or special-purpose AI. 
Today, so-called ‘world
knowledge’ can be formalised in simple individual cases in AI models, but it is
expensive, resource-consuming and always reductionist. The marginal utility of
today’s AI is still very limited and does not justify scenarios of massive job
losses. These assumptions are usually based on a simplistic understanding of
routine work and the production process.
When it comes to
regulation, one of the most urgent issues is thus to counter the digital anxiety
of many workers with a realistic assessment and an appreciation of their individual
working abilities. Practical, including technical, co-determination is also needed
in the digitalisation of operational processes.
This requires the strengthening
and extension of co-determination structures and rights. Co-determination serves
here not only to control the technology but can also be a supportive factor in investment
decision-making, which often is not properly recognised by management alone. 
Prosperity for all
Finally, a forward-looking policy has the responsibility to correct potential, excessive and unequal distribution effects—so that eventually prosperity for all is in fact created. In the short term, redistributive measures are essential to pursue a social ‘Pareto optimum 4.0’; in the long run, a transition plan is needed towards a world of work which tames advanced AI.
Such shared prosperity will be largely material in nature. But it can also be increasingly immaterial—including a reduction of working time.

WIPO Begins Public Consultation Process on Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property Policy
Geneva,



December 13, 2019










 
 
PR/2019/843
  
 


The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) today launched a public consultation process on artificial intelligence (AI) and intellectual property (IP) policy, inviting feedback on an issues paper designed to help define the most-pressing questions likely to face IP policy makers as AI increases in importance.
Beginning December 13, 2019, WIPO published its issues paper with a call for comments from the widest-possible global audience. It is the latest step in WIPO’s response to the ongoing interaction of AI with the IP system, including the use of AI applications in IP administration.
“Artificial intelligence is set to radically alter the way in which we work and live, with great potential to help us solve common global challenges, but it is also prompting policy questions and challenges,” said WIPO Director General Francis Gurry.

Machine learning relies on information in the form of electronic data, which is also at the heart of intellectual property and innovation in a global digital economy. I invite everyone with an interest to assist us in formulating the questions that are confronting policy makers and to share with us their expertise in order to have a focused dialogue.
WIPO Director General Francis Gurry
How does artificial intelligence impact intellectual property?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly driving important developments in technology and business. It is being employed across a range of industries, from telecommunications to autonomous vehicles.
Increasing stores of big data and advances in affordable high computing power are fueling AI’s growth. AI has a significant impact on the creation, production and distribution of economic and cultural goods and services. Since one of the main aims of the IP system is to stimulate innovation and creativity in the economic and cultural systems, AI intersects with IP in a number of ways.
In January 2019, WIPO issued a study that surveyed the landscape of AI innovation. The “WIPO Technology Trends” report provides a common information base on AI for policy and decision makers in government and business, as well as concerned citizens across the globe.
In September, WIPO held a Conversation on IP and Al bringing together member states and other stakeholders to discuss the impact of Al on IP policy, with a view to collectively formulating the questions that policymakers need to ask.
At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. Gurry announced that WIPO would commence an open process to develop a list of issues concerning the impact of Al on IP policy that might form the basis of future structured discussions.
Submissions on this new draft issues paper issued today are invited through February 14, 2020. Following the submission of comments, a revised issues paper will be prepared. All submissions will be posted on the WIPO website.

Called upon by the United Nations, World Bank, INTERPOL, and leading enterprises, Daniel is a globally sought-after expert on the competitive strategy implications of AI for business and government leaders. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Since Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Kik, Slack, and a growing number of bot-creation platforms came online, developers have been churning out chatbots across industries, with Facebook’s most recent bot count at over 33,000. At a CRM technologies conference in 2011, Gartner predicted that 85 percent of customer engagement would be fielded without human intervention. Though a seeming natural fit for retail and purchasing-related decisions, it doesn’t appear that chatbot technology will play favorites in the coming few years, with uses cases being promoted in finance, human resources, and even legal services. Not all chatbots are created equal though; some catch on while others fall away just as quick, and the level of function and natural interaction varies widely. Some companies (see #7 in this list) even argue for semantics i.e. “virtual assistant” is a more robust and advanced technology than a chatbot. In this article, we shed a spotlight on 7 real-world chatbots/virtual assistants across industries that are in action and reaping value for their parent companies. From streamlined operations and saved human productivity to increased customer engagement, the following examples are worth a read if you’ve ever considered leveraging chatbot technology for your business (or are curious about the possibilities). Each example is broken down into company description, chatbot/virtual assistant design and purpose, value proposition (tangible business results), and key questions/takeaways to consider when thinking about how to apply technology to your own company or industry.  1 – Expensify: “Concierge”  Company Description: Expensify software helps streamline and automate expense reports and travel arrangements for companies across industries. How it’s being used: Concierge takes new users step-by-step through the setup process, and is designed to proactively trouble-shoot customer issues (for example, if the connection between a user’s credit card and Expensify is severed, the chatbot gives instructions on how to fix the connection before it becomes a problem) With access to real-time travel pricing, Concierge is able to notify users if they’re receiving the best value Concierge can communicate with users on Expensify’s website or via mobile and is compatible with Slack (the cloud-based team collaboration tool) Value proposition: In an interview with FastCompany, Barrett noted that Concierge has helped reduce banking problems by 75%, and that the website has quintupled the number of its free trials (Expensify has no shortage of big-name clients, which include Uber, Warby Parker, Virgin Hotels, and Quora, to name a select handful). Key questions/takeaways: Select quotes are borrowed from FastCompany’s interview with CEO David Barrett: Are there recurring customer service issues or problem areas in our business that would benefit from preventive interaction? CEO David Barrett stated , “You don’t want to talk to the chatbot, you want something to happen with the minimum amount of interaction.” How might our business help customers make better and quicker decisions? Barrett advises keeping the user interface simple: “People don’t want more functionality, they already have too much functionality. The most modern applications today are about having less UI, a single button that does a tremendous amount…”   2 – 1-800-Flowers: “GWYN”  Company description: A floral and gourmet foods gift retailer and distribution company and one of the first businesses to use telephone and Internet for direct sales. How it’s being used: GWYN is a product of IBM’s artificial intelligence system, Watson, and is based on the Fluid Expert Personal Shopper (XPS) software platform); the chatbot helps consumers search for and place their gift order online GWYN becomes smarter as “she” interacts with more customers over time; the eventual goal is to offer a customized shopping experience based on a user’s past buying behaviors Using natural language, GWYN interprets customer questions about a product or service; “she” can then follow up with additional questions about the intended audience, occasion, and sentiment in order to suggest best-fit gifts for a particular customer Value proposition: 1-800-Flowers’ 2017 first quarter results showed total revenues had increased 6.3 percent to $165.8 million, with the Company’s Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets business as a significant contributor. CEO Chris McCann stated, “…our Fannie May business recorded positive same store sales as well as solid eCommerce growth, reflecting the success of the initiatives we have implemented to enhance its performance.” While McCann doesn’t go into specifics, we assume that initiatives include the implementation of GWYN, which also seems to be supported by CB Insights’ finding: 70% of customers ordering through the chat bot were new 1-800-Flowers customers as of June 2016. Key takeaways: How can we encourage additional customer purchases while they shop? Train a system to “read a customer’s mind” by gathering key information points and intuiting complimentary products and services. Use chatbots to help personalize the customer experience and invite return purchases, increasing customer lifetime value.   3 – LV=Broker: *“aLVin” Company description: LV= is a UK-based provider of financial products and services; its LV=Broker division offers a range of commercial and personal lines products for third-party brokers. How it’s being used: aLVin is built on the foundation of Nuance’s Nina, the intelligent multichannel virtual assistant that leverages natural language understanding (NLU) and cognitive computing capabilities. aLVin interacts with brokers to better understand “intent” and deliver the right information 24/7; the chatbot was built with extensive knowledge of LV=Broker’s products, which accelerated the process of being able to answer more questions and direct brokers to the right products early on aLVin’s live chat service overlaps when needed with human support representatives. Over time, LV= envisions a more collaborative relationship between the virtual assistant and the human support agents, which will help increase the number of transactional tasks that aLVin can assist with and allow service agents to handle more complex tasks Value proposition: Select quotes are borrowed from Computing’s interview with Head of Personal Lines Operations Alan Hickman. Alan Hickman noted that after the pilot, 98% of brokers said that they would use the service if offered full-time. LV= also benefitted as a larger company. According to Hickman, “Over the (trial) period, the volume of calls from broker partners reduced by 91 per cent…that means is aLVin was able to provide a final answer in around 70 per cent of conversations with the user, and only 22 per cent of those conversations resulted in [needing] a chat with a real-life agent.” Key takeaways: How can our business streamline tasks for professionals in a target industry? LV=’s Broker division wanted to be able to deliver important information conveniently to brokers 24/7. Are there areas where we could automate simpler customer requests (frequently asked questions/tasks) and reserve human capital for more sensitive or complicated demands? *Our search turned up little recent information (the chatbot was introduced in June 2015), and while aLVin appeared to be a fruitful addition, it’s unclear “he” or a successor are still in use by LV=   4 – H&M: The Official H&M Chatbot  Company Description: H&M is a global fashion company that promote sustainable materials and human labor How it’s being used: The purpose of H&M’s chatbot is to help mobile customers navigate their search through outfit possibilities and guide you to the online store areas that align with your purchase desires. H&M’s chatbot leverages the following information and responds differently based on provided information:
Defines your gender and style Suggests outfits and the total price for all items If you dislike the suggested outfit, the chatbot will select a different outfit If you like the outfit, the chat provides some options: shop – direct link to the H&M internet shop; save – archive your outfit; share – via social networks, email, etc.; next outfit –  provides a new outfit suggestion Value proposition: H&M’s consistent increased sales over the past year and its August announcement to launch an eCommerce presence in Canada and South Korea during the fall of 2016, along with 11 new H&M online markets (for a total of 35 markets by the end of the year), appear to signify positive results for its chatbot implementation (though direct correlations are unavailable on its website). Key takeaways: How can our business leverage technology to better and more often engage younger audiences with our products and services? H&M is one of several retailers experimenting with and leveraging chatbots as a  mobile marketing opportunity – according to a report by Accenture, 32 percent of the world (a large portion of the population 29 years old and younger) uses social media daily and 80 percent of that time is via mobile.   5 – Amtrak: “Julie”  Company description: The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) provides rail passenger services for customers in the 48 contiguous U.S. states. How it’s being used: Julie, a newer version of Amtrak’s original telephone-based customer service agent, is designed to guide users through Amtrak.com using natural language capabilities and a broad knowledge-base of the site In addition to responding through text, Julie can vocalize “her” answer alongside a written response Julie can provide or help customers find information on making a reservation, getting more information on Amtrak’s rewards program, finding station and route information, and a variety of other areas Value proposition: According to nextIT (Julie’s product platform), implementation of Julie resulted in the following:
25 percent more bookings $1 million in customer service email costs saved annually 50 percent year-over-year growth in users’ engagement with Julie 30 percent more revenue (monthly average) generated per booking Key takeaways: Is there a way to evolve or augment existing technology to make it more engaging and useful for customers? Instead of ditching Julie the telephone rep, Amtrak expanded “her” presence by implementing a more responsive chatbot. Do the nature of our services and size of our customer base warrant an investment in a more efficient and automated customer service response? How can we offer a more streamlined experience without (necessarily) increasing costly human resources?  Amtrak’s website receives over 375,000 daily visitors, and they wanted a solution that provided users with instant access to online self-service.   6 – FirstJob: “Mya”  Company description: FirstJob is an online-based recruiting firm that matches recent college graduates with entry-level jobs and internships by leveraging their existing social networks. How it’s being used: Mya is an A.I. recruiting assistant that manages large candidate pools, giving FirstJob recruiters and hiring managers more time to focus on interviews and closing offers Mya can talk to thousands of candidates at once through SMS, Facebook, Skype, email, or chat Mya asks prescreen questions; responds to FAQs; delivers application progress updates; gives tips and guidance to candidates; alerts candidates when a position has been filled; and administers assessments and challenges Mya also provides useful information for recruiters and managers, ranking candidates from most qualified to least based on weighted factors like experience, recent activity, engagement, and other metrics Value proposition: According to FirstJob, Mya automates up to 75 percent of the qualifying and engagement process. As reported by Forbes, studies suggest that Mya improves recruiter efficiency by 38 percent and increases candidate engagement by over 150 percent. Key takeaways: Select quotes are borrowed from Forbes’ interview with CEO and Co-founder Eyal Grayevsky. Can we provide a better way of doing business that transforms an arduous “elephant-in-the-room” process or task into one that allows all involved parties to stay active and engaged? As stated by Grayevsky, “I saw a huge opportunity to design a technology platform for both job seekers and employers that could fill the gaping ‘black hole’ in recruitment and deliver better results to both sides.”   7 – TouchCommerce: “TouchAssist”  Company description: TouchCommerce serves many Fortune 500 companies with customer engagement tools like livechat and FAQs; the company was acquired by Nuance in August 2016. How it’s being used: TouchAssist’s natural language and cognitive computing capabilities allow it to interact with customers and offer a “self-serve” experience (TouchAssist is consciously referred to by the company as a virtual assistant, not a chatbot) A live chat agent is available on standby if TouchAssist is unable to answer a question/provide the appropriate level of service TouchAssist leverages existing transcript data and other information from its consumer interactions to continuously improve the usability and user experience Virtual assistant and live chat engagements are visible and accessible from the same user window TouchAssist is compatible with multiple devices, including desktop, tablet, mobile browser, in-app and SMS Value proposition: TouchAssist responds to repetitive questions, freeing up about 80% of human agents’ time to work on other tasks, and reduces the average handle time of customer interactions overall. Key takeaways: What areas of our customer engagement process could benefit from lessening or eliminating unnecessary human interaction? According to TouchCommerce, 84% of customers polled prefer to use self-service to get what they need.   Image credit: App Developer Magazine Related Posts Use Cases of AI for Customer Service - What's Working NowArtificial Intelligence is currently being deployed in customer service to both augment and replace human… AI for Fraud Detection in Retail - 2 Powerful Use CasesLeading retailers - like Walmart, Stop & Shop, and Home Depot - are enhancing their payment… The Chatbot Landscape - 20 Chatbot Applications Across IndustriesChatbots are one of the most talked-about uses of natural language processing (NLP) software in… Machine Learning in Martech - Current Use CasesMoore Stephens estimated the size of the marketing technology or martech industry around $24 billion… How AI-Enabled Product Recommendations Work - A Brief OverviewMany AI vendor companies offer AI-enabled products and services for pushing more and more products… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.

Companies such as DeepMind have captivated our attention. We have been wowed by developments in areas such as computer vision, machine translation and speech recognition.In 2020, AI will begin to live up to the hype by starting to generate real economic value through its application across industries. According to consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, the widespread adoption of AI will add about $15.7 trillion (£12.8 trillion) to global GDP by 2030. Most of that business value will come not from AI-focused companies, but from the infusion of artificial intelligence into traditional industries. Early movers who embrace AI will become the winners.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTOne defining area of AI infusion is in the automation of repetitive tasks, using technologies such as RPA (robotic process automation). RPA will see widespread application in the work performed by functions such as accounts payable, back-office processing and various forms of data management. Routine tasks associated with a large number of jobs will now lend themselves to automation, freeing up people’s time to focus on more complex endeavours. RPA is already creating some of the most valuable AI companies in the world.Trending NowReview: Apple iPhone 13Another similar area of routine task replacement is the use of speech recognition and natural-language processing in customer service, telemarketing and telesales. New advances in these technologies allow 80 per cent of queries to a call centre to be dealt with through automated processes, while achieving higher customer satisfaction.In addition to optimising existing processes, in 2020 we will see new applications for AI across existing industries. Retail stores will use AI to forecast demand and sales, as well as to reshape logistics and the supply chain. AI will also help maximise throughput and minimise costs in manufacturing and agriculture.In 2020, healthcare will start to be significantly transformed by AI. While it will take several decades for AI to be fully integrated into the medical process, it is in 2020 that we will start to fully grasp AI’s potential for improving our quality of life. Expect strides to be made in the application of smart AI tools in radiology, pathology and diagnosis – leading to better treatment, faster recuperation, and lower cost. Unlike RPA and speech recognition, these tools will not replace humans, but will help them be more productive.AdvertisementAI will bring personalisation to many other areas too, including banking, insurance, loans and investment. We have already seen personal recommendations of news, content and merchandise, and we will see this continue to expand.And in education we will see AI being used to give and grade homework and exams, and to guide students through various exercises. This will free up teachers’ time to focus on students’ personal and emotional development, in areas such as resilience, empathy, creativity and compassion – qualities that will be critical to the new generations’ ability to thrive and adapt in the age of AI. In 2020, we will see AI, though still incredibly complex, start to become part and parcel of problem-solving across our lives.Kai-Fu Lee is CEO of Sinovation VenturesThis article was originally published by WIRED UKEnter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

Retail stores will use AI to forecast demand and sales, as well as to reshape logistics and the supply chain. AI will also help maximise throughput and minimise costs in manufacturing and agriculture.
In 2020, healthcare will start to be significantly transformed by AI. While it will take several decades for AI to be fully integrated into the medical process, it is in 2020 that we will start to fully grasp AI’s potential for improving our quality of life. Expect strides to be made in the application of smart AI tools in radiology, pathology and diagnosis – leading to better treatment, faster recuperation, and lower cost. Unlike RPA and speech recognition, these tools will not replace humans, but will help them be more productive.
AI will bring personalisation to many other areas too, including banking, insurance, loans and investment. We have already seen personal recommendations of news, content and merchandise, and we will see this continue to expand.
And in education we will see AI being used to give and grade homework and exams, and to guide students through various exercises. This will free up teachers’ time to focus on students’ personal and emotional development, in areas such as resilience, empathy, creativity and compassion – qualities that will be critical to the new generations’ ability to thrive and adapt in the age of AI. In 2020, we will see AI, though still incredibly complex, start to become part and parcel of problem-solving across our lives.

Artificial Intelligence may be just the thing to accelerate spray-on solar cell technology, which could revolutionize how consumers use energy.
A research team at the University of Central Florida used Machine Learning, aka Artificial Intelligence to optimize the materials used to make perovskite solar cells (PSC). The Organic-Inorganic halide perovskites material used in PSC converts photovoltaic power into consumable energy.
These perovskites can be processed in solid or liquid state, offering a lot of flexibility. Imagine being able to spray or paint bridges, houses and skyscrapers with the material, which would then capture light, turn it into energy and feed it into the electrical grid. Until now, the solar cell industry has relied on silicon because of its efficiency. But that’s old technology with limits. Using perovskites, however, has one big barrier. They are difficult to make in a usable and stable material. Scientists spend a lot of time trying to find just the right recipe to make them with all the benefits – flexibility, stability, efficiency and low cost. That’s where artificial intelligence comes in.
The team’s work is so promising that its findings are the cover story Friday, Dec. 13 in the Advanced Energy Materials journal.
The team reviewed more than 2,000 peer-reviewed publications about perovskites and collected more than 300 data points then fed into the AI system they created. The system was able to analyze the information and predict which perovskites recipe would work best.
“Our results demonstrate that machine learning tools can be used for crafting perovskite materials and investigating the physics behind developing highly efficient PSCs,” says Jayan Thomas, the study’s lead author and an associate professor at the NanoScience Technology Center with multiple affiliations. “This can be a guide to design new materials as evidenced by our experimental demonstration.”
If this model bears out, it means researchers could identify the best formula to create a world standard. Then spray-on solar cells may happen in our lifetime, the researchers say.
“This is a promising finding because we use data from real experiments to predict and obtain a similar trend from the theoretical calculation, which is new for PSCs. We also predicted the best recipe to make PSC with different bandgap perovskites,” says Thomas and his graduate student, Jinxin Li, who is the first author of this paper. “Perovskites have been a hot research topic for the past 10 years, but we think we really have something here that can move us forward.”
Others on the research team include: Basudev Pradhan from the NanoScience Technology Center and Surya Gaur from the College of Engineering and Computer Science. Pradhan is currently a faculty member at Centre of Excellence in Green and Efficient Energy Technology, at the Central University of Jharkhand in India
Thomas joined UCF in 2011 and is a part of the NanoScience Technology Center with a joint appointment in the College of Optics and Photonics and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering in the College of Engineering. His previous work resulted in a variety of innovations, including material that could help keep pilots and sensitive equipment safe from destructive lasers, a way to both transmit and store electricity in a lightweight copper wire, and filaments that harvest and store the sun’s energy and can be woven into textiles.
Previously, Thomas was at the University of Arizona in its College of Optical Sciences. He has several degrees including a doctorate in chemistry/materials science from Cochin University of Science and Technology in India. He’s published dozens of studies and earned several grants and awards including a National Science Foundation CAREER Grant and an R&D 100 award.

Artificial Intelligence Is Going To Make America's F-35 and B-2 Even Stronger
The future is now.

by Kris Osborn



 


Key point: ​Faster, more capable processors will enable the aircraft’s avionics, radar, sensors and communications technologies to better identify and attack enemy targets.

(Washington, D.C.) Fighter jets will control attack drones from the cockpit, bombers will avert air defenses and real-time intelligence data will be available to attacking forces more quickly -- all due to new iterations of fast-evolving Artificial Intelligence technologies. 

Faster computer processors, AI-infused algorithms able to merge or “fuse” sensor information and automated maintenance and checklists are informing emerging pilot tactics aimed at anticipating future threat environments. Various applications of AI now perform a wide range of functions not purely restricted to conventional notions of IT or cyberspace; computer algorithms are increasingly able to almost instantaneously access vast pools of data, compare and organize information and perform automated procedural and analytical functions for human decision-makers. When high-volume, redundant tasks are performed through computer automation, humans are freed up to expend energy pursuing a wider range of interpretive or conceptual work.
“The bottom line is the next big thing that is going to enable the US to maintain its qualitative edge is the seamless and ubiquitous sharing of information. Aircraft are going to be part of a sensor-shooter-effector-maneuver ISR complex,” said Ret. Lt. Gen. David Deptula, Dean of the The Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies and Warrior Contributor.





For the F-35 and B-2, for instance, rapid database access, organizing information and performing high-volume procedural functions are all decided advantages of AI applications. Algorithms, for example, are increasingly able to scan, view and organize targeting, ISR and sensor input such as navigation information, radar warning information, images or video.

The F-35, for instance, uses early iterations of artificial intelligence to help acquire, organize and present information to the pilot on a single screen without much human intervention. Often referred to as easing the cognitive burden upon pilots, the effort is geared toward systematically presenting information from a range of disparate sensors on a single screen. The F-35s widely-discussed sensor fusion, for example, is evidence of this phenomenon, as it involves consolidating targeting, navigation and sensor information for pilots.
In the near future, F-35 pilots will be able to leverage AI to control a small group of drones flying nearby from the aircraft cockpit in the air, performing sensing, reconnaissance and targeting functions. At the moment, the flight path, sensor payload and weapons disposal of airborne drones such as Air Force Predators and Reapers are coordinated from ground control stations.

For instance, real-time video feeds from the electro-optical/infrared sensors on board an Air Force Predator, Reaper or Global Hawk drone could go directly into an F-35 cockpit, without needing to go to a ground control station. This could speed up targeting and tactical input from drones on reconnaissance missions in the vicinity of where a fighter pilot might want to attack. In fast-moving combat circumstances involving both air-to-air and air-to-ground threats, increased speed could make a large difference.
“F-35 are already relying on AI. As we go to the future the Air Force will start to incorporate loyal wingmen - - autonomously contributing aircraft. There is going to be a huge potential for AI, not only in terms of weapons but in terms of being able to operate as an extension of the manned aircraft,” Deptula said.
An F-35 computer system, Autonomic Logistics Information System, involves early applications of artificial intelligence wherein computers make assessments, go through checklists, organize information and make some decisions by themselves - without needing human intervention.
The computer, called ALIS, makes the aircraft's logistics tail more automated and is able to radio back information about engine health or other avionics. A single, secure information environment provides users with up-to-date information on any of these areas using web-enabled applications on a distributed network, a statement from ALIS- builder Lockheed Martin says. ALIS serves as the information infrastructure for the F-35, transmitting aircraft health and maintenance action information to the appropriate users on a globally-distributed network to technicians worldwide, the statement continues.​
The prospect of using advanced algorithms and on-board computers to quickly perform a range of aircraft functions, while enabling human decision makers in a role of command and control, is further explored in a research paper from a London-based think tank called “Chatam House- Royal Institute of International Affairs.”
The 2017 essay, titled “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Warfare,” explains how fighter and bomber pilot “checklists” can be enabled by AI as “cognitive-aiding tools.”
“…pilots rely significantly on procedures to help them manage the complexity of various tasks. For instance, when a fire-light illuminates or another subsystem indicates a problem, pilots are trained to first stabilize the aircraft (a skill) but then turn to the manual to determine the correct procedure (rule following). Such codified procedures are necessary since there are far too many solutions to possible problems to be remembered,” the Chatam House paper writes.
Given this scenario, AI-enabled on-board computers could massively change this equation by performing some of these described key procedural functions autonomously. This not only lowers pilot workload, but frees up pilot “cognition” to focus on more pressing, mission critical tasks.
The Air Force’s stealthy B-2 bomber is yet another example; the aircraft is receiving a new flight management control processor which increases the performance of the avionics and on-board computer systems by about 1,000-times, Air Force officials said.
The upgrade is a quantum improvement over the legacy system, providing over a thousand times the processor throughput, memory, and network speed, according to senior Air Force leaders. The new processor will help automated navigation programs and expedite the B-2s “fly-by-wire” technology – all of which are designed to enable a pilot to expend energy upon the most pressing combat tasks with less intervention.
​Faster, more capable processors will enable the aircraft’s avionics, radar, sensors and communications technologies to better identify and attack enemy targets. The sensor-to-shooter time will be greatly reduced, allowing the B-2 to launch weapons much more effectively, therefore reducing its exposure to enemy attacks.
Although built in the 1980s, the B-2 is a digital airplane which uses what’s called a “glass cockpit” for flight controls and on-board systems.​
The upgrade involves the re-hosting of the flight management control processors, the brains of the airplane, onto much more capable integrated processing units. This results in the laying-in of some new fiber optic cable as opposed to the mix bus cable being used right now – because the B-2’s computers from the 80s are getting maxed out and overloaded with data, Air Force officials told Warrior.
Additional computer-based B-2 upgrades include the now-in-development Defensive Management System, an emerging sensor system engineered to identify the location of enemy air defenses. This system, called DMS, uses computer empowered sensor technology to inform B-2 crews about where air defenses are. This not only increases mission efficiency and safety but also helps ensure that B-2 stealth bomber missions remain effective and relevant for years to come. This is yet another instance wherein computer automation can increase air-attack efficiency by using algorithms to get pilots critical, real-time information.

According to recent data from LinkedIn, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Data Analytics amongst the top skillsets being favorited by employers in the country. Moreover, soft skills like customer service and partnership management also are much in demand..Earlier this week, LinkedIn, a business and employment-oriented service network, issued its list of top 15 emerging jobs in Singapore, wherein AI specialists rank at the top. The list further includes robotics engineers, full stack engineers, backend developers and data scientists who also led the pack after AI specialists. On the other hand, cybersecurity specialists and e-commerce specialists also made the list, with soft skills such as customer success specialists and creative copywriters..Considering reports, Singapore shares over 2 million LinkedIn profiles on the network. To create the top 15 emerging jobs, the professional service network assessed data of members with a public profile and who held a full-time position in Singapore over the past five years. Afterward, it scaled out the share of hiring and the average growth rate for each profession between 2015 and 2019 to find out roles that presented the largest growth..Vice President of LinkedIn's talent and learning solutions for Asia-Pacific, Feon Ang said &quot;Singapore's continued commitment to becoming a digital nation has led to continued demand for some of the fastest-growing jobs in our workforce. This also underscores the rise of data experts with a strong focus on technology.&quot;.In the country, the e-commerce sector had seen momentous growth, amplified demand for roles that knotted the realms of marketing and digital technology, LinkedIn noted. The e-commerce specialists were tasked to develop a digital and mobile ecosystem where customers could be learned and grown, compelling online sales for their organisation..However, the biggest skills gap is ultimately soft skills, according to Ang. &quot;Digitisation and automation have opened doors for more jobs that require creativity and interpersonal skills to help make sense of data and technology,&quot; she said..LinkedIn also revealed that TensorFlow, machine learning, Python and computer vision as skillsets professionals would need. It listed Python for Data Science Essential Training, Machine Learning and AI Foundations, and Learning Hadoop as some of the top learning courses on its platform. It also noted the roles in e-commerce would have to own skillsets in digital marketing, social media marketing and business development..To drive capabilities in the local sector, the Singapore government has already established a programme, called AI Singapore. The country, last month, launched a national AI strategy which aimed at tapping the technology to develop economic value, improve citizen lives, and arm its workforce with the essential skillsets. With this launch, Singapore's key goal is to pave the way for the city-state to be a leader in developing and deploying scalable, impactful AI solutions in key verticals by 2030..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
