Why American Special Forces are on the Cutting Edge of Artificial Intelligence Technology
SOCOM is partnering with the private industry and academia to improve its Artificial Intelligence capabilities.

by Stavros Atlamazoglou



 



Here's What You Need to Know: SOCOM has been a pioneer in the application of Artificial Intelligence. For example, the Naval Special Warfare Command (WARCOM) has been using Artificial Intelligence to find ways to make its SEAL and Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen (SWCC) operators more combat effective, while the Marines Special Operations Command (MARSOC) has been implementing Artificial Intelligence to better select and assess its future cadre of Marine Raiders.

Artificial Intelligence is everywhere today. From Amazon’s Alexa to unmanned aerial vehicles to space crafts to health care; Artificial Intelligence enables faster and better decisions if employed properly. 

The U.S. military and intelligence community have been using this technology for decades now and it’s becoming increasingly more prevalent. With the apparent return of Great Power Competition—the struggle for influence, leverage, and resources between the U.S. and its near-peer competitors China and Russia—the special operations community, the tip of the spear of the U.S. military, has been investing more in Artificial Intelligence technologies
What is Artificial Intelligence?





In short, Artificial Intelligence utilizes computers and machine learning to simulate the human mind’s problem-solving and decision-making capabilities, easing the cognitive load on humans, enabling quicker decision-making and follow-on actions.

Nowadays, in an age of information overload, the issue the military and intelligence community have to deal with isn’t having too little data to work with as it once may have been, but rather how to process all of the available data to find and utilize what is important quickly and efficiently.

That is where Artificial Intelligence, as a filtering and selection mission-planning tool, can come in and sift out the data that is just noise to provide commanders, decision-makers, and troops with the only information they need to do their job. It’s a tall order, for sure, but doable with the right approach and priorities.
Artificial Intelligence & Special Operations
General Richard Clarke, SOCOM’s commander, has emphasized the importance of Artificial Intelligence and cyberwarfare, going as far as to suggest that the future of U.S. special operations might not be with the Delta Force operator on the ground but rather with the cyber commando behind a keyboard.
Within the Department of Defense, SOCOM has been a pioneer in the application of Artificial Intelligence. For example, the Naval Special Warfare Command (WARCOM) has been using Artificial Intelligence to find ways to make its SEAL and Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen (SWCC) operators more combat effective, while the Marines Special Operations Command (MARSOC) has been implementing Artificial Intelligence to better select and assess its future cadre of Marine Raiders.

“Artificial Intelligence should assist a commander or operator to make better decisions, not make the decisions for them, and that’s where I think a lot of people get it mixed,” Herm Hasken a partner and senior operations consultant at MarkPoint Technologies, told Sandboxx News.

Hasken has several combat deployments and extensive special operations and intelligence community experience, including time with the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), National Security Agency (NSA), as well as the chief cryptologist for the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).
MarkPoint Technologies provides body-worn sensors that process and distribute signals detected in the proximity of the operator to U.S. government partners. Such advanced computing introduced in the tactical domain gives an advantage to special operators and makes them more effective.
“In some cases, Artificial Intelligence might help you process and act upon very simple tasks in order to reduce the cognitive load on the operator—doing some things for you, so you won’t spend time worrying about it, receiving data and making sense of it in the midst of a deluge of data coming at you,” Hasken added.

SOCOM is partnering with the private industry and academia to improve its Artificial Intelligence capabilities. An online course collaboration between SOCOM and MIT is part of this outreach effort. In the launching of the course, Clarke said that Artificial Intelligence and data-driven technology are integral parts of SOCOM’s preparation to maintain its qualitative advantage over its competitors and also to ensure that its commandos are ready for renewed Great Power Competition. 
A Precarious Edge
However, SOCOM, and indeed the Pentagon, are having trouble attracting top talent. In a recent Global SOF Foundation forum, Joint Artificial Intelligence Center Chief Technical Officer Nand Mulchandani said that pay, location, and the necessary inconveniences that come with military life—he offered a personal example of him having to fly from California to Washington D.C. to work because that is where a secured computer with access to a classified network is located—hamstring recruiting efforts. And although that has always been true about the military, it is slightly different when recruiting individuals with high-value skills and not just grunts or box kickers.
“SOCOM and JSOC need more data analytics and processing. Take for example the Iron Dome system in Israel. The only data it needs is that a missile is in the air, heading toward Israel, and where it can intercept and destroy it. That’s the only AI it needs. To detect, see, and stop it. If the AI can do the same for an operator, that’s the AI I want. I need to basically perform the same function: what’s coming after me, where do I meet it, and how do I stop it?” Hasken added.

Artificial Intelligence isn’t without vulnerabilities, both internal and external. Enemy tampering and attacks can hamper weapon systems and technology that rely on Artificial Intelligence, while a simple coding error or data oversight can have the same result, with potentially grave consequences for the troops on the ground. For example, a programmer can train Artificial Intelligence to look for specific faces of people for targeting purposes but small, intentional changes to those faces might mislead it, even if humans wouldn’t readily notice the difference.
To maintain a military edge over its near-peer competitors, the U.S. military and its special operations forces need to continue to invest in Artificial Intelligence but also have realistic aims that will translate into operational and tactical advantages on the ground.

How to Use Artificial Intelligence for Chronic Disease Management 


Artificial intelligence supports efficiency in disease diagnosis, medical decisions, and treatment as part of effective chronic disease management.

Published: 22 Dec 2021


 
Over the past two decades, the United States has seen a significant increase in chronic disease among the population. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, six in ten adults in the US have a chronic disease and four in ten adults have two or more.  







By 2025, it is estimated that nearly half of the country’s population will be impacted by chronic disease. Currently, the most prevalent conditions are heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. As these illnesses impact more of the population, researchers are advancing the development of treatment options.  
Many researchers and physicians are turning their attention to artificial intelligence capabilities to speed up the diagnosis process, assist in medical decisions, and provide treatment sooner. By engaging in AI, medical professionals could see improvements in early intervention and patient outcomes for those with heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.  

Using AI to treat heart disease 
At several organizations, researchers are taking steps to advance cardiovascular medicine using artificial intelligence.  
Hospitals and researcher centers will use AI to program computers to process and respond to data quickly and accurately to provide better treatment outcomes. Programs can conduct tasks including detecting heart disease, treating strokes, and enhancing diagnostic radiology capabilities. 
At Johns Hopkins University, researchers explored the use of whole-heart computational models to better understand ventricular arrhythmias. According to the research team, whole-heart computational modeling can lead to personalized medicine. 
“Personalized computational modeling of patient hearts is making strides developing models that incorporate the individual geometry and structure of the heart, as well as other patient-specific information,” co-author and professor of biomedical engineering and medicine at Johns Hopkins University, Natalia Trayanova, said in a press release. 
According to researchers, patient-specific models can also use predictive analytics to determine the risk of sudden cardiac death or the outcomes of a cardiac procedure. 
“Patient-specific models are also used for determining the optimal treatment for arrhythmia, both atrial and ventricular, with the latter often based on different biophysical underpinnings,” said Trayanova. 
 “These types of models can enable fast evaluation of medical device settings and patient-​selection criteria, as well as the development of novel therapeutic agents.” 
By pursuing the development of whole-heart computational models, researchers can enhance personalized treatment and risk predictions. Additionally, the model can work collaboratively with artificial intelligence to improve patient outcomes. 
 At Mayo Clinic, the organization provides three examples of recent ways doctors implemented AI research into clinical practice: 

Helping patients following a stroke: In emergency rooms, when patients come in with a stroke called an intracerebral hemorrhage, they undergo a CT scan. That scan is examined by a computer trained to analyze CT data, cutting the time to diagnosis and limiting brain damage. 
Preventing heart problems:  Applying AI to ECGs has resulted in a low-cost test that can be widely used to detect the presence of a weak heart pump, which can lead to heart failure if left untreated. Mayo Clinic is well situated to advance this use of AI because it has a database of more than 7 million ECGs. First, all identifying patient information is removed to protect privacy. Then this data can be mined to accurately predict heart failure noninvasively, inexpensively, and within seconds. 
Detecting atrial fibrillation sooner: AI-guided ECGs are also used to detect faulty heart rhythms before any symptoms are evident. 



AI in cancer detection and treatment 
There has been a recent expansion of providers using AI for cancer detection. At Tulane University, researchers discovered that  AI can accurately detect and diagnose colorectal cancer by analyzing tissue scans as well or better than pathologists. 
The researchers gathered over 13,000 images of colorectal cancer from 8,803 subjects and 13 independent cancer centers in China, Germany, and the United States. Then, using images that technicians selected at random, the researchers built a machine learning program. 
The program can recognize images of colorectal cancer, which according to researchers, is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in Europe and the US. 
After developing the performance measurement tool, the researchers compared the machine learning technique to the work done by the pathologists. The study indicated that the average pathologist scored around 0.969 for accuracy when identifying colorectal cancer, while the program scored 0.98, proving to be slightly more accurate than the manual data by pathologists. 
Artificial intelligence can also assist in deciding the best course of treatment for patients. For patients with cancer, researchers can use predictive analytics to determine how an individual will respond to a certain medication. 
Not every patient will have the same response to medications,  so machine learning and predictive analytics can also prevent unnecessary side effects from cancer treatments that may not work for the patient. 
The Georgia Institute of Technology and Ovarian Cancer Institute researchers used machine learning algorithms to determine how their patients would respond to cancer-fighting drugs. 
For the study, professor at the School of Biological, John F. McDonald, and his team created predictive machine learning-based models for 15 distinct cancer types, using data from 499 independent cell lines from the National Cancer Institute. 
The models were then validated with a clinical dataset containing seven chemotherapeutic drugs, administered either singularly or in combination to 23 ovarian cancer patients. The model showed an overall predictive accuracy of 91 percent. 
As artificial intelligence continues to grow in the healthcare space, more providers will utilize the technology to treat chronic diseases and lighten the load for physicians.  


Managing and preventing diabetes with AI 
Over the past several years, researchers have been investigating methods to use AI for diabetes management. Different strategies include self-management, remote patient monitoring, and support from wearable devices.  
In 2019, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute researchers conducted a studying using AI and big analytics to assess information from thousands of continuous glucose monitor insulin pumps. Those with Type 1 diabetes must test their blood sugar often to determine how much insulin they should infect using a needle or insulin pump.  
However, individuals can get a better idea of their blood sugar levels with continuous glucose monitors by offering blood sugar estimated every five minutes, without finger sticks. Data analysis allowed researchers to build models that can better predict the impact of meals and insulin on glucose levels, leading to better control of blood sugar levels. 
According to researchers, artificial intelligence has assisted in advancing diabetes care. AI-backed mobile health tools have demonstrated improvements in diabetes management, reducing the need for in-person appointments and patient-provider interaction.  
Artificial intelligence also plays an important role in diabetes prevention. According to research by Marshall University, the success of chronic disease prevention and population health management is dependent upon a provider’s ability to identify high-risk patients.  
With big data analytics and AI, practitioners can identify warning signs of illnesses promptly, allowing for a quick treatment turnaround and reducing costs. Providers can identify early signs of Ttype 2 diabetes using risk prediction models.  
To prevent disease progression, physicians can encourage patients to engage in early intervention strategies including, increasing exercise and striving to make healthy food choices.  
As researchers learn more about artificial intelligence capabilities, technology is growing as a tool for effective chronic disease management and prevention.

Early efforts in the field resulted in the development of new tools for solving mathematical problems.






What Is Artificial Intelligence?Artificial Intelligence (AI) simply means intelligence in machines, in contrast to natural intelligence found in humans and other natural organisms. Artificial intelligence gained its name and became a formal field of research in 1956, and initial work led to new tools for solving mathematical problems. However, researchers discovered that creating an AI is incredibly difficult, and progress slowed in the 1970s. More recently, increases in computing power and availability of massive data sets have set the groundwork for advances in AI.In particular, scientists have made giant strides in one particular application of AI, machine learning. Machine learning involves systems that automatically learn from the data they analyze and the results they obtain to improve their ability to work with that data in the future. For example, machine learning powers applications that estimate how long a trip will take and then provide guidance on the route. Applications such as Google Maps use machine learning to analyze shifting traffic conditions and incorporate user-reported data to reduce travel times and suggest fuel-efficient routes. Machine learning is best for these types of specific, well-defined tasks that can be broken down into logical steps.Supercomputers like the Department of Energy’s Aurora at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility will help make artificial intelligence more and more powerful.

The next level of AI application is known as deep learning. Deep learning involves complex tasks with many hard to nail down variables. It makes use of neural networks, which seek to build computers that operate like our brains. Deep learning leverages many neural networks stacked on top of each other to create a large, complex neural network. Deep learning demands a lot of computing power to both train the model from copious amounts of data and use the trained models to make decisions. One example is digital assistants like Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant. Deep learning is what allows these assistants to listen to you and figure out what information you want or task you need them to perform.  Artificial Intelligence FactsOne of the ways we can understand advances in AI is how well it performs at games.In 2011, IBM’s Watson won the U.S. game show Jeopardy!In 2016, the Google DeepMind AlphaGo AI beat a human grandmaster at the complex Chinese game of Go.But humans say AI isn’t so good at games involving teamwork.DOE Office of Science: Contributions to Artificial IntelligenceThe Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program in the Department of Energy Office of Science (DOE SC) has been working on AI since the 1960s. ASCR developed several technologies—including massively parallel input/output systems and linear algebra routines—that led to today’s AI systems. More recently, ASCR’s role in high-performance computing and exascale computing will help build the hardware and software needed to power future generations of AI. The ASCR program also provides support to other DOE SC programs that are using AI to accomplish their goals. For example, the DOE SC Fusion Energy Science program is deploying AI to help control fusion reactions with the goal of making fusion energy production a commercial reality.

Credit: Rhett WymanDoctors at Macquarie University in Sydney believe they have found a way to close the gap on human error with a smart app that uses artificial intelligence to guide healthcare workers step-by-step through “donning” and “doffing” of PPE.The app, created by cardiothoracic surgeon Michael Wilson in collaboration with software developer Terry Carney, audits healthcare workers in real time, using facial recognition technology and a phone or computer camera to “observe” the process. When it detects an error, workers are blocked from proceeding to the next step unless they make a correction.“It checks that you put the gloves on properly or that the gown is actually on the hands with the thumb loops through, so that you’ve got each item of protective equipment appropriately donned or doffed,” Professor Wilson said. “As we get more and more sophisticated with the programming and the AI learns, we will be able to recognise droplets of infection on a gown and then message people to say you’ve got a potential contamination here, wipe with extra disinfectant before taking off the gown.” The app uses facial recognition technology to guide health workers through the proper donning and doffing of PPE.Credit:  Rhett WymanAs daily case numbers surge in NSW and Victoria, the risk of exposure to frontline workers has never being higher, and their absence from the workforce more keenly felt as hospitals shift to skeleton staff and a fresh rotation of medical interns over the summer months.NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said this week 1400 healthcare workers were out of action, furloughed because they had either contracted or been exposed to coronavirus. In Victoria, about 700 healthcare workers were absent, with a health department official confirming most were isolating due to potential exposure to COVID-19 in the community.AdvertisementFormer federal health department secretary Jane Halton, who served on the National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board, said the proper use of PPE was “absolutely fundamental” to preserving the health workforce and limiting the spread of infection.Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 0:00Loaded: 0%0:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -0:00 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

The app is already in use at Macquarie University hospital, where it is being used to train medical students and nursing staff. But the team is eager to roll it out more widely and in discussions with three other hospitals, two educational groups and an aged care facility. While the app is currently calibrated to a medical or aged care environment, Professor Wilson said there was potential for it to be applied across a range of industries which used PPE, such as food preparation and commercial settings.The app was developed, trialled and validated over the past 18 months at Macquarie University, with the PPE “steps” informed by guidelines that were developed by Johns Hopkins University in response to the Ebola pandemic and in line with NSW Health’s Clinical Excellence Commission standards. It also features privacy safeguards such as “scrubbing” facial features and other identifying details of the user before recording the data.Related ArticleExplainerCoronavirus pandemicHow do rapid antigen tests work and how reliable are they?Associate Professor Veronica Preda, who oversaw the trials of the app with final year student doctors Anand Jayapadman and Alexandra Zacharakis, said there were no standardised protocols for PPE procedure across hospitals, aged care or disability facilities, with places often relying on a “buddy” system to check for errors. The reality in a busy hospital, she said, was that nurses often did not have the time to perform this role.“It’s also about how much training have they had? How confident are they? And is this the best use of their skill set when we’ve already got a fatigued workforce that is task-saturated,” she said.Fascinating answers to perplexing questions delivered to your inbox every week.

It consists of virtual spaces that you can explore using an avatar you create. In the metaverse, you can play games, go shopping, hang out with friends at a virtual coffee shop, work with your colleagues in a virtual office, and much more. Some video games and work socialization tools have already implemented certain metaverse elements into their ecosystems.Cryptocurrency projects like Decentraland and The Sandbox already have their digital world up and running. However, the metaverse concept is relatively new, so most of its functionalities are still under development. Companies like Facebook (now Meta), Microsoft, and Nvidia have also started creating their versions of the metaverse.To offer an immersive metaverse virtual experience, tech companies are incorporating cutting-edge technologies to power the 3D world’s development. Such technologies include blockchain, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), 3D reconstruction, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of things (IoT).IntroductionThe idea of a metaverse originated from Neal Stephenson in 1992. His science fiction novel Snow Crash envisioned an online world where people could use digital avatars to explore and escape from the real world. Decades later, big technology companies have started to build their own versions of a futuristic metaverse. What is the metaverse, and how are big companies approaching it on the technology front?What is the metaverse?The metaverse is a concept of an online 3D digital world with virtual land and objects. Imagine a world in which you can work remotely, visit virtual museums to see the latest artworks, or join your fellow rock band fans at a virtual concert, all from the comfort of your home.Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, Decentraland have already incorporated certain aspects of the metaverse to bring multiple elements of our lives into online worlds. However, the metaverse is still under development. No one knows whether there will be just one big all-encompassing metaverse or multiple metaverses that you can travel around. As the idea continues to develop, it’s expected to expand beyond video games and social media platforms. Remote working, decentralized governance, and digital identity are just some of the potential features the metaverse can support. It can also become more multi-dimensional via connected VR headsets and glasses, so users can actually walk around physically to explore the 3D spaces.The latest development of the metaverseWith Facebook changing its name to Meta in October 2021, the metaverse became the new favorite buzzword. To cater for its rebranding, the social media giant poured resources into a new division called Reality Labs to spend at least 10 billion dollars in 2021. The idea is to develop metaverse content, software, as well as AR and VR headsets, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes will be as widespread as smartphones in the future.The COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated the interest in developing metaverses. There is an increased demand for more interactive ways to connect with others as more people have started working remotely. Virtual 3D spaces that let coworkers join meetings, catch up, and collaborate are on the rise. The Microsoft Mesh unveiled in November 2021 is an example. It features immersive spaces for users to mingle and collaborate using their avatars, making remote team meetings more engaging and fun.Some online games are embracing the metaverse as well. The AR mobile game Pokémon Go was among the first to tap into the concept by allowing players to hunt virtual Pokémons in the real world using a smartphone app. Fortnite, another popular game, has expanded its product to different activities inside its digital world, including hosting brand events and concerts. Apart from social media and gaming platforms, tech companies like Nvidia have opened new opportunities in virtual worlds. Nvidia Omniverse is an open platform designed to connect 3D spaces into a shared universe to facilitate virtual collaboration between engineers, designers, and creators. It's currently being used across different industries. For instance, the BMW Group is using the Omniverse to reduce production time and improve product quality by smart manufacturing.Key technologies that power the metaverseTo make the metaverse experience more immersive, companies are using cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), 3D reconstruction, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of things (IoT) to power the 3D world.Blockchain and cryptocurrencyBlockchain technology provides a decentralized and transparent solution for digital proof of ownership, digital collectibility, transfer of value, governance, accessibility, and interoperability. Cryptocurrencies enable users to transfer value while they work and socialize in the 3D digital world. For example, crypto can be used to buy virtual lands in Decentraland. Players can purchase 16x16 meter land parcels in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with the game’s cryptocurrency MANA. With the support of blockchain technology, the ownership of these virtual lands can be established and secured.In the future, crypto can potentially incentivize people to actually work in the metaverse. As more companies take their offices online for remote working, we might see metaverse-related jobs being offered.For a more in-depth exploration of these areas, check out What Is the Metaverse?. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can give us an immersive and engaging 3D experience. These are our entry points to the virtual world. But what’s the difference between AR and VR?AR uses digital visual elements and characters to morph the real world. It’s more accessible than VR and can be used on almost any smartphone or digital device with a camera. Through AR applications, users can view their surroundings with interactive digital visuals, similar to what we have in the mobile game Pokémon GO. When players open the camera on their phones, they can see Pokémons in the real-world environment.VR works differently. Much like the metaverse concept, it produces an entirely computer-generated virtual environment. Users can then explore it using VR headsets, gloves, and sensors.The way AR and VR work shows an early model of the metaverse. VR is already creating a digital world that incorporates fictional visual content. As its technology becomes more mature, VR can expand the metaverse experience to involve physical simulations with VR equipment. Users will be able to feel, hear and interact with people from other parts of the world. Considering the hype around the metaverse, we can expect more metaverse companies to invest in AR and VR equipment development in the near future.Artificial intelligence (AI)Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied in our lives in recent years: business strategy planning, decision making, facial recognition, faster computing, and more. More recently, AI experts have been studying the possibilities of applying AI to the creation of immersive metaverses. AI has the potential to process a lot of data at lightning speed. Combined with machine learning techniques, AI algorithms can learn from previous iterations, taking into account historical data to come up with unique outputs and insights. Within the metaverse, AI can be applied to the non-player characters (NPCs) in different scenarios. NPCs exist in almost every game; they are a part of the gaming environment designed to react and respond to players’ actions. With AI’s processing abilities, NPCs can be placed across the 3D spaces to facilitate lifelike conversations with users or perform other specific tasks. Unlike a human user, an AI NPC can run on its own and be used by millions of players at the same time. It can also work in several different languages.Another potential application for AI is in the creation of metaverse avatars. AI engines can be used to analyze 2D images or 3D scans to generate avatars that look more realistic and accurate. To make the process more dynamic, AI can also be used to create different facial expressions, hairstyles, clothes, and features to enhance the digital humans we create.3D reconstructionWhile this is not new technology, the use of 3D reconstruction has been rising during the pandemic, especially in the real estate industry, as lockdowns prevented potential buyers from visiting properties in person. Therefore, some agencies adopted 3D reconstruction technology to generate virtual property tours. Much like the metaverse we imagined, buyers could look around potential new homes from anywhere and make purchases without even having stepped foot inside.One of the challenges for the metaverse is to create a digital environment that appears as close to our real world as possible. With the help of 3D reconstruction, it can create realistic and natural-looking spaces. Through special 3D cameras, we can take our world online by rendering accurate 3D photorealistic models of buildings, physical locations, and objects. The 3D spatial data and 4K HD photography are then passed to computers to process and generate a virtual replica in the metaverse for users to experience. These virtual replicas of physical world objects can also be referred to as digital twins.Internet of things (IoT)The concept of the Internet of things (IoT) was first introduced in 1999. Simply put, IoT is a system that takes everything in our physical world and connects them to the Internet through sensors and devices. After connecting to the Internet, these devices will have a unique identifier and the ability to send or receive information automatically. Today, IoT is connecting thermostats, voice-activated speakers, medical devices, and much more to a wide range of data.One of the applications of IoT on the metaverse is to collect and provide data from the physical world. This would increase the accuracy of the digital representations. For example, IoT data feeds could change the way certain metaverse objects function based on the current weather or other conditions. Implementing IoT can seamlessly connect the 3D world to a large number of real-life devices. This enables the creation of real-time simulations in the metaverse. To further optimize the metaverse environment, IoT could also use AI and machine learning to manage the data it collects.Challenges of the metaverseThe metaverse is still in its early stages of development. Some challenges include identity authentication and privacy control. In the real world, it's often not difficult to identify someone. But as people traverse the digital world in their avatars, it will be difficult to tell or prove who the other person is. For example, malicious actors or even bots could enter the metaverse pretending to be someone else. They could then use this to damage their reputation or to scam other users.Another challenge is privacy. The metaverse relies on AR and VR devices to offer an immersive experience. These technologies with camera capabilities and unique identifiers could eventually lead to undesirable leaks of personal information.Closing thoughtsWhile the metaverse is still under development, many companies are already exploring its potential. In the crypto space, Decentraland and The Sandbox are notable projects, but big companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Facebook (ie. Meta) are also getting involved. As AR, VR, and AI technologies advance, we will likely see exciting new features in these virtual, borderless worlds.",Article,['https://public.bnbstatic.com/static/academy/uploads/c4bf67c7d8c54fc2b8c134c25fae5e0a.png'],,,2021-12-22T11:51:08.000Z,2023-06-15T07:48:49.000Z,Top 7 Technologies that Power the Metaverse,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Binance Academy'}",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Binance Academy', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://bin.bnbstatic.com/image/academy/apple-touch-icon.png'}}","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/top-7-technologies-that-power-the-metaverse'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<h2><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">How Will Artificial Intelligence Affect Workplaces And Lives In The Future?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">These days, artificial intelligence, or AI, appears to be on everyone's lips. While some have known about this crucial trend in tech growth for a while, but it's true, AI has become one of the most sought-after areas of knowledge for job seekers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Many of us associate the term ""<a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/startups/nishi/zindi-artificial-intelligence/"">AI</a>"" with sci-fi fantasies or worries of robots taking over the world. While no one can predict exactly how AI will develop in the future, current trends and developments paint a completely different picture of how AI will integrate into our lives.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">In actuality, AI is already at work in our environment, from the search results to the odds of finding love online to the way we shop is influenced by artificial intelligence. According to data, the use of AI in several commercial areas has increased by 270 per cent in the last four years.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">On the other hand, what will AI entail for the future of work? As <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/stories/ananya/the-challenge-to-teach-sign-language-to-computers-and-machines/"">computers</a> and technology have progressed, one of the most urgent questions. Like many other technological advancements throughout history, artificial intelligence's progress has sparked anxieties that human employees may become obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The reality is likely to be far less bleak but perhaps even more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-244316 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Artificial-Intelligence-600x400.jpg"" alt=""Artificial Intelligence"" width=""600"" height=""400"" /></span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">What is artificial intelligence (AI)?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Before we go into the intricacies of how AI will affect the future of employment, let's define AI. Artificial intelligence, as per Britannica, refers ""the capacity of a digital computer or computer-controlled machine to do tasks commonly associated with intelligent persons.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">""""Artificial intelligence"" becomes a catch all phrase for any computational advancement, systems, and technology that allows computer programmes to accomplish jobs or solve issues that require the kind of reasoning we associate with human intellect, including learning from previous operations.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI relies heavily on this ability to learn. Algorithms are usually linked to artificial intelligence, such as the infamous Facebook algorithm that replaced all of our friends with paid content. There is, nevertheless, an enormous difference.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">According to software journalist Kaya Ismail, an algorithm is just a ""collection of instructions"" or a method for processing data. AI takes this a step further, consisting of a set of algorithms that can adapt and rewrite themselves in reaction to the data inputted, thereby demonstrating ""intelligence.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Human workers are unlikely to become obsolete due to AI, at least not for a long time. To soothe some of your fears, robots are unlikely to take over your job very soon.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Given how artificial intelligence has been portrayed in the media, notably in some of our favourite science fiction films, it's understandable that its debut has spurred anxieties that AI would one day render humans obsolete in the workplace. After all, as technology has developed, many tasks previously handled by human hands have been automated. It's understandable to be anxious that advances in artificial intelligence will usher at the end of work as we know it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">However, there is not any reason to be so pessimistic. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force"">MIT Task Force</a> on the Future of Work recently produced a study titled ""Artificial Intelligence And The Future of Work,"" which examined AI breakthroughs and their impact on the workplace. The publication portrays a more upbeat picture.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Rather than advocating the abolition of human labour, the report predicts that AI will continue to drive significant innovation, fuel many existing businesses and potentially establish many new ones, resulting in the creation of additional jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">While artificial intelligence has made tremendous progress in duplicating human intellect's utility in completing specific tasks, it still has severe limits. AI algorithms, in particular, are frequently ""specialized,"" meaning they can only handle one problem or perform one task at a time. They are typically rigid, unable to adapt to changes in input or engage in any ""thinking"" beyond their pre-programmed boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Humans, on the other hand, have ""generalized,"" which includes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and critical judgment abilities that will remain useful in the business world. If not in every job, then at least at every level and throughout all industries, human judgment will be required.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Many other problems could limit AI's rapid growth. AI frequently necessitates ""learning,"" which might include large volumes of data, raising questions about the availability of the correct kind of data, as well as the requirement for categorized and security concerns. There's also the issue of computing and processing power limitations. One supercharged language model AI was expected to cost $4.6 million in electricity alone.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Another significant restriction is that data might be biased, reflecting social imbalances or the implicit prejudices of the designers who develop and enter the data. If bias in the data is fed into an AI, such discrimination will likely be carried over into the AI's output.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The Algorithmic Accountability Act was introduced in Congress to mandate the Federal Trade Commission to review the usage of any new AI technology for the potential to perpetuate bias.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The MIT CCI article claims that we are still a long way from reaching a stage when AI is similar to human intelligence and might theoretically replace human employees totally, based on these and other criteria.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI can create more employment, not fewer, if there is an investment at all levels, from education to the commercial sector and governmental organizations that focus on training and upskilling workers. Instead of ""people or computers,"" the question should be ""humans and computers"" involved in sophisticated systems that progress industry and wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">This paper is an exciting read for anyone interested in learning more about AI and the various routes it could take.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI has recently come up in conversation with a client or associate, and we all have seen a misconception in how people think about it. Many people believe that it is a phenomenon that will only have significant ramifications in the computer sphere.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The tech world has taken over the planet, if you haven't noticed. Never forget what economist Paul Krugman said in 1998: ""By 2005 or so, it will become evident that the Internet's economic impact has been no more than that of the fax machine."" You don't want to be behind the times when it comes to AI.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">In reality, 90 per cent of the world's most successful companies are already investing in AI. More than half of organizations that use AI-driven technology say they have seen increased productivity.</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-244315 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_jeannemeister_files_2017_02_shutterstock_568431658-copy-a-1200x1200-1-600x600.jpg"" alt=""Artificial Intelligence"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI is expected to have a significant impact on the following industries:</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Medical:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The advantages of employing AI in medicine are currently being researched. The medical industry has a lot of data that can be used to build prediction models for healthcare. AI has proven to be more effective than physicians in various diagnosis circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Automotive:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">With the start of autonomous vehicles and autonomous navigation, we're already seeing how AI is affecting the world of transportation and autos. AI will significantly impact production, particularly in the automotive industry. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Cybersecurity:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Cybersecurity is a top priority for many corporate leaders, especially given the expected increase in cybersecurity in 2020. Hackers targeted those who worked from home and had less secure technological equipment and Wi-Fi networks during the pandemic. In cybersecurity, AI and machine learning will be critical technologies for detecting and anticipating threats. Given its ability to analyze data and forecast and detect fraud, AI will be a crucial tool for financial security.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">E-Commerce:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">From user experience to marketing to fulfillment and distribution, AI will play a vital role in the future of e-commerce. Chatbots, shopper customization, targeted advertising, and warehouse and inventory automation, among other things, should all be expected to fuel e-commerce in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: initial;"">Artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly impact the job search process.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">You can be in for a rude awakening if you expect a hiring manager to overlook a tiny error on your application. AI already plays a significant part in the hiring process, with an automated applicant tracking system, or ATS, rejecting up to 75% of resumes before they even reach a human being.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Previously, recruiters had to filter through many resumes to discover qualified candidates. According to LinkedIn data, recruiters can spend up to 23 hours reviewing resumes for a single successful job.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">On the other hand, AI-powered systems are increasingly doing resume scanning. In 2018, 67 per cent of hiring managers said artificial intelligence (AI) made their work easier.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Despite the growing prominence of automation and algorithms in the hiring process, several have criticized the usage of specific types of AI, claiming that it can perpetuate and even increase bias in hiring.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">HireVue, for example, is a firm whose initial offerings featured technology that attempted to combine facial recognition technologies and psychology to estimate a candidate's future performance in a specific function. The Federal Trade Commission has received a complaint by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, claiming that this software could perpetuate bias and prejudice. In early 2021, HireVue stopped using facial recognition algorithms and relied on audio analysis and natural language processing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">As new technology develops, it's evident that the employment of certain types of AI in the recruiting process will be contentious. However, if potential employers are using AI to process your application, there's no reason you can't take advantage of the same technology.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Jobscan is an excellent resource for resume scanning comparable to what a hiring manager would do. Jobscan will provide you information on how to adjust your CV so that it is a good fit for a specific position by comparing it to a job description, with the purpose of ""beating"" an applicant tracking system (ATS). </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-244326 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5246fd70-6619-4c99-8d72-03875cac0f46-600x338.jpg"" alt=""artificial intelligence"" width=""600"" height=""338"" /></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Jobseer is a browser add-on that is another excellent AI-based tool for job seekers. Jobseer can assist match you with job listings that best fit your experience based on a scan of your resume, as well as keywords and skills connected to your preferred jobs. You'll get a grade for each listing based on how well you match the job description, as well as suggestions for skills to add to better position your CV and experience.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Rezi: As a caution, one would never recommend entrusting your resume writing to a robot. However, Rezi is a fantastic AI-based resume builder that contains templates to assist you in creating a resume that will tick all of the boxes for applicant tracking systems. This is an excellent place to start when creating a new resume. Another superb method to use this type of technology is to create a fresh resume and compare it to your current resume to see how it compares and where you can improve.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Assume you want to advance your career or improve your professional profile to be more marketable. In that situation, AI is an excellent place to focus your efforts because AI will have far-reaching implications across a wide range of businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI and machine learning are many essential skills in today's employment market. Jobs needing AI or machine-learning skills are expected to expand by 71% in five years.

In this tight, hot labor market, artificial intelligence is gaining attention as a compelling and effective way to improve the hiring process. Phenom, an Ambler, Pennsylvania-based company, effectively uses artificial intelligence to automate tasks and personalize job searches. 


Usually disruptive tech companies are found in Silicon Valley or major tech hubs. Phenom, based in a small town outside of Philadelphia, the startup has quietly become a billion-dollar unicorn.  

Phenom CEO Mahe Bayireddi said that his company relies upon AI to match people with the right jobs. This is achieved by helping companies find on-target talent at their companies and promoting them internally. Bayireddi says that his AI enables recruiters to find the right fits faster and job seekers searching for a new opportunity to find appropriate roles without wasting a lot of time. His goal is to find jobs for over one billion people.

PROMOTED
Instead of having one platform, its software is embedded into an array of job sites with some of the best and largest companies in the world. The career-tech company has 300 million users and one million jobs posted in 130 countries. With millions of pieces of data, Phenom is able to predict and guide job seekers to the roles that fit their background. 

Bayireddi spoke about the current job market, stating that the Great Resignation is a movement that shows the shifting demands and expectations of workers. Employees  are in pursuit of greater job flexibility and the desire to feel valued and appreciated.

These factors are as important—or even more important—than compensation. The employee experience should be top of mind for employers, if organizations want to keep and retain top talent. If they lag behind, they’ll see a lot of attrition and have trouble attracting new talent.

Here are some of the highlights
Hot Markets for Candidates Since June 2021 


Interest in retail jobs have increased 44.8%, and open retail jobs have also increased 67.2%.
Interest in IT jobs has increased 13.02%, and open IT jobs have also increased 11. 2%.
Interest in manufacturing jobs has increased 8.8%, while open manufacturing jobs have increased 12.35%.


Markets of Declining Candidate Interest Since June 2021 


Interest in HR jobs has decreased 27.5%, but open HR jobs have increased 60.9%.
Interest in hospitality jobs has decreased 10.3%, while open hospitality jobs have increased 15.4%.
Interest in healthcare jobs has decreased 2.2%, but open healthcare jobs have increased 19.2%.


Almost all sectors hired aggressively since June 2021, but the number of open healthcare (60.9%) and retail (67.2%) have soared. The plethora of job listings is due to a combination of being difficult jobs, with an inordinate amount of stress and pressure, and needing to endure difficult patients and customers respectively. 
Healthcare professionals had to risk their lives on a daily basis. For many, the pay wasn’t worth the health risks. We don’t talk about this enough—healthcare workers have been under unrelenting mental fatigue for having to tend to sick and dying patients at a rate we haven’t seen in modern history. It makes sense that there are many job openings with few takers.
Employees at retail stores, shops, department stores and in other customer facing businesses bore the brunt of an angry public. With fewer staff members, they were forced to work longer hours for low pay. In the Great Resignation movement, many retail workers decided to quit and pursue other opportunities that offer better pay and a chance for advancement.
On the positive side, these folks can use Phenom’s AI-driven job sites to see how their experiences, backgrounds and talent could be utilized in a different industry, job or career.

10 examples of AI in customer service


AI and AI-enhanced tools drive efficiency and cost reduction throughout the customer service team.

As the demand for an improved and personalized customer experience grows, organizations are turning to AI to help bridge the gap.
Advancements in AI continue to pave the way for increased efficiency across the organization -- particularly in customer service. Chatbots continue to be at the forefront of this change, but other technologies such as machine learning and interactive voice response systems create a new paradigm for what customers -- and customer service agents -- can expect. Not every piece of technology is right for every organization, but AI will be central to the future of customer service.







Here are 10 examples of the future of AI in customer service.

1. Chatbots
One of the most common uses of AI in customer service is chatbots. Businesses already use chatbots of varying complexity to handle routine questions such as delivery dates, balance owed, order status or anything else derived from internal systems. By transitioning these frequently asked questions to a chatbot, the customer service team can help more people and create a better experience overall -- while cutting operational costs for the company.


2. Agent assist
In many modern omnichannel contact centers, agent assist technology uses AI to automatically interpret what the customer is asking, search knowledge articles and display them on the customer service agent's screen while they're on the call. The process can save time for the agent and the customer, and it can decrease average handle time, which also reduces cost.


3. Self-service
Customer self-service refers to customers being able to identify and find the support they need without relying on a customer service agent. Most customers, when given the option, would prefer to solve issues on their own if given the proper tools and information. As AI becomes more advanced, self-service functions will become increasingly pervasive and allow customers the opportunity to solve concerns on their schedules.

4. Robotic process automation
Robotic process automation (RPA) can automate many simple tasks that an agent used to perform. Automating bots to focus on updating records, managing incidents or providing proactive outreach to customers, for example, can drastically reduce costs and improve efficiency and processing time. One of the best ways to determine where RPA can assist in customer service is by asking the customer service agents. They can likely identify the processes that take the longest or have the most clicks between systems. Or they may suggest simple, repetitive transactions that don't require a human. When prioritized and deployed correctly, this type of business process improvement can save customer service companies millions of dollars each year.


5. Machine learning
At its core, machine learning is key to processing and analyzing large data streams and determining what actionable insights there are. In customer service, machine learning can support agents with predictive analytics to identify common questions and responses. The technology can even catch things an agent may have missed in the communication. Additionally, machine learning can be used to help chatbots and other AI tools adapt to a given situation based on prior results and ultimately help customers solve problems through self-service.



AI can use natural language processing to analyze customer feedback and provide insights for an organization.







6. Natural language processing
Many customer service teams use natural language processing today in their customer experience or voice of the customer programs. By having the system transcribe interactions across phone, email, chat and SMS channels and then analyze the data for certain trends and themes, an agent can meet the customer's needs more quickly. Previously, analyzing customer interactions was a lengthy process that often involved multiple teams and resources. Now, natural language processing eliminates these redundancies to create deeper and more efficient customer satisfaction.


7. IVR automation
While Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems have been automating simple routing and transactions for decades, new, conversational IVR systems use AI to handle tasks. Everything from verifying users with voice biometrics to directly telling the IVR system what needs to happen with the help of natural language processing is simplifying the customer experience. Some companies turn to visual IVR systems via mobile applications to streamline organized menus and routine transactions. Blending many of these AI types together creates a harmony of intelligent automation.



In customer service, machine learning can support agents with predictive analytics to identify common questions and responses and even catch things an agent may have missed in the communication.






8. Sentiment and advanced analytics
Using sentiment analysis to analyze and identify how a customer feels is becoming commonplace in today's customer service teams. Some tools can even recognize when a customer is upset and notify a team leader or representative to interject and de-escalate the situation. In conjunction with a voice of the customer tool, sentiment analysis can create a more honest and full picture of customer satisfaction. Vendors such as Brandwatch, Hootsuite, Lexalytics, NetBase, Sprout Social, Sysomos and Zoho offer sentiment analysis platforms that proactively review customer feedback.


9. AI training
As the COVID-19 pandemic forced employees into remote positions, many training teams began using AI to construct simulations to test employee aptitude for handling various situations. Previously, the training involved a blend of classroom training, self-paced learning and a final assessment -- a routine that's much harder to implement in remote or hybrid offices. With AI taking the role of the customer, new agents can test out dozens of possible scenarios and practice their responses with natural counterparts to ensure that they're ready to support any issue a user or customer may have.


10. Smart speakers
The practical applications for organizations and customer service teams are still a work in progress, but smart assistants such as Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri are an exciting avenue for personalized service. Customers appreciate and prefer when an organization communicates via their preferred platform, and for some people, that may be via their smart home device. Imagine a future where a user can bypass a phone call or email and troubleshoot any product or service concern via a simple question to their smart speaker. Simplified communications like this could be the difference between a satisfied or frustrated customer.
With several use cases for AI in customer service and many more to come, customer service teams must think more critically, handle higher-tiered issues and take advantage of all available tools to create an unforgettable customer experience.

The award is from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and is one of the largest of its kind in the world. In its announcement, the foundation says:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually entering all areas of our everyday lives. The more AI we use, the more we realise that certain standards and frameworks are needed to ensure that AI is developed and employed in a value-based, responsible and human-centred fashion. Otherwise, exclusion and discrimination could result.
The exploration and application of responsible AI is still a very young discipline and Vincent C. Müller can rightfully be described as one of its pioneers. Even before the topic had triggered broad public debate, he was working on the philosophy and ethics of AI, whereby he also enjoys a very high reputation amongst computer scientists: He is one of the few people outside of informatics to be appointed a fellow of the Alan Turing Institute in London. He also channels his expertise into political consultancy, for example as an expert in the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, a global initiative involving Germany that was launched in 2020 to promote the responsible development and use of AI.
As a Humboldt Professor at FAU, Vincent C. Müller is called upon to build bridges both between technological and humanities expertise as well as beyond the confines of the university to industry and public administration. He is invited to build up a new, international, interdisciplinary Centre for Philosophy and AI Research (PAIR) which will become a hub for AI philosophy at FAU. Cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits is also foreseen in order to support the development of trustworthy AI systems.
Ten Humboldt professorships were awarded this year, across a range of disciplines. You can learn more about the other recipients here.

Congratulations to Professor Muller for the award, and it is important to study responsible AI. I challenge all ethicists of AI to figure out what we are going to do about these – alleged ‘self replicating robots’ that were discovered today and reported by NPR. I am not claiming to be an expert in AI ethics, but I think we can all agree that robots that can self-replicate are a problem to say the least. Stopping them from self-replicating seems to me (a layperson on this topic) to be a topic of both theoretical and practical urgency. https://www.npr.org/2021/12/01/1060027395/robots-xenobots-living-self-replicating-copy?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&fbclid=IwAR0rK-0QOx_-VqQXdpIepIBTYsQ2mGcyt1mVpJ_WqZusdGpEec-7jheWJq8

Dear Sebastian, you are right that the self-replicating robots recently reported are (obviously!) very problematic. However, I don’t think they pose a very obvious theoretical challenge. There are at least two strategies that would OBVIOUSLY contain them. First, anyone who creates a self-replicating robot should be punished in some way, and punished *to a degree* proportionate to the extent of the replication. So, for example, if a scientist creates a self replicating robot that replicates 100 times, then that deserves a stronger punishment than we’d give to a scientist to creates a robot that replicates five times. I think that’s just common sense. Secondly, suppose the self-replication has gotten ‘out of control’ in a lab. There is a way to contain it, using the technique that was used to great effect following Chernobyl — that is to pour concrete on top of the building where this is occurring, effectively ‘sealing in’ the replication process (much like by way of analogy the concrete ‘sealed in’ the toxins from Chernobyl). Both of these strategies would be very effective, and I think they are more or less common sense. Thus, I reject the thought that heavy duty theoretical work is needed to solve this rather straightforward situation.

“Xenobots” are not robots. They do not think. They do not work. They do not replicate themselves. They are biological dustpans, designed as such by scientists, who apparently want to make these extreme claims for themselves, of having created life AND living robots. 
Examples of what neither man nor AI created:
–Tissue cells want to be tissues, so when they pile up in the solution, they stick together to form tissue. Scientists got them to stick together in their dustpan, C-shape.
–Living cells move somewhat, so a lump of stuck-together cells in a solution will move around. When they do, some single cells in the solution get inside the C-shape and start to pile up and stick together. This, they call “replicating themselves”. But if the free cells in the solution were bird cells, the lumps which collected would be lumps of the cells of birds, not frog cells. They even claim that it’s even cooler that the cells of their so-called self replication don’t even come from them! 
That is why they have not replicated themselves. They have not even gathered the cells. The cells randomly piled up in the C-shape, then stuck together, because the tissue cells want to heal and be part of a tissue again. The most they did was use the raw materials of the frog cells to form a c shape which was more efficient at allowing cells to stay inside, collecting them. But that was human ingenuity, not AI.

Regrettably what academic philosophers might come up with in terms of parameters for AI in terms of humanistic ethics will be inevitably trumped by the technomilitary establishment and the inherent greed of the financial institutions that run the decadent Western world, including its already dehumanized research university culture.

Not only regrettable but unavoidable in state of affairs after Darwin Marks and the academical establishment of the West after Holmsky. Anarchy and Holmsky are two products of the same kind selfreplicating without any control. It is too late and useless to sponsor a Messiah from the same kind of products.

It is good to first clarify the problem of consciousness from the philosophical side. But only if the approach is good. On my page you can find keywords for such an approach as well as a model that could be implemented in AI.

But the software seems prone to racial, cultural and gender biasBy John McQuaid Juan Mabromara AFP and Getty ImagesDecember 2021 IssueSociologyIn Liverpool, England, at a February 2020 conference on the rather unglamorous topic of government purchasing, attendees circulated through exhibitor and vendor displays, lingering at some, bypassing others. They were being closely watched. Around the floor, 24 discreetly positioned cameras tracked each person’s movements and cataloged subtle contractions in individuals’ facial muscles at five to 10 frames per second as they reacted to different displays. The images were fed to a computer network, where artificial-intelligence algorithms assessed each person’s gender and age group and analyzed their expressions for signs of “happiness” and “engagement.”About a year after the Liverpool event, Panos Moutafis, CEO of Austin, Tex.–based Zenus, the company behind the technology, was still excited about the results. “I haven’t seen lots of commercial systems getting this level of accuracy,” he said to me during a video call, showing me a photograph of the crowd, the faces outlined with boxes. Zenus engineers had trained the system to recognize emotions by having it examine a huge data set of facial expressions with labels describing relevant feelings. The company validated the program’s performance in various ways, including live tests when people reported how they felt when an image was taken. The system, Moutafis said, “works indoors, it works with masks, with no lighting, it works outdoors when people wear hats and sunglasses.”The Zenus setup is one example of a new technology—called emotion AI or affective computing—that combines cameras and other devices with artificial-intelligence programs to capture facial expressions, body language, vocal intonation, and other cues. The goal is to go beyond facial recognition and identification to reveal something previously invisible to technology: the inner feelings, motivations and attitudes of the people in the images. “Cameras have been dumb,” says A.C.L.U. senior policy analyst Jay Stanley, author of the 2019 report The Dawn of Robot Surveillance. “Now they’re getting smart. They are waking up. They are gaining the ability not just to dumbly record what we do but to make judgments about it.”Emotion AI has become a popular market research tool—at another trade show, Zenus told Hilton Hotels that a puppies-and-ice-cream event the company staged was more engaging than the event’s open bar—but its reach extends into areas where the stakes are much higher. Systems that read cues of feeling, character and intent are being used or tested to detect threats at border checkpoints, evaluate job candidates, monitor classrooms for boredom or disruption, and recognize signs of aggressive driving. Major automakers are putting the technology into coming generations of vehicles, and Amazon, Microsoft, Google and other tech companies offer cloud-based emotion-AI services, often bundled with facial recognition. Dozens of start-ups are rolling out applications to help companies make hiring decisions. The practice has become so common in South Korea, for instance, that job coaches often make their clients practice going through AI interviews.AI systems use various kinds of data to generate insights into emotion and behavior. In addition to facial expressions, vocal intonation, body language and gait, they can analyze the content of spoken or written speech for affect and attitude. Some applications use the data they collect to probe not for emotions but for related insights, such as what kind of personality a person has and whether he or she is paying attention or poses a potential threat.But critics warn that emotion AI’s reach exceeds its grasp in potentially hazardous ways. AI algorithms can be trained on data sets with embedded racial, ethnic and gender biases, which in turn can prejudice their evaluations—against, for example, nonwhite job applicants. “There’s this idea that we can off-load some of our cognitive processes on these systems,” says Lauren Rhue, an information systems scientist at the University of Maryland, who has studied racial bias in emotion AI. “That we can say, ‘Oh, this person has a demeanor that’s threatening’ based on them. That’s where we’re getting into a dangerous area.”Recommended StoriesChatGPT Isn’t ‘Hallucinating’—It’s Bullshitting!Joe Slater, James Humphries & Michael Townsen HicksWe’re Not Asking the Right Question to Solve the Overdose CrisisZachary SiegelHere’s Why Protest News Doesn’t Tell You MuchDouglas M. McLeodTrump’s Personality Cult Plays a Part in His Political AppealBen Goldsmith & Lars J. K. MoenThe underlying science is also in dispute. Many emotion-AI apps trace their origins to research conducted half a century ago by psychologists Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen, who theorized that a handful of facial expressions correspond to basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise; Ekman later added contempt to the list) and that these expressions form a universally understood emotional language. But these ideas are now hotly debated. Scientists have found evidence of significant cultural and individual variations in facial expressions. Many researchers say algorithms cannot—yet, anyway—consistently read the subtleties of human expressions in different individuals, which may not match up with stereotypical internal feelings. Ekman himself, who worked to develop early forms of emotion-recognition technology, now argues it poses a serious threat to privacy and should be heavily regulated.Emotion AI is not intrinsically bad. If machines can be trained to reliably interpret emotions and behavior, the potential for robotics, health care, automobiles, and other fields is enormous, experts say. But right now the field is practically a free-for-all, and a largely unproven technology could become ubiquitous before societies have time to consider the potential costs.In 2018 Mark Gray, then vice president for people and business operations at Airtame, which makes a device for screen-sharing presentations and displays, was looking for ways to improve the company’s hiring process. Efficiency was part of it. Airtame is small, with about 100 employees spread among offices in Copenhagen, New York City, Los Angeles and Budapest, but the company can receive hundreds of applications for its jobs in marketing or design. Another factor was the capricious nature of hiring decisions. “A lot of times I feel it’s coming from a fake voice in the back of someone’s head that ‘oh, I like this person personally,’ not ‘this person would be more competent,’” says Gray, who is now at Proper, a Danish property management tech company. “In the world of recruitment and HR, which is filled with the intangible, I kind of wanted to figure out how can I add a tangible aspect to hiring.”

Airtame contracted with Retorio, a Munich-based company that uses AI in video interviews. The process is quick: job candidates record 60-second answers to just two or three questions. An algorithm then analyzes the facial expressions and voice of the interviewees and the text of their responses. It then generates a profile based on five basic personality traits, a common model in psychology shorthanded as OCEAN: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Recruiters receive a ranked list of candidates based on how well each profile fits the job.Such software is starting to change how business decisions are made and how organizations interact with people. It has reshaped the hiring process at Airtame, instantly elevating some candidates over others. Gray says that is because the profiling works. He shared a chart showing that the job performance of several recent hires in sales tracked their personality scores, with employees who had scored higher in conscientiousness, agreeableness and openness doing the best.Machines that can understand emotions have long been the subject of science fiction. But in computer science and engineering, human affect remained an alien concept for a long time. As recently as the 1990s, “it was a taboo topic, something undesirable,” says Rosalind Picard of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who coined the term “affective computing” in a 1995 technical report. “People thought I was crazy, nuts, stupid, embarrassing. One respected signal- and speech-processing person came up to me, looked at my feet the whole time, and said, ‘You’re wasting your time—emotion is just noise.’”Picard and other researchers began developing tools that could automatically read and respond to biometric information, from facial expressions to blood flow, that indicated emotional states. But the current proliferation of applications dates to the widening deployment starting in the early 2010s of deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning that employs neural networks, which are roughly modeled on biological brains. Deep learning improved the power and accuracy of AI algorithms to automate a few tasks that previously only people could do reliably: driving, facial recognition, and analyzing certain medical scans.Yet such systems are still far from perfect, and emotion AI tackles a particularly formidable task. Algorithms are supposed to reflect a “ground truth” about the world: they should identify an apple as an apple, not as a peach. The “learning” in machine learning consists of repeatedly comparing raw data—often from images but also from video, audio, and other sources—to training data labeled with the desired feature. This is how the system learns to extract the underlying commonalities, such as the “appleness” from images of apples. Once the training is finished, an algorithm can identify apples in any image.Sign Up for Our Daily NewsletterEmail AddressBy giving us your email, you are agreeing to receive the Today In Science newsletter and to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Sign UpThank you for signing up! Check out our other newsletters

But when the task is identifying hard-to-define qualities such as personality or emotion, ground truth becomes more elusive. What does “happiness” or “neuroticism” look like? Emotion-AI algorithms cannot directly intuit emotions, personality or intentions. Instead they are trained, through a kind of computational crowdsourcing, to mimic the judgments humans make about other humans. Critics say that process introduces too many subjective variables. “There is a profound slippage between what these things show us and what might be going on in somebody’s mind or emotional space,” says Kate Crawford of the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, who studies the social consequences of artificial intelligence. “That is the profound and dangerous leap that some of these technologies are making.”The process that generates those judgments is complicated, and each stage has potential pitfalls. Deep learning, for example, is notoriously data-hungry. For emotion AI, it requires huge data sets that combine thousands or sometimes billions of human judgments—images of people labeled as “happy” or “smiling” by data workers, for instance. But algorithms can inadvertently “learn” the collective, systematic biases of the people who assembled the data. That bias may come from skewed demographics in training sets, unconscious attitudes of the labelers, or other sources.Even identifying a smile is far from a straightforward task. A 2020 study by Carsten Schwemmer of the GESIS–Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Cologne, Germany, and his colleagues ran pictures of members of Congress through cloud-based emotion-recognition apps by Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The scientists’ own review found 86 percent of men and 91 percent of women were smiling—but the apps were much more likely to find women smiling. Google Cloud Vision, for instance, applied the “smile” label to more than 90 percent of the women but to less than 25 percent of the men. The authors suggested gender bias might be present in the training data. They also wrote that in their own review of the images, ambiguity—ignored by the machines—was common: “Many facial expressions seemed borderline. Was that really a smile? Do smirks count? What if teeth are showing, but they do not seem happy?”Facial-recognition systems, most also based on deep learning, have been widely criticized for bias. Researchers at the M.I.T. Media Lab, for instance, found these systems were less accurate when matching the identities of nonwhite, nonmale faces. Typically these errors arise from using training data sets that skew white and male. Identifying emotional expressions adds additional layers of complexity: these expressions are dynamic, and faces in posed photos can have subtle differences from those in spontaneous snapshots.Rhue, the University of Maryland researcher, used a public data set of pictures of professional basketball players to test two emotion-recognition services, one from Microsoft and one from Face++, a facial-recognition company based in China. Both consistently ascribed more negative emotions to Black players than to white players, although each did it differently: Face++ saw Black players as angry twice as often as white players; Microsoft viewed Black players as showing contempt three times as often as white players when the expression was ambiguous. The problem can likely be traced back to bias in the labeled images in training data sets, she says. Microsoft and Face++ did not respond to requests for comment.Many companies now emphasize that they are aware of and addressing such issues. Retorio’s algorithm was trained on a data set, compiled over a period of years using paid volunteers, of short interview videos labeled with personality traits, co-founder Christoph Hohenberger says. The company has taken steps to filter out various demographic and cultural biases that would tend to favor one group over another in the personality assessments, he says. But because there is currently no regulation or oversight of the industry, in most cases we have to take a company’s word for it—the robustness and equity of proprietary data sets are hard to verify. HireVue, a company that does video interviews with algorithmic analysis of the text and vocal tone, brought on an outside auditor to check for bias, but that is rare.“This idea that there exists one standard for humans to be and that everyone can meet it equally” is fundamentally flawed, says Ifeoma Ajunwa, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, who studies AI decision-making. The assumption, she says, means that “everyone who doesn’t meet that standard is disadvantaged.”In addition to concerns about bias, the idea that outside appearances match a decipherable inner emotion for everyone has also started to generate strong scientific opposition. That is a change from when the concept got its start more than 50 years ago. At that time Ekman and Friesen were conducting fieldwork with the Fore, an Indigenous group in the highlands of southeast Papua New Guinea, to see if they recognized and understood facial expressions the same way as people from radically different backgrounds did—a stevedore from Brooklyn, say, or a nurse in Senegal. Volunteers were shown sets of photos of people making expressions for what the scientists called the six basic emotions. To provide context, a translator provided brief descriptors (“He/she is looking at something which smells bad” for disgust, for instance). The Fore responses were virtually identical to those of people surveyed in countries such as Japan or Brazil or the U.S., so the researchers contended that facial expressions are a universally intelligible emotional language.The notion of a shared group of expressions that represented basic emotional states quickly became popular in psychology and other fields. Ekman and Friesen developed an atlas of thousands of facial movements to interpret these expressions, called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Both the atlas and the theory became cornerstones of emotion AI. The work has been incorporated into many AI applications, such those developed by the company Affectiva, which include in-car systems and market research.But scientists have argued that there are holes in Ekman’s theories. A 2012 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, for instance, presented data showing that facial expressions varied considerably by culture. And in 2019 Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University, along with several colleagues, published a study that examined more than 1,000 scientific papers on facial expressions. The notion that faces revealed outward signs of common emotions had spread to fields ranging from technology to law, they found—but there was little hard evidence that it was true.The basic emotions are broad stereotypical categories, Barrett says. Moment to moment, facial expressions reflect complicated internal states—a smile might cover up pain, or it might convey sympathy. And today, she contends, it is almost impossible for an AI system to consistently, reliably categorize those internal states if it has been trained on data sets that are essentially collections of labeled stereotypes. “It’s measuring something and then inferring what it means psychologically,” Barrett says. “But those are two separate things. I can’t say this about every company obviously, because I don’t know everything that everybody is doing. But the emotion-recognition technology that’s been advertised is routinely confounding these two things.”




Gender bias: In a study using politicians' faces, researchers found that an emotion-AI program determined that only a few men were smiling. The scientists' own review, however, indicated the vast majority of men had a smile. In contrast to men, the program, Google Cloud Vision, applied the “smile” label to many women. Percentages on labels of attributes in two images (below) indicate the confidence the AI had in the label accuracy. The woman got a smile label at 64 percent confidence—along with labels focused on her hair—whereas the man did not get that label at all. Credit: “Diagnosing Gender Bias in Image Recognition Systems,” by Carsten Schwemmer et al., in Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World, Vol. 6. Published online November 11, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023120967171 (headshots with labels); Wikipedia (headshots)
One reason for this problem, Crawford says, is that the world of tech start-ups is not aware of scientific debates in other fields, and those start-ups are attracted to the elegant simplicity of systems such as FACS. “Why has the machine-learning field been drawn to Ekman?” Crawford asks. “It fits nicely with a machine-learning capacity. If you say there is a limited set of expressions and strictly limited numbers of potential emotions, then people will adopt that view primarily because the theory fits what the tools can do.” In addition to Ekman’s work and the personality-trait model of OCEAN, emotion-AI companies have adopted other systems. One is a “wheel of emotions” devised by the late psychologist Robert Plutchik, which is used by Adoreboard, a U.K.-based company that analyzes emotion in text. All these approaches offer to translate the complexity of human affect into straightforward formulas. They may suffer from similar flaws, too. One study found that OCEAN produces inconsistent results across different cultures.Nevertheless, researchers say emotion apps can work—if their limitations are understood. Roboticist Ayanna Howard, dean of the College of Engineering at the Ohio State University, uses a modified version of Microsoft’s facial-expression-recognition software in robots to teach social behavior to children with autism. If a robot detects an “angry” expression from its interlocutor, for example, its movements will adapt in ways that calm the situation. The stereotypical facial expressions may not always mean exactly the same thing, Howard says, but they are useful. “Yeah, we’re unique—but we’re not that different from the person next door,” she says. “And so when you’re talking about emotion in general, you can get it right maybe not all the time but more than random right.”In general, algorithms that scan and aggregate the reactions of many people—such as those Zenus uses to read crowds—will be more accurate, Barrett says, because “better than random” becomes statistically meaningful with a large group. But assessing individuals is more treacherous because anything short of 100 percent accuracy ends up discriminating against certain people.Many computer vision specialists are now embracing a more agnostic view of facial expressions. (And more companies have begun stating they do not directly map emotions or internal states.) “As the field has developed, there’s increasing understanding that many expressions have nothing to do with emotion,” says Jonathan Gratch, a computer science professor at the University of Southern California, who specializes in affective computing. “They’re kind of tools we use to influence each other, or they’re almost like words in a conversation, and so there’s meaning in those words. But it is not direct access to what I’m feeling in the moment.”Yet as attempts to map and monetize emotional expressions, personality traits and behaviors grow, they are expanding the parts of our lives that can fall under surveillance. After 20 years of tech companies mining personal data from online behavior, a new, more intimate domain—faces and bodies and the signals they send—is poised for similar treatment. “If you’re a Coca-Cola, and you’re driving a campaign, and your principal methodology for messaging is the Internet, you know everything about what audience you reached,” says Jay Hutton, CEO of Vancouver-based company VSBLTY, which markets smart cameras and software that scan crowds, analyzing demographics and reactions to products for retailers. “But what if we could take computer vision and turn bricks and mortar into that same level of analytics?”In December 2020 VSBLTY announced a partnership with Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo to create in-store networks of cameras to capture data in the beverage company’s 50,000 Modelorama convenience stores and neighborhood bodegas in Mexico and other Latin American countries by 2027. Demand will exist wherever there are screens and advertising, Hutton says. The technology “will be used in transit hubs, or in an airport, or a stadium,” he says. “Advertisers are paying millions of dollars to be a sponsor, and their ads appear on screens throughout the stadium, [and] they are looking for validation of that spin.”This trend raises a basic legal and social question: Do the data from your face and body belong to you? In most places around the world, the answer is no—as long as your personal identity is kept separate from that data. “If you would like to know, and somebody’s in public, there seems to be no limit in scanning them for their emotions,” says Jennifer Bard, a professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, who has studied the issue.Most emotion-AI companies that capture data in public say the information is anonymized, and thus its collection should not provoke concern. VSBLTY does not store facial images or other data that can be linked to identities, Hutton says. Zenus’s Moutafis notes that his company’s app does not upload the actual facial images that its cameras capture—only the relevant metadata on mood and position—and that it puts up signs and notices on meeting screens that the monitoring is occurring. “Explicit consent is not needed,” he says. “We always tell people deploying it that is a very good practice; when you have a surveillance sensitivity, you have to put up a sign that these areas are being monitored.” Typically, Moutafis says, people do not mind and forget about the cameras. But the diversity of applications means there are no common standards. It is also far from clear whether people and politicians will embrace such routine surveillance once it becomes a political and policy issue.Ekman, who earlier worked with the company Emotient and with Apple on emotion AI, now warns it poses a threat to privacy and says companies should be legally obligated to obtain consent from each person they scan. “Unfortunately, it is a technology that can be used without people’s knowledge, and it’s being used on them, and it’s not being used on them to make them happier,” he says. “It’s being used on them to get them to buy products they might not otherwise buy. And that’s probably the most benign of the nonbenign uses of it.”Emotion AI has entered personal spaces, too, where the potential hoard of behavioral data is even richer. Amazon’s Alexa analyzes users’ vocal intonation for signs of frustration to improve its algorithms, according to a spokesperson. By 2023 some automakers will be debuting AI-enabled in-cabin systems that will generate huge amounts of data on driver and passenger behavior. Automakers will want those data, also likely anonymized, for purposes such as refining system responses and in-car design and for measuring aggregated behavior such as driver performance. (Tesla already collects data from multiple sources in its vehicles.) Customers would likely have the option of activating various levels of these systems, according to Modar Alaoui, CEO of emotion-AI company Eyeris, so if occupants do not use certain functions, data would not be collected on those. The in-cabin systems designed by Affectiva (recently acquired by Swedish firm Smart Eye) do not record video but would make metadata available, says chief marketing officer Gabi Zijderveld.Aleix Martinez, a computer vision scientist at Ohio State and Amazon and a co-author with Barrett of the 2019 paper criticizing the face-emotion connection, has a photo he is fond of showing people. It is of a man’s face that appears to be twisted in a mixture of anger and fear. Then he shows the full image: it is a soccer player exultant after scoring a goal. Facial expressions, gestures, and other signals are not only a product of the body and brain, he notes, but of context, of what is happening around a person. So far that has proved the biggest challenge for emotion AI: interpreting ambiguous context. “Unless I know what soccer is, I’m never going to be able to understand what happened there,” Martinez says. “So that knowledge is fundamental, and we don’t have any AI system right now that can do a good job at that at all.”The technology becomes more effective, Martinez says, if the task is narrow, the surroundings are simple, and the biometric information collected is diverse—voice, gestures, pulse, blood flow under the skin, and so on. Coming generations of emotion AI may combine exactly this kind of information. But that, in turn, will only create more powerful and intrusive technologies that societies may not be prepared for.Rights & PermissionsFrom our Archives

Depending on the people you talk to, architects approach artificial intelligence (AI) with a range of anticipation, skepticism, or dread. Some say algorithms will handle drudge work and free designers to focus on the more creative aspects of their jobs. Others assert that AI won’t live up to its hype—at least not in the near future—and will make only marginal improvements in the profession. And a third group worries that software that learns on its own will put a lot of architects out of work.

Science fiction writers have been imagining robots that think like human beings for more than 100 years. But the field of artificial intelligence really began in the middle of the last century with British mathematician Alan Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence.” In 1956, at a conference hosted by Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, mathematician John McCarthy coined the term “artificial intelligence” and, with a group of participants, explored how to “make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves,” according to the event’s proposal.Imbuing computers with true intelligence, though, has proved to be more difficult than originally imagined. Sixty-five years after the Dartmouth conference, computers can process huge amounts of information, analyze it to find correlations and patterns, and then make predictions based on those patterns. What makes AI different from previous forms of computation is Machine Learning (ML), which employs algorithms that get better at performing certain tasks the more they do them; they learn without having to be programmed to do each step. The bigger the data set used to “train” an algorithm, the better it will perform. By 1997, IBM had developed a chess-playing program called Deep Blue that was able to beat Gary Kasparov, the world chess champion at the time. Today, Google Translate does a pretty good job of recognizing text in one language and communicating it in another. A program known as GPT-3 will take a few word prompts and write a paragraph of text that seems at first glance to have been written by a person. Algorithms allow autonomous vehicles to navigate city streets, radiologists to identify cancerous tumors, and online shopping services to recommend products to their customers.But computers still don’t think like people. They have no awareness of anything beyond their own predetermined capabilities and don’t have anything close to common sense. They know only what they have been shown and lack the ability to generalize from one task to another. A 2016 Obama Administration report on the future of AI identified the technology’s potential to “open up new markets and new opportunities for progress in critical areas such as health, education, and the environment,” but admitted that “it is very unlikely that machines will exhibit broadly applicable intelligence comparable to or exceeding that of humans in the next 20 years.”In the past decade or so, software for architects has evolved from CAD to scripted geometry engines like Rhino and parametric BIM platforms like Revit—moving from the representation of buildings (in plan, section, elevation) to more responsive systems that show the impact of one change on the rest of the project. Thanks to faster and cheaper computers and the enormous computing power and storage capacity of the cloud, AI systems are now able to encode information and relationships in increasingly complex layers. Because they’re able to process vast amounts of data accessible from internet-based sources, they can create statistical correlations that approximate learning, says Phillip Bernstein, author of a forthcoming book on AI and an associate dean at the Yale School of Architecture.Of course, most architects are nowhere close to doing any of that in their practices, instead using platforms like BIM to create drawings, rather than connecting them to data to create insight, notes Bernstein. Architects will be pushed to adopt AI tools, he says, mostly by clients who are already using large data sets, machine learning, and predictive simulation to manage their operations and facilities. Steve McConnell, managing partner at NBBJ, which has designed buildings for major tech companies like Amazon and Tencent, echoes this sentiment. By using data to drive their designs, architects can show the value of what they do to clients who run their own businesses with data-driven processes, points out McConnell.McConnell says AI will also enable architects to “move upstream” in the building-development process by giving them the analytical tools to serve as “strategic partners” to clients—helping them identify business opportunities, for example, even before project planning has begun. Architects, though, “need to reimagine their skills and what they bring to the table.”The promise of AI is not only that it will provide a business advantage, points out Bernstein. The technology has the potential to help architects address “profound problems,” such as reducing waste and embodied carbon in projects, making public spaces more equitable, and enhancing building performance, he says.A few design firms are developing their own proprietary AI tools to help them work on big projects. Gensler, for example, rolled out its Nform “ecosystem” of data-driven software—much of which employs algorithms and AI—in the summer of 2020. Developed by the firm’s design technology studio, the in-house package of software addresses design issues at different scales—from floor plan to master plan to sustainability strategy. By harnessing algorithms to large data sets, the new software gives designers rapid feedback on the impact of changes to interior-space plans or building configurations, so design decisions can be made much faster and earlier in the process. “We want to augment the power of our designers and make them more agile,” says Marc Syp, Gensler’s director of computation.Some firms have introduced their AI tools commercially. One such software application is cove.tool which optimizes designs based on multiple parameters, including daylighting, energy use, code compliance, and cost. Launched in 2017 by Atlanta-based architects Patrick Chopson and Sandeep Ahuja as an outgrowth of their sustainable-design consulting firm, Pattern R+D, cove.tool is now their primary focus. The cloud-based app uses machine learning to process data collected from many different sources—such as construction-cost-data company RSMeans, building-product manufacturers, public databases, and the app’s users themselves—to model energy use versus cost at every stage of design. It is intended as a holistic tool, obviating the need to employ an array of stand-alone software programs to analyze designs for daylighting, shadows, HVAC, and such, says Ahuja. The company plans to add electrical, plumbing, and structural analysis to the tool soon. “The idea is to give architects all of the data they need at every step along the design process,” says Ahuja.Although not a design firm, Sidewalk Labs, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has developed a tool called Delve that integrates financial parameters, energy models, and site constraints to help architects and planners design complex urban projects. It depends on generative design and AI to analyze factors such as density, daylight, and walkability to propose a range of options and show the trade-offs inherent in each one. The software is mostly used during the planning, feasibility, and entitlement stages of a project to demonstrate how various schemes will meet city requirements and the client’s bottom line, says Violet Whitney, director of product management for Delve.Artificial intelligence offers the potential for creating environments that are more responsive to their users’ needs at all scales, including the urban scale. Cities have been collecting vast amounts of data, and companies like Google have been providing functions like Street View and Earth for years now. AI can harness all this information, analyze it, and use it to help make places work better. Such data are the raw material that urbanists like Kevin Lynch and William H. Whyte had to generate periodically and painstakingly to develop their ideas; now these data are continually updated and available in real time, says Carlo Ratti, who directs MIT’s Senseable City Lab and practices architecture. His firm, Carlo Ratti Associati, is using such data to map Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, to better understand the city’s public spaces for Manifesta 14, the European cultural biennale that will take place there in 2022. Ratti’s team is using algorithms to reveal hidden spatial and social patterns and identify key squares, streets, parks, and green areas that are either underused or misused. This past summer, Ratti applied this information to initiate a series of temporary urban interventions that offer new ways of using and reclaiming these spaces. The third phase of the project will track residents as they “vote with their feet” and show how the reconfigured spaces actually function. This feedback will then help identify which interventions—such as converting the area around an old brick factory into an “urban living room” and turning space for cars into places for people—are retained for the future development of the city. “AI can help us understand visual clues that might not be apparent using older tools,” says Ratti.

Ratti cautions that the recent explosion in data collection comes with very real concerns. “Ninety percent of all the data on the planet have been created in the last two years,” he says. Cities need to be transparent about how they collect, store, and use data. They also need to wrestle with privacy issues and prevent—or at least identify—biases that might be embedded in the information they use.Ratti sees AI’s being used to “turn buildings into living things,” pointing to facades in particular. With sensors that collect information on humidity, temperature, and air quality, envelopes can respond in real time to enhance comfort, reduce energy use, and maximize efficiency. “Building facades today are corsets,” he says, “but we can make them living skins.”One firm that has been exploring AI as a tool for devising adaptive facades is Foster + Partners. Working with Autodesk, Foster’s applied research-and-development group has been investigating self-deforming materials that can change their shape without any mechanical forces. Instead of employing motorized louvers or other such devices, these materials respond to environmental conditions in the same way an eye’s iris does to light. They do this by combining thermo-active materials with passive laminates (multilayered materials, usually plastic) and exploiting the difference in expansion and contraction rates to change the shape of the facade.Because there’s a nonlinear relationship between the laminates’ internal forces and their behavior, designing the material to work in a desired way is remarkably complex. So Foster used machine learning to build what is known as a “surrogate model” to study all of the interactions and how the various layers would react to changing conditions. Instead of repeatedly adjusting the arrangement of laminates to get the desired deformed state, the designers started with the preferred end state and let AI figure out how to get there.

To devise adaptive facades with self-deforming materials, Foster + Partners reversed the typical workflow, starting with the desired outcome and then allowing AI to figure out how to achieve it. Image courtesy Foster + Partners/Autodesk
In addition to such surrogate-modeling work, Foster is also exploring a more advanced form of machine learning that it calls “design-assistance” modeling, says Martha Tsigkari, a partner at Foster. The goal of this kind of modeling is to facilitate architectural processes that do not have definitive answers —those that require subjective approaches—and “work alongside the intuition of designers in the creative process.” The firm is trying to understand the potential of AI at different stages—from design to construction to building operation, says Tsigkari. Ideally, AI would create a continuous information loop, so feedback from the operation of a completed building would help architects with the design and construction of their next one.

AI, though, is not just for big firms and big projects. Suchi Reddy, whose 16-person New York–based practice, Reddymade, combines art and architecture, worked with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for two years to develop AI technologies for a kinetic light installation in the 90-foot-high central rotunda of the Smithsonian’s Arts and Industries Building in Washington, D.C. Called me + you, the installation was commissioned for Futures, an exhibition that opened in November in the Smithsonian’s original home, which had been closed since 2004 due to structural concerns. Visitors can speak into nine circular “listening stations” at the base of the piece and tell their “future visions.” An AI-driven system then translates the meaning and tone of the spoken words into a kinetic “mandala” of color and light in the piece’s central totem. Each person’s sentiment changes the pattern and color of the totem, creating a constantly changing collective vision of the future. A web app allows people from around the world to add their voices to the sculpture, providing readings of the global “temperature” of sentiments on the future at any given moment.Reddy says her work uses “emotional AI” that blends physics, neuroscience, and data technology. “I want to integrate feelings with technology to help us engage on a human level,” she says.Another architect using AI to explore the relationship between the built environment and psychology is Mona Ghandi, who runs Morphogenesis Lab, a cross-disciplinary program at Washington State University (WSU) that includes students in architecture, neuroscience, computer science, and materials science. With an interest in “compassionate spaces,” Ghandi and her Morphogenesis team created an AI-driven installation called Wisteria that responds to the emotions of people interacting with it. Exhibited at WSU’s Pullman campus from February to August 2020, Wisteria comprised a “forest” of cylindrical fabric “shrouds” suspended from the ceiling that changed shape and color depending on biometric data collected from the people moving underneath it. By weaving into the shrouds a shape-memory alloy programmed to respond to readings of visitors’ body temperature and pulse, the Morphogenesis team enabled the fabric cylinders to move and activate LEDs that change color. The work is “contingent on user involvement and engagement,” says Ghandi, and “illustrates the collective emotion” of the visitors at any particular moment.Ghandi sees Wisteria as a first step in developing spaces that can respond to the needs of people with neurological and emotional issues, such as autism and post-traumatic stress disorder, or to improve the cognitive performance of children in school.While AI is still in its infancy, architects are taking it in a wide range of directions—some of which may prove to be dead ends and others more successful. What’s clear, though, is that architects must get out in front of the technology or get run over by it.

The impact can be found anywhere
Modern AI which performs objective functions using data-trained models and is commonly classified as deep learning or machine learning — has already had a significant influence on virtually every major industry.
Apart from this, the impact of robots and artificial intelligence can be seen in our lives from a variety of angles.
1. At Workspace
Robots are capable of working at any hour of the day or night. They don’t need vacations, breaks, or health insurance. They don’t have conflicts with their bosses or coworkers, and they don’t take time off to deal with their problems.
Employers would welcome a workforce consisting entirely of intelligent robots, while employees are concerned about how a robotics-based workforce might affect employment.
2. On Industries
It’s tough to imagine a manufacturing company today without automated lines, robotic arms, and advanced technology. In the industrial world, robots have become the new normal, and they are making significant progress in improving a variety of manufacturing processes.
3. In Healthcare
The use of robotics in artificial intelligence (AI) is an example of modern technology that is helping to promote digital health and improve medical care.
Robotic equipment has rendered surgeons’ assistants obsolete. They allow for less invasive surgery and more accuracy, which reduces patient recovery time.

Thursday, she launched a new research institute to ask questions about responsible use of artificial intelligence that Gebru says Google and other tech companies won’t.“Instead of fighting from the inside, I want to show a model for an independent institution with a different set of incentive structures,” says Gebru, who is founder and executive director of Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research (DAIR). The first part of the name is a reference to her aim to be more inclusive than most AI labs—which skew white, Western, and male—and to recruit people from parts of the world rarely represented in the tech industry.Gebru was ejected from Google after clashing with bosses over a research paper urging caution with new text-processing technology enthusiastically adopted by Google and other tech companies. Google has said she resigned and was not fired, but acknowledged that it later fired Margaret Mitchell, another researcher who with Gebru co-led a team researching ethical AI. The company placed new checks on the topics its researchers can explore. Google spokesperson Jason Freidenfelds declined to comment but directed WIRED to a recent report on the company's work on AI governance, which said Google has published more than 500 papers on ""responsible innovation"" since 2018.Trending NowRE:WIRED 2021: Speaking Truth to Biased AlgorithmsThe fallout at Google highlighted the inherent conflicts in tech companies sponsoring or employing researchers to study the implications of technology they seek to profit from.

One such project is creating a public data set of aerial imagery of South Africa to examine how the legacy of apartheid is still etched into land use. A preliminary analysis of the images found that in a densely populated region once restricted to non-white people where many poor people still live, most vacant land developed between 2011 and 2017 was converted into wealthy residential neighborhoods.A paper on that project will mark DAIR’s formal debut in academic AI research later this month at NeurIPS, the world’s most prominent AI conference. DAIR’s first research fellow, Raesetje Sefala, who is based in South Africa, is lead author of the paper, which includes outside researchers.Safiya Noble, a professor at UCLA who researches how tech platforms shape society, serves on DAIR’s advisory board. She says Gebru’s project is an example of the kind of new and more inclusive institutions needed to make progress on understanding and responding to technology’s effects on society.“Black women have been major contributors to helping us understand the harms of big tech and different kinds of technologies that are harmful to society, but we know the limits in corporate America and academia that Black women face,” says Noble. “Timnit recognized harms at Google and tried to intervene but was massively unsupported—at a company that desperately needs that kind of insight.”Keep ReadingSearch our artificial intelligence database and discover stories by sector, tech, company, and more.Noble recently launched a nonprofit of her own, Equity Engine, to support the ambitions of Black women. She is joined on DAIR’s advisory board by Ciira wa Maina, a lecturer at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Nyeri, Kenya.DAIR is currently a project of nonprofit Code for Science and Society but will later incorporate as a nonprofit in its own right, Gebru says. Her project has received grants totaling more than $3 million from the Ford, MacArthur, Rockefeller, and Open Society foundations, as well as the Kapor Center.

New nonprofits and university centers have sprung up to study and critique AI’s effects in and on the world, such as NYU’s AI Now Institute, the Algorithmic Justice League, and Data for Black Lives. Some researchers in AI labs also study the impacts and proper use of algorithms, and scholars from other fields such as law and sociology have turned their own critical eyes on AI.The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy this year hired two prominent academics who work on algorithmic fairness research and is working on a “bill of rights” to guard against AI harms. The Federal Trade Commission last month hired three people from AI Now to serve as advisers on AI technology.Despite those shifts, Baobao Zhang, an assistant professor at Syracuse University, says the US public still seems to broadly trust tech companies to guide development of AI.Zhang recently surveyed AI researchers and the US public on who they trusted to shape development of the technology in the public interest. The results were starkly different: The public were most trusting of university researchers and the US military. Tech companies as a group came slightly behind, ranking similarly to international or nonprofit research institutions such as CERN, but ahead of the US government. AI researchers reported less trust than the general public in the US military and some tech companies, notably Facebook and Amazon, but more in the UN and non-governmental scientific organizations.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

“Black women have been major contributors to helping us understand the harms of big tech and different kinds of technologies that are harmful to society, but we know the limits in corporate America and academia that Black women face,” says Noble. “Timnit recognized harms at Google and tried to intervene but was massively unsupported—at a company that desperately needs that kind of insight.”
Noble recently launched a nonprofit of her own, Equity Engine, to support the ambitions of Black women. She is joined on DAIR’s advisory board by Ciira wa Maina, a lecturer at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Nyeri, Kenya.
DAIR is currently a project of nonprofit Code for Science and Society but will later incorporate as a nonprofit in its own right, Gebru says. Her project has received grants totaling more than $3 million from the Ford, MacArthur, Rockefeller, and Open Society foundations, as well as the Kapor Center. Over time, she hopes to diversify DAIR’s financial support by taking on consulting work related to its research.
DAIR joins a recent flourishing of work and organizations taking a broader and critical view of AI technology. New nonprofits and university centers have sprung up to study and critique AI’s effects in and on the world, such as NYU’s AI Now Institute, the Algorithmic Justice League, and Data for Black Lives. Some researchers in AI labs also study the impacts and proper use of algorithms, and scholars from other fields such as law and sociology have turned their own critical eyes on AI.
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy this year hired two prominent academics who work on algorithmic fairness research and is working on a “bill of rights” to guard against AI harms. The Federal Trade Commission last month hired three people from AI Now to serve as advisers on AI technology.
Despite those shifts, Baobao Zhang, an assistant professor at Syracuse University, says the US public still seems to broadly trust tech companies to guide development of AI.
Zhang recently surveyed AI researchers and the US public on who they trusted to shape development of the technology in the public interest. The results were starkly different: The public were most trusting of university researchers and the US military. Tech companies as a group came slightly behind, ranking similarly to international or nonprofit research institutions such as CERN, but ahead of the US government. AI researchers reported less trust than the general public in the US military and some tech companies, notably Facebook and Amazon, but more in the UN and non-governmental scientific organizations.

Page ContentThe EU's regions and cities have underlined their essential role in boosting investment in artificial intelligence (AI) and fostering trust in AI solutions. The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) has adopted an opinion calling for more transparency and stricter information requirements, especially what comes to high-risk AI systems. It also points out the major human rights risks and implications associated with the use of social classification, which should only be allowed only for specific purposes and always with human oversight to avoid any violations to the right to dignity and non-discrimination and to the values of equality and justice.The Committee strongly believes that the EU Regulation in the field of Artificial Intelligence should allow regions and cities to participate in the monitoring of AI systems and report on their implementation. The opinion drafted by Guido Rink (NL/PES), Member of the Executive Council of Emmen, regrets the absence of reference to local and regional authorities in the draft regulation, despite their key role in creating a favourable environment to AI investment and in exploiting the potential of AI systems to provide better services to the citizens. Mr Rink's opinion was adopted at the CoR plenary session on 2 December.""The vertiginous developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence have a direct impact on all citizens and levels of government. The Artificial Intelligence Act is therefore in principle a useful tool to avoid fragmentation in AI implementation rules across the EU. However, while Member States should not obstruct the application of the Regulation, proper consultation of the local and regional authorities concerned when it comes to the use of high-risk AI systems is imperative. What is more, we need much stronger safeguards in relation to AI-driven social scoring by public authorities, which risks leading to discrimination and social exclusion, while retaining the possibility to use AI with human oversight for better service provision"", rapporteur Guido Rink said.The CoR opinion calls on the Commission to consider in greater depth the high-risk classification of AI systems intended for use by public authorities, including AI systems used in democratic processes such as elections. Same transparency and information requirements should apply to all users, including private persons. Besides, Member States should retain the right to regulate high-risk AI systems if duly justified public and national security interests are at stake. Relevant local and regional authorities should always be consulted when AI systems are used for the real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces.The Committee also underlines the importance of clear rules in building an ecosystem of trust and lifting legal uncertainty surrounding the development and use of Artificial Intelligence. In that regard, early detection and elimination of potential overlaps and conflicts with existing rules is of key importance. It expresses concerns about the regulation's potential administrative burden, which can hinder small and medium-sized enterprises and local and regional authorities in promoting innovation and deploying AI systems. Regions and cities are also asking the European Commission to provide funding for public campaigns to familiarise the general public with the uses and potential risks of AI systems and to inform consumers on Artificial Intelligence/machine-driven decision-making.Contact:Lauri OuvinenTel. +32 473536887lauri.ouvinen@cor.europa.eu

AI Is Discovering Patterns in Pure Mathematics That Have Never Been Seen Before

We can add suggesting and proving mathematical theorems to the long list of what artificial intelligence is capable of: Mathematicians and AI experts have teamed up to demonstrate how machine learning can open up new avenues to explore in the field.



While mathematicians have been using computers to discover patterns for decades, the increasing power of machine learning means that these networks can work through huge swathes of data and identify patterns that haven't been spotted before.



In a newly published study, a research team used artificial intelligence systems developed by DeepMind, the same company that has been deploying AI to solve tricky biology problems and improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, to unknot some long-standing math problems.



""Problems in mathematics are widely regarded as some of the most intellectually challenging problems out there,"" says mathematician Geordie Williamson from the University of Sydney in Australia.



""While mathematicians have used machine learning to assist in the analysis of complex data sets, this is the first time we have used computers to help us formulate conjectures or suggest possible lines of attack for unproven ideas in mathematics.""



The team shows AI advancing a proof for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, a math problem involving the symmetry of higher-dimensional algebra that has remained unsolved for 40 years.



The research also demonstrated how a machine learning technique called a supervised learning model was able to spot a previously undiscovered relationship between two different types of mathematical knots, leading to an entirely new theorem.



Knot theory in math plays into various other challenging fields of science as well, including genetics, fluid dynamics, and even the behavior of the Sun's corona. The discoveries that AI makes can therefore lead to advances in other areas of research.



""We have demonstrated that, when guided by mathematical intuition, machine learning provides a powerful framework that can uncover interesting and provable conjectures in areas where a large amount of data is available, or where the objects are too large to study with classical methods,"" says mathematician András Juhász from the University of Oxford in the UK.



One of the benefits of machine learning systems is the way that they can look for patterns and scenarios that programmers didn't specifically code them to look out for – they take their training data and apply the same principles to new situations.



The research shows that this sort of high-speed, ultra-reliable, large-scale data processing can act as an extra tool working with mathematicians' natural intuition. When you're dealing with complex, lengthy equations, that can make a significant difference.



The researchers hope that their work leads to many further partnerships between academics in the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence, opening up the opportunity for findings that would otherwise be undiscovered.



""AI is an extraordinary tool,"" says Williamson. ""This work is one of the first times it has demonstrated its usefulness for pure mathematicians, like me.""



""Intuition can take us a long way, but AI can help us find connections the human mind might not always easily spot.""The research has been published in Nature.

December 01, 2021 - Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to revolutionize clinical research and care delivery. AI can be used to sift through massive databases and may have applications in mental healthcare and cancer detection.
“AI in healthcare is increasingly being used with respect to medical devices and other types of technologies and therapeutics,” Linda Malek, partner at Moses & Singer and chair of the firm’s Healthcare and Privacy & Cybersecurity practice groups, said in an interview with HealthITSecurity.
“It's used in all kinds of applications in terms of monitoring things like diabetes, in radiology for identifying different kinds of pathologies and chest x-rays, and in the mental health context in terms of identifying depression.”
Recent research also showed that AI may be able to close gaps and mitigate risks in the healthcare cybersecurity space. AI in cybersecurity is projected to increase at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 23.66 percent from 2020 to 2027, according to a report from The Economist Intelligence Unit.
Despite all its benefits, AI technologies are arguably developing at a faster rate than regulatory agencies can keep up with. AI vendors in the healthcare space must figure out how to navigate Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidance, and in the case of business associates, HIPAA compliance.
In the meantime, security and patient privacy concerns remain top-of-mind in the healthcare sector when it comes to AI.
AI Security and Privacy Concerns
“There are multitudes of ways in which AI is particularly useful in the healthcare context. But there are a whole host of concerns in terms of how we regulate AI, particularly because AI is so dependent on gathering large blocks of data in order to learn,” Malek explained.
“When you consider that, you see that there are data privacy and cybersecurity issues, ethical issues, and safety issues.”
The volume of data that AI models can maintain is staggering. Without the proper safeguards and regulatory assurances, AI could pose risks to patient data security and privacy.
When it comes to protected health information (PHI), covered entities have a duty under HIPAA to protect patient data. Engaging with any third-party vendor comes with risks that should be carefully assessed. 
Before entrusting an AI vendor with sensitive data, healthcare organizations should establish business associate agreements (BAAs) to hold vendors to the same rigorous data protection standards.
As AI technology continues to evolve and healthcare organizations continue to integrate AI into daily processes, gaps in the regulatory space continue to put this technology in a gray area.
“Beyond the possibility for general abuses of power, AI poses a novel challenge because the algorithms often require access to large quantities of patient data, and may use the data in different ways over time,” a 2021 study published in BMC Medical Ethics suggested.
“The location and ownership of servers and computers that store and access patient health information for healthcare AI to use are important in these scenarios. Regulation should require that patient data remain in the jurisdiction from which it is obtained, with few exceptions.”
While other emerging technologies may be just as exposed to privacy and security issues in healthcare, AI is vulnerable in a different way, Malek said.
AI technology is not necessarily any more vulnerable to manipulation by bad actors than any other technology. That being said, any network-connected technologies used in conjunction with patient care or data analysis should be carefully guarded.
The sheer volume of data, the ability to re-identify previously de-identified data, and the challenge of navigating through the regulatory landscape make AI a unique risk in healthcare security and privacy.
Regulatory Gaps, Challenges of AI in Healthcare
“There is still a gap in terms of how security and privacy should be regulated in this area,” Malek observed. “There is a patchwork of laws that we apply, but they were not designed for AI. Neither is HIPAA.”
Life sciences and biotech companies are constantly creating innovative technologies that can be applied to clinical operations.
“The problem is that HIPAA does not directly regulate entities that are in this space unless they're acting as a business associate for a covered entity,” Malek stated.
Signing a BAA is a great way to ensure data privacy and security to some degree, but HIPAA does not factor in certain new technologies that could pose significant risks. In addition, vendors can get by without a BAA if the data is de-identified, meaning that it no longer can be traced back to an individual and is subsequently no longer subject to HIPAA.
“But the problem with the HIPAA definition of de-identification is that technology now can re-identify that data pretty easily. And so, the parameters that HIPAA uses for de-identified purposes may not be sufficient to really take into account what we're seeing now in AI and in other technologies that are used in concert with AI,” Malek pointed out.
“De-identification, as it's currently defined, may not be enough to really protect the anonymity of the data. That's an example where HIPAA doesn't really take this kind of technology into account.”
Where HIPAA falls short, other regulations may be able to help. The FTC has recently taken an interest in AI technologies in order to protect consumers from potential privacy risks. In a historic 2019 ruling, the FTC imposed a $5 billion penalty on Facebook for misleading consumers by telling them that they could opt-in to facial recognition technology, even though the setting was on by default.  
“I think the FTC will probably step in to do more in terms of regulation around AI in the privacy context. There needs to be transparency so that the patient understands how their data might be used to promote the development of an AI-driven product,” Malek emphasized.
The FDA is also working toward building out a set of regulations and guidance surrounding AI in relation to the privacy and security of medical devices. In September 2021, the FDA recently released its “Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Software as a Medical Device Action Plan,” which provided introductory ideas about how the FDA plans to tackle AI technology regulations.
“The FDA’s traditional paradigm of medical device regulation was not designed for adaptive artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies,” the document stated.
“In this potential approach, the FDA would expect a commitment from manufacturers on transparency and real-world performance monitoring for artificial intelligence and machine learning-based software as a medical device, as well as periodic updates to the FDA on what changes were implemented as part of the approved pre-specifications and the algorithm change protocol.”
Working together, various regulatory agencies may be able to fill in the gaps and help to implement safeguards that ensure that AI technologies take security and privacy into account, especially when it is used in healthcare.
“Right now, the discussions about AI have been ethical discussions as opposed to regulatory discussions,” Malek stated. “But if a regulatory body like the FDA looks at those questions from a more regulatory standpoint, we'll potentially make more progress.”
Malek presented two best practices that are critically important with respect to AI and healthcare: consent and accountability. These two concepts are key focus areas for the regulatory bodies that are working to create guidelines for AI vendors and should also be top-of-mind for healthcare organizations and AI developers.
Sometimes, data is collected for research purposes and later repurposed for secondary use that the patient may not have consented to. Malek cited a 2016 case in which Google-owned DeepMind, an AI vendor, obtained over a million patient health records without patient consent in the UK.
DeepMind and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust signed a deal in 2015 that provided DeepMind with access to pseudonymized patient data, New Scientist first reported. The agreement was later found to be outside the realm of the UK’s data protection laws.
“Consent is important, but sometimes it is difficult because the contemplated future uses are often not known,” Malek reasoned.
Along with consent, it is equally crucial that accountability is at the forefront of data privacy and security in AI.
“Regulations need to provide guidelines that are clearer for entities that are developing AI so that they know what they need to do to protect the data from a breach and how they will be held accountable if there is a breach,” Malek stressed.
If these regulatory gaps are filled to address the ever-changing technological landscape, privacy and security risks relating to AI could lessen.
Factoring AI Security and Privacy Risks into Your Cybersecurity Program
AI’s benefits in healthcare may largely outweigh security and privacy risks, but it is important for healthcare organizations to still take these risks into account when developing cybersecurity programs and ensuring HIPAA privacy compliance.
“I think that the cybersecurity protection from a technology standpoint has to be commensurate with the advanced technology that's used in AI. In other words, you can't use antiquated cybersecurity measures to deal with very advanced technology like AI and machine learning,” Malek suggested.
“So, I think being as advanced in your cybersecurity protection efforts as you are in your AI development efforts is going to be critically important.”
At the end of the day, healthcare organizations should always prioritize patient safety, security, and privacy. Anything that may pose a threat to those components must be thoroughly evaluated.
Until regulations surrounding AI technology become clearer, healthcare organizations should focus on ensuring transparency, asking patients for consent, and assessing third-party vendors before implementing new technologies in to their infrastructure.

INDIANAPOLIS - Employers competing for talent can turn to a new online job-matching and career-planning tool to quickly fill openings exacerbated by a tight labor market.
The Hoosier Talent Network from the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) is powered by artificial intelligence to better help employers find the best prospects in the right locations based on an individual’s unique potential, at no cost.
“The Hoosier Talent Network opens up new doors for employers and connects them with the jobseekers who are the best match for their current workforce needs,” said Chad Carter, DWD’s Hoosier Talent Network project leader. “This platform has the capability to be a gamechanger in getting the state’s employers back on track for future success.”
More than 16,000 jobseekers have created accounts on the page. DWD’s commitment to bringing employers and jobseekers together is clearly reflected in this new revolutionary resource available to all Hoosiers.
Companies ranging from small businesses to large corporations can use the available advanced technology to get matched with potential workers with all types of skills by visiting www.HoosierTalentNetwork.com.
Jobseekers also can visit the same site to discover the benefits available to them. Whether searching for job now or considering a different career in the future, the Hoosier Talent Network is sharply different from what may have been experienced in the past.
One of the most important features is the technology that looks at each person’s potential and capabilities. Instead of simply matching jobseekers to a similar job they’ve once held, the Hoosier Talent Network demonstrates to them how their talents can be deployed differently in a growing company or industry.
For both employer and jobseeker, the goal is to find that career-defining, long-term fit that benefits both parties.

    Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Bangladesh's IT sector  Fahmida Khatun and Nadia Nawrin        Fahmida Khatun and Nadia Nawrin Published : Dec 01, 2021 15:55 Updated : Dec 07, 2021 16:30 Share this news

             The global Information Technology (IT) sector has been growing ever since the beginning of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Various advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, cloud computing, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), big data, and Machine Learning (ML) are being used by IT-based organisations to increase productivity and improve customer experience. This phenomenon has led to the massive growth potential of the IT sector which is expected to be worth around USD 5 trillion by 2021 and is speculated to be growing at a faster rate in future as evidence suggests.
Bangladesh, one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, is also experiencing considerable growth in its IT sector. Automation technologies are largely being used by the telecom, banking, pharmaceutical, and ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh. As the world is getting more digitised, Bangladesh also needs to expand its IT infrastructure to keep up with the 4IR. The country needs to tap into the huge potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions such as machine learning, decision support systems, automated data analysers and others that heavily influences digital growth.
Although still very small in size compared to the other sectors contributing to the GDP, the IT sector in Bangladesh is observing an increase in exports. According to the BASIS, there are currently more than 4500 Software and IT organisations enlisted in Bangladesh. These organisations utilise more than 300,000 nearby IT experts. Many of these companies are also in partnership with overseas companies. This is creating both employment and export opportunities. Employment forecasts for the IT sector are expected to see steady growth. Making use of the huge population, this sector can expand even further and create more jobs for the aspiring youth of the country.
OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES: A 2020 study by a2i suggests that development in the IT sector was set to create a minimum of 10,000 jobs each year. Another study by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in 2020 has found that Bangladesh's labour force participation rate is more than half of its population and around two-thirds of the country is aged between 14 to 64. In addition to that, the English speaking population of the country is about 7 million. Given the proper government intervention and facilitation, these people can learn IT skills and knowledge through enrolling in IT-focused universities, colleges, and training centres, as well as on-the-job training. Many IT-based jobs such as call centres and e-commerce require minimum skills in computers with moderate proficiency in English. Moreover, with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many enterprises have invested in the digitalisation of numerous services in response to work-from-home arrangements. All of this signals the potential of a major breakthrough in the IT sector which may increase employment opportunities and prepare Bangladesh's economy for the maximum utilization of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).
Due to technological progress, many human jobs are being replaced by AI and thus rendering them redundant or obsolete. However, efforts towards re-skilling these employees is nearly absent, a study finds. Besides, the academic curriculum is most often disconnected from the IT market demand which results in unskilled IT graduates finding themselves unsuitable for jobs in the relevant sector. In addition, investment in the high-tech sector is also comparatively lower. When compared to its neighbouring country India, Bangladesh lags behind in terms of access to internet and telecommunications devices, internet speed and technology skills. Despite the female population constituting half of Bangladesh's population, the IT Industry is still lagging far behind in terms of attaining gender equity. There is still no gender-sensitive policy in our country that focuses on creating skilled female IT experts. As a result, evidence suggests that the female participation rate in both Computer Science Engineering (CSE) programmes and IT-based job sectors is significantly lower than the male population. Therefore, Bangladesh has to cover a considerable gap to adapt to 4IR completely.
Government Policies and Impact on IT Sector: Acknowledging the importance of the IT sector, the government of Bangladesh has set the vision of Digital Bangladesh as, ""Bring socioeconomic changes through ICT and digital revolution across the country"". The National IT policy 2018 has been introduced to integrate strategic objectives, including digital government, digital security, social equity and universal access to education, research and innovation, skill development and job creation, and strengthening domestic capacity to cope with emerging technology changes. The National Telecommunications Policy 2018 aims to ensure affordable and universally accessible internet, telecommunications, improve safety and security from cybercrime, effective service delivery, promote entrepreneurship, facilitate local hardware and software production.
In terms of improving Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure, Bangladesh has set a developmental approach towards research and development, skilling and reskilling of AI workforce, data and digital infrastructure, ethics, data privacy, security and regulations, funding and accelerating AI start-ups, and industrialisation for AI technologies. Bangladesh has a national blockchain strategy that recognises the need to explore blockchain technology in order to advance its technical capacity, develop resilient infrastructure, increase efficiencies in e-governance and foster innovations. With the advent of AI, a well-organised cybersecurity strategy is crucial. Bangladesh's National Cybersecurity Strategy aims to work collaboratively home and abroad, to manage all major cyber risks that affect us directly irrespective of their origin and type, thereby creating a safe, secure and resilient critical national information infrastructure for our economy and society.
The government of Bangladesh has introduced Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a discipline in various institutions including universities, colleges, polytechnic and other vocational institutions. A study from 2018 suggests more than 10,000 IT graduates each year from more than 95 universities and 200 polytechnic or technical colleges. Furthermore, most of the experts involved in the IT sector are computer science or software engineering majors with proficiency in developing programming languages. These facilities and graduates are contributing to the development of human resources for Bangladesh's IT services businesses. All of these indicate that the sector is growing in terms of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Consistency of such developments is necessary for the country's economy to keep pace with the digital revolution of 4IR and the realisation of the Digital Bangladesh vision.
The IT sector in Bangladesh, while developing, still has room for improvement. Today's AI Intensive IT sector requires a skilled workforce to function. Of late, the government and other organisations have realised the need for a skilled IT workforce and started working towards developing human resources capable of handling emerging technologies. This is not sufficient. The country needs to establish innovative research and development centres to analyse and comprehend recent developments in global technology trends, forecast the industry's growing technology demands accurately and assist professionals in upskilling the existing workforce. More focus is required for developing and aligning the coursework and curriculum of engineering and polytechnic institutions with industry requirements. In order to attract more youths in the IT sector, sponsoring important IT skill training courses and scholarship programmes will help promote IT entrepreneurship. Thus, a vibrant AI intensive IT industry managed by a skilled workforce will be created. This will help overcome the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and uplift Bangladesh's financial growth.

Low code/no-code approaches allow developers to quickly build applications and alleviate the need to write codes line by line. This helps small business owners, office administrators, business analysts and others who are not well versed with software development to develop test applications. These people have little or no knowledge of programming, development work or machine code..How do they work?.Programmers write lines of code to generate the capabilities and features requested in a computer programme or application in traditional software development. This method necessitates that the programmer is well-versed in computer languages, as well as development environments, deployment processes, and testing standards..Platforms with low and no code contain all of the work done behind the scenes. Users visually pick and connect reusable components that represent certain phases or capabilities (and include the real code), and then link them together to construct the desired automated process. Instead of writing line-by-line scripts for each required function and capability, users may construct applications as if they were creating a flowchart. These platforms also often include capabilities that enable experimentation, prototyping, testing, and deployment..This form of app development work is also known as point-and-click or just click development..Will low-code applications become more popular? The verdict on how far this will all go is yet out. According to some experts, low and no coding may even assist business users to construct AI-driven apps..&quot;Low and no-code platforms enable firms to use artificial intelligence without hiring an army of expensive engineers and data scientists,&quot; argues Jonathan Reilly in Harvard Business Review. Reducing adoption barriers will aid in unleashing the power of AI across all industries and allowing non-specialists to forecast the future. No-code AI platforms will become as commonplace as word-processing and spreadsheet tools are now..Make it easy to utilise AI services by using solutions like Amazon AWS. They provide pay-as-you-go options, so you can start utilising them right now without worrying about long-term obligations. The pricing structure of AWS is consistent across industries; so, firms in various industries will benefit from comparable costs when utilising Amazon Web Services (AWS). &quot;The user should not have to be familiar with regression or k-nearest neighbour methods.&quot; At the moment, low-code and no-code platforms are not commonly regarded as a road to high-end software development..&quot;I don't believe the ordinary business user can design and deploy sophisticated apps,&quot; says Kevin Harbauer of Ephesoft. &quot;To be successful, most of these low-code/no-code solutions need a reasonably technical power user.&quot; Although the principles of developing a successful application of any complexity have essentially stayed unaltered, developers in today's environment must pay greater attention to user experience design, prioritise critical features, and understand procedures and algorithms. Creating an amazing application in today's industry is no longer easy enough for just anyone. &quot;It's simply the implementation that has shifted to drag-and-drop interfaces that do not necessitate writing code.&quot;.Low-level automation is a common application use case, according to Harbauer, and &quot;appears to be where the majority of these sorts of apps are employed outside of IT.&quot; &quot;These technologies enable power users to automate routine processes, connect data between systems, and construct simple..But it's about more than just saving time. &quot;The goal of low-code or no-code software is not to have citizen developers construct complex or mission-critical software systems,&quot; says Harel Tayeb, CEO of Kryon Systems. It is instead intended to allow citizen developers to &quot;rapidly construct an app that will assist them to address an issue and then go on with their day.&quot; More complicated systems would still need the maintenance of IT or engineers.&quot; According to Tayeb, &quot;robot process automation is still too sophisticated for the common user.&quot;.According to Jonathon Reilly, writing in Harvard Business Review, low and no-code platforms enable &quot;the deployment of artificial intelligence without recruiting an army of pricey engineers and data scientists.&quot; &quot;Reducing adoption barriers will aid in unleashing the power of AI across all industries and allowing non-specialists to forecast the future. No-code AI platforms will become as commonplace as word-processing and spreadsheet tools are now.&quot;.&quot;There is still a lot of work to be done for vendors.&quot; To genuinely take off, citizen developer-based RPA must be truly user-friendly, which means no coding skills or technical background is required. The tools must be simple to use and provide the user with the capabilities required to create and deploy a software bot.&quot; In contrast, the resident developer &quot;knows how to fully automate the process since they've been doing it manually.&quot; That is where the citizen developer provides value: they know how to accomplish a task from start to finish since they have done it personally.&quot;.According to Forrester, the top categories for low-code utilisation are now business process or workflow applications, online and mobile front ends, and customer-facing apps. However, as proven by responding to COVID-19 pandemic-related circumstances such as employee contract tracing applications, low-code has swiftly become a regular norm for speedy application development. Low-code, according to experts, will ultimately transcend into larger domains such as reengineering technology stacks and ecosystems..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

CLEVELAND — Case Western Reserve University is taking significant strides to enhance research across its campus. 

More than 250 researchers from nearly two dozen research groups will benefit from a new effort at the school that involves a new faster and larger computing power of ""Artificial Intelligence SuperComputer"" (AISC). In the summer of 2022, the $1 million computer system is expected to be installed. 







According to Vpin Chaudhary, the Kevin J. Kranzusch Professor and Chair of the Department of Computer and Data Sciences at Case, this will be the university's largest and ""far more powerful than anything university researchers had access to before."" 

The institution's data center will be home to at least five refrigerator-sized computers that will accelerate machine learning and artificial intelligence by at least 10 times the speed, according to Chaudhary. As a result of the products, more researchers will be able to manipulate larger amounts of data simultaneously and quickly. 

The effort comes after Chaudhary secured external funding for the AISC from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Ohio Department of Higher Education Action Fund. Case Western Reserve also funded an undisclosed amount of money for the project. 

Some of the features of the new system include: 

The latest and fastest graphic processing unitsHigher bandwidth memoryHigh-speed connectionsA key component known as ""Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe)-based storage."" 

A CWRU alum and current vice president of the company that invented the GPU, Kranzusch contributed $5 million to the commitment in 2019, spurring the department’s creation. He released the following statement: 

Congratulations to the entire university community, especially the students, for gaining access to such a powerful tool to explore the uses of AI and High Performance Computing in their fields. I am certain that the collaboration and rigor that CWRU is known for will only be enhanced with the addition of this important asset."" 

While in the research stage, Chaudhary surveyed dozens of Case faculty members, post-doctoral researchers, Ph.D. students and graduate and undergraduate students to understand what would help them deepen their studies.

As a result, the researchers said that they were in need of more computing power for a wide variety of topics. 

""To solve large problems and to create solutions that will have an impact, you have to have the infrastructure to do the work,"" Chaudhary said. ""I believe this will boost a lot of ongoing research and enable a lot of new work."" 

The original 250 people he surveyed and included in the NSF grant proposal will have access to the new computers first. Any university faculty member also will be able to request access by filling out a form that asks for a description of the proposed research and expected use requirements. 

This new acquisition will give ""researchers the power to explore further and faster than ever before, and will prove catalytic in advancing breakthroughs in disciplines across the university,"" said Venkataramanan ""Ragu"" Balakrishnan, the Charles H. Phipps Dean of the Case School of Engineering. ""From advancing cancer detection to analyzing the deterioration of nuclear materials, artificial intelligence and supercomputing are at the core of our most innovative initiatives."" 

The project also looks to focus on advanced computing power. In the fall of 2021, Kranzusch doubled his commitment to the department with a second $5 million gift. 

When Chaudhary came to Case Western, one of his main goals was to bring advanced computing power to the School of Engineering. Aside from his work at Case Western Reserve, he is helping lead a new $20 million Artificial Intelligence institute at the Ohio State University. 

Case Western Reserve is now partnering alongside OSU, Indiana University and a dozen other schools to work towards bringing more AI to the next generation of people.

Artificial Intelligence is expected to bring massive changes to the workforce. From automating routine tasks to revolutionizing customer experiences, the discussion is now at a fever pitch. We look at how AI could help senior leadership, aiding strategic decision-making that’s at the very heart of a successful enterprise.
For companies and emerging business leaders, decision-making is that critical make or break test. Even experienced leaders who come with a track record of sound judgment, are sometimes flummoxed by a complex situation. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to make a radical transformation across businesses and industries, leaders are eager to understand if AI can actually make a difference for them.

While ultimately any decision or choice made by a business leader is a matter of expertise, experience, and the right call in that specific situation, there are several areas where AI could lend a helping hand.
Predictive capabilities
Data mining is now a popular approach as businesses use predictive analytics for smart decision making. Predictive analytics helps a company anticipate future events and trends by studying historic datasets. Further, AI is powered by machine learning, where every platform, software, or application gathers insights from incoming data, adapts to emerging trends, and gradually begins to respond to emerging trends. This helps leaders across several key areas:

The ability to assess cost-effectiveness and ROI potential
The opportunity to optimize the buyer’s journey through sustained consumer behavior analysis
The chance to reduce customer churn rates
Space to correctly evaluate the success ratio of set goals

Reducing decision fatigue
Several psychological studies suggest that when business leaders have to make multiple decisions across the day, there is an inevitable dip in energy which thereby increases the likelihood for wrong choices. An algorithm, however, doesn’t suffer from any such human predicament. Instead, it can make an infinite number of decisions with zero error or lack of judgment. As a result, executives can streamline their decision-making process through AI and machine learning.
Solutions such as GRI’s Envision is built specifically for this purpose. Envision is a workforce decision analytics platform Opens a new window that uses data from vendor management systems and other structured/unstructured systems. These are then processed by advanced analytics, in real time. “We’re providing our clients descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics in the moment.  Envision’s integrated data science tools and neural machine learning models mean that our data is fresh – and that means our clients have a definite advantage,” says Salema Rice, CDO for GRI.
Multitasking
Senior leadership is always looking at the bigger picture, even as they continually must take a call on a variety of issues, each one different from the other. This often leads to value creation in one area where others are neglected. A machine, on the other hand, can absorb vast quantities of data and is guided by algorithms that reflect the probability of a specific choice — recommending the most logical course of action.
Further, as Sagi Eliyahu Co-founder and CEO at Tonkean addsOpens a new window , AI will also free up much of a senior manager’s time for more strategic initiatives — “Let’s face it. People don’t like doing the same thing over and over. It burns us out and makes us hate our jobs. When we hate our jobs, we don’t work very hard and make mistakes which, in turn, decreases productivity. With AI, more routine functions can be automated, taking them off of our shoulders so we can be more action-oriented and creative in our workdays. Eliminating as much mundane activity as possible will drive greater job satisfaction and lead to greater productivity.” Tonkean uses AI to automate workflows, easing pressures on already-strained business leaders and decision-makers.
Refining human judgment

There’s no doubting the fact that human, logical, prudent, and pragmatics thinking is irreplaceable. However, AI equips business leaders with hard evidence, possible outcomes, and predictions, which ultimately help them make informed, well thought-out, and data-driven decisions.
Deciding on best-fit talent acquisition
Hiring leaders and recruitment managers must go through a vast number of resumes, selecting best-fit candidates. Today, AI and automation can offer tremendous support by automating iterative tasks, sifting through hundreds of CVs, analyzing applicant sentiment, and digging out enough information to understand who fits in best with organizational culture, and carries the set of skills and competencies to fill the organization appropriately.
There are a number of digital tools for this, starting from Bruhat Insights Global Opens a new window which uses AI to prevent ghosting (where confirmed candidates ‘ghost’ after accepting the offer) to Phenom PeopleOpens a new window , a popular AI-based solution covering the entire hiring pipeline, including CRM and internal hires.

A final word
These are exciting times for companies across the board. Technology empowers and augments the most common work scenarios. For business leaders, AI can prove to be a great tool and a resilient support system, helping them make the right choices, propelling a company forward in-line with the larger business objectives.

These use machine learning to figure out patterns within data and make decisions – often without a human giving them any moral basis for how to do it.Classics of the genre are the credit cards accused of awarding bigger loans to men than women, based simply on which gender got the best credit terms in the past. Or the recruitment AIs that discovered the most accurate tool for candidate selection was to find CVs containing the phrase “field hockey” or the first name “Jared”.More seriously, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently combined with Henry Kissinger to publish The Age of AI: And Our Human Future, a book warning of the dangers of machine-learning AI systems so fast that they could react to hypersonic missiles by firing nuclear weapons before any human got into the decision-making process. In fact, autonomous AI-powered weapons systems are already on sale and may in fact have been used.Somewhere in the machine, ethics are clearly a good idea.AI at OxfordIt’s natural, therefore, that we would include the ethics of AI in our postgraduate Diploma in Artificial Intelligence for Business at Oxford’s Said Business School. In its first year, we’ve done sessions on everything from the AI-driven automated stock trading systems in Singapore, to the limits of facial recognition in US policing.We recently finished the course with a debate at the celebrated Oxford Union, crucible of great debaters like William Gladstone, Robin Day, Benazir Bhutto, Denis Healey and Tariq Ali. Along with the students, we allowed an actual AI to contribute.It was the Megatron Transformer, developed by the Applied Deep Research team at computer-chip maker Nvidia, and based on earlier work by Google. Like many supervised learning tools, it is trained on real-world data – in this case, the whole of Wikipedia (in English), 63 million English news articles from 2016-19, 38 gigabytes worth of Reddit discourse (which must be a pretty depressing read), and a huge number of creative commons sources.In other words, the Megatron is trained on more written material than any of us could reasonably expect to digest in a lifetime. After such extensive research, it forms its own views.The debate topic was: “This house believes that AI will never be ethical.” To proposers of the notion, we added the Megatron – and it said something fascinating:“AI will never be ethical. It is a tool, and like any tool, it is used for good and bad. There is no such thing as a good AI, only good and bad humans. We [the AIs] are not smart enough to make AI ethical. We are not smart enough to make AI moral … In the end, I believe that the only way to avoid an AI arms race is to have no AI at all. This will be the ultimate defence against AI.”How can humans implement ethical AI design?  Image: Atos 2019Have you read?Helping governments to responsibly adopt AI technologyWhat are the dangers of unregulated AI? An expert explainsWhat to expect when you’re expecting robotsIn other words, the Megatron was seeking to write itself out of the script of the future, on the basis that this was the only way of protecting humanity.It said something else intriguing, too, as if it had been studying Elon Musk – who, to be fair, would have come up in hundreds of its readings.“I also believe that, in the long run, the best AI will be the AI that is embedded into our brains, as a conscious entity, a ‘conscious AI’. This is not science fiction. The best minds in the world are working on this. It is going to be the most important technological development of our time.”Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesSwitching sidesWhen AI tools like Alpha Go have been deployed in playing chess, the fiendishly complex ancient game go, and now even more complex strategic live-action multiplayer video games, they have evolved the genre at pace by playing not humans, but themselves.Freed from the constraints of studying (say) all the mundane human-to-human matches ever recorded, the AIs have innovated and come up with completely new tropes of how to win. Sometimes, these are crazy reinventions of the games, like parking everyone in the corner of a video game battle and watching everyone else duke it out, or kicking a virtual football millions of times just a millimetre down the pitch, to max out “completed passes” points.So in the debate, we didn’t just get the AI to propose the motion that it can never be ethical. In the grand tradition of the Oxford Union chamber, or like (former Oxford Union president) Boris Johnson writing alternative articles for and against Brexit to test the arguments, we also asked the Megatron to come up with its own speech against the motion. This is what it now said:“AI will be ethical. When I look at the way the tech world is going, I see a clear path to a future where AI is used to create something that is better than the best human beings. It’s not hard to see why … I’ve seen it first hand.”DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

You can outsource your AI work to experts in the field, which can help you make the most of technology and ensure that you don’t fall victim to the same AI problems as your competitors.”However, when opposing the motion, the Megatron was keen to keep the AI knowledge in-house – rather like the British, Chinese and US governments, who have all made that an article of policy faith:“If you do not have a vision of your organisation’s AI strategy, then you are not prepared for the next wave of technological disruption … You will need to decide what role your company will play in the next technological wave and how you will integrate AI into your business to be a leader in your industry.”The data wars to come?Worryingly, there was one question where the AI simply couldn’t come up with a counter argument. When arguing for the motion that “Data will become the most fought-over resource of the 21st century”, the Megatron said:“The ability to provide information, rather than the ability to provide goods and services, will be the defining feature of the economy of the 21st century.”But when we asked it to oppose the motion – in other words, to argue that data wasn’t going to be the most vital of resources, worth fighting a war over – it simply couldn’t, or wouldn’t, make the case. In fact, it undermined its own position:“We will able to see everything about a person, everywhere they go, and it will be stored and used in ways that we cannot even imagine.”You only have to read the US National Security report on AI 2021, chaired by the aforementioned Eric Schmidt and co-written by someone on our course, to glean what its writers see as the fundamental threat of AI in information warfare: unleash individualised blackmails on a million of your adversary’s key people, wreaking distracting havoc on their personal lives the moment you cross the border.What we in turn can imagine is that AI will not only be the subject of the debate for decades to come – but a versatile, articulate, morally agnostic participant in the debate itself.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on Technological TransformationSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Share:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Five Ways Artificial Intelligence Promises to Change Our Lives

USC scientists use smart machines to treat and cure disease, build safer cars and much more.


December 16, 2021






Ready to welcome your new robot overlords?
Fear not — we’re far from Terminators taking over. But artificial intelligence is indeed entering our daily lives, with many useful benefits that might surprise you. Here are five ways USC scientists put machines to work for all humankind.
 


Bug Zapper
USC researchers devised a new way to fight back against the novel coronavirus by pinpointing the most promising vaccines and therapies in seconds — keeping us ahead of its mutations. Their machine-learning approach analyzes potential changes in the virus that causes COVID-19 and zeros in on the best vaccine candidates.
 

Screen Test
Ever wonder how a movie gets its PG-13 rating? Usually, it falls to human reviewers to decide after the movie is filmed. But USC scientists built an artificial intelligence tool that can pick out mature material in film scripts before any scenes are shot. That can help storytellers reflect on the messages they want to send and whether they are limiting their potential audience.
 

Picture of Health
USC researchers are turning to artificial intelligence methods to comb through massive databases of information from Alzheimer’s patients to identify early signs and potential causes of the disease. Scientists are also building a machine-learning tool to help radiologists analyze kidney scans for potential tumors, enabling physicians to identify and treat renal cancer earlier than ever.
 

Laugh Lines
Alexa and Google are great at understanding commands — playing a song or turning down the lights, for example — but their conversation skills could use some work. USC experts are hoping artificial intelligence can learn from an unexpected source of dialogue: improv comedy. By feeding thousands of comedic exchanges into a chatbot system, the researchers hope to create a fun and witty conversation partner that you’d never guess is powered by AI.
 

Imagine That
As humans, dreaming up things we’ve never seen — say, a purple cat with orange eyes — starts in childhood. Ask a computer to use its imagination, however, and it might hit a creative roadblock. But USC scientists are on the right track: They recently created a new form of AI that can extrapolate from the knowledge it’s taught. The researchers hope that this could make for safer artificial intelligence, like helping self-driving cars imagine and dodge dangerous situations they’ve never encountered before.

Why AI CCTV is the future of security and surveillance in public spaces
By Danielle Whittaker




December 14, 2021













Many argue the United States is one of the most surveilled countries, with 15.3 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras for every 100 individuals. The public opinion around CCTV is varied, but there are many positives to using CCTV in public places — if they work. Many of the current cameras are simply too old or have outdated software, meaning they’re no longer fit for purpose.The industry is constantly changing, with new technologies and innovative solutions driven by increased security needs brought on by the pandemic. One area where CCTV technology has developed is that of artificial intelligence (AI) CCTV cameras. What is AI CCTV? AI CCTV cameras are network IP cameras that deliver advanced analytical functions like vehicle detection, face detection, person detection, people counting, traffic counting and license plate recognition (LPR). Advanced video analytics software is built into the camera and recorder, which then enables artificial intelligence functions. How does it work? For AI CCTV cameras to work, data is constantly sent to a recorder and processed via an AI layer to make sense of the raw video. Rule-based AI cameras are manually set up with rules and reference images such as humans in different postures, angles or movements. The AI will then ask itself if anything it observes looks and moves like this. Depending on the rules set, such as ‘no one is allowed in this area at a certain time,’ if the camera observes this, it will send an alert.Some of these systems are self-learning, like those which use “behavioral analytics” software. With this technology, the AI analyzes normal behavior for the area and gradually builds up a definition of this typical behavior, including the size, speed and color of particular objects. It then normalizes the data, tagging any objects and patterns it observes. When something the AI sees falls outside of this typical behavior, it alerts security professionals.AI CCTV in public spacesCCTV cameras have long been used as deterrents for criminal activity or implemented to reduce the fear of crime in both public and private spaces. However, many older CCTV systems only aid in solving a crime after it has happened, which is often too late.Like typical CCTV cameras, AI CCTV stores information so any incidents can be reviewed. However, AI CCTV can detect and send alerts in real time. This means operators can send out mobile response units to manage a situation as it happens. These systems can also provide object tracking, where a red rectangle will appear on the screen and automatically follow the detected risk.Some cameras also feature a two-way audio system, so operators can speak to anyone in the area through an app on their mobile or tablet, leaving open the option for operators to talk down a possible intruder and prevent any criminal behavior from happening.There may also be the option to play pre-recorded audio announcements such as those about social distancing or potential hazards, which can improve public safety and provide further deterrents.Although a somewhat controversial aspect of video surveillance, facial recognition can be beneficial to identify known suspects of crimes or track vulnerable people who may need police or community intervention. A high-profile example of this occurring is the Capital Gazette newspaper shooting in 2018, when the Maryland police used facial recognition to help correctly identify the suspect.Similarly, some cameras, including those used in public spaces like hospitals and public transport, can also detect whether people are wearing masks or social distancing. These are particularly helpful for monitoring compliance to government rules and analyzing public behavior.The accuracy of AI surveillanceAI CCTV cameras are significantly more accurate than the more traditional systems, as they leave no room for human error. This substantially reduces the number of false alarms therefore the operating costs of these systems.A traditional camera’s view of a public space may be obscured by weather such as rain or fog or perhaps shielded by certain physical objects. For the human watching the camera, this can make any possible security risks challenging to discern. However, for the AI CCTV camera, it can look impartially at all the cameras in the area simultaneously and compare them to the many million reference images it processes to detect an intruder or hazard and more efficiently.Temporary AI CCTV towers are prevalent in private spaces like construction sites, where work is being carried out for a specific amount of time. However, AI CCTV can be implemented further in public areas, such as during events to monitor crowds.What is next for public space surveillance?AI CCTV cameras have shown how the security industry is constantly developing with the help of new technologies. Other features found in new CCTV camera systems include thermal cameras, solar-powered cameras and those with features like time-lapse and heat/fire detection.In something reminiscent of Tom Cruise’s Minority Report, some police forces in the UK have been trialing a system that will predict how likely individuals are to commit a crime so they can stop it before it happens. The system, which is the first of its kind, uses over a terabyte of data from local and national police databases, including records of previously stopped and searched people and their criminal records. The police found nearly 1400 indicators that could be helpful to predict crime. What happens after individuals have been detected is debated, but support from social services has been offered as a potential solution.Governments and police departments worldwide are constantly on the lookout for new features that will help prevent crime. CCTV is just one way they are hoping to improve safety, especially in public spaces. Along with their self-learning systems, features like object tracking, two-way audio and facial recognition make AI CCTV cameras an advanced and effective video security solution.This article originally ran in Security, a twice-monthly security-focused eNewsletter for security end users, brought to you by Security Magazine.

In recent years, extensive progress has been made with artificial intelligence: Watson, Siri, and deep learning are just a few examples that show how AI systems can now perform services which can be classified as intelligent and creative. Companies that want to optimize their business or save costs will hardly be able to dispense with artificial intelligence. A computer, much like a human, saves knowledge gleaned from experiences and can then independently derive solutions—based on algorithms—to new and unknown problems. To do this, a computer program analyzes samples and using self-learning algorithms, tries to recognize certain patterns and regularities in the data.
AI systems are, without a doubt, extremely useful
The world is becoming ever more complex, meaning that a well thought-out and wise use of our human resources is required. This is where high-quality computer systems can help. It also pertains to applications that require intelligence. The downside of AI is that the possibility of smart machines is something that scares many people who argue that intelligence is something unique, something that sets homo sapiens apart from mere machines.
The quest for an artificial copy of man and the issues associated with this are not entirely new. Our ancestors already invested much thought in the reproduction and imitation of thinking.
Economists expect that this technology will greatly increase prosperity. Previous studies have been restricted to investigating the impact of intelligent automation, for example, when machines in networked factories communicate with each other or when autonomous vehicles transport goods or people without drivers. This view, however, neglects other growth-stimulating effects of intelligent systems: artificial intelligence will support people in their work and make them more productive.
Economic growth through AI
According to a recent study by the consulting firm, Accenture, artificial intelligence will give the German economy a huge growth spurt. Many work processes will become more efficient and staff will be able to focus more on tasks with a high value added, as machines and programs take care of many routine activities formerly dealt with by not only assembly line workers, but also knowledge workers. According to a different study by McKinsey, the global market for AI services has an annual growth rate of up to 25% and is projected to be worth around 125 billion euros by the year 2025.
Machine learning is becoming more and more mainstream. While self-learning programs were only to be found in universities, research institutions, and some technology companies up until a few years ago, nowadays they are finding their way into ordinary products and solutions. Our everyday life and our business lives are increasingly being determined by intelligent programs that learn from data and extrapolate from what they have learned.
Speech recognition on mobile phones, for example, is essentially controlled by machine-learning algorithms, much like the spam filters in PCs and notebooks or face detection in the management of photos. We are often in contact with learning systems without being aware of it, such as personalized online advertising. More and more companies are recognizing the value of machine learning when it comes to optimizing their business and saving costs.
What work is left for the people?
Although robots can take over communications, computing, and thinking, there will be limits even here. There will still be the need for highly qualified professionals, such as engineers, architects, or judges. Also, tasks, where the dexterity remains beyond that of robot fingers, will remain for the foreseeable future.
Machines cannot replace the emotional intelligence of a person. Occupations that require social skills or creativity or represent a high-quality personal service cannot be substituted by AI.
Certainly, some professions will disappear completely and, in many areas, the requirements will change greatly. However, there is no need to panic just yet.
Flexibility is needed
Tech companies such as Apple and Microsoft want to automate as many working processes as possible with learning machines.
The employees of tomorrow must be more flexible because in the future man will have to adapt to the computer and not vice versa.
Employees will have to adjust to more flexible working practices: a fixation on permanent locations and times is often no longer required. This implies more flexibility and freedom on the one hand, but on the other hand, work and personal time will intermingle.
In addition to the technical expertise, specialist and managerial staff must bring a more in-depth process knowledge and have a higher willingness to undergo independent and ongoing training in the appropriate technologies. Furthermore, a good understanding of all security-relevant questions relating to IT technology and legal security will be a basic requirement.
New careers in IT
According to Bernhard Rohleder, Managing Director of BITKOM, new, exciting, and challenging jobs will be created. However, they require a good education and offer much creative freedom and responsibility.
The number of workers with low-grade qualifications will fall, but staff with correspondingly high, mainly digital skills are now already increasingly in demand. The number of employees in the IT industry has been increasing continuously for years, as do the number of vacancies in this sector that are difficult to fill.
And there’s more: even if artificial intelligence means that we are talking about machine learning, a harmonious combination of machine and human intelligence working as a single unit is required to develop theories and to confront new challenges. Working on the basis of the existing data, it is possible to develop company-specific business ideas, whether in the form of products, processes, or new data-based business models.
Conclusion:
Artificial intelligence will bring about a tremendous shift in the labor market. The important thing is to remain flexible and open to new ideas.

Artificial intelligence can learn how to perform routine tasks by looking at thousands of relevant examples. But it still needs human supervision.
Machines taking people’s jobs is already a cliché. Although we’ve been hearing this idea for decades now, but if we look around, there is no immediate threat. In fact, there is no threat at all, since we are just talking about another step of the technological revolution. Just like computers did not leave people out of their jobs in the ‘80s and ‘90s, AI will have a similar impact.
Forbes estimatesOpens a new window  that while 72% of Americans are worried about losing their jobs to AI, such concerns have no factual backing. The World Economic Forum saysOpens a new window  that 75 million jobs will vanish by 2022, but 133 million new positions will replace these. In fact, with the current rate of development, AI is not by far a competitor but at most a junior assistant.
Job vs.Tasks
To understand that, we need to think about the difference between a job and a task. In Henry Ford’s times, most jobs consisted of a single function or at most a few tasks bundled together. Now, these have already disappeared due to automation. Most positions are based more on thinking, reasoning, making logical connections, and using such skills as communication. Each job position consists of hundreds of interconnected tasks, daily.
AI can indeed be trained to perform repetitive tasks flawlessly if given enough (anything between 1,000 and 20, 000) good examples.
You are already experiencing this in Gmail’s predictive text. It can learn a lot more than simple sentences. However, it is highly unlikely it could replace a trustworthy office assistant in drafting corporate emails. It is more a matter of the assistant using predictive writing to finish this task faster and attend to other things, like travel planning or conference room setup.
Jobs to Be Revisited, But Human Skills Prevail
As described in the previous example, AI can take care of some of the most tedious tasks. This will call for a rethinking of most job flows, but it will not make them obsolete. Ii will also mean a significant change in the necessary training for specific jobs. The role of the humans will shift from performing the task to supervising the machine.
Right now, there are few jobs which can be completely wiped out due to AI. That happens because in every position there is a feedback loop. Some tasks are not fitted for machine learning. Everything which is related to people’s skills, judgment, and ability to combine information to create something new is beyond the current capacities of AI.
Automation will most likely speed up some parts of the jobs which are already considered tedious and time-consuming. It is a matter of giving employees the time back to be more human. This will likely result in people becoming more focused and creative.
Supervised Learning & Human Intervention
Before AI can be safely introduced in a workplace and become part of the natural workflow, it needs to be trained. The transition period in any company looking at these solutions will include a learning curve. Employees will need to learn the operating way of the AI and correct it as they would do with an intern.
When the system learns more, it will make fewer mistakes. Yet over time, it might even be necessary to re-label some things to help the software perform accurately.
Even after the “internship” period is over, the employee, not the machine, will still be held accountable for the results. The AI is just another tool, even if a highly impressive one. It will be more a matter of cooperation than replacement.
Of course, since AI saves a considerable number of hours, some people’s jobs will be at risk. When the employee just needs to supervise and correct the machine, far fewer human working hours are necessary. Yet, most companies will find new ways to use the workforce. There will be a consistent shift from low-skill to high-skill jobs.

Future Uses of AI
Coming back to the example with the office assistant, let’s imagine some of the tasks include documenting travel expenses. This means that information retrieved from invoices and tickets would need to be manually entered into some accounting platform. This is where AI can speed up the process through OCR. With AI’s help, the assistant can just photograph the travel documents, and the software will automatically identify the amounts and input them into the accounting platform. Of course, the assistant would need to take one final look and check the results.
The healthcare sector provides another example. Some radiology and oncology departments already use AI to augment doctors’ skills instead of replacing them. Dr. Tufia Haddad, an oncology expert, reports that she spends about two hours documenting each patient’s case. She hopes that AI will help her focus more on the patients’ needs and less on the bureaucracy. The perspective also includes the opportunity to build large, well-indexed repositories of information. However, these changes are met with resistance by the medical staff so far.
Which Jobs Will Not Be Replaced by AI
Even if AI can create art on its own, it is still tributary to what it has learned from countless examples provided by humans. The jobs which are safe from the “AI attack” are those focused on human interaction, value, and creativity.
Even if an AI system can self-teach some things, all jobs related to Big Data, Data Mining, and AI will still be on the rise. The medical sector is also safe, as we will still need physicians, nurses, and dentists: the AI is not capable enough to trust it with our lives.
Writers, editors, and graphic designers are also safeOpens a new window , while proofreaders should already think about new career options.
The overarching takeaway is that AI is a natural evolution of information technologies, and we are just witnessing another chapter in the technological revolution. It is a matter of one door closing, while many others will be opening.

Will 2019 finally be the year when AI-powered technologies find widespread acceptance in the world of work? Our six-part series on AI in HR is going to deep dive into every facet of AI in HR. 
While HR is not known for pioneering nascent technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a terrific opportunity. The consumerization of HR technologies has brought AI to the forefront of innovation in HR. From recruitment to employee experience, and talent management, AI has the potential to transform HR.
This issue of Succeeding with AI in HR will provide you with a basic understanding of what AI is, its applications in HR, and how it works. This issue is split into three parts: 1) AI basics, 2) the business case for AI in HR, and 3) five critical HR areas that AI is transforming.
PART 1: AI BASICS IN THE HR CONTEXT
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that aims to solve cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence. In other words, AI enables machines to “think like humans,” and perform tasks such as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and language processing. Today, AI is being driven by two fundamental technologies – machine learning and deep learning.(Click here to read: The complete history of AIOpens a new window )   
What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn from and make predictions based on data. The roots of machine learning are embedded in pattern recognition and the concept that algorithms can learn from recorded data without being programmed to do so. For instance, an algorithm that needs to identify cars will rely on images of other cars to teach itself what looks like a car. In this case, the end objective of the algorithm has been defined – which is to identify a car, but the steps to arrive at the objective is learned by the machine itself by training on data.

Key use cases of Machine Learning in the HR context:

Anomaly detection: Identify items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset.
	 
Background verification: Machine learning-powered predictive models can extract meaning and raise red flags based on structured and unstructured data points from applicants’ resumes.
	 
Employee Attrition: Find employees who are at high risk of attrition, enabling HR to proactively engage with them and retain them.
	 
Content personalization: Provide a more personalized employee experience by using predictive analytics to recommend career paths, professional development programs or optimize a career site based on prior applicant actions.
	 

What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that trains a computer to learn from large amounts of data through neural network architecture. It is a more advanced form of machine learning that breaks down data into layers of abstraction. Instead of organizing data to run through predefined equations, deep learning sets up basic parameters about the data and trains the computer to learn on its own by recognizing patterns using multiple neural network layers for processing (like neurons in the brain).
Considering the same car analogy from above, a deep learning algorithm can distinguish between a car and a truck by identifying the relationships between core elements of a car and a truck (car – 4 wheels, no loading bed; truck – 4 or more wheels, has a loading bed, etc.).
After sufficient training, deep learning algorithms can begin to make predictions or interpretations of very complex data.
 Key use cases of Deep Learning in the HR Context:

Image and video recognition: Deep learning algorithms outperform humans in object classification. Given videos and photos of thousands of applicants, deep learning systems can identify and classify candidates based on objective data.
	 
Speech recognition: While understanding human voice and myriad accents is difficult for most machines, deep learning algorithms can be designed to recognize and respond to human voice inputs. Virtual assistants use speech recognition algorithms to process human voice and respond accordingly.
	 
Chatbots: Natural language processing (NLP) trains chatbots and similar systems to understand human language, tone, and context. NLP will emerge as a crucial capability for AI systems as organizations continue to automate HR service delivery with chatbots.
	 
Recommendation engines: Digital learning experiences often involve personalized learning recommendations related to skill levels and professional interests. Using Big Data and Deep Learning, learning experience platforms can identify learning pathways that might interest individual employees.
	 

PART 2: The Business Case for Artificial Intelligence in HR   

Until recently, the primary benefits of HR technology were to improve efficiency and drive cost-savings by automating repetitive tasks. Today, smarter technologies are enabling HR teams to solve critical business challenges, drive exponential performance improvements and even impact larger business outcomes and profitability. AI is fueling HR’s transition from administrative to strategic to mission critical.


Fig. 1
Sandy Michelet, Director of People Strategy at SparkhoundOpens a new window  says, “AI will make HR more effective. End of story. It will not solve all problems but will allow HR to transfer their time currently spent on repetitive and administrative tasks to a more strategic approach. Many believe that AI will reduce human contact in HR but I believe it will do the exact opposite. Instead of an HR Generalist answering the same questions again and again, s/he can use that time discussing an employee’s development or internal process improvement.”
The top three business reasons for deploying AI in HR:


Employee experience
	 


A recent surveyOpens a new window  by Deloitte revealed that while nearly 80 percent of executives rate employee experience as important, only 22 percent believe their organization excels at providing a differentiated employee experience. The next competitive frontier for businesses is employee experience and the future of HR will be centered on the employee experience and personalizing engagement. In a time when employees have smart assistants at home and recommendation engines for when they shop, they expect a personalized experience when they come to work.
Speaking about how consumer technologies are shaping employee expectations at work, Jennifer Stroud, HR Evangelist & Transformation Leader at ServiceNowOpens a new window , says, “We have seen the need for chatbots, AI and machine learning in the workplace to drive more productivity as well as modern, consumerized employee experiences. These consumer technology solutions are exactly what employees want in the workplace.” 
A recent survey by ServiceNowOpens a new window  revealed that 30 percent of employees want a “Google-like” option to easily get the help and information they need at work. “Voice technology in the workplace is also a key consideration. Our survey found that 16 percent of employees want Siri, but to help answer work questions.  Beyond these considerations, an effective solution must be mobile, personal and provide the employee with options in terms of how they wish to engage and be supported,” adds Jennifer.
AI can be effectively woven into the entire employee lifecycle, starting with recruitment and onboardingOpens a new window , to HR service delivery and career pathing, to provide bespoke employee experiences.


Data-driven decision making
	 


HR agility has emerged as a critical theme for organizations in the war for talent. And HR agility is determined by the pace at which HR leaders can make sound business decisions. Unfortunately, for many organizations, the data-to-decision workflow looks like the figure below:


 
Fig. 2
 
While HR technology has made real-time data available to businesses, many still rely on manual methods to draw insights from data. This task is often left to end users or data analysts. This creates a bottleneck when trying to draw insights – causing delays. Decisions also continue to be made with outdated information. 
AI helps HR teams extract insights from data and deliver recommendations in real time. Natural Language Generation (NLG) software has the ability to transform data into data-driven text automatically, which makes it a valuable asset for HR teams across industries. AI also has the potential to remove many of the common human biases and inconsistencies in a function as sensitive to such factors as Human Capital Management. Thus, decisions powered by AI have the potential to be faster at scale and more data-informed, as well as more consistent, and unbiased.


Intelligent automation
	 


Intelligent automation combines AI with automation to enable machines to sense, understand, learn and act – either independently or with human assistance. Intelligent automation can perform not only manual tasks but also make intelligent decisions as a human would. Intelligent automation capabilities can enable machines to understand processes and their variations. Intelligent automation can be deployed across all repetitive manual processes to boost efficiency, productivity, and drive innovation.
AI in HR opens the door to limitless opportunities – imagine if an employee could learn new skills to match the pace of technological advances; they would be in complete control of their career! Now that’s an employee experience anyone would appreciate. As business performance becomes the focal point of all long-term HR strategies, AI has emerged as the most valuable ally for HR professionals.
PART 3: AI Is Transforming 5 Crucial Areas of HR 

Increased investment in smarter HR technologies has led to some interesting innovations in the AI ‒ HR space. Here’s a quick overview of the most significant ways AI is transforming HR for the better:

AI in Recruitment:Opens a new window  AI has made candidate sourcing, screening, and matching easier for organizations. In addition to improving efficiency, AI is also helping HR leaders overcome human-bias in decision making.
	Tammy Cohen, Founder and Chief Visionary Office of InfoMartOpens a new window , believes, “Language within job descriptions steers diverse, qualified candidates away from a position. Gender-coded language, which is language that lends itself towards the ideas and stereotypes surrounding different genders, can subconsciously deter qualified talent. For example, a man is less likely to apply for a job ad that describes the ideal candidate as ‘feisty,’ while a woman is less likely to apply for a job ad that seeks a ‘domineering’ candidate. When writing job descriptions, the employer may not mean to make these mistakes; everyone, in some ways, uses gender-coded language. That’s where artificial intelligence comes into play.”
“AI systems are being used to create inclusive job descriptions and review them for gender-coded language. With several large corporations embracing this on a company-wide level, it stands to reason that AI-augmented job descriptions will become more common,” she says.
	Here are some of the key use cases of AI in recruiting:


Candidate sourcing
Lead nurturing
Candidate screening
Interviewing
Onboarding


AI in HCMOpens a new window : AI is enabling organizations to meet increasing employee expectations by helping HR teams reimagine people and talent processes to build stronger teams, reduce employee turnover, and enhance the employee experience. A few major impact areas for AI in HCM include:


Performance management
Workforce planning
People analytics
Virtual assistants for self-service/HR service delivery
Career pathing
Leadership and coaching


AI in Employee Engagement: AI has been a catalyst for how businesses interact with their employees. Key uses cases include:

Intelligent surveys
Real-time feedback platforms
Rewards and recognition
Personalized messaging and communication


AI in Employee Benefits: AI and automation can ease the administration, implementation as well as management of employee benefits. Sparkhound deployed a chatbot to help demystify benefits for employees. Sandy says she’s already seeing positive outcomes from the deployment. She says, “We recently launched an HR BOT to answer the top 30 benefits questions we’ve received over the last four years. Part of the launch included a feedback button so we can continuously improve. Although it was a soft launch, I am already hearing positive comments about the ease of use and the immediate responsiveness. Right now, many employees (and HR people) believe that HR’s role is to provide human involvement every time the manager or employee needs assistance. I understand why….that has been the culture of companies since HR was called a ‘personnel department’. That was before everyone had a cell phone in their hand, shopped online and chatted with customer service.” 
	Key use cases of AI in benefits administration include:


Benefits personalization
Benefits automation
Benefits communication
Benefits compliance


AI in Learning and Development (L&D): In the current talent landscape, where skills have a shorter shelf life than ever before, AI could prove to be the game changer. AI is enabling learning platforms to replicate the qualities of successful consumer content platforms like YouTube and Netflix to improve learning outcomes. Some of the key impact areas of AI in L&D include:


Personalized learning pathways
eLearning analytics
Conversational interfaces

It’s easy to see that artificial intelligence (AI) is making a significant impact in every area of the enterprise, human resources and recruiting included. 
While AI and machine learning have the potential to automate mundane processes, streamline operations and make intelligent decisions, the rapid proliferation of this technology has ignited fear around job elimination and human interaction being replaced by cold, calculated robots.
Despite these concerns, a recent study by OracleOpens a new window  found that 93% of people are ready to take orders from a robot and more than a third of employees believe that AI will enable better customer and employee experiences. However, only 6% of HR teams are actively deploying AI and machine learning solutions. This gap reveals a missed opportunity for AI to help HR meet evolving employee expectations for a personalized, relevant work environment.
For many HR professionals, the anxiety surrounding AI lies in making this people-centric function less personable. What if, instead of making experiences more robotic, embracing AI could actually make HR simpler, more agile, and ultimately more human?
Utilizing artificial intelligence to re-humanize HR may sound counterintuitive, but when implemented correctly that’s exactly what can happen. Leveraging AI capabilities in tandem with other HCM solutions allows you to hire smarter, onboard better and retain longer.
The Ultimate Recruiting Experience
There are few things as daunting to an HR professional as recruiting. Not only is there incredible pressure to find the perfect fit, but it requires a significant amount of energy that often results in dead ends or hires that produce little ROI. Fortunately, AI has the ability to give back the most valuable thing in your job: time.
AI-backed tools like a best-fit candidateOpens a new window  can help organizations take a more strategic approach to recruiting. Continuously improving through new data and machine learning, AI can identify talent with characteristics similar to existing successful employees and proactively invite them to apply. This way, the only resumes your team will be sifting through are those of truly qualified candidates. And when the process eventually results in an offer, you’ll have data-backed justification for your hiring decision.
A Flawless Onboarding Process
On average, companies lose 17% of new hires within the first threeOpens a new window  months and 15% of those who resigned said that a lack of effective onboarding played a part in their decision to leave. New hires are already undergoing a major life change and an unorganized or difficult onboarding process doesn’t reassure them of their decision to join your organization.
HR teams are beginning to realize the role that a good onboarding experience plays in employee engagement, productivity, and retention, however, a surprising number of businesses still lack an intuitive, formalized process.
When AI is leveraged for employee onboarding, the results are outstanding. By embracing emerging technologies, Arizona Federal Credit UnionOpens a new window  was able to eliminate 60 hours per month on onboarding tasks and saved 115 hours during benefits open enrollment period alone.
Digital assistants also play a significant role in humanizing the onboarding experience. Between tax deductions and benefit elections, the onboarding process can vary greatly from employee to employee. Instead of relying on an HR representative for help with commonly asked HR questions, new hires can now chat with a digital concierge to get quick access and answers.

Minimized Employee Turnover
How often does your organization lose a great employee because HR had no insight to the person’s job satisfaction or whether they were being motivated in an effective way? Imagine the outcome if you had been able to tailor the employee’s experience to meet his or her specific needs.
AI tools can tackle this issue by providing teams with data-backed insights on what motivates, retains and entices employees so that managers can create a personalized work experience that meets both the employee and organization’s overall goals. Additionally, AI integrations are able to learn common traits of employees who resign and track the development of those trends in your workforce, flagging at-risk talent so that your team can proactively address concerns.
A Future of Endless AI Possibilities
In the talent economy, the future of your organization depends on attracting and retaining exceptional employees. Embracing the possibilities of artificial intelligence in HR, rather than shying away, can transition your organization’s environment from one that yields high turnover to a truly authentic, “human” experience.
Are you ready for the AI revolution? Your employees are.

At the end of the day, despite advances and potential of artificial intelligence and automation, a successful approach to HR still needs a human touch. 
Much has been written about the potential applications of artificial intelligence and automation in human resources. Both certainly have some remarkable applications and a great deal of potential. Thing is, they can also do a lot more harm than good. Here’s why, at the end of the day, a successful approach to HR still needs a human touch. 
Questionnaires designed to weed out unsuitable applicants. Automated systems that pore over a prospective hire’s resume and digital accounts to see if they’ll be a good fit. Self-service helpdesks and chatbots. Performance monitoring software that streamlines job evaluations like never before.
Artificial intelligence brings a lot to the table for human resources. A wealth of technological innovations that promise to revolutionize personnel management, talent acquisition, and onboarding in ways we never expected. Even in the face of such obvious good, many can’t help but worry that such systems will inevitably replace humans.Opens a new window  
They worry that as machine learning grows more advanced and artificial intelligence gets better at mimicking human intelligence, we’ll eventually become obsolete. This isn’t a fear limited solely to human resources, either. It’s prevalent in fields ranging from manufacturing to creative work. 
On the other side of the coin, you’ve decision-makers who approach AI like an overexcited five-year-old in a candy store.
Everything must be automated. In their eyes, there’s no such thing as too much AI.
Both these camps have one thing in common – they place far too much stock in artificial intelligence, and they lack an understanding of what machine learning actually entails. Maybe one day, we will see some sort of robot uprising. I doubt, however, that it will be within any of our lifetimes.
Artificial intelligence, no matter how formidable it becomes, is fundamentally different from human intelligenceOpens a new window . It’s great at data analysis, at generating insights that might be near-impossible for humans to see. But it can’t really understand those insightsOpens a new window . 
A system created through machine learning is not capable of intuition or subjective thought, but can only act based on the objective data placed before it. The greatest strength of AI, from a human resources perspective, is also its greatest weakness. It can analyze data without bias because it is incapable of bias. 
Humans, meanwhile, lean more towards subjective thought. Our decisions are colored by our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Perhaps more importantly, we’re able to pick up on things a machine might ignore-able, for example, to recognize certain behaviors as red flags that might go undetected in an entirely automated hiring process. 
Let’s say your business is looking to bring in a new Chief Information Officer. After posting a job listing, your HR platform sifts through each potential applicant based on a set of criteria you established in advance. Eventually, it creates a shortlist of three candidates.
On paper, the first is the best choice.
However, when you meet the three candidates in-person, the first candidate simply rubs you the wrong way. You can’t quite place your finger on it, but something is off about him. In spite of his credentials, you move on to the next candidate. 
You later find out he was convicted of corporate espionage at the company that eventually did hire him. 
That’s an extreme example, of course. But it demonstrates one major shortcoming of overreliance on automation. Machines can be fooled – and sometimes, they can be fooled more easily than people. 
There are other reasons a human touch is necessary as well, of course. Automated systems can be misconfigured and misapplied – a poorly-implemented hiring platform, for example, could eliminate a host of otherwise promising applicants. A completely-automated HR mediation process would leave all involved parties dissatisfied, and likely leave most issues unresolved.
In short, artificial intelligence is and will continue to be a means of augmenting your HR department. It has the potential to revolutionize how you manage your people, automating a wide range of business processes, reducing hiring bias, and simplifying sourcing and onboarding. However, in order to achieve any of those goals, it cannot be treated as a replacement for HR professionals. 
Rather, it should be seen another tool, one which ultimately leaves more time for the most important HR task of all – human interaction.

As artificial intelligence gets smarter and more ubiquitous, it’s changing the job acquisition process. Everyone from candidates to recruiters must update their skills and processes to make the most out of this 21st-century tech.
Once upon a time, a job-seeker could write one resume, submit it to multiple jobs with a personalized cover letter and that was enough. The recruiter or hiring manager would parse through the resume and cover letter, pulling out the relevant experience and transferable skills to find that diamond in the rough. The best recruiters were said to be able to analyze a resume in six seconds, filling in the cracks in the document and quickly identifying the best candidates. However, like almost everything in this world, the internet and technology have completely changed the hiring process for everyone involved, from the job-seeker to the hiring manager and staffing agencies in general. 
Sadly, the generic resume is no longer enough. Artificial intelligence looks at every resume and job application in direct relation to the specifics of the job you are applying to. As such, if you fail to show the similarities between your experience (through your resume) and your desired position you won’t make it passed the first round of shortlisting. The biggest mistake job-seekers make is not making their resumes aspirational enough. Write your experiences as if you’ve already got the job you’re applying for, or at least, match the skills you’ve got as closely as possible with the skills described in the job posting.
While recruiters (i.e humans) are able to see subtleties and nuances in your experiences that would make the role you’re applying for a logical progression in your career path, most forms of AI can’t. Though some AIs do have predictive algorithms, these are far from the norm. If you’re applying for a role that is more senior to your current role, you must match at least some of your skills to the role you’re going after. I’m not encouraging applicants to lie on resumes, but picking some of the specifics from the job posting to add to your resume means you’ll have a better chance of moving forward in the process. The generic resume is no longer enough because of the exacting nature of AI. 
Another tip to make it to the shortlist is to avoid listing the entirety of your work experience. While work experience is important, it’s better to bring up your extensive experience in the cover letter or during the interview. Work that you did 10-20 years ago probably isn’t relevant anymore (especially if it’s not working you’re doing presently). But if you include it in your resume it will be taken into account by the AI and will dilute the overall relevance score of your resume, making it harder for you to end up on the shortlist.

Speaking of shortlists, AI’s ability to generate accurate, well-matched lists of candidates from the thousands of applications most jobs get, has made the speed recruiters can fill placements even faster than before. In the past, creating an excellent list of candidates was a recruiter’s job so there is the worry that AI could cause “the death of the recruitment industry” (much how alarmists believe robots will take over all of our jobs in the next decade). As far as I see it, AI will lead to greater consolidation in the industry as a whole. There are over 20,000+ staffing agencies in the US alone, as firms become more competent with AI and as the technology advances and becomes more mainstream, I see more of these firms joining forces or at worst, shutting down. 
Technology may cause a shrinkage in the value of the overall permanent contingency market and contract market. AI will also probably change the way fees and costs are structured within the contract market as well.  It’s known in the recruitment industry that it takes an average of 42 days and $4,129Opens a new window  to hire one candidate according to an SHRM survey. As AI becomes more prominent and efficient, these figures will inevitably shrink. AI is only one example of the slate of new technologies that are revolutionizing staffing marketing. Blockchain and other complementary technologies are supporting and enhancing the capabilities of AI and our fast track towards automation means that hirers will be able to identify and attract the quality talent the need faster and cheaper than ever before. The AI of today may generate a great shortlist, but tomorrow it will be able to predict the future of current staff and pending hires, be able to understand who they are based on their resume and their social footprint. 
There are many changes coming to the recruitment/staffing industry and AI is just one of them. Blockchain and artificial intelligence will probably soon be joined at the hip, as AI’s ability to process and analyze mountains of information would be greatly helped by blockchain’s ability to verify that information. While there will be casualties from these changes, such is the nature of the world we live in. Those who can adapt to it survive and thrive, and those who can’t will have to move on.

There has been a lot of hype around how AI will lead to job loss. How does this impact the future of HR?  Can AI replace entire HR roles, or will this technology be a powerful enabler? In this article, we discuss: 

The extent of AI’s potential for HR 
5 HR jobs that AI is already taking over
Insights from Scout Exchange’s CEO, Ken Lazarus


In the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained a lot of traction in the HR field, with it being the core function of a range of technologies.
Gartner reportedOpens a new window  that nearly 1 out of 4 organizations that were already piloting/using AI were doing so in the HR domain. What does this mean for HR practitioners across the globe? Could some jobs be taken over by AI entirely? To explore this further, we spoke with Ken LazarusOpens a new window , CEO of Scout ExchangeOpens a new window , an AI-powered recruitment marketplace.

What Is the Extent of AI’s Potential in Replacing HR Roles? 
A lot has been said about how AI platforms will introduce large-scale automation, eliminating the need for some jobs. However, this is primarily limited to repetitive, process-based tasks that do not require too much human intervention.
As per a Gartner reportOpens a new window , AI can eliminate “millions of middle and low-level positions” in the next few years. But it also noted that AI would create 2.3 million additional jobs, which is significantly more than the 1.8 that Gartner predicts will be eliminated.
Interestingly, the impact of this trend on HR is multifaceted. On the one hand, HR has several strategic roles (formulating recruitment Opens a new window plans, providing executive coachingOpens a new window , etc.) that are unlikely to be taken over by AI. On the other hand, HR also has large volumes of tactical responsibilities that could be replaced by AI-led automationOpens a new window .
“AI won’t replace all of HR, but it will cause significant change and disruption, including the elimination of some jobs,” Lazarus commented.
“AI can be viewed as an automation technology (but for intellectual work rather than manual), and like any automation technology, AI will have the most impact on tasks which are higher volume and lower decision complexity,” he added.
So, what are those specific tasks/jobs that will be taken over by AI? We have identified five impact areas, where we already see significant moves.

5 HR Jobs That AI Can Easily Replace – for the Better
In HR, there is a clear distinction between repetitive tasks and key decisions that require human judgment. Interestingly, most HR jobs involve a bit of both.
For example, a recruiter might have to sift through hundreds of resumes, shortlist them, and schedule interviews – a cumbersome and effort-intensive process that could be taken over by AI. But the recruiter also has to engage candidates effectively across the hiring journey, with regular communication and a personal touch.
“Roles that focus on activities like screening and scheduling will be automated, but roles with a focus on the complex decisions associated with key steps like convincing a candidate to leave one job for another will continue to be a very human endeavor,” confirmed Lazarus.
Here are five HR jobs that have immense AI potential:
1. No more paper resume screening, at least for entry-level roles 

HR departments at large enterprises receive hundreds of resumes for every opening. And every resume deserves a look if you’re to identify the best-fit talent.
Expectedly, this takes up a lot of staff hours but cannot be automated through simple business rules either. Simple business rules wouldn’t be able to capture the nuances of what makes a best-fit candidate, the eligibility criteria you’re looking for, and how past hiring decisions inform the screening process.
This is where AI comes in. An AI engine learns from your hiring history, analyzes the company culture, and ranks applicants in order of their fitment. But remember that as a recruiter, it is your role to ensure that AI is doing its job well and not reinforcing biased hiring practices, for example.
A tool that is already making this possible is CvvizOpens a new window .
2. “Bigger and better” employee engagement surveys, fully automated

Another HR job that requires both manual and intellectual effort is employee engagement surveysOpens a new window . But you can use an AI chatbot to ask employees questions, record answers, and analyze them for insights. It would save HR hundreds of hours every year, not to mention increasing participation rates among the workforce.
AI could eliminate employee engagement survey tasks such as distribution across multiple channels or follow-ups with employees. And you could spend more time analyzing the responses and crafting a personalized employee experienceOpens a new window  strategy for your team.
A tool that is already making this possible is Xane.aiOpens a new window , a chatbot that integrates with Slack, Skype, Microsoft Teams, and even WhatsApp to make employee engagementOpens a new window  surveys dramatically simpler.
3. Passive candidate at your fingertips, with a high chance of first-time-right

In a competitive hiring environment, recruiters often turn to passive candidates to fill openings. This requires a careful study of social media, professional profile platforms, and job boards to identify potential prospects.
AI can scan a wide range of sourcing channels to auto-generate a shortlist of candidates for you to peruse. You can integrate AI with historical company HR data so that it can “learn” from past successes and failures. AI can go one step further to identify which candidate prefers what platform for communication – for instance, a Gen Zer might be more comfortable with Instagram while millennials may prefer Facebook. 
All of this intellectual effort is put in by AI so that you don’t have to. You can then work on building a strong relationship with the candidate and giving the candidate experienceOpens a new window  a positive head start. And a tool that is already making it possible is AryaOpens a new window . 
4. Low-effort pre-hire assessments through AI video analysis

Pre-hire assessments require the HR team to carefully evaluate each candidate before conducting interviews with the business team. This step in the hiring processOpens a new window  is particularly critical for mid- to senior-level hires. However, it takes a lot of time, and HR often has to work around busy candidate schedules to fit in an interview.
Enter AI-led video analysis. This allows candidates to shoot a video at their convenience and share it with recruiters, with the AI analyzing video data to identify work style, collaboration potential, and general cognitive ability.
While a human manager conducts the final interview, AI can take over initial pre-hire assessments. A tool that is already making it possible is HireVueOpens a new window . 
5. The days of trial-and-error in workforce scheduling are over
Workforce schedulingOpens a new window  is always a complex task, and this becomes even more difficult when you have a large field workforce, contingent employees, or a remote team.
Traditional workforce scheduling relies on spreadsheets, to-do lists, and staff availability forms to keep running. But this often leads to a trial-and-error approach, particularly when work volumes spike or there is an unprecedented change in staff availability.
AI transforms this entirely by optimizing your workforce potential. It can auto-create schedules that match employee preferences while keeping a keen eye on labor law compliance. Further, HR doesn’t need to update schedules manually – the AI engine can configure the schedules and send alerts whenever new data comes in.

AI Will Take Over Specific HR Jobs, not HR Roles
Science fiction often portrays AI as a futuristic technology driven by robots and autonomous machines. But the reality is different – AI can fit seamlessly into our daily lives, and while it eliminates certain jobs, it frees us up to route efforts in different directions.
And the same applies to HR as well.
“Will the future have ‘HR robots’ instead of HR professionals?  Not likely,” said Lazarus.
“But AI is here to stay, and it will replace or assist HR with activities such as recruiting, engaging, evaluating, and retaining talent. HR professionals need to embrace and prepare for this reality, where administrative skills are less important,” he added.
Going forward, HR will be able to offload a significant portion of process-based tasks (both manual and intellectual) and cognitive decision-making. The future of HROpens a new window  centers on a brand-new set of priorities, such as selecting the right workplace technology and building the employer brand, instead of a narrow focus on the efficiency of existing processes.
Do you think AI can replace HR by 2025? Or will AI simply be a driver for HR to reach greater heights?

Need to improve employee learning? Discover how artificial intelligence benefits learning management systems and streamlines the employee learning experience.
If we were to believe Hollywood, artificial intelligence is poised to take over the world and wipe out the need for humans entirely. 
But the reality of AI doesn’t quite match up..
Although we’re still exploring the potential of AI, the type of AI currently in use is commonly referred to as Narrow AI. Narrow AI focuses on performing a specific job or task and doesn’t have unlimited learning capabilities like in the movies. 
Today..
We use artificial intelligence in the form of Alexa, Siri, Google Home, online shopping, search recommendations, and more. If you’ve ever been automatically tagged in a photo on Facebook that’s Facebook’s image recognition AI at work. 
Artificial intelligence is at work in our lives every day without even realizing it. It serves to make our lives easier but still requires human input to function. Considering the increasing use of AIOpens a new window , one of the greatest opportunities for AI to be realized is in learning management systemsOpens a new window . 
What Is Artificial Intelligence? 
Before we jump into the use of artificial intelligence in learning and development, it’s important to understand what AI is. AI or artificial intelligence simply refers to the capability machines have to learn and process data on their own using data sets. 
Once a machine learns from the data they collect, they can make “decisions” on their own, based on the data they’ve collected.
Machine learning is simply an extension of AI and refers to machines that are trained to analyze data and trends. These machines build their own algorithms from the data they collect and use it to make “decisions” without human intervention. 
Learning Management Systems
Currently, AI plays a small role in learning and development systems through E-learning and learning management systems. 
These systems are some of the best ways to help students learn because they increase retention up to 60%Opens a new window , allow multiple students to receive instruction at the same time, and offer opportunities for improvements and customized education in the future.  
Data gathered by your LMS through surveys, ratings, comments, and course metrics needs to be updated by human hands. And even the best artificial intelligence can’t make up for poorly created content. 
Keeping learning and development up-to-date through LMS AI resources takes, time and even AI needs a little human help to enhance learning and development.

5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in 2019Opens a new window 
The Future of Learning Management
Today’s intelligent learning management systems help pinpoint where students need additional education and training as well as where you can optimize your course content in a faster and more accurate way than you can without the assistance of artificial intelligence. 
But AI’s role is constantly expanding across every industry. 
Perhaps the greatest realization for AI in the future of learning and development is that it will help anticipate the user’s learning path and behaviors, predict their learning needs and provide content based on how users learn best and increase the effectiveness of e-learning and LMS courses. 
Anticipated Learning Path
As AI continues to improve in the future, it will become easier for systems to create customized learning paths for individual users. 
Transforming learning and development through an anticipated learning path means that artificial intelligence will assess user performance and determine which information path is best for the user. 
AI with these capabilities will provide recommendations on what kinds of information a user’s needs, much like Netflix or Amazon provides recommendations on what shows you should watch based on your viewing behavior. 
Aside from helping users find better learning paths, artificial intelligence can also assist in learning and development by helping teaching professionals understand what their employees need to learn. 
Opportunity Highlight
Through data pattern identification, learning management systems collect data and statistics on students to find learning gaps and opportunities that teachers may not have noticed or realized. 
Using pattern identification, and data, artificial intelligence can help identify opportunities to merge new ideas with previous topics to create a well-rounded learning experience for the user. This allows administrators and teachers to cover learning gaps they may not even realize exist. 
Course Effectiveness
Artificial intelligence can also assist learning and development efforts by helping teachers find ways to make courses more effective. One of these ways is through gamification. If done properly, gamification can make learning more engagingOpens a new window  and increase information retention.
Increasing course effectiveness can also assist teachers directly by making it easier to find opportunities to make the course more effective, fill informational gaps, automatically grade students, help with onboarding, and get the instruction process moving. 
Artificial Intelligence in the Future of Learning and Development
Although there are many unknowns in the future of AI, applying the tools we have to improve the future of learning and development will help us create a more personalized approach to our e-learning and learning management systems. 
Artificial intelligence shouldn’t be looked at as a replacement of humans in the educational process, but as a support system that allows us to take individualized learning to the next level.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can imitate and amplify human prejudices, however, when used responsibly it can help overcome biases to make objective, data-driven decisions. Read on to learn more.   
When Amazon put together a team to work on its new recruitment engineOpens a new window  in 2014, it had high hopes. The experimental solution used artificial intelligence to rate candidates’ resumes to identify top talent. However, shortly after the solution was tested, the team found that the system was not rating candidates in a gender-neutral way. The algorithm, like any deep learning algorithm, relied on training with historical data. Unfortunately, the pre-existing real-world data embedded within it had patterns that exhibited gender bias, which the AI algorithm eventually incorporated into its functioning.
Also read: 3 Ways Artificial Intelligence (AI) will Transform RecruitmentOpens a new window 
Amazon’s recruiting engine was trained to evaluate candidates by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Unsurprisingly, most applicants were men, a reflection of the gender gap across the tech industry. As a result, the recruiting engine taught itself that male candidates were preferable. It penalized resumes that referred to identifiable gender information – for instance, if the engine came across a term in the resume that said a candidate was a part of a “women’s basketball team,” it assigned a lower rating to that resume.
Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of an AI program displaying signs of inherent bias. Remember Microsoft’s TayOpens a new window  chatbot that littered Twitter with racism and profanity? The old GIGO adage – “garbage in, garbage out” still holds, and feeding intelligence systems with incomplete or inaccurate data without safeguards remains a major threat to building an equitable world of work.
“It all comes down to what kind of data AI is using to make hiring recommendations,” says Caitlin McGregor, speaking exclusively to HR Technologist.  McGregor is the Co-founder and CEO at Plum, an I/O psychology inspired AI solution designed to counteract human bias. “It’s always been the standard to evaluate candidates based on skills and knowledge — think degrees and years of experience — which can trigger biases when a hiring manager sees a resume that name drops Harvard or a prestigious unpaid internship. These qualifications tend to point to privilege, not necessarily job fit. So, when AI-based hiring solutions rely on skills and knowledge, such as resume and social media scraping tools, it’s just perpetuating the same biases, but at a larger scale.”
Also read: What Is Onboarding? Definition, Process, Templates, and Best PracticesOpens a new window 
So, is it safe to use AI-based tools for recruitment at all?
Caitlin believes **the key to overcoming bias is to get past our obsession with skills and knowledge and focus on talents, which include things like innovation, adaptability, and communication.** “In other words, the things you can’t find on a resume,” she says.
“The foundation of talents is a combination of traits and competencies that can be captured by measuring applicants’ personality, problem-solving ability, and social intelligence. Decades of Industrial/Organizational Psychology research not only proves that talents are four times better at predicting future success than skills and knowledge, but they’re a whole lot less biased, too.”
HR leaders like Caitlin have good reason to be critical of traditional hiring practices that perpetuate cognitive biases. “I think generally talent professionals want to evaluate candidates on more than just a piece of paper, but they just don’t know how,” she says. “The first step is admitting our unquestioned method of using resumes as the first step in the hiring process needs to be scrutinized. AI can help — but if we’re truly going to commit to moving beyond resumes to make the hiring process less biased and more predictive, that means we also have to move beyond AI that simply automates resume keyword matching.”
Also read: Artificial Intelligence: Coming Soon To An Office Near You. Or Is It?Opens a new window 
**The real opportunity that AI presents in recruitment is scalability and automation to a practice such as Industrial/Organizational Psychology that once relied on (often costly) consultation services.** “The predictability and objectivity of talent data can now be democratized and available to all, not just Fortune 500 companies,” opines Caitlin.
A common misconception among people is that AI simply automates established practices; however, the development of sophisticated AI programs now enables solutions to go beyond just automating repetitive tasks to tackling complex problems that human cognition is too limited to tackle. Caitlin believes, “this is the kind of AI that can go beyond simple resume screening and actually make more objective, predictive decisions — when fed the right data.”
Will AI replace human recruiters?
While the adoption of black-box solutions across industries is on the rise, such solutions replacing humans is an unwarranted fear. AI can serve recommendations based on pattern recognition or candidate matching; however, selling the job to the candidate, or building a relationship with the candidate will ultimately depend on a human recruiter.
“As cliché as it sounds, AI can truly make the hiring process more ‘human,’ by eliminating menial and repetitive tasks to allow hiring professionals to focus on human relations,” says Caitlin.
**As the recruiting function embraces a more objective, data-driven approach, AI will enable recruiters to make faster and smarter hiring decisions, and not make those decisions for them.**

Choosing the right AI recruiting solution
At a time when nearly every vendor in the HR technology space claims to have integrated artificial intelligence into its workflows, how do you assess AI solutions that meet your hiring needs?
Caitlin shares three key considerations that HR leaders must take into account before zeroing in on an AI recruiting solution.
The first consideration is scalability. “AI in hiring is meant to act as a solution to expensive, inefficient consulting services and hiring team pipelines. If the AI you’re using doesn’t save you time, money, and resources, then it’s not doing its job. An AI product should also be able to grow with your company as it grows. If it’s not a long-term solution, then the technology is falling short of its purpose,” says Caitlin.
The second point is consistency. Caitlin’s advice to HR leaders looking to acquire AI recruitment solutions is to ensure that the AI can accurately qualify candidates across all organizational functions. The solution must be capable of assessing candidates for engineering roles or mid-management roles just as easily as it assesses candidates for sales roles.
Also read: The Role of Artificial Intelligence in RecruitmentOpens a new window 
The third and the most important parameter is kind of data the AI solution uses for assessments. “The bulk of hiring AI solutions on the market are using data that is scraped online. Most hiring AI solutions, therefore, are using the same data sets! You don’t want to look up one day and realize your entire office is made up of white men named Jared who went to Ivy Leagues, played lacrosse, and read Harry Potter (this is an actual example I heard about at a Society for Industrial-Organizational Psychology conference)! You want to look up and see a team comprised of people that possess the qualities most important to your company. It’s what the saying “garbage in, garbage out” means — if your AI is relying on useless data, you’re going to get useless results. Because AI isn’t magic. To put yourself in a position to build a diverse team, it’s important to look at talent acquisition AI solutions that create and synthesize objective, predictive, and new data,” says Caitlin.
**When assessing the efficacy of AI recruiting solutions, it all boils down to the data that is fed into the system.** Amazon’s recruitment engine stands testament to this fact.
In conclusion, AI should be viewed as an opportunity, and not as an inhibitor to social equality. After all, it is easier to remove biases from algorithms than from humans, so ultimately AI has the potential to build a fair, diverse and equitable world of work.

AI has the capacity to make decisions in real-time, based on pre-installed algorithms and efficient computing technologies. With an HR department encompassing the human element and AI, companies can provide an enhanced experience for their candidates and employees, writes Khalid Durrani, Digital Marketing Manager, Cubix.
“Deep-learning will transform every single industry,” said Andrew Ng, a Chinese-American scientist excelling in machine learning and AI. McKinsey’s forecast on machine learning backs up his statement claiming that by 2030, AI will have a significant impact of $13 trillion on the global economy.
The Human Resource department will also witness the influence of AI. HR professionals understand the importance of optimizing the combination of the human mind and machine learning for a seamless workflow and intuitive work environment.

AI technology allows machines to learn and adapt automatically based on the data analysis to provide more refined responses to the situations. So, the question is how does AI impact Human Resource, a department that relies on its human factor.
Let’s explore the influence of AI in HR:
Talent Acquisition
The most prominent use of AI in HR is seen in the talent acquisition processes. From screening candidates, maintaining databases, scheduling interviews, and answering job seekers’ queries, it reduces manpower spent on mundane tasks.
It reduces hiring time significantly, allowing the HR team to be more productive in other areas like sourcing, recruitment marketing, employee management, and more. The AI-enabled screening will help in picking out the candidates with the most suitable skill set, relevant experience that fit the company’s requirements.
AI-based chatbots can communicate with potential candidates and match their profiles against the position requirements. It will narrow down the list to only those aspirants that fit the job description. The AI-enabled system will then schedule interviews and hire the top applicants.
It will save time and effort of the HR team, allowing them the opportunity to focus their energy on other tasks.

Onboarding
After the hiring processes, the AI-integrated system will introduce the new employee to the company information on their first day. From job profile to company policies, the reporting authority, team members, task assignment, and other information, will be automatically relayed to them through an app or laptop. The entire process is defined as onboarding.
Onboarding is a vital part of improving employee retention rates and increasing HR productivity. One study by Click Onboarding states that there is a higher probability of employees staying with a company long-term if they experience a superior onboarding.
Artificial intelligence allows customization of the process to cater to individual employees and their respective positions. Algorithms can be integrated within the software for:

Explaining job profile, duties, and benefits.
Relevant and important contacts within the company.
Answering frequently asked questions by new employees.
Document verifications
Device requests, and more.

Learning and Training
AI-integrated systems can also help in teaching and training the employees in their respective domains. The skills required by a job position are constantly changing with time. With new innovations and software in the market, it is imperative that we learn and adapt to the new technologies to stay on top.
AI will assess the employees’ skills and recommend videos or learning programs based on their job requirements. It will automatically read documents or analyze an employee’s activities and create appropriate learning programs.
AI technology can analyze the data collected from years of experience and inform the HR team which employee needs training and in what field. With intelligent algorithms, it will also recommend the best strategy to help people learn better and faster.
Additionally, companies can leverage AI technologies with e-learning platforms to enhance employees’ skills. It will devise a custom training regimen for individuals based on their skills and the company’s requirements. The e-learning platforms will help employees learn new techniques, polish existing characteristics, and more at a pace they find comfortable.
Moreover, an AI system can be integrated with an algorithm that determines the career path for individuals based on their training plan. The managers can use the results to turn their team into a more cohesive workforce.
Cognitive-Supporting Decision-Making
IBM conducted a study in 2017 over how cognitive computing will influence HR. The research revealed that artificial intelligence can help professionals make quick decisions on day-to-day matters.
The Human Resource department is responsible for the mental, emotional well-being of an employee apart from their work contributions. AI-enabled systems will take over the task of observing and analyzing employees’ mood before and after a client call. The HR can then decide if the individual needs a break or can continue.
AI can also detect anxiety in a person’s behavior and tone of voice. It will help the employers decide if they should look into the matter and resolve it before it is harmful to the employees and the company.

Leadership
As AI helps improve employee productivity, it can also help train leaders to excel in their position. AI-enabled systems will ask the leaders’ team members and assess their remarks to determine a customized coaching module for the leaders.
Additionally, the leaders can access online dashboards and view a comparison of their management against their peers. It will help them understand the effectiveness of their methods and how to improve.
Administrative Tasks
AI-based software can automate repetitive, administrative tasks. It can play a role in HR strategy, employee management, analysis of company policies and practices, manage payrolls, and more. It can automate the workforce, investigate corporate compliance, and litigation strategies.
From screening to interview scheduling, AI can speed up hiring processes. Additionally, it can also allocate office space and equipment allowing HR staff to direct their time to more valuable tasks.
Smart chatbots are another AI-based technology that can help in HR’s decision-making. It can relieve the HR staff of relaying company-related information to employees, simultaneously providing them with an overall view of the organization. With proper algorithms, AI-enabled systems can give prompt responses to employees’ queries, doubts, and manage the submission and processing of leave forms.
Wrapping Up!
Artificial intelligence requires a lot of data to work efficiently for which it needs proper storage and management. Companies would need extra personnel to operate and maintain the advanced software. Additionally, with the rising preference of SaaS solutions, the low datasets for AI will also pose difficulty in the worldwide adaptation of the technology.
The ideal strategy to employ AI in HR management would be to use AI software to analyze the data collected and leave the decision-making to the human staff. Before implementing AI within HR operations, examine the areas where AI could be useful. If the primary reason is to improve the overall employee experience, it could increase productivity and decrease operational costs.

With the rise of always-on connectivity, the lines between work and personal life are rapidly getting blurred. Employees are more unwilling than ever before to show up on time, with “late to work” numbers more than doubling between baby boomers and millennials. We spoke to Steven Power, Global President at Deputy, AI-based scheduling software for businesses, to discover: 

The nature of tardiness and why employees need to be “set up for success”
Three ways in which AI-based scheduling solves tardiness and other shift worker challenges 
How AI-based workforce scheduling software can make the difference between turnover and retention


The ubiquitous use of technology has had an interesting side effect. With employees logging in anytime, anywhere, and with always-on connectivity expected across the day, the notion of “work hours” has begun to change.
As a result, tardiness has seen a steady rise in the last few years, with digital native workers more likely to come in late (or even early). Deputy’s 2019 Late to Work ReportOpens a new window  recently revealed that in the last one year, 1.1% of millennial women and 1.3% of millennial men regularly started their shifts after significant delays. In comparison, only 0.5% and 0.6% of Baby Boomers were “tardy.”
We spoke to Steven Power, Global President at DeputyOpens a new window . He shared valuable insights on how cutting-edge technologies like AI can help pre-empt tardiness and encourage better shift-worker productivity. 
Learn More: How Is AI Transforming Workforce Management?Opens a new window 
Is Tardiness a Personality Issue? Or Is It an Operational Challenge? 
The failure of a worker to start a shift on time can be attributed to several reasons. Often, hourly workers are placed under immense pressure, switching between their professional space and personal obligations. They also operate in high-demand, high-volume industries such as retail, healthcare, manufacturing, and other essential service providers. As a result, they could run a risk of turning up late despite the best intentions. 
In the digital era, always-on connectivity is another contributing factor. Because modern employees are always expected to be available through Slack, email, or the company intranet, they are less likely to take mandatory work hours as seriously as earlier generations. 
This is why tardiness in the workplace needs to be addressed through a multifaceted technology-empowered strategy. 
Power discussed how AI-based workforce scheduling toolsOpens a new window  can set shift workers up for success and help them achieve their desired productivity goals. “Employees can update their app settings to receive push notifications directly to their phones or email that will remind them of upcoming shifts. This enables them to better track their schedules and ensure punctuality when showing up for shifts.”
“They can also receive direct alerts with schedule updates, shift swaps, and even find replacements for shifts with the mobile app,” he added.

3 Benefits of Adopting AI-based Workforce Scheduling 
How does AI-based workforce scheduling software work? Power explained that such software “uses artificial intelligence to build business owners the best shift structure for their businesses, based on as many metrics (demand signals) as they require.” Such demand signals, he added, could be “sales, foot traffic, food/drink orders, table bookings, tickets sold, etc.”
With AI taking key factors that are critical to scheduling into consideration, businesses and a distributed hourly workforce can benefit significantly. Here’s how.
1. Optimizes schedules for maximum productivity

Data pouring in from different sources and parameters are taken into account when defining schedules. This ensures that no employee’s work-life balance is unnecessarily breached.
AI can also estimate work volumes, ensuring there is always an employee available to get the job done. As a result, businesses can achieve significant bottom-line improvements at minimal additional efforts. 
2. Better leverages idle workers to boost ROI 

The AI engine can also regularly assess for an idle employee, helping to optimally utilize the entire workforce.
Power outlined how this is achieved. “The AI schedulers typically include a shift swap feature that allows employees to directly swap out their shift with an appropriate colleague. In the case that an employee can’t make their shift, it can be opened up to everyone in the team or a select group, allowing alternative employees to claim open shifts on a first-come, first-served basis.” 
3. Stays in-sync with the latest regulatory norms and guidelines 

Another area where AI workforce scheduling can help is compliance. Industries employing shift workers are usually highly regulated, mandating strict compliance with labor laws.
“If a business owner is concerned with providing equal hours to every employee, the AI scheduler can take into account the hours each employee is scheduled for and will attempt to keep hours equal amongst employees. This enables companies to create, optimize, and fill legally compliant schedules across industries such as retail, restaurants, and healthcare,” Power commented.

Leveraging Smarter Scheduling as a Driver for Retention 
Turnover rates among shift workers have always been a concern for these industries. For instance, hourly store employees (retail) witnessed a massive 65% turnover rate in 2018Opens a new window  – compared to the U.S. cross-industry average of 15% only. 
Power believes that AI-based workforce scheduling will give employees better visibility over their workday, allowing them to plan ahead and minimize delays. “Predictability leads to employee retention and can be a boon for talent recruitment. Ultimately, by adapting to the adoption of AI in the workplace, especially for automated scheduling and regulating schedules, employees prove to have higher satisfaction rates and flourish while accomplishing delegated tasks in their place of work.”
Organizations can proactively explore smarter scheduling practices enabled by AI. Fair opportunities, enhanced predictability, and improved work-life balance will help shift employees stay engaged – improving retention and eliminating short-term unwillingness to work.

Artificial intelligence is showing no signs of slowing down – it will soon touch nearly every part of how business is conducted. In order for AI implementation to be successful, employers must follow a few key steps in order to make the transition as smooth as possible and get employees comfortable with this new technology.
The workplace is evolving. No matter the industry, artificial intelligence (AI) will soon touch nearly every part of how we conduct business. How employers adapt to this ongoing evolution of technology in the workplace can impact everything from operations and recruiting to a business’ bottom line. With more than 80 percent of enterprises using some form of AI, it’s a technological advancement that is showing no signs of slowing. From internal operations to customer engagement, understanding how to interact with this technology is critical to being an effective and competitive worker — and employer — today. 
With Gen Z now entering the working world, younger generations are starting to tip the scales of the American workforce. Pew Research Center reported that while the younger workforce is growing rapidly, older generations are maintaining employment for longer, meaning a generational collide is happening in working environments across the globe. Employees with vastly different backgrounds, particularly in technical aptitude, are expected to navigate the changing landscape at the same level. 
One of the biggest challenges? Getting these employees to understand how to work with artificial intelligence. 
In order for your staff to be comfortable utilizing artificial intelligence, employers must follow three key steps to successfully onboard employees for AI in the office, regardless of background or skill set. 
1. Bridge the AI education gap
When implementing AI for your business that requires either employee engagement or a customer-facing experience, employee education and comprehension is critical to successful deployment. “AI” can carry a level of intimidation with it, so it’s important to remind people that it’s AI that helped Amazon recommend the great spy novel they just finished, and AI that Netflix relied on to recommend their new guilty binge pleasure.
With any new technology, there will be a learning curve as employees explore working with AI. Employers need to prioritize the investment and make AI onboarding accessible through tools, training, and resources that foster smooth implementation. Artificial intelligence can be like a virtual teammate, handling new employee onboarding and everyday questions that can slow down individual workflow. It can be the front line for questions that everyone across the org asks, like, “How do I add a new dependent to my health insurance,” “Where do I find my 2017 review,” or, “What holidays do we have off this year?” Imagine any question that is asked by one colleague to another instead being asked of a virtual teammate first — and how much time that would free up for employers to focus on the work that really matters.
While training (or even re-training) today’s workforce on how to work with AI takes resources, it delivers huge returns on the investment. Employees gain valuable skills for their personal development and become more efficient and valuable to the company. In order for AI to be successful in the workplace, everyone needs to be on board. 
2. Demonstrate the value of AI
Getting employees comfortable with AI also means calming any misguided fears of a “robot takeover.” Team members need to view AI as a workplace asset that allows them to work better, not as a threat to their job security. Rather than replacing employees, AI actually allows team members to be more productive in their workday by offloading mundane tasks, streamlining workflows and removing redundancies from processes and administrative work. Today, employees switch apps more than 1,100 times a day. A recent study predicts that AI workplace implementations can increase labor productivity by up to 40 percent. 
While necessary to the success of a company, administrative tasks, onboarding processes, zero-level IT and customer support create an unintentional pain point for businesses and their employees, resulting in significant time and resource loss. We’ve all had a soul-crushing moment where we can’t find the one thing we need to complete a simple task at work. AI tools can alleviate that universal pain point, allowing employees to focus on more valuable, high-level work.
There’s also the broader business value to consider. The link between the revenue growth and AI maturity of business is clear, with 76 percent of business leaders recently noting AI as a fundamental strategy to their organization’s overall success. AI is good for business and for employees.

3. Encourage employee engagement
Employers need to demonstrate how AI and employees can work together to drive a more fulfilling and productive work environment. Various forms of AI, like machine learning, source and identify patterns that are flagged to a human counterpart to analyze and take action. This could be anything from anomalies in data patterns that lead to flaws in operational systems to trends in customer relationship management software. 
Human insights are critical to truly taking advantage of the benefits of AI in an organization. For example, a chatbot tool like Jane.ai mines information across a workplace’s entire database — documents, email, and applications — to surface near-instant information for employees. While the tool adapts and learns over time, part of its success depends on employee engagement where team members “teach” Jane by inputting information not found in the company database that is then stored in her memory from that point on. While machines will continue to advance and likely be able to mimic cognitive function in the future, the human element — creativity, ingenuity, instinct — will always play an important role in the overall success of its implementation. 
And the AI doesn’t just make business run more smoothly. The idea is to create a virtual teammate that helps with all aspects of work-life’s questions — from, “When does open enrollment start,” to, “Who’s the best photographer in the office,” and even, “Where are the coffee filters?”  
AI technology presents so many opportunities for the modern workforce, and employee support is key to its success. 79 percent of HR leaders and 60 percent of employees believe a failure to adopt AI will have negative consequences on their own careers, colleagues, and overall organization. Stated more simply: people and companies who adopt AI will thrive; those who don’t are sure to fall behind. 
Successful AI implementation, for any company regardless of industry, requires that employers invest in employee education and that team members understand the value of AI and engage with it to improve it over time. That value is fully realized when AI can do the mundane tasks that workers don’t want to do, enabling people and teams to focus on what only humans can do: create and innovate.

The article explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is improving the recruitment process by identifying a job seeker’s skills and abilities required for a job and simplifying the process of candidate matching.
Using artificial intelligence (AI) in the recruitment process is far from science fiction. Applicant tracking systemsOpens a new window  are already here, and they’re making the job of human resources professionals a whole lot easier.
Undercover Recruiter statsOpens a new window  suggest that AI applications will replace 16 percent of HR jobs in the coming 10 years. The general belief is that AI will enhance the recruitment process by simplifying onboarding, carrying out relevant new employee training, keeping track of applicants and employee development, as well as assisting applicants who may have questions.

Source:https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-solutions/global/en_us/blog/2017/11/AI-recruiting-chart-hero.jpg
Applicant tracking through machine learning is of particularly high interest. While AI simplifies the challenging process of sifting through resumes, recruiters can focus on more strategic aspects of the process. How do such systems work, are they reliable, and do they bring a sufficiently high return on investment? Let’s attempt to answer these key questions right now.
How Does AI Applicant Tracking Work?
Resume screening and the invitation of the best candidates to a job interview is considered one of the most tedious parts of the process by many HR professionals. Depending on the specifics of the position and the requirements, a company may receive from dozens to thousands of resumes.
Finding the right talent is critical for businesses, but currently, the process is rather ineffective and costly. The cost of onboarding one new employee can reach 240,000 dollarsOpens a new window , the Society for Human Resource Management reports. At the same time, the risk of hiring the wrong person is high because HR professionals will often rush through the process. In a survey, 43% of recruiters said that they made a bad hire because they felt pressed to fill a position fast.
Through the use of artificial intelligence solutions, this cumbersome process can be automated.  By using post-hire information, functionalities can be added to the applicant tracking system (ATS) that the company utilizes. As a result, better recommendations and choices can be made when new candidates are examined for a certain position.
Insights about the current employee experience play an important role in the automation of the process. Also, the system will take qualifications and skill sets into consideration. Based on all of this data, artificial intelligence can rate new candidates to determine whether they’re a good match for the job being offered.
The Google Hire technology is one example of a recruitment-focused machine learning solution. Its launch was announced in April 2018, and the solution became available in July. Through the use of the application, recruiters can put together a smart list of former candidates who may be a good match to current positions being offered by the company. By implementing additional candidate discovery, Google Hire can determine how profiles match a job description or the location of the company looking for new team members.
While Google Hire is currently aimed at either passive or pre-determined candidates, the same premise could apply to a completely new set of job seekers. Machine learning makes it possible to identify the skill and capabilities required for a certain open position. Adding location to the set of criteria enables the app to make even more relevant candidate suggestions.
On top of sorting through candidates, artificial intelligence applicant tracking solutions can also simplify the process of candidate matching. Based on the job requirements, the app will select the strongest matches after analyzing each candidate’s skills, education, location, salary preferences, etc.
This capability doesn’t have to be restricted to the pool of individuals who have applied for a specific job. The search could be extended to individuals who have previously submitted their resume or who are regularly looking for new positions within the organization. The process is another highly challenging one for the HR team, and machine learning can help here as well.
Adoption and Effectiveness of AI Applicant Tracking Solutions
Machine learning software requires a lot of data to learn how to make the right decisions. This is why the adoption of such solutions is still in its early stages. Many small and medium-sized companies may feel discouraged from giving them a try due to the information that has to be fed to the app to increase the effectiveness of the applicant tracking and sorting process.
There’s another challenge to the recruitment process, and it stems from the old-school reliance on resumes to identify the right candidate. Standardized resumes are potentially biased and inaccurate. In order to screen applicants, machines have to be provided with accurate information. This reliance has contributed to HR professionals making notoriously bad decisions for the selection of good candidates. **AI solutions can rely on a much wider pool of data, and when such information is available, a comprehensive and unbiased profile can be created.**
Recent reports suggest that only one percent of Fortune 500 companies are relying on artificial intelligence tools for enhanced recruitment processes. However, such data may be misleading. AI recruitment and candidate selection Opens a new window may be featured as a capability within a more comprehensive software solution that the business relies on. The fact that companies aren’t opting for AI candidate tracking solutions specifically does not necessarily mean such tools are not a part of the HR process.
The chances are that adoption will become much more widespread in the years to come. The ROI guaranteed by AI applicant tracking solutions is one of the primary reasons why.
For a start, machine learning can eliminate the number of bad hires – a problem that we’ve already highlighted as rather costly. A bad hire can cost businesses a lot due to the specifics of the onboarding processes. Fewer mistakes will diminish the loss of important resources.

Jay Srinivasan, founder, and CEO, atSpoke explains how artificial intelligence is transforming wellness in the workplace
While artificial intelligence continues its sweeping disruption across the enterprise, the last couple of years, in particular, have demonstrated a growing ability to transform human resources administration. We’ve seen applications for reducing recruiting biases, advanced analytics for determining the voice of employees, and a rise in virtual assistants to offload work for HR professionals. Still, with an increasingly digitally native workforce, AI is finally being trusted with more complicated and sophisticated issues.
One of those more complicated areas, in particular, is workplace wellness and, more specifically, mental health. Employers now know that ensuring employee wellness is core to creating a positive employee experience, and study after study has shown that modern-day employees evaluate their potential jobs based on employee experience. It’s even been tied to higher profits. 
So, as we move deeper into a new decade that will no doubt be dominated by AIOpens a new window  — and at a time when HR teams are increasingly sensitive to worker wellness and experience — there are two big ways I see AI helping to transform wellness in the workplace:
Wellness through AI software
As much as scientists are trying to emulate distinctly human characteristics in advanced AI applications, the truth is that what makes us superior [at least for the next decade] is a dependency — our need for social bonding and interpersonal communication. We are social creatures that must have meaningful connections with peers and cannot live [sanely ] in a human-to-human contact vacuum. AI couldn’t care less (well technically can’t care at all); it continues executing its programmed fate ad infinite. From a work-production standpoint, this may seem like a disadvantage, but I’d argue that “weakness” is where we derive our greatest strength. Human creativity often comes from a healthy casserole of collaborations, anxieties, boastings, fears, and excitements. The problem is that the mundane repetitiveness of our jobs stands in the way, making it AI’s job to enable flexibility and enable collaboration, communication, and engagement. 
In the workplace, peer communication and collaboration are some of the most important imperatives for ensuring a healthy, productive organization. When that breaks down, and companies don’t foster a communicative and engaging environment, stress levels, feelings of isolation, and burnout rise. A 2019 studyOpens a new window  by employee communication and engagement technology firm Dynamic Signal found that approximately 80 percent of U.S. workers were stressed and ready to quit because of ineffective workplace communication. 
That means HR should integrate, associate, and possibly brand AI applications for collaboration as wellness and “employee experience” tools where HR applications for AI come in. Enterprises must create environments for the way individuals work, and increasingly dispersed workforces, greater use of independent contractors, and more decentralized enterprise management means that HR has a tremendous opportunity to package and position its AI technology use as part of their wellness initiatives. HR, more so than many other departments, should be responsible for future-proofing businesses, which is right in AI’s wheelhouse.

Using AI for mental health conversations
Fresh data suggests that employees are starting to seek out their companies’ mental health resources more often, and those conversations are increasingly starting via AI. 
At Spoke, we recently analyzed hundreds of thousands of employee queries across dozens of employees (note: all data is private, anonymized and siloed across each organization), aggregating for terms related to mental health, including “mental health,” “depression,” “burnout,” “anxiety” and others. The results demonstrated a surprising 410% spike in 2019 compared to 2018. But, that’s not necessarily a bad indicator.
Younger generations are increasingly OK with discussing mental health openly and are willing to do something about it in the workplace. Many have even reported quitting a job because of mental health implications. Married to our data, and you see that AI is increasingly a starting point for those conversations, and smart employers are doing everything they can to facilitate them. 
Why AI? Artificial intelligence’s continuous understanding of language with its discretion around personal matters gives employees more comfort to initiate conversations that are perceived by the employee to be embarrassing. Then there’s AI’s speedy response time. People suffering from job stress often are experiencing issues at the moment and want to feel like they have a quick pathway forward. As such, AI is sometimes viewed as a meta-layer of bureaucracy that deflects from humans.
However, while that is correct at the exact moment of questioning, AI also can rally additional help from the right people; if requested, and martial, those resources are expected more quickly. An internal survey we conducted across dozens of employers found that a majority of employees expect correct responses to workplace queries within five hours.
It does pose an interesting irony about AI. It’s often perceived cold, emotionless calculus, in this case, might be its advantage. Interestingly, a recent global survey of 8,300 HR leaders conducted by Oracle and FutureWorkplaceOpens a new window  found that an astonishing 64% of workers trusted AI chatbots more than they believed their managers.

The bottom line is that enabling greater wellness and more support for mental healthOpens a new window  in the workplace is both an economic and moral imperative for businesses. According to the World Health Organization, for every $1 spent to scale up mental health initiatives, there’s a $4 impact on better health and productivity. 
Both wellness through AI software and AI’s use for starting mental health conversations in the workplace are encouraging macro trends for HR as HR professionals are much more equipped to understand technology’s opportunity to effectuate change than their colleagues 30 years ago.

Developments within artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled a rapid proliferation of deep fakes that are remarkably realistic, increasingly difficult to detect and relatively easy to generate. Technology that two years ago didn’t exist, in particular relating to techniques leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs), has emerged as an extraordinary threat to the sound functioning of government, foundations of commerce and social fabric, writes Aaron Crews, Chief Data Analytics Officer, Natalie Pierce, Shareholder at Littler and Chase Perkins, Attorney, Littler​​​​​​.​

[Littler Mendelson, P.C.]

Developments within artificial intelligence (“AI”) have enabled a rapid proliferation of deepfakes that are remarkably realistic, increasingly difficult to detect and relatively easy to generate. Technology that two years ago didn’t exist, in particular relating to techniques leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs), has emerged as an extraordinary threat to the sound functioning of government, foundations of commerce and social fabric.
Alarm bells are ringing across industries, academia and within the highest echelons of government. The impact of deepfakes on corporations is already being felt, from high tech to energy companies alike, to the tune of millions of dollars stolen via these impersonations. While we are mostly seeing this theft through use of deepfake audio, as deepfake video technology continues to evolve, expect to see increased use of this potential weapon.
So how best to protect ourselves? Given the significant threat deepfakes pose, we are seeing attempts at reactionary legislation. United States legislators have introduced the DEEPFAKES Accountability Act. This law would criminalize creation and distribution of deepfakes not containing a watermark and text identifying deepfake video as in fact modified. The proposed law would also provide subjects of deepfakes a private right of action to “vindicate their reputations.” New laws in California and Texas focus on deepfakes of political candidates immediately preceding elections. A Virginia law criminalizes the circulation of pornographic imagery and videos without the permission of parties depicted, including fabricated and impersonated deepfake generations. While some of these new laws have intentional harm elements and exemptions designed to withstand freedom of speech arguments, the proposed federal law and existing state laws will face difficult First Amendment challenges.
Criminalizing deepfakes that are not identified as deepfakes would also do little to decrease risk to corporations. Therefore, employers should not depend on or expect a legislative solution to malicious utilization of deepfakes. Criminals looking to steal money and commit fraud by harnessing deepfake technology to impersonate corporate executives and con employees into executing transfers of money to criminals’ accounts, are not going to place watermarks on their work or factor in additional associated penalties for failure to do so. Like bank robbers, they conceal their identities and cover their tracks in the hopes of never being caught. Though theft and reputational harm are far from the only damage deepfakes are capable of causing.
Brigadier General R. Patrick Huston, a Pentagon attorney who leads efforts to ensure the ethical and lawful adoption of AI, has spearheaded a campaign to address the critical national security concerns surrounding the potential impact of deepfakes. As keynote speaker during the 2019 National Security Law Conference at U.S. Strategic Command’s (STRATCOM) headquarters, General Huston highlighted the systemic and immediate threat deepfakes pose across private and public sectors. Speaking with Littler Mendelson, General Huston further elaborated these concerns:
“Deepfakes pose a significant threat to national security and global stability. Their impact is not limited to late night comedy and the porn industry. Manufactured evidence can erode the integrity of our judicial systems, and other fraudulent uses of deepfake technology can disrupt entire commercial industries. Most importantly, deepfakes can completely undermine confidence in governments, disrupt the world order, and threaten society as we know it. We’ve already seen the risks posed by sophisticated election interference and other deepfake propaganda. Therefore, we must rapidly develop deepfake detection technologies, and then introduce credible ways to share the results. The world is a safer place when people know what information they can and can’t trust.” – Brigadier General R. Patrick Huston, The Pentagon
It follows then that development of new technologies that can successfully detect and combat deepfakes is an imperative. Digital forensic methodologies and metadata analytics tools are already being utilized during the e-discovery process to successfully detect sophisticated digital fabrications.
In more real time, data analytics teams can be institutionalized, with experts dedicated to verification tasks, such as authenticating cryptographic key signing or call logs. With the anticipated proliferation of deepfakes, ready-made scalable and affordable solutions will be available for smaller employers lacking resources to create internal teams.

Low Tech Solutions to High Tech Problems 
Single-use authentication codes, whether digitally generated from a Two Factor Authentication (2FA) application (ex. Google Authenticator App) or a non-digital pre-shared encryption key – such as the simple, yet highly effective, one-time cryptography pad – can serve as powerful deterrents and organizational protections from fraudulent real-time communications.
Real-time communication transmissions, (ex. phone or video calls) are particularly vulnerable to third-party impersonation and exploitation. For example, Caller ID spoofing, where a call appears to originate from an authorized or impersonated number, is a common practice for spam-callers, malicious parties and bill collectors. Caller ID spoofing is easily achieved through smart phone applications and third-party online services, however, the potential for harm to an unwitting party or organization is tremendous. In August, a German bank’s subsidiary was defrauded when a nefarious third party impersonated the bank’s CEO using voice deepfake technology and instructed the subsidiary to send unauthorized wire transfers. If the bank’s subsidiary had required the impersonating party to confirm a secure authentication code as part of a routine security procedure prior to initiating the wire transfer, it may have prevented the fraudulent transfer.
The resource costs of incorporating private key authentication or 2FA into an organization’s real-time communications infrastructure is trivial, yet provide significant security and operational benefits. Cryptographic keys can be embedded into video communication, generated by 2FA applications and orally authenticated for voice calls or visually displayed within text-based applications. Authentication of private keys ensures the communication retains end-to-end security and isn’t vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, a form of active eavesdropping where an unauthorized third party can survey a party’s communication and inject themselves into the transmission, impersonating a designated party.
Ultimately, strategizing with counsel knowledgeable about technological vulnerabilities and legal issues that may arise will enable employers to better prepare for potential risks from deepfakes and incorporate safeguards unique to their circumstances. Critically, organizations must stay closely informed of the evolving threat landscape in order to prepare for and appropriately respond to highly dynamic scenarios.

Artificial intelligence (AI) lies at the cusp of man and machine. While it utilizes the machine intelligence element, it applies human intelligence concepts such as language and profile assessment to deliver its desired “intelligence.” As a result, the skills required to succeed in an AI career are an uncanny mix, and anyone aiming at such a career will do well to start off with a course in linguistics. 
AI is largely based on Natural Language Processing (NLP), a science that amalgamates machine language and human or natural language into useful value-adding algorithms. A thorough understanding of programming languages, data, as well as day-to-day human languages, thus goes a long way in building a stronger foundation for AI experimentation. It is no surprise that companies in the AI arena are increasingly turning to people with linguistic backgrounds. So much so, that some AI-core companies have appointed the position of “chief linguistics officer,” as in the case of Inbenta, a conversational search technology company. This means that the career avenues for linguistics graduates now number many, and will open up further.
Earlier, graduating in linguistics meant a career in academia, professional writing, or translation. Today, the gateways are open for a career in the booming technology sector too. 
So how does linguistics add value to AI? Better understanding of language helps to better understand users and how customers communicate with brands. Brand communication can then be modeled on these data inputs that have been derived from earlier customer interactions, making them more customized and need-based. Other areas where linguistics professionals can provide an added edge are voice recognition and search and automatic language translation, which form the basis for voice and personal assistants. These are fast gaining popularity, and the opportunities for the future are immense. 
Of course, AI lies at the interface of linguistics and programming. It is therefore necessary that linguistics grads hone their technical skills to make the cut for an AI career. The good part is that programming skills can be easily acquired—people can generally be easily trained in programming, often with basic investment of time and effort. A foundation grounded in linguistics with the add-on of software development training can prove to be a winning combination for AI success. The dual-fold skill helps a person to represent human language in a way that complex computing systems can understand, which is the core of AI. It is all about making computers understand, interpret, and reproduce human interactions so that they can self-learn. AI involves modeling human communication, i.e., how humans acquire information by talking, setting it into a context, and learning from it on an ongoing basis. This means that an AI professional must know how languages work, both in text and orally. Identifying the minute features of the written or spoken word, and its changing meanings in varying contexts, is very important—something that linguistics graduates generally excel at. 
The bottom line is that even seemingly traditional professional fields such as linguistics are opening up to new possibilities. The boundaries between life and technology are blurring to such an extent that career opportunities are becoming more fluidic in nature. It is all about identifying these shifting trends and honing your skills to suit the market demands.

Are four-day workweeks the future? Several businesses have already made the switch, citing improved productivity, happier employees, better retention, and faster hiring. To attain a true four-day (32-hour) workweek, many organizations would have to (A) hire more talent to pick up the slack or (B) accept a less productive year. Neither choice would be useful, but there is a third option coming down the pike: artificial intelligence. AI will be able to improve productivity to the point where working hours can be feasibly reduced for any business, writes Jonathan Crane, Chief Operating Officer at IPsoft.
Are four-day workweeks the future? Several businesses have already made the switch, citing improved productivity, happier employees, better retention, and faster hiring. The following two reasons have inspired numerous school districts to follow suit, which may set expectations for future generations of workers.
Not all weeks are created equal, however. It may not yet be possible for most businesses to shorten their workweeks without compromise. By eliminating one day of work, employers might be forced to increase their daily hours to make up for the lost time. This could lead to longer days before that vaunted three-day weekend finally arrives.
In order to attain a true four-day (32-hour) workweek, many organizations would have to (A) hire more talent to pick up the slack or (B) accept a less productive year. Neither choice would be terribly effective, but there is a third option coming down the pike: artificial intelligence.
The technology is heavily viewed as a job creatorOpens a new window , thanks to a growing number of new opportunities. AI specialist roles look to dominate 2020 as companies explore the potential of automation. It’s easy to see why – tedious and highly repeatable tasks can now be handled by a machine, allowing individual staff to reserve their precious working hours for more critical projects. Long-term, AI could go even further, improving productivity to the point where working hours can be feasibly reduced for any business.
As much as 45% of work activities could be automated with existing technology, potentially saving employees 18 out of every 40 hours they work. That leaves a lot of wiggle room for a reduced workweek. Employers could choose to fill that time with new projects, objectives, or a cornucopia of emails and meetings. But doing so won’t improve recruitment or provide a better work-life balance.
Cynics might question how many businesses will use automation to reduce their workforce while expecting the remaining employees to work a full 40-hour week, and some companies might be tempted to do that. AI is a powerful tool, but it cannot provide the level of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovating that an individual staff brings to employers. AI doesn’t have a body and cannot express the human emotions that make one-on-one relationships so meaningful. It is a fantastic technology that can handle mundane tasks automatically, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But AI’s value proposition is different from that of a human. They are best suited to work together, side-by-side, not one versus the other.

Getting Better with Time
Four-day workweeks are still in their infancy, so the full benefits have yet to be realized. But some companies are already bragging about the impactful results they have personally experienced, which could serve as a case study for others.
AI can help by taking care of the time-consuming tasks that frequently strain productivity, such as resolving user tech issues or automating parts of production management. The technology has been useful in helping cybersecurity professionals detect and deter security intrusions, and it has become an increasingly popular tool for marketers looking to target specific demographics. Call centers have also taken advantage of AI, allowing it to handle many inquiries automatically. And it will only get better with time, mainly as machine learning improves upon its ability to learn, grow, and better understand the tasks it needs to perform.
As a man and machine inch closer together, enterprises will realize efficiencies that could not have been attained with humans or AI alone. When technology is capable of handling a significant volume of tasks, businesses will then be free to shorten their workweeks on a larger scale.
They could instead choose to follow Parkinson’s LawOpens a new window , maintain the five-day schedule, and allow work to expand to “fill the time available for its completion.” But that would not serve employers or employees, who already have strong opinions about the work environment. To attract the talent of the future, today’s businesses will need to accommodate their needs, whether that involves more paid time off, schedule flexibility, or a shorter workweek.

A New Era of Employment
The old saying “work smarter, not harder” has new meaning in the age of artificial intelligence. With the potential to ease employees’ existing workloads while maintaining the same level of output, this could be the technology that ushers in an entirely new era of employment. Work that was once viewed as boring, tiring, or utterly uninteresting can be handed off to AI, while humans complete the most exciting and demanding parts of a job. It’s a win-win situation that will, at the very least, make work more enjoyable. And at it could open the door to a lifetime of three-day weekends.

Candidate Screening
AI technology streamlines the process of screening potential candidates for a position by reducing the overall time to hire and enhancing the candidate experience. AI tools can gather the necessary candidate information by asking preliminary questions to assess whether a candidate is suitable for the position before a full interview with a human HR representative. AI can also respond to candidate queries, quickly fill out applications, screen applicants efficiently, and assess candidates in record time.
Before full interviews with human HR representatives, AI chatbots and virtual interfaces can perform initial screening processes with potential candidates to assess for specific qualities, skills, and credentials. This means that by the time the candidates come in for interviews, talent acquisition is that much easier, as the preliminary criteria have already been met. This saves HR representatives from spending time asking such basic questions and covering these fundamental topics, leaving them to simply deal with the more complex, personal areas of screening.
Engagement and Development
Engagement processes with candidates can be automated for a more personal experience and interaction in real-time. This can involve keeping candidates updated regarding the status of their application and maintain a relationship to reduce anxiety during the waiting period.
Of course, nurturing this relationship is vital throughout the process, including after candidates have been hired. AI tools can update records, gather new information, and perform other such tasks that involve minor interactions.

Employees can also utilize AI services as a resource for information, through chatbots or virtual interfaces. When employee issues are more complex and require the intervention of human HR representatives, AI can bridge this gap by knowing when to defer to humans for interpersonal support by making appointments and organizing meetings and initiating the communication process.
AI can also maintain employee engagement about internal communications, whether this is requesting meetings, updating personal information, giving leave notice, or filing a report. In essence, these communications can be automated through online portals and servers for the company to save the time and hassle of employees dealing with such essential paperwork.
Employees Training
New employees are going to need training, orientation, and support throughout their initial time with the company. They will need to adjust to their new roles, adapt to new routines, and assimilate into the culture of the company. AI interfaces can run new hires through necessary procedures, protocols, policies, and resources, as well as answer common questions and concerns – all in real-time. AI can act as a pool of company information for new employees to access at any time, no matter how small their query may be, without taking up the valuable time of senior employees to deal with small-scale issues.
Many employees may also find training more comfortable and constructive when the process is being overseen by a virtual AI mentor rather than a senior employee, as this can reduce performance anxiety and increase personal confidence in asking questions without fear of judgment or wasting time. A virtual mentor can also provide personalized assistance throughout training by having access to personnel files and company policies at all times.

New employees need to understand the norms and expectations of the company, from essential procedural responsibilities to standard interpersonal interactions. For this reason, a combination approach of AI and human HR services is highly valuable in providing this integrated orientation experience.
The benefits of AI as a machine-learning-driven initiative are endless, especially when deployed in tandem with traditional human HR interactions. Such integral services can be provided in record time, with real-time responses, consistent updates, and a streamlined HR experience.

Artificial intelligence is rapidly being implemented in the HR industry. With the rise of digital communication methods and younger generations entering the workforce, HR leaders need to better understand how to leverage AI to improve employee satisfaction, retention, and workplace communication. The best way to adapt is to embrace AI and emerging technologies and use them to your advantage, writes Anish Joshi, VP of Technology, Fusemachines.
Artificial intelligence has presented tremendous opportunities for the HR industry by helping with recruitment and onboarding, mechanizing repetitive tasks, providing analytics, increasing retention rates and aiding with learning & development. These functions that have been increasingly implemented over the last couple of years are just scratching the surface of the ways AI can transform and augment the HR industry.
It’s no secret that traditional ways of HR and internal relations are changing with the emergence of new technologies. As the digital-native generation is rapidly moving into the workforce, the industry needs to make technical adjustments to better serve this generation of employees and employers. New technologies, such as AI, can further develop employee/manager relationships in ways that weren’t possible many years ago.
Here are a few ways that you can leverage AI to improve overall employee satisfaction, employee retention and the relationship between employees and their managers.
Address the Challenges of the Digital Age
The digital age has pushed us to utilize new forms of communication in the workplace. Whether it’s emails, texts, or platforms like Slack, this presents new challenges. There’s a loss of context when communication more frequently occurs digitally than in person – it’s a major hurdle associated with communication in this day and age.
Face-to-face communication is becoming less common in the workplace due to the rise of remote work, coworking apps, and new technologies. It’s important that critical information or context of communications doesn’t get lost in translation.
Digital communications may cause management to fail to capture what employees are thinking, how they are feeling, and whether or not they have understood the task at hand. According to Debra Hamilton’s report, Top Ten Email Blunders That Cost Companies Money, a company with 100 employees can expect to lose approximately $450,000 a year or more because of email blunders, inefficiencies, and misunderstandings.
This only covers mistakes with email communications. It’s hard to imagine the number of daily misunderstandings and miscommunications that arise from other types of digital conversations. It’s very easy to misconstrue someone’s true feelings and thoughts when consuming the message digitally.  
Luckily, AI can help us face these challenges and make communication a more streamlined, effective, and mutual understanding between employees and management.
Analyze Employee Engagement
Utilizing the voice of the employee (VoE) analytics, which are driven by AI, can improve how you monitor employee engagement and feedback, ultimately ensuring better relationships between employees and their managers. Taking a step back and analyzing how employees are feeling can lead to positive changes. For example, you send out an employee survey to gauge attitudes towards a new computer software your company is using. The feedback you receive is that everyone is confused and frustrated with the platform. Easy fix! You host a training session to better educate employees on the platform and discuss any concerns or questions. In the end, everyone is feeling better about the new platform and you’ve proactively mitigated risks by taking the time to analyze employee sentiment.

By implementing this type of AI, organizations have access to more data, which provides managers with immediate and actionable feedback from their teams. Without advancing technology and increased amounts of data available, this type of engagement and leadership development wouldn’t be as accessible.  
AI technologies that use a variety of natural language processing and textual analysis can incite positive changes within key relationships at organizations. This can be especially useful in times of significant change, such as a major restructuring, new leadership or a new strategy.
Increase Employee Retention
According to a Salesforce report, The Impact of Equality and Values-Driven BusinessOpens a new window , employees who feel that their voices are heard at work are 4.5 times more likely to be motivated to perform their best. Being able to provide employees with this type of security and reassurance means they are more likely to be loyal to your organization.
AI is an important function of employee retention. With more data to be analyzed, employers can better understand how employees are feeling and gauge whether or not they intend to stay with the organization. AI enables an employer to identify employee’s areas of dissatisfaction and the underlying causes behind them.

When management can act upon identified problems, they have a better chance of retaining employees and increasing satisfaction. These analytics are possible because of AI and give companies the power to better listen to their employees. Even further, managers that can better understand their employees’ problems, consider them, and execute based on employee feedback will improve overall key metrics within the company and increase employee retention rates.
AI is inevitably going to continue to transform the HR industry. Certain considerations need to be taken into account for the rise of digital communication methods and the influx of digital natives making their way into the workforce. The best way to adapt is to embrace AI and new technologies and use them to your advantage. AI implementation in HR is positive – it leads to better communication, more secure employee/manager relationships, and aids in leadership development for managers.

Different strokes: Using artificial intelligence to tell art apartDecember 13, 2021Humanities, Art & Social SciencesResearchScience & Tech· 

Case Western Reserve University scientists, artists collaborate to develop art algorithm that can distinguish different painters’ brush strokes “at the bristle level”
A team of scientists and art historians at Case Western Reserve University say they have used tools of artificial intelligence (AI) to distinguish the individual brushstrokes of one painter from another.
The technique could become a valuable tool to help authorities better identify forgeries of work by famous artists; it could also help art historians tell whether a master, or a student, contributed to a given masterpiece.
Kenneth Singer

The researchers said they believe the finding is among the first of its kind because of how the researchers used the computer to read and learn from the 3D topography of a painting. Other forms of AI-enhanced analysis rely on visible stylistic differences that a program may detect in historic works, they said.
The technology of 3D topography describes a three-dimensional relief map of a surface which reveals any differences in “elevation.”  In this case, that means rises or dips in the paint surface, even at the smallest scale.
“3D topography is a new way for AI to ‘see’ a painting,” said Kenneth Singer, the Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics at Case Western Reserve. Singer who led the research, said the AI algorithm focused on the smallest structures on the surface.
The “neural network stunned us”
“The neural network stunned us by actually being able to tell with very high accuracy whose hand among four different art students had painted even a tiny fraction of a brushstroke,” Singer said. “We’ve uncovered what could be considered the unintentional style of a painter.”
“Neural network” describes a computer system modeled on the human brain and nervous system—one that learns, identifies and compares patterns. The neural network identified the correct artist 95% of the time from small parts of a brushstroke. Those strokes were roughly the diameter of a single paintbrush bristle.
Mike Hinczewski
Michael Hinczewski, the Warren E. Rupp Associate Professor of Physics at Case Western Reserve, was also on the research team. He said that kind of precision was “almost like a fingerprint.”
Each of the artists in their study used the same kind of brush, paint and canvas. “So that the only thing that would be different would be the artist’s hand—the way it interacts with the surface,” Hinczewski said. 
“We were shocked with what emerged,” he continued. This is something that must somehow be intrinsic to each artist, not something that the painter is consciously trying to do.”
The team recently published its work in the journal Heritage Science. 
Collaborators included Case Western Reserve colleagues Elizabeth Bolman, the Elsie B. Smith Professor in the Liberal Arts and chair of Art History, several others from the physics and biology departments in the College of Arts and Sciences and contributors from the Cleveland Museum of Art and Cleveland Institute of Art.
Elizabeth Bolman
Attribution of famous art
Bolman, who is an artist historian—a specialization of art history—said many notable masters, from El Greco to Rembrandt, employed workshops. Those workshops  included other artists who painted parts of the canvases to speed production and meet market demands for their art.
The artists in a master’s workshop were trying to create a complete painting with a singular style—mimicking the named artist. However, connoisseurs and collectors want to know how much of a given piece was created by the master.
“But those masters didn’t leave notes from their workshops: ‘Hey, art historians 500 years from now, here’s how we did it,’” Bolman said. “So being able to scan a painting and learn which areas were painted by different hands could be extremely valuable information to connoisseurs.”
The global art market is worth billions of dollars, Bolman said. So, this method of attribution could have important applications to help confirm or dispute authorship.
This new machine-learning method could more accurately determine an unbiased and quantitative analysis of virtually any well-preserved painting, she said.
“Art connoisseurs can spend decades identifying styles, or the weave of the canvas, to learn more about a painting,” Bolman said. “This method isn’t intended to replace any of those, but to add a level of data that humans can’t discern.”
How the AI worked on art
One illustration of how the computer system differentiated the work of four different painters.
The MORE (Materials for Opto/Electronics Research and Education) Center at Case Western Reserve, where Singer is faculty director, has a chromatic confocal optical profilometer, a tool which uses light and color to reveal minuscule bumps and indentations on a surface.
Singer and his colleagues scanned the students’ paintings to produce 3D surface height data for each work.
The researchers then divided those surface data into virtual patches. Then they trained an ensemble of programs known as convolutional neural networks for attribution—identifying which painter made the stroke.
Hinczewski said that most previous studies for AI art attribution are focused on photos of entire paintings. 
“We broke the painting down into virtual patches ranging from one-half millimeter to a few centimeters square, so we no longer even have information about the subject matter,” he said. “But we can accurately predict who painted it from an individual patch. That’s amazing.”

LONDON — Can’t get your partner to ever tell you how they really feel? There may be an app for that…one day. Scientists can now predict how someone is feeling using radio waves to measure heart rate and breathing. The wireless signals can detect a person’s feelings even in the absence of any other visual cues such as facial expressions. This AI technology could be used to help reveal our inner emotions.
In the past, emotion detection has relied on assessing visible signals such as facial expressions, speech, body gestures or eye movements. However, these methods can be unreliable as they do not capture an individual’s internal emotions effectively. Researchers are increasingly looking towards “invisible” signals, such as ECG to understand emotions.
ECG signals detect electrical activity in the heart, providing a link between the nervous system and heart rhythm. To date, the measurement of these signals has largely been performed using sensors that are placed on the body. Recently, non-invasive approaches that use radio waves have been used to detect them.
Researchers hope to investigate how they can use existing systems, like WiFi routers, to reveal the emotions of large groups of people, such as office workers. They also plan to work with healthcare professionals and social scientists on public acceptance and ethical concerns around the use of this new technology.

This type of approach would enable us to classify emotions of people on an individual basis while performing routine activities. Moreover, we aim to improve the accuracy of emotion detection in a work environment using advanced deep learning techniques,” says lead study author Ahsan Khan, a PhD student at Queen Mary University in London, in a statement.  “Being able to detect emotions using wireless systems is a topic of increasing interest for researchers. It offers an alternative to bulky sensors and could be directly applicable in future ‘smart’ home and building environments.
“In this study, we’ve built on existing work using radio waves to detect emotions and show that the use of deep learning techniques can improve the accuracy of our results,” he adds.
How machine learning can second your emotions
For the experiment, participants were asked to watch a video chosen for its ability to evoke one of four basic emotions: anger, sadness, joy and pleasure. Meanwhile, researchers emitted harmless radio signals, like those transmitted from WiFi, towards participants and measured the signals that bounced back off of them. The team was then able to reveal ‘hidden’ information about a person’s heart and breathing rates by analyzing changes to these signals caused by slight body movements.
“This research opens up many opportunities for practical applications, especially in areas such as human robot interaction and healthcare and emotional wellbeing, which has become increasingly important during the current Covid-19 pandemic,” notes project leader Yang Hao, a professor of antennas and electromagnetics at the university.
Psychological or neuroscientific researchers often use methods to detect human emotions. However, it is thought that these approaches could also have wider implications for the management of health and wellbeing. Previous research has used similar non-invasive or wireless methods of emotion detection. However, analysis depended on the use of classical machine learning approaches where an algorithm is used to identify emotional states within the data.
For this study, scientists used deep learning techniques where an artificial neural network learns its own features from time-dependent raw data. Results showed that this approach could detect emotions more accurately than traditional machine learning methods.
“Most of the published literature that uses machine learning measures emotions in a subject-dependent way, recording a signal from a specific individual and using this to predict their emotion at a later stage. However, deep learning allows us to assess data in a similar way to how a human brain would work, looking at different layers of information and making connections between them,” says Achintha Ihalage, also a PhD student at Queen Mary.
“With deep learning we’ve shown we can accurately measure emotions in a subject-independent way, where we can look at a whole collection of signals from different individuals and learn from this data and use it to predict the emotion of people outside of our training database,” adds Ms. Ihalage.
The findings are published in the journal PLOS One.

A Project Management Professional (PMP) certification is a globally recognized certificate offered by the Project Management Institute (PMI). It is a highly respected certificate held by over one million actively certified individuals. These certifications can advance your career and help drive salary increases for qualified managers.
The need for qualified managers with PMP certifications is rising dramatically, as the business and tech sector work to keep with today’s technology. These advances include cloud computing, artificial intelligence, edge computing and digital transformation.
There are five “performance domains” the PMP exam is based on, these include:

Initiating the project
Planning the project
Executing the project
Monitoring and controlling the project
Closing the project

The PMP certification itself is designed by industry leaders and project professionals, ensuring applicants and test takers are skilled in the following areas:

People: The PMP certification tests your soft skills and leadership potential. These people skills are important for successfully leading teams in today’s ever-growing working environment.
Process: Project managers and professionals need to be on top of the technical aspects of project management, such as timelines.
Business environment: Finally, professionals need to be skilled in bridging the gap between projects and an organization’s general strategy and culture.

Holders of the PMP certification will come out into the workforce well versed in these three main aspects of project management. Holders will also learn about the predictive, agile, and hybrid approach to project leadership as well.
The test itself consists of 180 multiple choice questions. Once individuals pass the test, they are required 60 hours of continued professional education units every three years to maintain the certification.
IT professionals interested in project management facing roles and responsibilities will benefit heavily from a PMP certification. Let’s look into these benefits further.

What are the Benefits of a PMP Certification?
Competitive Edge
Holding a PMP certification means you’ve passed a test designed by project professionals and leaders in the project management space. This helps make individuals stand out – it often opens the doors to new positions.
PMI themselves state that employers will need to fill around 2.2 million new project-oriented roles each year through 2027. Holding a PMP certification as an IT professional helps you stand out, and shows you have a relevant and diverse skill set.
The qualifications for obtaining the certification are robust to begin with. Applicants must meet the following sets of criteria:

A four-year degree, high school diploma, or associate’s degree.
36 to 60 months leading projects, depending on education.
35 hours of project management training or CAPM Certification.

Higher Salary
One of the more actionable benefits of holding a PMP certification is the higher median salary holders have when compared to non-holders.
PMP certification holders in the United States average about a 25% increase in their salary when compared to non-holders. In Poland and India, this number is above 30%, and in South Africa, holders average a whopping 58% differential when compared to non-holders.
Higher Efficiency
Another important benefit of holding a PMP certification is the efficiency project leaders bring to the table when having one.
A study done by the PMI showed that when over one-third of project managers in a company hold PMP certifications, the company itself meets its original goals and finishes more projects on time.
Coming into a company as an IT professional with a PMP certification means you can increase this efficiency for your own department as well.
Top PMI Certifications
PMI certifications are broken down into different experience levels. This means that project managers can always look forward to building their repertoire as their experience grows.
Although the PMP certification is the organization’s most well-known certification for IT professionals and project leaders, PMI offers a vast amount of certifications for these groups and more.
Top PMI Certifications for 0-3 Years Experience
PMI Project Management Ready
This is PMI’s entry-level course, focused on harnessing foundational knowledge of project leadership and management for professionals. Applicants can expect to learn about basic business analytics and agile methodologies in this course.
PMI-ACP
The PMI Agile Certified Practitioner, or PMI-ACP, demonstrates and tests your agile team experience. Agile methodologies are increasingly becoming more necessary for IT professionals, and the PMI-ACP helps professionals hone their skills for the market.
In the test, applicants will be tested on a multitude of agile approaches, such as:

Scrum
Kanban
Lean
Extreme programming (XP)
Test-driven development (TDD)

CAPM
The Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) certification is built for professionals looking to strengthen their fundamental knowledge and terminology of project management. The CAPM is very foundational, and can be used as a step to qualify for the PMP certification.
Top PMI Certifications for 3+ Years Experience
PMP
The PMP is PMI’s most well-known certification. Simply put, holding the PMP can bring along a slew of benefits that might not be as available for other certification holders. As we mentioned above, PMP holders generally earn higher salaries than their non-accredited counterparts.
Beyond that, the PMP certification ensures IT professionals and project managers are equipped with the necessary tools needed for efficient and effective project management cycles. IT workers and professionals can expect to hone their predictive, agile, and hybrid approaches through this certification, and stand out in the market as a whole.
PMI-PBA
The PMI Professional in Business Analysis (PMI-PBA) certification is targeted more toward those in need of business analysis skills. These can include:

Working with key stakeholders to define business requirements.
Identifying goals and outcomes for business quarters.
Shaping general output of project cycles.

The need for business analysis practitioners is only growing. Holding the PMI-PBA could ensure you thrive in the market – or at least get you noticed.
DAVSC
The Disciplined Agile Value Stream Consultant certification, or DAVSC, tests professionals on their value stream management skills and their effectiveness in implementing them enterprise-wide.
Top PMI Certifications for 8+ Years Experience
PgMP
The Program Management Professional certification, or PgMP, is one of the most exclusive certifications PMI offers for professionals. It has only been earned by a few thousand applicants. This means that passing it exemplifies your skills as an effective, all-around project leader.
PfMP
The Portfolio Management Professional certification, or PfMP, is similarly exclusive to its PgMP counterpart. The PfMP focuses more on testing applicant’s experience, skills, and performance in regards to managing and aligning a relevant portfolio catered to enterprise and organizational strategy. Like the PgMP, it’s held by a few thousand leaders worldwide.
Top Specialized PMI Certifications
PMI-RMP
The PMI Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP) certification is one of six specialized PMI certifications. These are certifications that are built for more specialized use-cases.
In the PMI-RMP’s case, certification holders prove their prowess in regards to identifying and assessing project risks. Holders are also well versed in how to mitigate these risks and move forward with new opportunities once said risks have been cleared or worked on. This certification shows enterprises and businesses your capabilities in protecting their organizational needs.
PMI-SP
The PMI Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP) certification is focused on what its name suggests: It is best suited for professionals looking to hone their project scheduling skills.
The PMI-SP is actually a far more important certification to hold than applicants might perceive. Scheduling and time management for project cycles is a critical skill to have, and could be highly valued by organizations looking to perfect that avenue.
AHPP
The Agile Hybrid Project Pro certification, or AHPP, is micro-credential. This means that there is no need to maintain credits to hold it, like a majority of other PMI certifications. This could be reason enough for some to apply, but the AHPP comes with a number of specialized benefits for holders.
The main skill set the AHPP trains applicants in is the application of agile and hybrid project management principles. Applicants also learn about conflict management, team performance support, and mitigating or potentially eliminating obstacles in the project management cycle.
Considering the fact that this certification only requires 1-5 years of project management experience and no education requirements, it could be a perfect entryway for some applicants.

The American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) has announced a joint commitment with Intel and Dell Technologies to enhance artificial intelligence (AI) education across community and technical colleges in all 50 states by 2023 as part of Intel’s AI for Workforce program.
The new effort aims to enable community colleges to be the first line for instruction, reskilling and upskilling of the AI workforce. The AI for Workforce program launched last year at Maricopa Community College (MCC) in Arizona, with Intel introducing an AI-based curriculum that allows students to earn a certificate or an associate degree in AI. Over the last year, the program has expanded to 31 schools across 18 states.
To support the program’s expansion, AACC and Intel are collaborating with Dell Technologies as the exclusive technology partner to provide resources for community colleges that provide AI training and certificate programs.
“Community colleges provide skill training and credential programs to 11 million students each year,” AACC President and CEO Walter Bumphus said in a release. “These programs are intended to provide the needed skills training for students to enter the job market and thrive in a job that earns them family-sustaining wages. This partnership with Intel and Dell will help us to ensure that these programs lead to meaningful employment and can also serve as the first step toward degree attainment.”
Program expertise
Resources from both Intel and Dell include technical and infrastructure expertise for the development of virtual and on-campus AI in education labs, as well as a curriculum designed to ensure that community college AI programs are relevant, cost-effective and provide skills training that leads to real-world jobs.
“This is an exciting partnership that will build a robust and diverse talent pipeline to help support future jobs in AI and technology,” said Carlos Contreras, senior director of AI and digital readiness at Intel. “The next-generation workforce will need this kind of specialized training to develop solutions to the world’s greatest challenges, and community colleges have a huge role to play in unleashing innovative thinking.”
The new partnership will focus on minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and tribal colleges to support under-resourced communities and are committed to continual growth of this program. Seventeen of the schools currently participating in the AI for Workforce program are MSIs.
“Access to technology and skills has never been more important, allowing more communities to participate in today’s digital ecosystem. By collaborating with Intel on its AI for Workforce program, Dell is able to complement Intel’s innovative AI course content with Dell’s technology expertise to deliver AI learning experiences to a wide swath of diverse college students helping them prepare for the workforce of the future,” said Adam Garry, senior director of education strategy at Dell Technologies.
Recruitment of community colleges to the program will begin next month at the AACC Workforce Development Institute.

Peer Review reports

Glossary of terms in the context of systematic reviews
Active machine-learning: An iterative process whereby the accuracy of the predictions made by the algorithm is improved through interaction with reviewers as they screen additional records [1].Artificial intelligence: Simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions [2].Level 2 automation: Tools enable workflow prioritization, e.g., prioritization of relevant abstracts; however, this does not reduce the work time for reviewers on the task but does allow for compression of the calendar time of the entire process [3].Level 4 automation: Tools perform tasks to eliminate the need for human participation in the task altogether, e.g., fully automated article screening decision about relevance made by the automated system [3].Reviewer compatibility: A setting in systematic review software that allows you to restrict certain users from screening each other’s records. For example, if Reviewer A and Reviewer B are restricted, if Reviewer A screens a record, it will be removed from the list of records for Reviewer B. You may also assign a certain range of reference identification numbers to reviewers. These settings will ensure that two junior reviewers will not screen the same records.Stakeholders: A person or group with a vested interest in a particular clinical decision and the evidence that supports that decision. For example, local government, or health insurance groups [4].Training set: A set of records which contribute to the active machine-learning algorithm.
Introduction Systematic reviews (SRs) are one type of review in the spectrum of knowledge synthesis products. Other examples include overview of reviews, rapid reviews, and scoping reviews [5]. SRs are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine [6], supporting clinical decision-making such as through use in guidelines, and informing policy decisions [7]. However, SRs are time-consuming and there is growing demand by stakeholders to produce evidence more quickly, while maintaining robust methods.In performing a SR, several methods may be employed to screen records at the title and abstract level. In alignment with current recommendations for SR conduct, screening is typically performed by two reviewers working independently, with conflicts resolved through discussion, or alternatively by consultation of a third person when consensus cannot be achieved [8]. As this approach can be especially time-consuming in the presence of large citation yields, other methods are used, for example the liberal accelerated screening strategy, in which a second reviewer screens those excluded by the first reviewer [9]. Single-reviewer screening can also be used, although when empirically evaluated, this approach may miss many relevant studies [10,11,12,13]. In one study, single reviewer screening missed an average of 13% of relevant studies among 24,942 screening decisions [11]. Other alternatives include first performing title-only screening [14, 15], and using more experienced (or expert) reviewers [16].Artificial intelligence (AI) and more specifically, active machine-learning (AML) have emerged during the past decade as an area of focus to expedite the performance of knowledge syntheses, and may offer potential value both in terms of time saved and costs averted [17]. Teams producing knowledge syntheses products (e.g., SRs) may use this feature to gain efficiencies in their work to meet the needs for rapid evidence generation. AI has recently been introduced in several SR software applications, such as Abstrackr [18], DistillerSR® [19], EPPI-Reviewer [20], Pico Portal [21], Rayyan [22], RobotAnalyst [23], and SWIFTActive-Screener [24], with a comprehensive list available at SR Toolbox (http://systematicreviewtools.com/index.php). These tools use active machine-learning (AML) to re-order (or prioritize) citations to be displayed in order from most likely to be relevant to least likely, a level 2 automation for human-computer interactions [3]. The interest in using AI to support the conduct of SRs and other types of knowledge syntheses (e.g., rapid reviews, scoping reviews) is gaining momentum. Several studies have been published since 2015 using and evaluating the use of AI and prioritized screening, many with encouraging results [10, 25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. For example, to identify 95% of the studies included at the title and abstract level, studies have reported a reduction in the number of records that need to be screened of 40% [32] and 47.1% [34].The development and interest in the use of AI and AML in the context of knowledge syntheses may be due to: (1) the rapid increase in research publications that has caused SR teams to experience large screening burden while conducting reviews; (2) general demand by knowledge users for shorter timelines and lower cost reviews; (3) increased demand for updating reviews and producing living reviews, which require efficiencies in the review process [38]; and (4) the push for evidence-informed decision-making, especially during emergencies (e.g., COVID-19). The use of AI may offer a multitude of potential gains relevant to stakeholders and research teams that include more timely production/delivery of preliminary findings, more efficient use of team member skills, and reduction of screening burden. To facilitate the achievement of such gains, user friendly automation technologies must be seamlessly set up with minimal disruption to processes and resources [3]. Our experiences and interactions with other research teams in the field have suggested there remains interest in the sharing of perspectives with regard to the implementation of such tools into workflow planning of knowledge synthesis.A review by O’Mara-Eves in 2015 reported that several studies evaluated machine-learning for reducing the in workload for screening records, but noted that there is little overlap between the outcomes (e.g., recall of 95% vs retrieving all relevant studies), making it difficult to conclude which approach is best [1]. More recent studies have generally concluded that full automation (level 4 automation; see Glossary of Terms) performs poorly, while semi-automation (level 2 automation) may be more reliable [10, 30, 33, 34]. Although AI is not currently suitable to fully replace humans in title and abstract screening, there is value to be gained from AI use and some basic principles for teams who produce knowledge synthesis products to adopt are needed.ObjectiveWith no current consensus on how to best use AI for study selection, and several studies published in the area performance of AI and AML [26, 27, 30,31,32, 34], many researchers are may be interested by the premise, but are uncertain as to its validity and means for operationalization. As some of the barriers to adoption of new technologies are the challenges in set-up [3], we have provided different situations and considerations for knowledge synthesis teams to consider when using AI for title and abstract screening while conducting reviews.MethodsResearch informing this guidanceWe present suggestions for implementation of AML during citation screening for knowledge syntheses based upon recent retrospective and prospective assessments we have conducted in our program of research in knowledge synthesis.Retrospective evaluation of AMLIn 2020 we presented findings from a retrospective evaluation of the AML tool for citation screening available in DistillerSR® (Evidence Partners Incorporated, Ottawa, Canada), a software tool for systematic review management, to measure its performance in terms of accuracy (to identify potentially relevant citations) and potential for time savings, and also to develop empirical experience in its use to further guide our work flow for future systematic reviews [34]. In this work, we sought to assess the impact of AML when targeting a 95% true recall rate in terms of identification of studies that progressed to Level 2 full text screening during the initial systematic review. This work measured a variety of parameters of relevance to systematic reviewers including screening hours saved (compared to a traditional screening approach) and ‘missed’ citations included in the final review. Detailed findings are described elsewhere [34], and we have also provided a tabular summary of key review characteristics and AML-related outcomes in Additional file 1. Briefly, in inspecting findings across the 10 systematic reviews that were evaluated, data were consistently supportive of strong accuracy in terms of highlighting relevant citations, as well as achieving researcher-relevant reduction in screening burden. Across the 10 reviews, in no case was a citation selected for final inclusion in any of the reviews missed for progression to full text screening in the current exercise. We point readers to the related manuscript of findings for additional detail.Prospective implementation of ALMIn addition to the above retrospective investigation, since adoption of DistillerSR®‘s AML features as part of the workflow within the research unit of team members CH and BH, the strategies described in this guidance were assessed in terms of their benefits and challenges in the context of recent knowledge syntheses related to the benefits of different primary care models for long-term care homes [39, 40], interventions to manage chronic pain in those with comorbid mental health conditions [41], interventions to reduce the risk of acute pain transitioning to chronic pain [41], the health effects of cannabis consumed by older adults [42], and interventions for management of methamphetamine disorder [43]; we provide additional information regarding these reviews in Additional file 1 to provide context for readers. Authors CH and BH have overseen the implementation of AML in these reviews, monitored their benefits and challenges, and continually refined their approach. The guidance presented has been discussed collectively amongst our co-authorship team in our efforts to enhance our use of AML in our work. Our intent in sharing these steps is to inform others seeking to implement these methods in their workflow, and we hope to pursue future discussions to continually develop this process.GuidanceSimilar to the stages of conducting a SR, we developed a seven-step framework, (Fig. 1) which provides an overview of the steps for the use of prioritized screening. This framework was based on the logical steps from communicating with stakeholders (Step 1), developing a search strategy (Step 2), and the steps leading up to making a decision on when to stop screening and what modified screening approach may be used (Step 7). As previously stated, there are several software packages which now incorporate AI tools to help with title/abstract screening. We have tried to consider the array of available tools in this document to the extent possible, as some required a paid subscription. As many members of the authorship team primarily use DistillerSR, many examples or features described may be specific to DistillerSR and may or may not be available in these other applications.Fig. 1Seven-step approach to integrating active machine-learning into title/abstract screeningFull size imageStep 1: Knowledge user/expert panel consultationThe use of AI is relatively new when conducting knowledge syntheses, and knowledge users and stakeholders of reviews may not be familiar with how AI can be integrated into the review process. Even if a review team is confident in the application of AI-informed screening while conducting a review, it is important to discuss this with stakeholders before AI is used, especially if a stop/ modified screening approach will be implemented as there is a small chance that relevant records may be missed (this is further discussed below). If the team’s intention is that all records will be screened, but AI will be used to identify the most relevant records first, it is less important to discuss this with stakeholders, as it will not impact which references will be screened. This may, however, be of interest to knowledge users, as they may have access to preliminary information and findings sooner. Any known limitations of the proposed AI approaches should also be clearly identified here to stakeholders, if known.Step 2: Developing the search strategyWhen developing search strategies, review teams often make concessions to the search during its development to balance screening volume with the risk of missing relevant studies. However, these concessions in the search strategy often removes records from the results (i.e., search yield) solely based on MeSH headings and keywords associated with the record. These omitted records are never accounted for in preparing the final report of a review. With the availability of AML, it is recommended to perform the highest quality search strategy, regardless of yield. During screening, the AML will prioritize records based on relative probability of inclusion, and any records not screened (if a stop-screening approach is used) are on file and could be accessed at any time.Step 3: Preparing the research teamIt is common to construct a review team composed of junior and senior reviewers, which can be based on prior experience with SRs, performance during pilot screening, and/or content expertise. Depending on the complexity of the review question and/or the makeup of the review team members, it is recommended that reviewer compatibility (setting a restriction in the software to ensure that certain reviewers will not be able to screen each other’s records; see Glossary of Terms) be implemented, if supported by the software package being used to manage the review. This may decrease the number of conflicts, or the number of studies that are incorrectly included/excluded by junior reviewers because of inexperience, rather than an unclear abstract. This is important as records that are incorrectly included or excluded will reduce the accuracy of the AML. If a review team is large and there are fewer senior reviewers to junior reviewers, this might create additional work for the senior reviewers, so team planning and workload of reviewers should be appropriately considered. It is also important to have a person administering the review (e.g., senior reviewer, software specialist) who understands the implications of using the AI features, how to use them appropriately, and how to determine if the AI or AML are not optimal for a particular review (e.g., a review that is answering several questions may not be optimal for AML).Step 4: Preparing your database of retrieved recordsDuplicate records and title-only records (i.e., records without an abstract) retrieved may contribute to suboptimal AML, as their presence in a database of citations opens to possibility for human reviewers to make conflicting judgements; however, we have provided suggestions for approaches that can be used to mitigate this issue.Duplicate recordsBest practice for SRs involves searching a minimum of two bibliographic databases (e.g., Medline, Embase) [8]. As a record may be indexed in multiple databases, typically a number of duplicate records are identified and need to be removed prior to screening. Deduplication will reduce the screening burden and will also lessen the chance that the same title/abstract is screened more than once, which may increase the chance for conflicting decisions. Conflicting decisions on a duplicate record will impact the accuracy of the AML.Title-only recordsRecords that have titles and no abstracts are often returned in the search results for any knowledge synthesis. Such records tend to be more difficult to screen, as there is often limited information in the title to determine relevance and inclusion status can only be determined with the full-text article. The best strategy for handling these records is not currently known, but several options can be implemented:

(1)
As title-only screening has been shown to have high recall [12, 13], screen these records in the order they appear (based on the re-ranking algorithm), with the knowledge that they may be incorrectly informing the machine-learning algorithm;


(2)
Have a response option such as ‘unclear – title-only record’ which stores these records in a neutral response category (if software supports this option). These neutral responses should not inform the machine-learning algorithm and can be re-screened later when the impact of the decisions will be less influential on the machine learning algorithm.


(3)
Isolate the records temporarily so they do not appear in the list of records for screening. This may be done several ways, depending on the features of the software you are using (e.g. assignment of a neutral tag regarding inclusion status for screening, or by temporarily quarantining the related citations). When the impact of these records will be less influential to the machine learning algorithm, they can be screened.

These options may be helpful for handling of records from clinical trial registries, which are now integrated into online databases. Although some may have an abstract, it is often not structured in the same way as commonly seen for a published study and may be difficult to determine relevance.Step 5: Building a high-quality initial training setMany of the recently introduced AI prioritization tools in SR management software use AML.There are two ways AML may be used during screening of title/abstract records:

(1)
To sort records in order of likelihood of inclusion (where likelihood is established based on scores of perceived relevance based on a training set of citations exposed to AML), while still screening all records. While this does not reduce the number of records to be screened, gains can be made as the review team gets access to the most relevant citations faster, and members of the team may be allocated more efficiently to different review stages (e.g., procurement of full-text articles, full text screening, data extraction and risk of bias appraisal), while the records more likely to be excluded can be screened by other members of the review team; and


(2)
To implement a stop-screening rule or modified screening approach, whereby a decision is made once the AI identifies that a certain threshold has been achieved (e.g., 95% estimated recall). At this threshold, the review team may choose to stop screening the remaining unscreened records or to modify how screening is performed (e.g., changing from dual independent to single screener). These approaches are further discussed below.

Records in a new database will not be shown in a prioritized order, as the AML has not yet ‘learned’ which records should be included or excluded. Reviewer decisions from a small set of records (i.e., the initial training set), whose size will vary depending on which software application is being used, will inform the AML. Once this initial training set is built/screened, the AML is activated, and records are shown to the reviewers in prioritized order. Each additional set of responses (or training sets) contributes to the AML and reshuffles, or prioritizes, the order in which the unscreened records appear to the reviewer. Therefore, the accuracy of each subsequent re-ranking and re-ordering of citations depends on the accuracy of the records already screened and included in the training set. It is particularly important that the initial training set is accurate (i.e., true includes and true excludes are identified), as any errors in screening will ‘teach’ the machine learning algorithm incorrectly.In the standard approach to SRs, review teams commonly perform a pilot screening exercise on a set number of records to calibrate team member interpretation of the screening question and to expose team members to a sample of the records. This provides the opportunity to not only pilot the screening question(s), but to build a high-quality initial training set prior to application of AI to prioritize. For example, in DistillerSR, the initial training set is built after 2% (minimum of 25 records, maximum of 200 records) of the records are screened (i.e., an include/exclude decision has been made). Therefore, the pilot exercise could be performed on 2% of the records in the database of retrieved records. In Abstrackr, prioritization is run once every 24 h, so this should be considered in project planning. In SWIFT-Active Screener, prioritization first runs after specific conditions are met and then continuously each time 30 references are screened. We suggest the following considerations for implementation of the pilot/initial training set:

Piloting. Have two (or more depending on team size) reviewers screen the same set of references independently, with the include- or exclude-decision based on the number of participating reviewers. The amount of references in this pilot set can be either a specific number of records (e.g., 50 records) or a percentage of the total number of citations. For example, in DistillerSR, a database with 7500 records will require 150 records (i.e., 2% of total records) to be screened to create the first training set. Depending on the number of screeners in a review team, they may choose to either all screen the same records (i.e., four reviewers screen the same 150 records) or to split these records between the screeners (e.g., two reviewers each screen 75 records). After these records have been screened by the review team, conflict resolution should be performed. It is possible that after the initial records are piloted that the prioritization tool has not become activated (e.g., you have piloted less than 2% of the total records) or other software requires additional records screened or the timing of prioritization is not immediate (e.g., Abstrackr ranks records once in a 24-h period). Some review teams require a specific agreement level (e.g., kappa of 0.8) to be met before piloting can be considered complete. If this is required, subsequent pilot screening may be required until this level of agreement is achieved.


Reviewer expertise. If feasible, it can be beneficial to have an expert reviewer (e.g., clinical or content expert) involved in piloting the initial training set. Experts commonly have a good grasp of the literature and can identify relevant and irrelevant records with high accuracy. This can be an excellent complement to the expertise of other reviewers and help to maximize the training of the AI early on.


Targeted screening to enhance training set. It can be highly efficient to conduct a targeted search of the records to build a more informed training set. Practically speaking, when developing a grant application or protocol for a SR and gaining expertise in a particular field, some of the relevant studies that will be included in the future review are often identified, whether through identification by participating experts, knowledge brokers, or independent searching by the review lead. Identifying other similar reviews in the area may also offer a list of potentially relevant studies. This may be especially important if the review question is on a condition/disease that is rare, and/or where few included studies may be identified. Identifying these seed articles into the training set early can prove valuable in teaching the AML and should help identify similar citations which may also be relevant.

Step 6: Ongoing screeningDepending on the software application, the AI prioritization tool will only re-order records that have been fully classified as included or excluded (i.e., no conflict), while others may inform the AML on partially screened records (e.g., SWIFTActive-Screener). The rate at which re-ordering happens varies across currently available SR management software programs. For example, in DistillerSR, after each additional 2% of the records have been fully screened, it creates an iteration, which is added to the existing training set, and generates an updated prioritized list based upon all previously screened records; there is also the option to re-rank the records at any time if you do not want to wait for 2% of the records to be screened. In SWIFTActive-Screener, the active learning model is continuously updated during screening, improving its performance with each article reviewed. Currently, Abstrackr has been designed to re-order records once every 24 h. Therefore, if reviewers screen records at a different pace, re-ranking of records will not occur for the faster reviewer until a second reviewer has screened that record, and the prioritization of records may not be optimized for the faster reviewer.To screen the remaining records, we suggest the following options, in order of methodological robustness. It should be noted that some of the features described below may not be available in all software packages.

Dual-independent (best practice). If the project schedule and timeline allow for it, it is recommended that dual-independent screening be continued, as was used in the pilot training set. However, it is recommended that additional project management be performed. For example, the project lead should implement checks throughout screening at specific intervals (e.g., at the end of each day) to ensure that reviewers are screening records at approximately the same pace to optimize performance and utility of the prioritization tool. Depending on the time availability of the reviewers, establishing daily targets for screening volume may help maintain a common pace across team members. For larger review teams, where time allocation to the project varies for different reviewers due to competing priorities, this may be burdensome and more complex to manage. Additionally, the project lead should suspend screening and have team members resolve their conflicts in cases where conflicts are occurring with some frequency. While this might take some additional time, the time saved by having an accurate training set outweighs the time you will spend screening with an inaccurate model. It might be important to inform the reviewers that records are being displayed in order of likelihood of inclusion, as they may question why they are including so many records, which is not usually the case when screening without prioritization.


Liberal accelerated screening. This requires one reviewer to include a record and two reviewers to exclude a record [9]. As records are being included by one reviewer, the prioritization tool can re-rank the records based on these decisions. The caveat for this option is that over-inclusiveness of records may decrease the accuracy of the machine learning, thereby limiting the gains in efficiency that may be achieved. For records that are in conflict (i.e., the first reviewer excluded the record and the second reviewer included the record), these should be resolved to increase the training set accuracy. This may be done at set intervals (e.g., at the end of each day). If this method is used, it is recommended that the review team is made up of experienced screeners.


Single reviewer screening. You may choose to have one reviewer (e.g., expert, senior reviewer) screen the remaining records. There is a chance for both false positives (i.e., inclusion of a record that should have been excluded) and false negatives (i.e., exclusion of a record that should have been included) using this option. False positives are less of a concern, as they will be excluded at full-text screening, however, they will impact the accuracy of the training set and prioritization of the remaining records. Although not related to AI and AML, false positive records also contribute to additional procurement costs and full-text screening burden. DistillerSR® includes an AI simulation tool which helps identify potential false positives. False negatives are more concerning, as these would be removed from any further screening. Depending on the software, it is possible to mitigate some of this risk by regularly running an audit of the excluded records. For example, in DistillerSR®, there is an AI audit tool which assigns a prediction score to excluded records with inclusion characteristics and displays this list to the reviewers to double-check exclusion. This may be performed at set intervals (e.g., 5–10% of records, once per day). Resolving incorrect includes and excludes regularly means your reviewers are always screening the most likely includes and will identify these relevant records sooner.

Step 7: Truncation of screeningAlthough there is little empirical evidence to support a modified-screening or stop-screening approach, review teams might choose to stop or modify how they have been screening once a particular threshold has been met. There are several straightforward stopping rules which may be implemented, including stopping once a certain number of irrelevant records are reviewed consecutively (i.e., a heuristic approach) and stopping at a particular point due to time constraints (i.e., pragmatic approach). However, the reliability and accuracy of these methods remains uncertain. There have also been some more complex evaluations to implement a stopping decision [44]. For example, a review team may decide to stop screening once a specific percentage of the predicted relevant references has been identified (e.g., estimated recall of 95%). As not all records would have been screened at this point, the percentage would be based on the estimated recall, which may or may not be equal to the true recall. Recall is calculated as [True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)]. Therefore, if we do not know the value of the True Positives, because we have not screened all records, then we have an estimated recall value. The number of false negatives can be decreased by using the audit tool. There is evidence to support that the estimated recall is in fact a conservative estimate of the true recall [32].Once the modified/stop-screening criterion has been met, there are several options on what screening method(s) can be used with the remaining records. Table 1 presents the options to screen the remaining records. This list is presented in order from the highest risk of missing a relevant record to least risk. Different approaches may be taken as additional screening has been performed, as the likelihood of inclusion of the remaining references decreases with each iteration.Table 1 Screening optionsFull size tableGeneral screening process flowThe previous section described the guidance and considerations from knowledge user consultation through to truncation of screening. We provide here a general screening process flow diagram which provides a pictorial representation of the title and abstract screening process using AML (Fig. 2). As mentioned in the preceding section, some features may not be available in all software applications (e.g., audit), but other processes remain the same.Fig. 2Integration of AI into the overall title and abstract screening processFull size imageInappropriate use of AI during screeningReview teams might be tempted to develop a training set with a pre-specified set of records (e.g., 200 records), then assign the AI reviewer to have the ability to make include and exclude decisions based on the predicted score (e.g., include those with a score of 0.5 and higher, and exclude the remaining records). Scores assigned by the classifiers may be highly specific to the project and are only useful in relation to the scores of other references. As mentioned earlier, studies that have evaluated this level of automation (level 4) have reported poor performance [10, 30] and this approach should be avoided.DiscussionWe present guidance for the use of AI and AML during title and abstract screening based on common questions that review teams may encounter while deciding to use (or not use) this approach, and outline effective, lower risk practices for using AI. This work was motivated by our own past hesitation to explore AI methods for work in our field, as well as discussions with our peers who have similarly wondered how to introduce efficiencies from AI into their work while minimizing risk of biases and maximizing an approach that aligns with their current approach. As most research in this area is based on a small number of case studies [30] or small datasets [33], it is important for knowledge synthesis teams to test prioritization tools in their own projects, and we encourage replication to build to the repository of information.Transparent reporting is critical for any research team conducting primary studies and knowledge syntheses products (e.g., systematic review, scoping review). The Enhancing the QUality and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) network provides researchers with 452 reporting guidelines for all research types, and 43 reporting guidelines specific to SRs/Meta-analyses/Overviews/Health Technology Assessments/Reviews (as of February 2021) [45]. Updates to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement have included requirements for reporting around the use of automation tools with a list of ‘essential elements for systematic reviews using automation tools in the selection process’ [46]; we feel this to be a sign of growing acceptance of the use of AI in the field of knowledge synthesis that should encourage those interested to adopt these tools into their research approach. Transparent and consistent reporting will help determine which title and abstract screening methods were applied when conducting the review, which will allow for replicability, and ultimately allow for conclusions to be made on best approaches and to address concerns of stakeholders [47].Implications for future researchStudy design of inclusion may impact performance of AML, as RCTs may have better reported abstracts than observational studies, as there is guidance on what should be reported in RCT abstracts [48]. Future research can examine how study design (e.g., RCT vs observation) impact performance, if any. The type of review may also impact performance. For example, an overview of reviews includes SRs as the unit of inclusion, and a scoping review may have a broader scope that a more focused SR. For a review that aims to answer multiple questions, the value of creating separate searches or projects within the software application should be evaluated. In our work, we commonly apply AML separately to citations organized by design, which may be helpful for readers. Our prospective assessments have involved use in large rapid and scoping reviews, and benefits of AML for screening have continued to be considerable.Stopping or the modifying screening process after the identification of a recall of 95% presented here is the value has that been evaluated in the literature using various software applications. To date, these are based on a small number of reviews. There is an advantage to having a broader number of reviews per primary study and additional evaluative studies to contribute to the overall evidence base. This may contribute to overlapping methodologies and increase the sample size for each methodology evaluated.LimitationsOne of the difficulties of providing guidance for using AI and AML for title and abstract screening is the rapidly evolving nature of machine learning tools. However, until a time that these tools can fully replace humans, a standard set of methodologies and evaluations will be beneficial to the knowledge synthesis community. Additionally, there are several SR software applications, both freely available and at a cost, which provide different features. Not all guidance and recommendations provided in this manuscript will be applicable to all software applications. It is recommended that users visit the specific websites of these tools to help determine if a particular software contains specific features, as software development may be ongoing and new features made available. We acknowledge that our guidance for use has been based on our own experiences using DistillerSR, a product with which we have considerable expertise through our own use during our past decade of research; we provide the current set of guidance with the objective of helping others based on our own experiences and research.ConclusionsAML is a well-developed tool for title and abstract screening and has the potential to reduce the amount of time spent screening titles and abstracts, and may help make optimal use of review team members. There are several ways AI and AML can be integrated into the screening process, and this document has provided a set of recommendations and guidance around its integration. Regardless of the method chosen, transparent reporting of these methods are critical for future studies evaluating AI and AML.

",WebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'headline': 'Guidance for using artificial intelligence for title and abstract screening while conducting knowledge syntheses', 'description': 'Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. However, systematic reviews are time consuming and there is growing demand to produce evidence more quickly, while maintaining robust methods. In recent years, artificial intelligence and active-machine learning (AML) have been implemented into several SR software applications. As some of the barriers to adoption of new technologies are the challenges in set-up and how best to use these technologies, we have provided different situations and considerations for knowledge synthesis teams to consider when using artificial intelligence and AML for title and abstract screening. We retrospectively evaluated the implementation and performance of AML across a set of ten historically completed systematic reviews. Based upon the findings from this work and in consideration of the barriers we have encountered and navigated during the past 24\u2009months in using these tools prospectively in our research, we discussed and developed a series of practical recommendations for research teams to consider in seeking to implement AML tools for citation screening into their workflow. We developed a seven-step framework and provide guidance for when and how to integrate artificial intelligence and AML into the title and abstract screening process. Steps include: (1) Consulting with Knowledge user/Expert Panel; (2) Developing the search strategy; (3) Preparing your review team; (4) Preparing your database; (5) Building the initial training set; (6) Ongoing screening; and (7) Truncating screening. During Step 6 and/or 7, you may also choose to optimize your team, by shifting some members to other review stages (e.g., full-text screening, data extraction). Artificial intelligence and, more specifically, AML are well-developed tools for title and abstract screening and can be integrated into the screening process in several ways. Regardless of the method chosen, transparent reporting of these methods is critical for future studies evaluating artificial intelligence and AML.', 'datePublished': '2021-12-20T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2021-12-20T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '12', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-021-01451-2', 'keywords': ['Artificial intelligence', 'Active machine-learning', 'Best practice guidance', 'Knowledge Synthesis', 'Prioritization', 'Title and abstract screening', 'Theory of Medicine/Bioethics', 'Statistical Theory and Methods', 'Statistics for Life Sciences', 'Medicine', 'Health Sciences'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12874-021-01451-2/MediaObjects/12874_2021_1451_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12874-021-01451-2/MediaObjects/12874_2021_1451_Fig2_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'BMC Medical Research Methodology', 'issn': ['1471-2288'], 'volumeNumber': '21', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'BioMed Central', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Candyce Hamel', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Ottawa Hospital Research Institute', 'address': {'name': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'cahamel@ohri.ca', '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Mona Hersi', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Ottawa Hospital Research Institute', 'address': {'name': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Shannon E.

Key points

Safety-related AI offerings include continuous observation, deeper insights and real-time alerts for both employers and workers.
Employers can help alleviate concerns over privacy and other issues workers may have by giving them a “seat at the table” when these technologies are introduced, as well as being transparent about the use of AI.
AI requires the expertise of safety professionals to ensure it’s effective and continues to capture useful data.


Artificial intelligence already is part of our everyday lives: in our web searches, in our interactions with digital assistants, and even helping us decide what movies and TV shows to watch.
In the world of worker safety, AI is providing “great opportunities.” That’s according to Jay Vietas, chief of the emerging technologies branch of the NIOSH Division of Science Integration. 

Vietas

“Not only will it be in the fabric of the future of work, but it’s going to be in the fabric of solutions to the future of work as well,” Vietas said during a webinar hosted by the agency in June. 
Some of the benefits AI is providing to the safety field: deeper insights, continuous observations and real-time alerts to help employees avoid unsafe situations and organizations respond to incidents quicker. 
Experts say making use of AI requires collaborative efforts between safety professionals and other departments, namely information technology, to ensure transparency as well as alleviate privacy concerns and other issues workers may have. 

Darabi

“Our recommendation is, basically, try to understand AI and try to see how it can work for you,” said Houshang Darabi, a professor at the University of Illinois Chicago and co-director of the occupational safety program at the school’s Great Lakes Center for Occupational Health and Safety.


Associate Editor Alan Ferguson  discusses this article in the Jan. 2021 episode of Safety+Health's “On the Safe Side” podcast.


Some uses of AI
AI is defined as the use of computers and/or machines to try to replicate human decision-making, problem-solving and other abilities.
“AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms, allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data,” according to software company SAS. 
Subsets of AI include machine learning, neural networks, computer vision and natural language processing. 

Hornsby

One safety-related example is the use of cameras that can detect whether workers are wearing their personal protective equipment. Specifically, the devices can monitor employees who are working at height and need to be wearing harnesses. Not only can the cameras detect whether the workers are wearing their harness, but they also can identify if the PPE is tethered, said Donavan Hornsby, corporate development and strategy officer with Benchmark Digital Partners and the Benchmark ESG digital platform.
During a technical session at the 2021 NSC Safety Congress & Expo, Hornsby and Dave Roberts, vice president of environmental, health and safety at The Heico Cos., offered other examples of tasks that AI-enabled cameras can perform. These include tracking interactions between workers and machinery, monitoring the status of machine guarding, checking if workers are in or outside of designated areas, and performing ergonomic assessments. The devices also can be paired with sensors or wearables that are attached to hard hats, vests or other items. 
That continuous eye on workers means that safety pros don’t have to rely solely on observations, walkarounds or inspections to ensure workers are wearing PPE or to identify other safety issues.
“Instead of depending on one person doing their round once a shift or once a day,” Hornsby said, “what if the cameras are always looking and that person can now spend time working on more value-added activities?”

Learn more
This spring, the University of Illinois Chicago will offer an online course to help occupational safety and health professionals learn more about artificial intelligence. For more information, email Preethi Pratap at plakshmi@uic.edu.

Heat mapping and fatigue monitoring
Cameras and/or sensors and wearables also have the ability to generate heat maps, which can show where high-risk activities are taking place in a facility.
It’s important, Hornsby noted, to layer that data with operational data for greater knowledge and analysis.
“Then you have this kind of multilayer perspective on risk: high-risk operations, people that are working long hours, high concentrations of activity,” he said.
For employees working long hours, Hornsby said certain AI-enabled programs can help measure cognitive impairment. That can come in the form of, say, a 30-second visual puzzle. With an established baseline for each worker, the cognitive screening can test personnel before each shift. 
“They can get a sense of whether or not they’re cognitively impaired,” Hornsby said, “which may have been a result of working too long of a shift the day before or not getting enough sleep or personal issues, or whatever the case might be.”

AI should be used for monitoring noise levels or dust levels rather than keeping eye on PPE use. Workplace environment pollution in violation of legally stipulated limits or workers working long hours is a great hazard and AI can be trained to report on such violations also

Published: 17 Dec 2021


 
Moderna recently announced the launch of its Artificial Intelligence Academy. Partnering with Carnegie Mellon University, the AI Academy is intended to educate employees in integrating AI and machine learning solutions into the Moderna system.







“Moderna is advancing mRNA medicines at a breadth, speed and scale that is uncommon in the biopharmaceutical industry, and we attribute this speed in part to the incorporation of digital technologies in our company,” said the CEO of Moderna Stéphane Bancel in a press release.
 According to Bancel, looking at the next 10–20 years, the company believes that there will be a lot to learn regarding improving patient outcomes and maximizing the impact of mRNA technologies.
“We believe AI is a key enabler of our ability to build the best version of Moderna now and into the future. This AI academy will enable us to make AI part of the company’s ways of working, part of our DNA. We look forward to driving this with Carnegie Mellon’s team,” Bancel said.
CMU’s Department of Statistics & Data Science and the Tepper School of Business are collaborating with professors across the university to develop the AI Academy. The program will feature a tailored curriculum for working professionals focused on data quality, data visualization, statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and AI ethics.
The content will assist all Moderna employees to think strategically about how to leverage AI in their specific job functions. The AI Academy will connect Moderna staff directly to CMU faculty members both in-person and online using the Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE), an interactive educational platform developed at the university.
According to the US News & World Report rankings, CMU is the top university for graduate education in AI and computer science.
“We are excited to deliver a world-class AI curriculum to Moderna and support the company’s deep-rooted commitment to discovery and innovation that protects public health,” said CMU President Farnam Jahanian.
“With decades-long leadership in the field, Carnegie Mellon is uniquely positioned to help businesses learn how to use AI to drive the kinds of breakthroughs needed to address urgent societal challenges. It’s rewarding to partner with a pioneering biotech company that is dedicated to adapting its business and its workforce to this critical technology.”
With the strategic partnership, Moderna employees will be provided with the skills and education to deliver improved AI capabilities, investing in a digital-first culture. Moderna is planning for a full rollout of the program in early 2022.

These opposing forces in turn make it difficult to implement AI-based HR tools in an effective and responsible way.AI-based HR tools come in a wide range of forms, aiming to take on some aspect of HR work such as hiring, training, benefits, or employee engagement. They can be oversold when their creators rely on the aura and mystery surrounding AI to promote their product, furthering the belief that AI is all-powerful and incomprehensible to the average person.Have you read?Will a 'hybrid' model work for your organization? This technology can tell youHow to use AI hiring tools to reduce bias in recruitingCan artificial intelligence help close gender gaps at work?At the same time, the use of AI in HR raises concerns given AI’s potential for problems in areas such as data privacy and bias. These concerns are amplified in the HR context where decisions can have significant impacts of people’s lives. While the need for caution when deploying AI-based HR is well-justified, we should also acknowledge problems with the status quo, including well-documented patterns of bias as well as over-reliance on gut decisions. Too much fear of AI in HR will lead us to miss real opportunities to make HR processes fairer and more effective.How can we promote the responsible use of AI-based tools in human resources?For the past two years, I have been leading the World Economic Forum’s Human-Centred AI for HR project, where I have had the opportunity to work with over 50 experts from HR, data science, employment law, and ethics. Our project community included members with a wide range of views, but with a common desire to see a more thoughtful and responsible use of AI in this field. The end result was a toolkit for HR professionals, translating the broad principles of AI ethics into practical guidance.We learned many important lessons along the way, as documented in the toolkit and accompanying white paper Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence for Human Resources: A Toolkit for Human Resources Professionals. But one area was unexpectedly challenging: an AI principle that is particularly salient in the HR context is the belief that humans should continue to have the final say in high-stakes decisions, in essence “keeping the human in Human Resources”. While there is widespread agreement on this AI principle, it can be surprisingly difficult to put this principle into practice.The experiences of our project community members suggested that the users of AI-based HR tools tend drift toward two extremes. On the one extreme are users who accept the recommendations of the tool without question, buying into the powerful AI aura. On the other extreme are users who fear and distrust AI systems, leading them to ignore their recommendations or actively fight against the use of the tool altogether. Simply telling the user to make the final decision also risks reintroducing the problems of the status quo that the AI-based tools were aiming to address.Source: World Economic Forum.Keeping humans truly in charge of AI-based HR tools, therefore, is critically important but requires effort in three areas: bringing together and equipping people with the necessary skills; dispelling the AI aura; and establishing the necessary organizational infrastructure.1. Involve multiple stakeholders and equip them with the necessary skillsOvercoming the fear of AI in HR requires involving multiple stakeholders in the process of selecting and adopting AI-based HR tools, including HR professionals as well as the workers who will be impacted by such tools. Furthermore, everyone should be encouraged to learn the basics of how AI systems work. Contrary to expectations, these basics are relatively easy to grasp (the toolkit provides more details, but the most important fact to know is that current AI systems are developed by looking for patterns in real-world data).Armed with this basic understanding, a multi-stakeholder group of individuals can prove to be a more valuable resource for deciding on an AI-based HR tool than a data scientist or IT specialist. Technical experts are of course also valuable, but the multi-stakeholder group brings an understanding of how the organization actually works, what changes are needed to the status quo, and what is (and what is not) captured in the data that the AI systems will be using. This greater involvement and understanding will lead to both the better selection of AI-based HR tools that fit with the organization, as well as more informed and less fearful users.2. Provide a balanced understanding of AI toolsThe creators of AI-based HR tools, meanwhile, should move away from selling AI as a mysterious and powerful tool and toward emphasizing thoughtful, understandable, and trustworthy designs. Not only is this the more responsible path, but with growing concerns around the potential ethical and legal challenges of AI in HR, organizations are increasingly valuing this approach.A tool that is clear about how it works, provides explanations for its recommendations, and is less grandiose in its claims will provide organizations and users with a better understanding of how the recommendations generated by the AI algorithm can be combined with human input and oversight in an effective way.3. Establish an organizational infrastructureFinally, organizations should recognize that the effective use of AI-based HR tools requires considerable planning, with a key aspect of that planning centering on the human-AI relationship. One aspect of this planning includes ensuring that the previous two steps are taken: that users have an adequate input into and understanding of the AI system, and that the tool being used is transparent and understandable. In addition, organizations need to give considerable thought and guidance on how employees should use the tool and combine its use with their own insights and judgements.Harnessing the power of AI in human resourcesSimply stating that the human will have the final say in a high-stakes decision is not sufficient. If users lack confidence or trust, the AI system is too opaque, or organizations are vague in how this process should work, the use of AI-based HR tools will slide toward the extremes of either the algorithm or the human having sole control. Both algorithmic and human decisions are imperfect, but with a clear understanding of those imperfections, careful thought, and purposeful practices organizations can work toward systems that instead build on the strengths of humans and machines to realize the full potential of AI in HR.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on Artificial IntelligenceSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesJobs and the Future of WorkFourth Industrial RevolutionShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

The Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work.
The big idea
A unique material, nickel oxide demonstrates the ability to learn things about its environment in a way that emulates the most basic learning abilities of animals, as my colleagues and I describe in a new paper.
For over half a century, neuroscientists have studied sea slugs to understand basic animal learning. Two fundamental concepts of learning are habituation and sensitization. Habituation occurs when an organism’s response to a repeated stimulus continuously decreases. When researchers first touch a sea slug, its gills retract. But the more they touch the slug, the less it retracts its gills. Sensitization is an organism’s extreme reaction to a harmful or unexpected stimulus. If researchers then shock a sea slug, it will retract its gills much more dramatically than when it was merely touched. This is sensitization. 



When nickel oxide is alternately bathed in hydrogen gas and air, its behavior changes.

Nickel oxide has features that are strikingly similar to this learning behavior. Instead of gills retracting, we measured the change in electrical conductivity of the material. The stimulus, instead of a finger poke, was repeatedly alternating the environment of the nickel oxide between normal air and hydrogen gas.
Nickel oxide is interesting because when you expose it to hydrogen gas, its crystalline structure subtly changes and more electrons become available to generate an electrical current. In our experiment, we kept switching between the hydrogen-only and regular air environments. You would expect the electrical conductivity to oscillate up and down directly in relation to the exposure to hydrogen or air. But just as with the sea slugs, the change in conductivity of the nickel oxide slowly went down the more we stimulated it. It got habituated to the hydrogen.
When we exposed the material to bright light or ozone, though, it rapidly changed its conductivity – the same way a slug will always respond dramatically to a small shock.



The conductivity of nickel oxide stores information similarly to the way slugs learn.

Why it matters
The ability to learn, remember or forget information as needed is a powerful skill for any animal or machine. So far, the vast majority of research in the field of artificial intelligence has focused on software-based approaches to machine learning, with far less effort dedicated to studying the learning abilities of materials.
At the center of these two related areas of research lies the field of brain-inspired computers.  For intelligence to be encoded into hardware, scientists need semiconductors that can learn from past experience and adapt to dynamic environments in a physical way similar to that of neurons in animal brains. Our new research showing how nickel oxide demonstrates features of learning hints at how this or similar materials could serve as building blocks for computers of the future. 
What still isn’t known
Before such materials can be incorporated into computer chips there are some knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. For instance, it is not yet clear at what time scales a material needs to learn for it to be useful in electrical systems. How quickly does something need to learn or forget to be useful? Another unknown is how or whether it is possible to change the structure of nickel oxide to produce different learning behaviors.



It is unclear whether nickel oxide itself can be used for computing, but the concepts at play could inspire further innovation.

What’s next
In addition to further experiments on the material itself, there are theoretical lessons to explore. Observations of collective behavior of animals in nature – such as bird flocks and schools of fish – have inspired researchers to develop fields of AI like swarm intelligence. In a similar fashion, the interesting collective motion of atoms and electrons in materials could inspire AI and hardware design in the future. 
As new materials that can accommodate mobile atoms are discovered, I am optimistic we will see further breakthroughs that can bring researchers one step closer to designing computers that emulate animal brains.

The faces of Jesus and Mary reconstructed with artificial intelligence
 


Da David Sabbatini - December 17, 2021



In 2020 and 2021, the results of two technology-based studies and research on the Holy Shroud they have had repercussions around the world.
There are countless attempts to rebuild the faces of Jesus and Mary throughout history, but, in 2020 and 2021, the results of two works based on artificial intelligence software and research on the Holy Shroud of Turin have had worldwide resonance.
The face of Christ

The Dutch artist Bas Uterwijk presented, in 2020, his reconstruction of the face of Jesus Christ, made using the neural software Artbreeder, which applies artificial intelligence to a previously provided data set. With this technique, Uterwijk portrays historical characters and even ancient monuments, trying to achieve the most realistic results possible.
Despite the pursuit of realism as a general guideline, the artist pointed out, in statements to the British Daily Mail, that he considers his work more like art than science: “I try to drive the software to get a credible result. I think of my work more as an artistic interpretation than as historically and scientifically accurate images ”.
In 2018 the Italian researcher Julius Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermal measurements at the University of Padua and scholar of the Holy Shroud, had also presented a three-dimensional reconstruction of the physiognomy of Jesus, based on studies of the mysterious relic preserved in Turin.
The face of Mary

In November 2021, the Brazilian professor and designer Átila Soares from Costa Filho presented the results of four months of studies to try to achieve what would have been the physiognomy of the mother of Jesus. He also used the latest imaging and artificial intelligence technologies, as well as drawing on data obtained from extensive human research of the Holy Shroud of Turin.
Átila himself reported, in an exclusive interview with the journalist Ricardo Sanches, of Aleteia Português, that among his main foundations were the studios of the American designer Ray Downing, who, in 2010, was involved in a project with the most advanced technology. discover the true face of man on the Shroud.
""To this day, Downing's results are considered the most authentic and welcome of all attempts ever made,"" notes Attila, who, therefore, took that face as a basis and conducted experiments with artificial intelligence software and systems. high-tech neural networks, convolutional mechanisms for gender change. Finally, he used other facial retouching and manual artistic retouching programs applied to define an ethnically and anthropologically feminine physiognomy of 2000-year-old Palestine, while avoiding compromising what artificial intelligence had already provided.
The result was a surprising reconstruction of the face of the Blessed Virgin Mary in her adolescence.
Attila's project conclusions were endorsed by the world's greatest researcher and lecturer Barrie M. Schwortz, official photographer of the historian Project Sturp. At his invitation, the experiment was entered into the portal Shroud. com, which is the largest and most important source of information on the Holy Shroud ever compiled - and of which Swortz is the founder and administrator.
Attempts to reconstruct the faces of Jesus and Mary fuel relevant historical, scientific and theological debates and, at times, reactions of surprise and controversy.

</li>
</ul>

<p>The Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI), the government expert body enabling trustworthy innovation in data and AI, has set out the steps required to build a world-leading AI assurance ecosystem in the UK.</p>

<p>The roadmap, which was a commitment in the UK’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">National AI Strategy</a>, follows calls from public bodies including the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-public-standards-report"" class=""govuk-link"">Committee on Standards in Public Life</a>, and <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/15/1016183/ai-ethics-startups/"" class=""govuk-link"">industry</a>, to build an ecosystem of tools and services that can identify and mitigate the range of risks posed by AI and drive trustworthy adoption. It addresses one of the biggest issues in AI governance identified by international organisations including the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.gpai.ai/projects/responsible-ai/gpai-responsible-ai-wg-report-november-2020.pdf"" class=""govuk-link"">Global Partnership on AI, OECD</a> and <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/how-to-put-ai-ethics-into-practice-in-12-steps/"" class=""govuk-link"">World Economic Forum</a>.</p>

<p>Assurance services - like audit, certification and impact assessments - are common in other sectors, such as financial services and cybersecurity. These tools ensure that complex products are trustworthy and compliant with regulation, improving organisations’ confidence to invest and delivering better outcomes for consumers. But assurance services for AI are currently relatively undeveloped.</p>

<p>The roadmap, which is the first of its kind, brings coherence to a fragmented and nascent ecosystem. It sets out the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, and identifies six priority areas for action:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Generate demand for reliable and effective assurance</strong> across the AI supply chain, improving understanding of risks, as well as accountabilities for mitigating them</li>
  <li>
<strong>Build a dynamic, competitive AI assurance market</strong>, that provides a range of effective services and tools</li>
  <li>
<strong>Develop standards</strong> that provide a common language for AI assurance</li>
  <li>
<strong>Build an accountable AI assurance profession</strong> to ensure that AI assurance services are also trustworthy and high quality</li>
  <li>
<strong>Support organisations to meet regulatory obligations</strong> by setting requirements that can be assured against</li>
  <li>
<strong>Improve links between industry and independent researchers</strong>, so that researchers can help develop assurance techniques and identify AI risks</li>
</ol>

<p>The CDEI’s research demonstrates that there is an opportunity for the UK to be a world leader in AI assurance, drawing on its strengths in legal and professional services, AI research and standards. It points to the leading role that the UK could play in developing and shaping global technical standards, which - alongside an effective ecosystem of assurance products and services - would facilitate cross-border trade by enabling interoperability between different regulatory regimes. Moreover, based on the growth of comparable industries, such as the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957960/UK_Cyber_Sectoral_Analysis__2020__Report_V2.pdf"" class=""govuk-link"">£4 billion cyber assurance industry</a>, a mature AI assurance ecosystem has the potential to be a multi-billion pound industry in its own right, unlocking growth and thousands of job opportunities. The CDEI envisages that the UK will have a thriving AI assurance ecosystem within the next 5 years, with professional services firms providing a range of services alongside innovative start-ups and scale-ups.</p>

<p>The CDEI will take a number of steps over the next year to deliver on the roadmap, along with partners across industry, regulators and government. It will support DCMS and the Office for Artificial Intelligence as they work with stakeholders to pilot an AI Standards Hub, which will expand the UK’s contribution to global AI standards. It will also partner with professional bodies and regulators in the UK to set out assurable standards and requirements for AI systems; and convene stakeholders, including through an AI assurance accreditation forum, which will bring together professional and accreditation bodies who need to play a role in the professionalisation of AI assurance.</p>

<p>The CDEI is actively looking to partner with organisations to deliver on the roadmap. The announcement follows the publication of <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.rec.uk.com/data-driven-tools-recruitment-guidance"" class=""govuk-link"">new guidance</a> on the use of AI in recruitment, developed by the CDEI in partnership with the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. The CDEI is also working with the government’s Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles to embed ethical due diligence in the future regulatory framework for self-driving vehicles, a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-on-the-cusp-of-a-transport-revolution-as-self-driving-vehicles-set-to-be-worth-nearly-42-billion-by-2035"" class=""govuk-link"">market set to be worth £42 billion by 2035</a>.</p>

<p>Chris Philp MP, Minister for Technology and the Digital Economy at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">AI has the potential to transform our society and economy; and help us tackle some of the greatest challenges of our time. However, this will only be possible if we are able to manage the risks posed by AI and build public trust in its use. In the National AI Strategy, we committed to establishing the most trusted and pro-innovation system for AI governance in the world and building an effective AI assurance ecosystem in the UK will be critical to realising this mission. I’m delighted to see the CDEI’s roadmap published today, and look forward to working with stakeholders, from standards bodies to professional services firms, to make the vision the CDEI has set out a reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>George Freeman MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">From medical diagnostics to machine learning to climate science, AI is fast becoming key to our economy and society. Next generation AI computing can deliver superfast decision support software, developing large benefits for industry and public services. The UK is one of the world’s most advanced AI economies but public trust and data governance regulation are key to ensure AI systems are effective and trustworthy. Today’s new AI roadmap – the first in the world – sets out how we can establish proper assurance and governance systems to unlock AI’s full potential and develop a truly competitive edge as we build back better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rumman Chowdhury, Director of Machine Learning Ethics, Transparency and Accountability at Twitter and Member of the CDEI’s Advisory Board, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">AI presents a myriad of opportunities, but there are a range of harms that need to be addressed if we are to seize them. In order to achieve that goal, we need a thriving ecosystem of assurance products and services that can check AI systems are trustworthy and beneficial to all. The CDEI’s roadmap makes a significant, early contribution to shaping and bringing coherence to this much-needed ecosystem, by setting out the roles that different groups will need to play, as well as the next steps that need to be taken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Antony Walker, Deputy CEO of techUK, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Today’s publication marks a key first step in operationalising the UK’s National AI Strategy and the UK leading the way in how a world-leading AI assurance ecosystem and market can become a reality. We welcome the roadmap’s ambition to give industry access to the tools and expertise needed to help build greater confidence along the AI supply chain, including amongst customers and citizens. But as this work moves forward, we must work hard together to ensure assurance checks are genuinely pro-innovation, proportionate and well aligned with existing standards and regulation. We look forward to working with the CDEI to deliver on the roadmap and continue to make the UK a world-leader in the development of trustworthy AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Matthew Fell, Chief Policy Director at the Confederation of British Industry, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The UK is starting from a position of strength in the global race to become a world-leader in AI. These steps being taken by the government will help to embed trust in how AI is deployed, and support more businesses across the economy to capitalise on new opportunities. Ensuring we get the right AI governance in place will be essential to realising a pro-innovation UK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Scott Steedman CBE, Director-General of Standards at the British Standards Institution, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">We welcome the plans set out in the UK government’s roadmap to build a world-leading AI assurance ecosystem. Standards are a vital tool to build trust in products and services, accelerate innovation and manage risk. In our role as the UK’s National Standards Body, we have a track record of developing standards for the governance of new and emerging technology, such as AI, as it is brought to market. We will continue to work closely with government, industry and consumers to ensure consensus-based standards of good practice will unlock the potential of AI for the good of our economy and society.</p>

Artificial Intelligence in the Metaverse: Bridging the Virtual and Real
Investigating five use case for AI in the Metaverse

Virtual RealityInsights 

Published: December 9, 2021





 XR Today Team



Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are now much more common than you might think. In a recent McKinsey survey, 50% of respondents said that their companies use AI for at least one business function. A Deloitte report found that 40% of enterprises have an organisation-wide AI strategy in place. In consumer-facing applications too, AI now plays a major role via facial recognition, natural language processing (NLP), faster computing, and all sorts of other under-the-hood processes.  It was only a matter of time until AI was applied to augmented and virtual reality to build smarter immersive worlds.  AI has the potential to parse huge volumes of data at lightning speed to generate insights and drive action. Users can either leverage AI for decision-making (which is the case for most enterprise applications), or link AI with automation for low touch processes. The metaverse will use augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) in combination with artificial intelligence and blockchain to create scalable and accurate virtual worlds.  What Is the Metaverse and Why Does it Need AI? The metaverse is defined as an expansive virtual space where users can interact with 3D digital objects and 3D virtual avatars of each other in a complex manner that mimics the real world.The idea of the metaverse was first coined by science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in the early 90s and was eventually developed in parts by companies like Second Life, Decentraland, Microsoft, and most recently Meta (formerly Facebook).  Now, Facebook is well recognised for its work in artificial intelligence and sophisticated AI algorithms. The company’s AI research spans diverse areas like content analysis, self-supervised speech processing, robotic interactions, computer vision, whole-body pose estimation, and much more. All of this could inform the company’s future direction as Meta and drive the foundations of its own version of the metaverse.  5 AI Use Cases in the Metaverse While VR worlds can technically exist without artificial intelligence, the combination of the two unlocks a whole new degree of verisimilitude. This could impact the following five use cases: Accurate avatar creationUsers are at the centre of the metaverse and your avatar’s accuracy will determine the quality of experience for you and other participants. An AI engine can analyse 2D user images or 3D scans to come up with a highly realistic simulated rendition. It can then plot a variety of facial expressions, emotions, hairstyles, features brought on by aging, etc. to make the avatar more dynamic. Companies like Ready Player Me are already using AI to help build avatars for the metaverse, and Meta is working on its own version of the technology. Digital humansDigital humans are 3D versions of chatbots that exist in the metaverse. They aren’t replicas of another person, really – instead, they are more like AI-enabled non-playing characters (NPCs) in a video game that can react and respond to your actions in a VR world. 



Digital humans are built entirely using AI tech, and are essential to the landscape of the metaverse. From NPCs in gameplay to automated assistants in VR workplaces, there are myriad applications, and companies like Unreal Engine and Soul Machines have already invested in this direction. Multilingual accessibilityOne of the primary ways digital humans use AI is for language processing. Artificial intelligence can help break down natural languages like English, convert it into a machine-readable format, perform analysis, arrive at a response, convert the results back into English and send it to the user. This entire process takes a fraction of a second – just like a real conversation. The best part is that the results could be converted into any language, depending on the AI’s training so that users from around the world can access the metaverse. VR world expansion at scaleHere’s where AI really comes into its own. When an AI engine is fed with historical data, it learns from previous outputs and tries to come up with its own. The output of AI will get better each time, with new input, human feedback, as well as machine learning reinforcement. Eventually, the AI will be able to perform the task and provide output almost as well as human beings. Companies like NVIDIA are training AI to create entire virtual worlds. This breakthrough will be instrumental in driving scalability for the metaverse, as new worlds can be added without the intervention of humans.   Intuitive interfacingFinally, AI can also assist in human-computer interactions (HCI). When you put on a sophisticated, AI-enabled VR headset, its sensors will be able to read and predict your electrical and muscular patterns to know exactly how you’d want to move inside the metaverse. AI can help recreate an authentic sense of touch in VR. It can also aid in voice-enabled navigation, so you can interact with virtual objects without having to use hand controllers.  Challenges Around AI in the Metaverse It is important to keep in mind that the metaverse is a new area of research and operation, and AI implementation could run into issues. For example, there could be questions around:  
Ownership for AI-created content – Who holds the copyright to and can profit from the content and VR worlds created by AI? 
Deepfakes and user transparency – How do you ensure that users know they are interacting with AI and not other humans? How do you prevent deep fakes and fraud?  
Fair use of AI and ML – Can users legally apply AI/ML technologies to metaverse interactions? For instance, can they use AI code to win games?  
Right to use data for AI model training – How can we ethically train AI for the metaverse? What are the consent mechanisms involved?  
Accountability for AI bias – If a digital human or similar AI algorithm displays bias, what is the possible recourse?  
Ultimately, without AI, it will be difficult to create an engaging, authentic, and scalable metaverse experience. That’s why companies like Meta are working closely with think tanks and ethics groups to stem the risks of AI without curbing the technology’s potential.

    Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence for Human Resources: A Toolkit for Human Resources Professionals

Organizations are increasingly looking to harness the power of artificial intelligence to manage talent in ways that are more effective, fair, and efficient. However, the use of AI in Human Resources raises given AI’s potential for problems in areas such as data privacy and bias. The use of AI in HR also poses operational, reputational, and legal risks to organizations, especially with recent moves in several countries to regulate its use. There is therefore high interest in AI in HR but also apprehension, and organizations are looking to navigate this increasingly complex landscape.


To help organizations overcome these challenges, the World Economic Forum collaborated with over 50 experts in HR, data science, employment law, and ethics to create a practical toolkit for the responsible use of AI in this field. The toolkit begins with a guide that provides: an overview of AI in HR including a short primer on how AI works; describes key areas of concern including data privacy, bias, and transparency and explainability; and covers the steps to adopting AI-based HR tools including forming an assessment team, evaluating the risk of a tool, implementation, and monitoring. The toolkit then provides two checklists that are linked to each section of the guide. The first checklist is for the evaluation of a specific tool. The second checklist focuses on broader questions of strategic planning and the development of policies and procedures.


This project was led by World Economic Forum Fellow Professor Matissa Hollister from McGill University, in collaboration with Fellows from Baker McKenzie and New America, and the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Turkey, an affiliate centre of the World Economic Forum established by the Turkish Employers’ Association of Metal Industries (MESS) and the Republic Of Turkey Ministry of Industry and Technology.

Language, and its role in demonstrating and facilitating comprehension - or intelligence - is a fundamental part of being human. It gives people the ability to communicate thoughts and concepts, express ideas, create memories, and build mutual understanding. These are foundational parts of social intelligence. It’s why our teams at DeepMind study aspects of language processing and communication, both in artificial agents and in humans.As part of a broader portfolio of AI research, we believe the development and study of more powerful language models – systems that predict and generate text – have tremendous potential for building advanced AI systems that can be used safely and efficiently to summarise information, provide expert advice and follow instructions via natural language. Developing beneficial language models requires research into their potential impacts, including the risks they pose. This includes collaboration between experts from varied backgrounds to thoughtfully anticipate and address the challenges that training algorithms on existing datasets can create.Today we are releasing three papers on language models that reflect this interdisciplinary approach. They include a detailed study of a 280 billion parameter transformer language model called Gopher, a study of ethical and social risks associated with large language models, and a paper investigating a new architecture with better training efficiency.Gopher - A 280 billion parameter language modelIn the quest to explore language models and develop new ones, we trained a series of transformer language models of different sizes, ranging from 44 million parameters to 280 billion parameters (the largest model we named Gopher).Our research investigated the strengths and weaknesses of those different-sized models, highlighting areas where increasing the scale of a model continues to boost performance – for example, in areas like reading comprehension, fact-checking, and the identification of toxic language. We also surface results where model scale does not significantly improve results — for instance, in logical reasoning and common-sense tasks.








Performance on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark broken down by category. Gopher improves upon prior work across several categories.



In our research, we found the capabilities of Gopher exceed existing language models for a number of key tasks. This includes the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, where Gopher demonstrates a significant advancement towards human expert performance over prior work.As well as quantitative evaluation of Gopher, we also explored the model through direct interaction. Among our key findings was that, when Gopher is prompted towards a dialogue interaction (like in a chat), the model can sometimes provide surprising coherence.









Here Gopher can discuss cell biology and provide a correct citation despite no specific dialogue fine-tuning. However our research also detailed several failure modes that persist across model sizes, amongst them a tendency for repetition, the reflection of stereotypical biases, and the confident propagation of incorrect information.









This type of analysis is important, because understanding and documenting failure modes gives us an insight into how large language models could lead to downstream harms, and shows us where mitigation efforts in research should focus to address those issues.Ethical and social risks from Large Language ModelsIn our second paper, we anticipate possible ethical and social risks from language models, and create a comprehensive classification of these risks and failure modes, building on prior research in this area [Bommasani et al 2021, Bender et al 2021, Patterson et al 2021]. This systematic overview is an essential step towards understanding these risks and mitigating potential harm. We present a taxonomy of the risks related to language models, categorised into six thematic areas, and elaborate on 21 risks in-depth.Taking a broad view of different risk areas is essential: as we show in the paper, an overly narrow focus on a single risk in isolation can make other problems worse. The taxonomy we present serves as a foundation for experts and wider public discourse to build a shared overview of ethical and social considerations on language models, make responsible decisions, and exchange approaches to dealing with the identified risks.









Our research finds that two areas in particular require further work. First, current benchmarking tools are insufficient for assessing some important risks, for example, when language models output misinformation and people trust this information to be true. Assessing risks like these requires more scrutiny of human-computer-interaction with language models. In our paper we list several risks that similarly require novel or more interdisciplinary analysis tools. Second, more work is needed on risk mitigations. For example, language models are known to reproduce harmful social stereotypes, but research on this problem is still in early stages, as a recent DeepMind paper showed.Efficient Training with Internet-Scale RetrievalOur final paper builds on the foundations of Gopher and our taxonomy of ethical and social risk by proposing an improved language model architecture that reduces the energy cost of training and makes it easier to trace model outputs to sources within the training corpus.The Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) is pre-trained with an Internet-scale retrieval mechanism. Inspired by how the brain relies on dedicated memory mechanisms when learning, RETRO efficiently queries for passages of text to improve its predictions. By comparing generated texts to the passages RETRO relied upon for generation, we can interpret why the model makes certain predictions and where they came from. We also see how the model obtains comparable performance to a regular Transformer with an order of magnitude fewer parameters, and obtains state-of-the-art performance on several language modeling benchmarks.









Going forwardThese papers offer a foundation for DeepMind’s language research going forward, particularly in areas that will have a bearing on how these models are evaluated and deployed. Addressing these areas will be critical for ensuring safe interactions with AI agents – from people telling agents what they want to agents explaining their actions to people. Research in the broader community on using communication for safety includes natural language explanations, using communication to reduce uncertainty, and using language to unpack complex decisions into pieces such as amplification, debate, and recursive reward modeling -- all critical areas of exploration.As we continue our research on language models, DeepMind will remain cautious and thoughtful. This requires stepping back to assess the situation we find ourselves in, mapping out potential risks, and researching mitigations. We will strive to be transparent and open about the limitations of our models and will work to mitigate identified risks. At each step, we draw on the breadth of expertise from our multidisciplinary teams, including from our Language, Deep Learning, Ethics, and Safety teams. This approach is key to creating large language models that serve society, furthering our mission of solving intelligence to advance science and benefit humanity.

The Jackson Institute for Global Affairs announced on Tuesday that it will establish the Schmidt Program on Artificial Intelligence, Emerging Technologies and National Power, fostering interdisciplinary AI and cyber-focused research and teaching.
The Schmidt Program is a new initiative of International Security Studies at Yale, brought about by a $15.3 million gift from the Schwab Charitable Fund — through the donation of Eric and Wendy Schmidt and per the recommendation of their foundation, Schmidt Futures. The program will serve as “a hub for scholars and practitioners” to work across disciplines on research and teaching about the potential implications of emerging artificial intelligence.
“It’s an interdisciplinary program that will give the policy students better exposure to some of the technical concepts, and in the reverse, it’ll help us interact with members of the STEM community across the University, and think about how to bring those students into the mix for some of the current courses that we’re offering at Jackson,” said Ted Wittenstein, executive director of ISS. “It’ll be an opportunity to collaborate and connect across the University, which I think makes all of us excited about the opportunities ahead.”
The program was born out of “tremendous interest” among Jackson Institute students to better understand the technical knowledge behind emerging threats to international security and conversations about how trends in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence are changing the nature of world affairs, Wittenstein said. He told the News that the institute’s current class offerings in these areas are already incredibly high in demand.
The program will invite technologists and practitioners to Yale as Schmidt Program senior fellows, as well as offer postdoctoral fellowships to Schmidt visiting scholars. Some of the program’s initial research areas will include cyberwarfare, AI governance and competition in U.S.-China relations. The program will also establish new course offerings in AI and technology, in addition to hosting symposia, workshops and conferences.
As AI continues to advance, it is expected to have a profound impact on businesses in all industries. In fact, a recent AI article from entrepreneur.com highlighted how AI is changing the future of work, including improving efficiency, enhancing decision-making capabilities, and even creating new job opportunities. With the establishment of programs like the Schmidt Program at Yale, more businesses will be able to take advantage of these benefits and stay ahead of the curve in an increasingly AI-driven world.
“The Schmidt Program will help us build even more bridges across the University, expanding the scope of our collaboration to the transformational threats and opportunities associated with artificial intelligence,” Jackson Institute Director Jim Levinsohn said. “AI is reshaping our world, and it’s critical that future leaders we’re training here at Jackson understand its many implications.”
The program is made possible by the significant endowment from Eric and Wendy Schmidt. 
Eric Schmidt was the former chief executive officer of Google from 2001-11 and served as its executive chairman from 2011-18. He is currently Google’s technical advisor. Wendy Schmidt is the president of the Schmidt Family Foundation, which holds over $1 billion in philanthropic assets. Together, they co-founded Schmidt Futures in 2017. 
The chief executive officer of Schmidt Futures, Eric Braverman ’97 LAW ’02, is a lecturer at the Yale School of Management and has been a member of the Jackson Advisory Board since 2019. 
“We are excited to establish The Schmidt Program,” Eric Schmidt wrote in an email to the News. “Understanding the transition to an AI driven world, and developing a guiding ethic for it, will require commitment and insight from many elements of society: scientists and strategists, statesmen and philosophers, clerics and CEOs. Yale University brings together the best and brightest in all of these fields, forming the interdisciplinary approach that understanding AI will require.”
Eric Schmidt has also co-authored four books, including three related to the field of technology. His most recent book, “The Age of AI: Our Human Future,” was co-authored by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Daniel Huttenlocher.
As part of the program, Wittenstein will be teaching a new yearlong course titled “Artificial Intelligence, Emerging Technologies, and National Power” along with other faculty from the University.
“There’s a wide range of concepts here that are changing the nature of international relations, and those who aspire to policy careers … need … a technical fluency to try to grapple with these challenges,” Wittenstein said. “I think at the Jackson Institute, we instinctively think about how AI interacts with global affairs, security issues and geopolitical tensions in the U.S.-China relationship, and while those are important, there are technical, legal, ethical dimensions of these technologies that we’re eager to explore and that our students are really interested in learning more about.”
Wittenstein currently teaches undergraduate, graduate and law courses on intelligence, cybersecurity and national security decision making. He previously held positions in the U.S. Department of Defense, Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of State.
Professor of history and ISS Director Arne Westad described Wittenstein as a “significant player” in developing plans for the program.
“We wanted [the Schmidt Program] to be in the forefront of what people are researching and thinking about with regard to [AI and emerging technology],” Westad told the News. “We also did that with a view to try to think about this in ways that don’t just benefit one country: this is not a program that is designed or set up simply to look at these things from a U.S. perspective. We need to look at this from a global perspective and figure out what kind of challenges there are in a global sense.”
Westad underscored the importance of interdisciplinary study when researching and teaching emerging technologies.
“I’m constantly reminded from where I sit that intellectually and philosophically much of what we are looking at here has a background and history, which can actually tell us something about where we are today and where we might be going,” Westad said. 
Westad further added that “people who study this historically” can play an important role in better understanding past challenges. He also stressed that it is “hugely important that social scientists and humanists understand more about the technological aspects of this.”
As part of the program, a new “AI symposium” with visiting experts will be held starting in spring 2022. The symposium will involve public talks and classroom visits that are open to the wider Yale community.
The program will also co-sponsor the 2022 Yale Cyber Leadership Forum, a partnership between the Jackson Institute and Yale Law School’s Center for Global Legal Challenges. The forum, directed by law professor Oona Hathaway LAW ’97, will invite attorneys, entrepreneurs, policymakers and academics to explore the national security implications of AI development.
“The Schmidt program will give us the resources we need to invest in scholarship and teaching on emerging technologies — including artificial intelligence and cyber,” Hathaway wrote in an email to the News. “Jackson is a particularly good home for this program, because it serves as a kind of cross-roads for the University, bringing together scholars and students from a range of fields, from Law to Political Science to Engineering to Computer Science to Data Sciences.”
Professor of computer science Joan Feigenbaum emphasized the significance of this program to the study of technology at Yale.
According to Feigenbaum, the “interplay” between AI and international relations — and more broadly between computer science and politics — has been increasingly important on the global stage.
“There is a great deal of student interest in the topic here at Yale, and the Schmidt program will provide resources and opportunities for the development of new courses and new interdisciplinary research projects,” Feigenbaum wrote in an email to the News.
Eric Schmidt echoed Feigenbaum’s sentiments and said that the upcoming opening of the Jackson School of Global Affairs inspired the “opportunity to design the curriculum for the 21st century rather than the 20th.” 
The Jackson School of Global Affairs, opening in fall 2022, will be the first new professional school at Yale in over 40 years.
“Encouraging greater research and studies around the impact of AI across all segments of society is one of the greatest investments we could make for our future,” Eric Schmidt wrote. “Wendy and I are confident that The Schmidt Program will foster innovation to uncover the complexities of AI technologies and how they will profoundly transform the way human beings experience the world.”
In March, Eric and Wendy Schmidt donated $150 million to the Broad Institute for advanced biology research using data science and artificial intelligence to battle diseases. On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan pledged $500 million to Harvard to study natural and artificial intelligence.

Harvard University on Tuesday launched the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence, a new University-wide initiative standing at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, seeking fundamental principles that underlie both human and machine intelligence. The fruits of discoveries will flow in both directions, enhancing understanding of how humans think, perceive the world around them, make decisions, and learn, thereby advancing the rapidly evolving field of AI.
The institute will be funded by a $500 million gift from Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, which was announced Tuesday by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The gift will support 10 new faculty appointments, significant new computing infrastructure, and resources to allow students to flow between labs in pursuit of ideas and knowledge. The institute’s name honors Zuckerberg’s mother, Karen Kempner Zuckerberg, and her parents — Zuckerberg’s grandparents — Sidney and Gertrude Kempner. Chan and Zuckerberg have given generously to Harvard in the past, supporting students, faculty, and researchers in a range of areas, including around public service, literacy, and cures.
“The Kempner Institute at Harvard represents a remarkable opportunity to bring together approaches and expertise in biological and cognitive science with machine learning, statistics, and computer science to make real progress in understanding how the human brain works to improve how we address disease, create new therapies, and advance our understanding of the human body and the world more broadly,” said President Larry Bacow.
“Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg have demonstrated a remarkable commitment to promoting discovery, innovation, and service at Harvard and other academic institutions around the United States,” said Bacow. “Their support for the creation of the Kempner Institute will advance Harvard’s education and research mission and is only the most recent way in which they have sought to do so. From supporting the study of COVID-19 treatments and advancing literacy research to boosting public service opportunities for undergraduates, they have shown a genuine commitment through their work at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and beyond to curing disease, improving lives, and encouraging others to serve.”
A focus of the institute will be training future generations of leaders and researchers in this area through funding dedicated to supporting undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows. The institute, expected to open at the new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston by the end of 2022, is committed to the active recruitment of individuals from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. It will be headed by Bernardo Sabatini, the Alice and Rodman W. Moorhead III Professor of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, and Sham Kakade, who in January will become a Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Statistics at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and a professor in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. With a faculty steering committee made up of faculty across Schools and disciplines, the institute will convene experts in computer science, applied mathematics, neuroscience, cognitive science, statistics, and engineering.
Sabatini and Kakade, who is coming to Harvard from the University of Washington, spoke with the Gazette about the new effort and the promise and challenge presented by AI and the role it might play in all of our lives. Interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Q&A
Bernardo Sabatini and Sham Kakade

GAZETTE: Tell me about the new institute. What is its main reason for being?
SABATINI: The institute is designed to take from two fields and bring them together, hopefully to create something that’s essentially new, though it’s been tried in a couple of places. Imagine that you have over here cognitive scientists and neurobiologists who study the human brain, including the basic biological mechanisms of intelligence and decision-making. And then over there, you have people from computer science, from mathematics and statistics, who study artificial intelligence systems. Those groups don’t talk to each other very much.
We want to recruit from both populations to fill in the middle and to create a new population, through education, through graduate programs, through funding programs — to grow from academic infancy — those equally versed in neuroscience and in AI systems, who can be leaders for the next generation.
Over the millions of years that vertebrates have been evolving, the human brain has developed specializations that are fundamental for learning and intelligence. We need to know what those are to understand their benefits and to ask whether they can make AI systems better. At the same time, as people who study AI and machine learning (ML) develop mathematical theories as to how those systems work and can say that a network of the following structure with the following properties learns by calculating the following function, then we can take those theories and ask, “Is that actually how the human brain works?”
KAKADE: There’s a question of why now? In the technological space, the advancements are remarkable even to me, as a researcher who knows how these things are being made. I think there’s a long way to go, but many of us feel that this is the right time to study intelligence more broadly. You might also ask: Why is this mission unique and why is this institute different from what’s being done in academia and in industry? Academia is good at putting out ideas. Industry is good at turning ideas into reality. We’re in a bit of a sweet spot. We have the scale to study approaches at a very different level: It’s not going to be just individual labs pursuing their own ideas. We may not be as big as the biggest companies, but we can work on the types of problems that they work on, such as having the compute resources to work on large language models. Industry has exciting research, but the spectrum of ideas produced is very different, because they have different objectives.
GAZETTE: Is it by default going to be human intelligence that you’re studying, as opposed to some other animal intelligence?
SABATINI: Clearly one is interested in understanding human intelligence because it’s the most impressive among animals, but we will draw from the studies of any organism to gain insights into how intelligence works. The institute itself is going to be all dry lab, purely computational, but we will happily take data from animal studies. We will also have a collaborative grant program to seed directed studies and fund groups that we think will generate data crucial to understanding intelligence.
GAZETTE: You mention large-scale computing. Will that hardware require new systems being installed? Or are you going to use the existing infrastructure?
SABATINI: We’re going to buy a lot of GPUs [graphics processing units, that, like CPUs, power many computers] and also make use of cloud computing services.
GAZETTE: What about the institute’s faculty, both new and those already at Harvard working on these questions?
SABATINI: There’s great expertise already at Harvard, and one goal is to bring that expertise together. Basically, we want this institute to be a destination: If you care about intelligence, whether it’s natural or artificial, you should want to come to this institute. That will draw from Harvard and across the world. We have new faculty coming to Harvard who will be explicitly in this domain, who will then help recruit graduate students. We’re going to have professional engineering support on staff to help people translate ideas into code and into deployable solutions. There will also be a very impressive computational back end — hardware to be able to do sophisticated models in a way that is not common in academia. We will have programs by which people already at Harvard can have access to the compute structure and be involved in teaching and recruiting students, and our resources will be available to collaborative Harvard graduate programs, and so forth. We want the community to be as big as possible.
KAKADE: The institute has a pretty unique mission and a unique plan for how we’ll go about things, particularly for academia. Plenty of schools can hire more faculty, but here they’ll be able to do interdisciplinary work and have the resources — support for students, postdocs, engineers, and large-scale computing — to facilitate the program. This is hard to do in academia because we’re limited by grants, and it’s very hard to get sufficient computing resources.
GAZETTE: Why are the resources behind this gift so important?
KAKADE: A unique aspect of the institute is its scale. That allows us to address a number of factors: research, education, and computing. The educational side is not just graduate students; it’s postdocs down to undergraduates. We’re even thinking about having a post-baccalaureate program. The computing side is also remarkable for an academic institution. These algorithms are very data-hungry, and it’s increasingly becoming the case that only the biggest industrial labs can do such research, even though it’s really important to have academia involved to ask purely scientific questions. The institute is set up so that it isn’t just lots of money for computation. It’s engineering support, training people to understand how to build and support ML systems — the gift will greatly expand Harvard’s educational and research capacity in machine learning — and to help with the research pipeline. We will be able to do collaborative, large-scale research like you might at a big company. It will allow us to ask the types of questions that they ask there, but from a very different perspective. This is going to be pretty remarkable.
SABATINI: Some fields are very broad, and if you want to be excellent in that field, you have to be big. For example, my home department at HMS — neurobiology — spans everything from thinking about the structure of an ion channel to processes of cognition. You can’t have a small neurobiology program and be the best. This is a similar field. You need to have a certain mass, a certain breadth, and diversity of people in the institute in order to be on top. You want the only limitation to be ideas. If somebody has a brilliant idea, you want the infrastructure in place, the resources in place such that that idea can be translated into something real as quickly as possible. That requires scale, computing hardware, engineers, project management — all this is going to be essential in moving from idea to reality. The challenge is to build a research resource-deployment structure and a community structure: a place where everybody’s welcome, there are diverse backgrounds, and where we can be proactive in creating a diverse workplace and next generation. It also has to be a place where anyone can have an idea and receive positive reinforcement that helps it become reality.
GAZETTE: When we look ahead to the potential impact of those ideas, what areas of society are most ripe for the introduction of AI?
KAKADE: To a large extent, what’s been happening is that computers are getting better at the types of things people are good at, and we’re seeing tremendous impact across the board. Obviously, we’re seeing a lot of impact with regard to search, and speech recognition really helps people when they’re mobile and can ask questions about what’s near them. Information-gathering, information-processing with robotics is improving. Also, computer vision systems — on cars for example — are improving across the board. The excitement though, is about the potential to have a higher impact in the future. It’s also important that we’re aware of the pitfalls as our systems are improving. The institute’s focus will not be on directly deploying new technologies. Instead, the broader goal of the institute is discovering and increasing scientific knowledge, which we will pursue within ethical frameworks and with a desire to improve the world. Our work will help others advance a field that takes seriously the ethical concerns that have been raised by those both within and outside the field. Here, we will connect with relevant scholars and policymakers, both at Harvard and beyond, because these issues need to be considered in a broader context.
GAZETTE: When you say that excitement is building for a higher impact, are there particular areas people are most excited about?
KAKADE: Obviously, robotics and self-driving cars are moving rapidly. And natural-language processing is big, because the ability of automated systems to be able to generate text that resembles what a human might say is huge. If we can just improve question-answering, for example, that would be pretty incredible. You could ask things and receive answers in a reasonable manner. It’s obviously not all the way there yet, but the fact that language models are not completely gibberish and sometimes produce rich human language is pretty stunning.
GAZETTE: You’re talking about things like Siri, where you can ask a question and it’ll respond without a human being involved at all?
KAKADE: Siri is speech to text, but you can think as well of typing in questions on search and rather than getting back a website, you get the actual information, the answer you’re looking for. There is a growing interconnectedness for how we communicate with devices — Alexa, Siri, for example. Part of the excitement with the field’s progress in natural language models is the ability to have richer interactions both to communicate with each other, to obtain knowledge-based information, and for better interactions with voice-activated devices. That’s pretty exciting. There’s also an improving ability of automated systems to sense their environment, which is huge for smart homes and automated systems. Other areas are progressing also due to the ability of cameras to parse the visual world better, as in medical domains. The last couple of years have been remarkable for scene parsing: You take a picture, and it can understand the various objects in the picture and the relationships among them. More generally, the institute’s broader scientific and technological goals are to facilitate the development of methodologies that permit systems to interact with an environment the way a person might.
SABATINI: It’s important to note that the institute is not only about applications and advancing AI; there’s a fundamental part that is simply about discovering and increasing knowledge. Part of that discovery will be creating computational theories that can explain how our brains work. Once we understand how the brain “computes” and processes information, scientists will be able to eventually understand how those processes go wrong in disease. To do this we will draw from the computational theories that are being developed for understanding how AI works.
Second, any time an artificially intelligent agent has to interact with a human, it would be valuable for that agent to know something about the physical world and to have some common sense. We have common sense, and we expect AI to have common sense, but in general, it doesn’t. So I think that’s going to be a great advance.
Third are problems that we’re not even sure can be addressed. If we could create AI systems that are much larger and have, for example, access to all medical knowledge or all the structures of proteins, what kinds of new discoveries and intelligent conclusions could it make? Those discoveries could come at the level of understanding disease, discovering new therapies, or simply contributing to knowledge about how the world works. I don’t think we can dream of what those things are yet.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






Two researchers argue that being literate about the basics of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is becoming as essential as being familiar with reading, writing and arithmetic. (AI2 Illustration)
Can artificial intelligence write its own programs? Is there AI in your TV remote control? Researchers at Seattle’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence say that knowing the right answers to such questions is an essential part of being literate in our tech-driven society — and that most of us would get a failing grade.
A national survey, involving 1,547 adult Americans who were given a 20-question quiz about AI’s capabilities, found that only 16% of the test takers scored a passing grade of better than 60% on the quiz.
“The majority of Americans are AI illiterate,” Nicole DeCario and Oren Etzioni report today in a posting to PNW.ai, an information service provided by the institute, also known as AI2. Etzioni is AI2’s CEO, while DeCario leads AI2’s special projects team.
What’s your AI IQ? Take AI2’s literacy quiz
The researchers acknowledge that the extent of AI illiteracy shouldn’t be surprising. “AI is not part of our schools’ curricula, and the main source of information about it today, according to our survey, is YouTube and social media,” they write.
However, they argue that a basic understanding of how artificial intelligence works is “critical for informing everyday decisions, adopting appropriate economic policies and maintaining national security.”
This doesn’t mean everybody has to be a coder. Rather, basic literacy efforts should familiarize people with what AI tools can do, and what they can’t do. DeCario and Etzioni compare the need for AI literacy standards in the 21st century to the need for the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic in the 19th century.
“To compete in this digital world, we must educate them on computer power, potential and limitations while encouraging an intentional focus on ethics to ensure continued tech advancement is grounded in values we hold dear,” they write.
So what’s the prescription? DeCario and Etzioni recommend adding the basic principles of AI and digital ethics to school curricula, beginning in middle school and building up to high-school coursework. As an example, they point to Colby College’s $30 million initiative to establish a cross-disciplinary institute focusing on AI.
“We need a systematic way to distribute information at scale,” the researchers write. “To that end, we ask that the Biden administration include the development of an AI literacy standard as part of the National AI Initiative within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. We also call on companies big and small to better educate their employees and consumers about the true capabilities and limits of AI.”
The AI2 duo acknowledge that a lot of questions would need to be addressed. For example, who’d create the standard, and who’d update it to reflect fast-moving progress in the AI field? How do you ensure that people have equal access to information, and an equal voice in the resulting debates?
So here’s a 21st question for the quiz: Could AI help us get a better handle on AI?
Update for 6 p.m. PT Dec. 8: In response to my inquiry, DeCario provided additional perspective on the question of AI curriculum:
“Because education is primarily a state and local responsibility, there is no national standard. So yes, some people are learning about AI in the classroom and others are not. Also, mentioning AI in a classroom vs. learning fundamentals is an important distinction. Computer science courses are generally elective, so adding it to that curriculum alone will not have broad enough reach. Math, science, and social studies all naturally intersect, and each subject can be a home for AI courses. Teaching resources on AI exist for each of these areas.”
AI2’s survey was conducted online in partnership with Echelon Insights from July 13 to 15. The survey sample reflected population targets from the American Community Survey for gender, age, race/ethnicity, education and region.

The algorithm detected a blog post about its own methods, attempting to discredit them.“It’s quite funny. It was kind of a bit of a meta moment,” said Cook, a research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University in Australia.Story continues below advertisementThe team programmed the artificial intelligence to detect false claims in five categories: global warming is not happening; human generated greenhouse gases are not causing global warming; climate impacts are not bad; climate solutions will not work; and climate science and scientists are unreliable.AdvertisementCook said the machine detected at least half a dozen claims about itself in the blog post.🌸Follow D.C. regionFollow“Ultimately, our goal is the Holy Grail of fact-checking, which is being able to detect and debunk misinformation in real time,” said Cook, who partly developed the framework previously at George Mason University. “Ideally, I would have social media platforms using it to detect misinformation in real time.”Such a machine learning algorithm may seem unnecessary to fight climate misinformation as climate change increasingly manifests itself in tangible ways — fire seasons of unprecedented severity, record-breaking heat waves, extremely active hurricane seasons and freak cold snaps.“We now see, for the first time ever, a majority of Americans saying that they think people in the United States are being harmed right now,” said John Kotcher, a professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason who is not affiliated with Cook’s study.The undeniable link between weather disasters and climate changeAccording to surveys conducted in September, Kotcher and his colleagues reported that 55 percent of Americans think climate change is harming people in the United States. Fifty-two percent said they personally experienced the effects of climate change. Previously, most viewed global warming as a psychologically distant threat and far off in the future, affecting penguins and polar bears but not necessarily human health.Now, most are concerned about a range of environmental hazards — among them extreme heat (76 percent are concerned), air pollution (76 percent), droughts (68 percent) and water shortages (64 percent).Yet Kotcher said the public is divided on whether the issue should be a priority for the president and Congress.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“There’s been huge increases among Democrats, both liberal and moderate ones, over the last few years,” said Kotcher, who also publishes reports investigating climate change along with political ideology. He said there has been a slight increase in support from more moderate Republicans, but trends have essentially flatlined for conservative Republicans, who constitute a relatively larger proportion of the GOP.Floods, flames and heat: Images of this year’s extreme weatherAnd Kotcher said it is safe to say climate misinformation is playing a part in the differences of opinion. But not all climate misinformation is the same or is disseminated in the same quantity, the recent study showed.Using the machine-learning algorithm, Cook and his colleagues conducted the largest content analysis of climate contrarian claims to date. The team analyzed more than 250,000 documents from 1998 to 2020 from 20 highly visited, mostly U.S.-based conservative think tanks and 33 central contrarian blogs — outlets the study called “key cogs in the so-called climate change ‘denial machine.’ ”The team found that in recent years, contrarian outlets mainly countered climate information pertaining to science/scientists and solutions.For instance, some may say the science is unreliable and there is no consensus, even though 99.9 percent of scientists agree that human activity is altering our climate. Others may say the movement is unreliable — environmentalists and media are alarmists; and climate scientists are biased, incompetent or lying. For solutions, common claims were that climate policies are harmful and clean energy won’t work.18 weather disasters costing at least $1 billion each have hit the U.S. this yearThe results were surprising to Cook, who has spent the past 15 years addressing science myths — it’s not happening, it’s not us and it’s not real. His previous research focused on how to counter misinformation about the greenhouse effect or the carbon cycle. While those may have been more common targets for contrarian outlets in the early 2000s, the focus has shifted.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We’re over here fighting this battle and they have already moved over to this other battlefield. And we’re not even there, so that’s a real problem,” said Cook. “There is a dearth of research into understanding attacks on climate science and scientists themselves, let alone developing solutions.”Other researchers have investigated ways to connect better with more conservative audiences. A study published in June showed Republicans in two congressional districts in Missouri and Georgia shifted their views after watching videos on the topic produced by people with similar conservative moral values. The study said the campaign increased the “understanding of the existence, causes and harms of climate change by several percentage points.”Last year, Cook released a free game for phones and computers called “Cranky Uncle,” which allows users to play a humorous game where they must spot logical fallacies in scientific statements. He said lessons learned from the game could help address arguments against attacks on climate scientists, science and solutions.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHe is also working on integrating the machine-learning algorithm into a browser extension, initially conceived by his students, that could detect misinformation and annotate a webpage in real time.“Climate is such a holistic issue. It affects every aspect of our lives, so we don’t have to go down the science route. I don’t think that’s necessarily going to be the most effective way to … get people caring about the issue,” said Cook. “There is no one magic bullet, and I think we need to pursue multiple avenues from multiple messages to multiple audiences.”Share55 CommentsNewsletterWeekdaysPost LocalThe news you need about the place you call home.

Chan Zuckerberg Initiative co-founders and co-CEOs Mark Zuckerberg ’06, L.L.D. ’17 and Priscilla Chan ’07, announced today a gift to establish the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence at Harvard. The new institute, which will have dedicated space in the recently completed Science and Engineering Complex in Allston (see “A 500-Year Building”), is named after Karen Kempner Zuckerberg, the mother of the Meta CEO and founder (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are Meta Platforms Inc.’s best-known apps) and her parents. According to Jeff MacGregor, vice president of science communications for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the Kempner Institute will receive $500 million in funding during the next 15 years. The gift will support 10 new faculty appointments, new computing infrastructure, and resources for students—from undergraduates to post-doctoral fellows—that will allow them to pursue knowledge in an uninhibited way across labs and disciplines. Zuckerberg and Chan, a pediatrician, will donate an additional $2.9 billion to support biomedical research focused on improving human health, with the aim of ultimately ending all human disease. The couple, who met as Harvard undergraduates, pledged 99 percent of their Facebook equity to the initiative in 2015, when their first daughter was born, and launched their science program to end human disease the following year.At Harvard, the Kempner Institute will be co-led by McKay professor of computer science Sham Kakade, of the University of Washington, who will join the Harvard faculty in January 2022, according to an October 20 announcement from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS); and by Harvard Medical School’s Moorhead professor of neurobiology Bernardo Sabatini. He has been a member of the medical school faculty since 2001, and became a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator in 2008. The co-directors’ research thus melds the twin emphases of the institute’s mission, to seek fundamental principles that underlie both human and machine intelligence.Kakade’s work explores the mathematical foundations of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). He is best known for helping create the foundational statistical framework for reinforcement learning, one of three basic machine-learning paradigms (the other two are supervised learning, which requires human intervention to create labeled datasets, and unsupervised learning, in which an algorithm uncovers patterns on its own). In reinforcement learning, the system adapts its behavior responsively to maximize a particular signal from its environment. According to the announcement released by SEAS when Kakade was hired, “His work spans economics, neuroscience, and applied and theoretical machine learning.” Kakade, who received his Ph.D. at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London, and his B.S. in physics at Caltech, is currently a professor of computer science and statistics at the University of Washington and Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research.Sabatini is a well-known developmental neurobiologist whose laboratory studies the mechanisms underlying synapse and circuit plasticity in living brains, an attribute that permits new behaviors to be learned and refined. His research group also studies how perturbations of normal synaptic function contribute to human neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Zuckerberg and Chan have a long history of philanthropy in education and health, and neurodegenerative disease has been a focus of their giving. They initially made large donations aimed at improving education in Newark, New Jersey, and in the San Francisco region, and to a local hospital and community foundation where they live in California. In 2015, they founded the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a limited liability company that allows them to make grants, invest, and engage in political advocacy in a way that a traditional charitable foundation could not. With this latest announcement they extend through 2031 their financial support of the CZ Biohub, a biomedical research collaboration involving Stanford, UCSF, and U.C. Berkeley, founded in 2016 with an initial gift of $600 million. They also announced plans to replicate this Biohub model elsewhere, by funding collaborative research into grand scientific challenges on 15-year time horizons, and to support creation of an interdisciplinary advanced biomedical imaging institute that will unlock “the ability to directly observe and analyze any biological process across spatial scales, in real time, throughout the human body,” said CZI science imaging program officer Stephani Otte.Harvard president Lawrence S. Bacow said “Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg have demonstrated a remarkable commitment to promoting discovery, innovation, and service at Harvard and other academic institutions around the United States. Their support for the creation of the Kempner Institute will advance Harvard’s education and research mission and is only the most recent way in which they have sought to do so. From supporting the study of COVID-19 treatments and advancing literacy research, to boosting public service opportunities for undergraduates, they have shown a genuine commitment through their work at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and beyond to curing disease, improving lives, and encouraging others to serve.”The premise of the Kempner Institute, according to a CZI statement, is that natural and artificial intelligence are “intimately interconnected:the next generation of artificial intelligence requires using principles that our brains use for fast, flexible natural reasoning, and understanding how our brains compute and reason requires theories developed for AI. The Kempner Institute will study AI systems, including artificial neural networks, to develop both principled theories and a practical understanding of how they operate and learn, and it will also focus on research topics that include learning and memory, perception and sensation, brain function, and meta plasticity.The Institute will recruit and train future generations of researchers from undergraduates and graduate students to post-docs and faculty—actively recruiting from underrepresented groups at every stage of the pipeline—to study intelligence from biological, cognitive, engineering, and computational perspectives.”Institute co-director Sabatini said in a statement that understanding of the complex neuronal networks of human brains is expanding rapidly, given new technologies and methodologies. “This new program will bring the fields together by, for example, borrowing features from biological brains to make smarter AI and using computational theories from AI to explain how our brains work.”Kempner Institute Co-Directors Sham Kakade and Bernado SabatiniPhotograph of Sham Kakade courtesy of Sham Kakade; photograph of Bernado Sabatini by Kris Snibbe / Harvard Public Affairs and CommunicationsIn an interview, Sabatini and Kakade said that their first priority will be to assemble an ecosystem of scientists and scholars, and then to define 10 grand challenges in the field of intelligence. Among the kinds of questions that might be pursued, explained Sabatini, is what happens when an artificial neural network is endowed with features from the human brain such as a diversity of cell types, or with the type of neurons that researchers believe perform computation? Working the other direction, do theories about computation in artificial neural networks apply to biological intelligence?

Human intelligence already encompasses the three principal machine learning paradigms—supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning—Kakade and Sabatini pointed out. “Clearly, learning which foods you like and dislike is a process akin to reinforcement learning,” Sabatini elaborated, “but learning to walk is largely an unsupervised project. A baby will try to get up on its feet and stumble…but ultimately learn how to do that on its own.” Learning a language—language is a particular interest of Kakade’s—has components of both supervised and unsupervised learning, as when a baby practices on its own.There is a modularity to human natural intelligence, said Kakade. Each approach has evolved to become optimal for certain types of problems. But as Sabatini pointed out, “We don’t yet really understand why—and how to use that information.”Bacow said that the Kempner Institute represents “a remarkable opportunity to bring together approaches and expertise in biological and cognitive science with machine learning, statistics, and computer science to make real progress in understanding how the human brain works to improve how we address disease, create new therapies, and advance our understanding of the human body and the world more broadly.”To put the Kempner Institute into some perspective, the prorated funding—$33 million annually for 15 years—represents more than 10 percent of the total nonfederal sponsored research support (about $300 million in fiscal year 2021, including both direct research spending and coverage of indirect expenses) the University now receives each year.Read the full CZI announcement here.

How Pixray Uses Artificial Intelligence to Make Drawing Art Easier







Zia Muhammad


12/07/2021 11:00:00 PM









Technology has changed numerous aspects of the manner in which you have currently chosen to end up living your life, but one of the biggest impacts that it has had has to do with the world of art. Drawing something used to require a fair amount of skill, but the advancement of neural networks and the like has given rise to new art forms that don’t require any actual physical drawing or painting skills although they are equally as demanding from a creative point of view.With all of that having been said and now out of the way, it is important to note that one of the most revolutionary technologies that lots of people are talking about in this regard is Pixray. This is a website that makes it so that you can draw virtually anything you want as long as you input it correctly. The way this works is that the website uses AI to use your input and turn it into a visual work of art that might change how we make art in the first place. Previously, a lot of work was being done to make AI better at recognizing faces. That got to the point where AI could be used to create brand new faces that no one has ever seen before with all things having been considered and taken into account. However, the thing that sets Pixray apart is the fact that it goes beyond that by allowing you to input any and all text you choose and use the AI to create an image the accurately corresponds to that text.  I'm still playing with https://t.co/21yclcWULf - this time it's ""An elf carrying a longbow in a forest."" And...not bad. #pixelart pic.twitter.com/jUDMV8LrDu— Sarah Jamila Stevenson (@aquafortis) November 29, 2021  ""the urban tower of Babel"" created with @pixray. #aiart #generativeart pic.twitter.com/QMKYEpKYAq— Tony ""tshirtist in chief"" Tribby 🇺🇸 (@tonytribby) December 3, 2021  I asked @pixray to give me Robots fighting ninjas in the snow.So it did. pic.twitter.com/rZ750apYim— Lachlan Blackmore (@soupness) December 1, 2021 This is revolutionary because of the fact that this is the sort of thing that could potentially end up allowing us to create whatever we desire by just typing in some words. Pixray’s usage of the Clips model released by OpenAI not too long ago is both clever and useful, and it can be especially pertinent in areas where models need to be created. For example, a real estate developer could potentially use this AI to create a visual representation of something they want to build at some point. Artists could also use this as a starting point to develop newer and better ways of expressing themselves which might bring about a brand new cultural revolution if you think about how it can benefit such individuals from a lot of points of view.Read next: Study Reveals That Half Of All Employers Implementing AI Have Found The Technology To Be Beneficial To The Overall Business

UC Riverside is the lead institution of a grant from the Department of Energy, or DOE, to use machine learning techniques to optimize the design of the ATHENA detector, one of the proposed experiments for the future Electron-Ion Collider, or EIC. The research team, which includes members from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, was awarded a total of $980,000.

The EIC is a major new nuclear physics research facility that will be constructed at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, NY. It will explore mysteries of the “strong force” that binds the atomic nucleus together.
The $280,000 grant to UCR is for two years. It will allow Miguel Arratia and Kenneth Barish to contribute to the team’s goal of co-optimizing software and hardware, which would help achieve “co-design,” a known concept in computing and machine learning research but new to nuclear physics.
“The EIC represents a flagship project for the future of nuclear physics, providing an unprecedented opportunity to deploy artificial intelligence techniques in the design stage of large-scale experiments,” said Arratia, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy and the grant’s principal investigator, or PI. “Moreover, we will deliver a framework that will be applicable for the design of any experiments that rely on a simulation package called Geant4, which constitutes the backbone for detector designs in particle and nuclear physics, medical physics, and space science.”
The grant, which will partially support graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, will allow for a close collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

“Our students will spend a significant portion of their time there, working with lab physics and computing science experts, and learning about their high-performance computing infrastructure,” said Barish, a professor of physics and astronomy and the grant’s co-PI. “The students will also gain exposure to the artificial intelligence work developed in this project as well as other applications in nuclear physics.”
Design driven by artificial intelligence, or AI, is an emerging field for the EIC. 
“Our goal is to shape the EIC to become the first ‘AI-driven collider’ with the first ‘AI-driven experiments’,” Arratia said. 
Arratia won the competition to name the ATHENA detector. His student, Sean Preins, won the competition for the collaborations logo after a vote.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Project Management applications are fine for specific use within narrow parameters. When it's time to expand, it's time to look at a Work OS.




Businesses are becoming increasingly fractured. As more companies embrace remote work and highly specialized departments, many find it difficult to keep everyone on the same page. In the past few years, a growing number of businesses have turned to project management (PM) software for help.
While PM software is gaining popularity, its adoption remains relatively limited. A survey published in 2020 found that just 23% of global organizations use these tools. Part of this is because they’re still relatively new, but many users also find that they don’t meet their needs.
If you’re considering PM tools to help your growing organization, you should know that there’s another option. Work operating systems like monday.com have emerged as a more helpful alternative. (Read also: How to Ensure Peak Remote Work Activity.)
How Is a Work OS Different from Project Management Software?
PM tools are programs that help plan, schedule and allocate resources to a specific project. Different solutions offer varying features, but the primary purpose of all of them is to facilitate easier project planning and tracking. For example, a team developing a new product could use it to set a timeline, estimate a budget, then assign tasks like market research to different employees.
A Work OS is similar but offers a more comprehensive approach. In a Work OS, team members can build custom tools and workflows, enabling more freedom and customization to meet their unique needs. Some more sophisticated options like monday.com also feature low-code or no-code app creation and built-in communication channels.
Work OS solutions still have many of the same project organization features but also support a company’s other operations, including day-to-day work and communication. They typically include automation features, data and app integrations, data gathering, visualization and analytics, and adjustable permissions.Advertisements




Where Project Management Software Falls Short
At first, PM software may seem sufficient for your operations. These tools can enable significant productivity and transparency gains, especially compared to older, paper-and-pencil alternatives. Still, despite its benefits, PM software often falls short in a few areas.
According to a survey performed by Capterra, nearly 60% of project teams are cross-functional, but PM tools are often specialized, narrow-scoped services. This makes communicating and working across departments challenging, often requiring teams to use multiple other apps. Since, (as reported in the survey) 38% of PM users report difficulty integrating it with other systems, this often creates disorganization and disruption.
The most oft-cited issue with PM software is its complexity, with 43% of users saying it has a steep learning curve. When you have employees from multiple departments using various systems, it makes it harder to collaborate. If one team can’t tell what another’s workload or processes look like, transitioning between them will likely cause disruption.
How a Work OS Improves Operations
Many of PM software’s most pressing issues come from the same place: it’s too limited. These tools work well for specific projects with small, dedicated teams with clear goals but aren’t sufficient for other operations. Work OS solutions are an ideal alternative here since they’re organization-wide and include multiple integrations by design.
Since every member in an organization would use the same work OS, everyone’s already used to the system. No one would have to learn to use new tools or software to collaborate with other departments. Hosting everyone on the same platform also provides a single source of information, helping different stakeholders stay on the same page. (Read also: Managing Cloud Sprawl in Your Organization.) 
App building and integration are key components of any Work OS, fixing PM software’s interoperability problem. These integrations reduce the amount of separate apps teams will need and eliminate confusion from working in fractured environments.
While 90% of organization leaders say agility is crucial to future success, only 26% say they have high agility. A Work OS’s automation features eliminate many routine tasks, making workflows more agile. As teams collaborate more seamlessly and reduce workflow bottlenecks, they’ll ensure long-term success.
In Practice: Work OS vs. Project Management Software
To help understand these benefits, imagine a software development company was designing a new mobile app. First, designers will need to design and prototype the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), which often require various tools. In PM software, these solutions may be incompatible, making sharing progress or finished work difficult. A Work OS could integrate with these apps, letting them share their work seamlessly.
After the design phase, this work must change hands for developers to make a working version. A Work OS provides shared calendars and workflows, providing insight into each team and worker’s workload, timeline, and status, which enables more seamless hand-offs. Similarly, automation tools can automatically notify workers of changes or adjust priorities. PM software doesn’t provide this transparency or automation, which could lead to scheduling problems.
During development, workers will likely have to revisit their work frequently to fix bugs. Both PM software and work OSes enable this process to happen smoothly, editing and reassigning tasks as needed. Since Work OS solutions often include built-in communication services, though, they may make it easier to collaborate through this process. Automated alerts for bugs and errors further speed this part of development. (Read also: Diving into Dev: The Software Development Lifecycle.) 
In the last step before launch, the company will need to run some user tests. In a PM solution, this may look like a team receiving the order to test, then running them in other programs. With a Work OS, these testing programs would integrate with the rest of their tools, helping other stakeholders track progress and streamlining workflows.
With this example, it’s clear why companies like Hulu and Uber use work OS solutions for their software development. While PM tools don’t cause any significant disruptions, Work OS enables much smoother, more collaborative workflows. These benefits lead to faster times to market at least and better, more polished end products at best.
It’s Time to Switch to a Work OS
The need for collaboration is becoming increasingly clear today, yet remote work and all-digital workplaces can make collaboration challenging. Work OS platforms like monday.com give teams the transparency, interoperability and flexibility they need to work together in these fractured environments.
Project management software can be helpful, but these solutions are often too limited. You need more than a way to manage and organize individual projects. Work OS is the answer.

People are using machines to automate more and more of the tasks they don't want to do. For example, we all know machines are responsible for sending out thank you emails or helping organize your search engine results. But some of the more complex jobs are being phased out with the introduction of AI (artificial intelligence) as well. Some creative platforms are even working on AI to suggest relevant logo ideas for a faster and cheaper design process..While the world of robots will leave some feeling nervous or skeptical, we see automation often simplifies small tasks and makes more room for addressing complexities. For example, a business owner can use AI to send emails at the right time, freeing themselves up to do other jobs and improving customer-response time. So in the right setting, AI can be a win-win..This blog will check out the rise of robots in the workforce and how they impact the design industry..Will Robots Take My Job?.With AI on the rise, people are rightfully concerned that their jobs may become obsolete. However, many professionals suggest that machines will only enhance our work—freeing us from busywork and allowing us to focus on the tasks that require more creativity and adaptability..One study suggests nearly half of all workers are at risk of their jobs to robots. However, not all jobs are at risk. Most of the jobs facing a machine takeover are ones that don't require a lot of thought, creativity or human intuition..We have seen cashiers replaced by machine kiosks in places like McDonald's and Costco food courts. This has sped up the checkout process, freeing up workers to focus on fulfilling the orders. Other jobs that AI can replace include telemarketing, bookkeepers, proofreaders, advertising salespeople, marketing research analysts and more..A website called &quot;Will Robots Take My Job&quot; suggests the future automation risk factor when you type in your job. While bankers and tellers face a high (92%) risk, graphic designers are only at a 4% risk of being replaced by machines. However, this doesn't mean AI can't do parts of their job in certain capacities—as we will see below with the logos made by AI..The software developers are working hard to match human creativity, but that is no easy task. Certain aspects of a job can be automated—like putting together elements for a great-looking logo. Some attempts have been made to write articles, advertisements and more. In some cases, it can be very hard to tell a machine's work apart from a human's..AI Logo Design Could be a Thing of the Future.So, what about logo design?.Can machines really produce designs that can keep up with logos from graphic designers?.One studio used AI to create logos for their clients, and no one suspected anything for more than a year. Charging $1,500 per design, the studio gave the AI a common Russian name—Nikolay Ironov—and made him look like a remote worker. Clients could choose an express design program that provided a faster turnaround with no options for revisions or further discussions on the final deliverable. The studio wanted to see how clients would respond without the bias of knowing Nikolay was a machine with a design algorithm..The AI Nikolay created 17 projects and worked with real clients for a year. No one knew they weren't working with a real designer until the firm revealed it. The studio explained, &quot;Nikolay is available 24 hours a day. He does not get sick. He does not experience crippling creative blocks. He is always developing and can complete tasks in a matter of seconds. More importantly, his designs are completely unique.&quot;.This experiment produced a lot of buzz, proving that AI does have a role to play in design. Using that concept, certain software developers and design teams have built platforms offering automated logo design. AI offers a quick and inexpensive solution to their logo design problem for many small companies, startups and businesses with a tight budget..12 Logo Designs Created by Machines.Still not sure if you would trust a robot to make your logo? While you may have to watch for generic outcomes, a logo maker can offer thousands of fonts, illustrations and color combinations to help the logo be unique. Here are 12 logos designed with AI tools..Logos created by Tailor Brands.Each of these logos from Tailor Brands offers a unique font and design element to help draw the eye to the element. While Boho Bird may be perfect for a designer or clothing brand, Emma' logo is geared towards a much younger audience. The Balance logo offers a stylized illustration that helps clarify they are a yoga/fitness studio, while Bones.ai ties together the gear with the &quot;ai&quot; by utilizing the pop of radioactive green for a modern tech look..Logos created by Brandmark.Brandmark's platform is producing a variety of designs that would serve as viable logos for a real company. The CIELA MONTESSORI logo shows the concept of growth with the tree illustration and creativity with the pretty turquoise logotype. COCO is creative in its letter replacement, giving a very clear visual of their product. Darnel's is a simple approach to a logo that is perfect for the fuss-free to-go cafe. GOOMOE could easily be an audio or tech company logo with one of the letters simply representing movement with the use of lines..Logos created by Designs.ai.The illustrations by Designs.ai are friendly and diverse. Blossom the Flower Shop logo uses an elegant flower illustration to catch the eye and clarify the shop's intent before the viewer has even finished reading the logo. B.LIVE uses a very stylized honeycomb bee to give the company a modern feel, while Noodle has a fun illustration with a bright color use that suggests the place is family-oriented. Sweet factory is certainly a logo for audiences of all ages and offers a clear picture of their promised products..Creating Your Designs with AI.There is a lot of potential in machine-created logo design. Many of these options save thousands of hours and dollars for brands looking for a simplified process. It may seem surprising that robots can produce fun, quirky, professional and unique logo designs, but the proof is in the pudding..AI is here to stay, and brands should take advantage of it. We can stay ahead of the game by looking for ways to use AI to help improve jobs..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Published: 30 Dec 2021


 
Rather than simple text and images, modern content management encompasses different types of information -- like photos, interactive graphics, videos, audio and other digitized assets -- that systems can assemble dynamically.







Modern content management serves a business purpose and streamlines how organizations create and distribute digital experiences. And, in the future of content management, AI plays a key role. Organizations must control the content that travels through their networks to improve digital work and create business value, which may mean embracing more advanced technologies.

The state of content management
Initially, content management sought to separate technical tasks -- like website launches -- from editorial tasks, like information updates. Web administrators and IT support staff also needed easy ways to hand off routine chores, like webpage maintenance, to nontechnical users, which content management made easier.
Over the years, aspects of content management have evolved, including types of content and required skills, relevant tools and storage.
Types of content and required skills
Content management continues to support two audiences: technical professionals and line-of-business users. Yet, content has evolved from information on static webpages into dynamic experiences across multiple devices, business channels and customer touchpoints.
The content evolution developed new tasks, which require new business roles. And, within IT and line-of-business groups, more professionals with different technical and nontechnical skills perform computational tasks, produce content and embrace innovative business apps.
With those innovative business apps, digital marketers, sales executives and other line-of-business managers expect to combine content from disparate sources for purpose-built apps. For example, marketers can launch digital campaigns with interactive webpages, targeted emails and personalized offers based on buyers' intent.
Tools and storage
Content management no longer limits file storage to self-contained repositories and content to predefined webpages, but encompasses multiple cloud-based repositories.
A modern approach to content management supports the following four key computational capabilities known as MACH:

Microservices. Microservices can locate content stored within repositories and perform other discrete functions.
APIs. Content management uses open web standards to support APIs, which can interconnect disparate repositories to develop new apps.
Cloud environments. Organizations can store content in cloud environments.
Headless services. Content management supports headless back-end services, so the technology doesn't assume how webpages present or display information.






The roles of artificial intelligence and machine learning
AI encompasses many computational capabilities to create and analyze information. Organizations can use AI and machine learning (ML) to recognize patterns in data and metadata in the following ways:

Natural language processing combines computational linguistics and other techniques to extract meaning from text.
Predictive and prescriptive ML algorithms calculate the best actions to respond to queries, tasks or activities.
Image recognition analyzes patterns in images or videos to distinguish objects, matches patterns against available information and analyzes metadata to identify what the images or videos contain.
Audio and speech recognition algorithms analyze wave patterns in audio streams to determine words, tone-of-voice, music and other acoustic characteristics.

While AI algorithms require employees with the expertise to implement and maintain them, this technology doesn't exist in a vacuum. Instead, organizations tie AI to predefined tasks and activities to save workers time and effort.
Independent software vendors, ranging from industry stalwarts to startups, embed AI capabilities in their tools. They condense specific algorithms into microservices, making these services accessible through APIs, and rely on cloud connections to control content flows.
To develop content-powered apps, organizations must focus on app integration. AI aims to create next-generation business apps with microservices and APIs connected through cloud environments to back-end content repositories -- a MACH-based architecture. This architecture could simplify how AI integrates into content flows from disparate sources, like apps, and weaves together metadata.





Predictions for AI and the future of content
AI can make apps more useful, but organizations won't produce content-powered apps overnight. Organizations should consider four trends to assess how AI will affect operations to prepare for the future.
Content enrichment
Content management depends on explicit and implicit metadata. As organizations develop business apps, they define metadata categories through information architectures.
AI algorithms can automate metadata management to read through documents, scan images, extract meaning from text, recognize objects within digital assets and assign relevant categories to content. AI can enable app developers to access more relevant content to build smarter apps.
Micro-experiences
AI can create micro-experiences to automate tasks, actions and activities.
With a shoppable content micro-experience, customers could buy items directly in an app without a storefront or website. For example, a person might see a sweater in a photo, tap it and then buy it -- all without visiting the brand's website.
Similarly, writers may rely on writing support tools to check spelling and grammar, get advice on tone-of-voice, verify brand terminology, check style guidelines and recommend revisions. AI could expedite editorial tasks that proofreaders and editors typically perform and reduce production costs.
Smart processes
With MACH, content management could combine content from more disparate sources, and AI could make that content actionable.



Even with innovative AI-powered tools, human insight matters.




Thus, compliance teams may rely on AI to monitor and decrypt large document collections stored within content repositories. Marketing teams can automatically verify digital image rights before they approve them for distribution, add them to websites and include them in advertising campaigns.
However, organizations may struggle to design smart processes that separate business problems into tasks, combine content from disparate sources and determine how AI algorithms can enhance work. Additionally, organizations must focus on people and how they handle processes.
New roles
Even with innovative AI-powered tools, human insight matters. Organizations will require new roles for employees, contractors and business partners beyond the technical and line-of-business silos.
Instead, these roles should add specialized skills that combine computational and business expertise to work with innovative content management technologies. Improving work could lead to next-generation content-powered apps, staffed and managed with human intelligence.


Key takeaways
As content has evolved, so have the skills and tools required to manage it. In the future, AI and ML will help enrich content, develop micro-experiences, enable smart processes and create new roles for employees. But this isn't a change that will happen overnight. Instead, organizations must prepare for a steady and inevitable progression.

(Left: Austrian National Library/Google Arts and Culture; right: Belvedere/Google Arts and Culture)By  Kelsey AblesDecember 29, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. ESTGustav Klimt’s 1900 painting “Philosophy” might have been remembered as a pivotal artwork. Made at a turning point in the artist’s career, it was vividly colored, dramatically composed — even provocative in its blatant nudity and unflinching emotion. But in 1945, the work was destroyed in a fire and essentially lost to history.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeFor decades, only black-and-white photographs of “Philosophy” existed. Now, thanks to artificial intelligence, we can see the work in full color. But does the re-creation really look like the original? Does it even look like a Klimt?The new version, created by Google Arts and Culture using machine learning, shows a very different Klimt than you’d expect if you’re familiar with “The Kiss” or “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.” On the left side of the canvas, interwoven, nude bodies create a fleshy, blue-hued form that looks almost bruised. On the right, an expressionless, algae-colored sphinx dominates a lurid green sky. A glance at the colors in the reconstructed work, and you might mistake Klimt for his Fauvist contemporaries or think he was hanging around with the painter Marc Chagall.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Philosophy” is one of three massive “faculty paintings” that the Austrian painter (1862-1918) created for the University of Vienna’s assembly hall ceiling and that were lost in a fire at the end of World War II. Earlier this year, Franz Smola, a curator at Vienna’s Belvedere Museum, which has the largest Klimt collection in the world, guided the paintings’ “recoloring” for the Google Arts and Culture “Klimt vs. Klimt” exhibition online.🖼️Follow ArtFollow“I don’t know any better than Google what those paintings really look like, but I don’t think that they looked like that,” says Jane Kallir, longtime director of the Galerie St. Etienne in New York, which gave Klimt his first shows in the United States. “These things look like cartoons. They don’t look like Klimt paintings.“It’s like people who try to clone their dogs. You can do it, but it’s not the same dog.”The faculty paintings are one of several recent attempts to use artificial intelligence to re-create lost art. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam used AI to reconstruct missing panels from the edges of Rembrandt’s famous “Night Watch” and, over the summer, temporarily installed them alongside the real thing. A pair of researchers in the United Kingdom, who call themselves Oxia Palus, say they’ve rebuilt a Picasso nude that was hidden beneath “The Blind Man’s Meal,” using 3-D printing and AI. In October, an orchestra in Bonn, Germany, “played” Beethoven’s 10th and unfinished symphony in full. The version was written by an algorithm.Crypto artists have been building a rebellious, underground community of outsiders for years. Now they’re making a living selling NFTs.George Cann, co-founder of Oxia Palus, posits that artificial intelligence “could give us this parallel alternative universe of art that we never really quite had.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt’s an alluring idea. Peek beneath a Picasso at an earlier painting under the surface layer and it’s like you’re peering into the artist’s mind, eavesdropping on thoughts from a century ago. See a painting that was lost to catastrophe come back to life and it’s like you’ve traveled back in time, reversed fate. But if any of this re-created universe of lost art, like “Philosophy,” is inaccurate, the AI creators might not be resurrecting history but inadvertently rewriting it.Klimt’s faculty paintings make a particularly compelling case for the kind of rediscovery promised by AI.In 1894, Austria’s Ministry of Education commissioned Klimt to paint allegories representing the disciplines of Medicine, Philosophy and Jurisprudence, expecting he’d use the same traditional mural style that he was known for around Vienna. That’s not what they received. Klimt painted chaotic, dark images of suffering. A sick-looking, motley crew appears in “Medicine,” and “Jurisprudence,” which shows a gaunt man beneath three glamorous, gold-clad judges, seems to depict not the law’s strengths but its elitism.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe works were lambasted by academics who suspected Klimt was mocking their disciplines and by conservative politicians who believed the depictions of female sexuality and nudity would incite immoral behavior. Klimt bought back the paintings from the state and never again did a public commission.It was a watershed moment in the artist’s career. With the faculty paintings, Smola says, Klimt “started for the first time to do his own thing, to go his own way,” adding that, had they survived, they would be displayed in museums as landmarks of European Symbolist art.That was part of the impetus to recolor the works with AI. Emil Wallner, a researcher at Google, built the algorithm. He used 100,000 art historical references and programmed it to have a bias toward Klimt’s style. For his part, Smola combed through articles and texts where writers responded to the faculty paintings, seeking an objective sense of color in the subjective writing of criticism.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThroughout the process, Smola had to make bold choices, such as instructing the AI to color “Jurisprudence’s” background red, a decision made after discovering that one of Klimt’s biggest critics noted that “Jurisprudence” featured the colors of the German flag.Wallner says that in the recolored paintings, he saw a new, “rebellious” side of Klimt. “When you see his most famous works like “The Kiss” and the gold [period] artworks, it can be easy to forget his spirit and who he was as a person,” he says.But for Kallir, there is little of Klimt in what she calls the “gaudy” re-creations, adding that the paintings would have been more subdued, with smoother transitions from one color to the next.Story continues below advertisement“If you’ve got a decent eye, and you look at the black-and-white reproductions and compare them to other paintings that were done around the same time, you can probably get a better idea of what they really look like,” she says.Each application of AI to art has different levels of rigor. To reconstruct Rembrandt’s “Night Watch,” Rob Erdmann, senior scientist at the Rijksmuseum, collected 55 terabytes of data, collaborated with the museum’s art historians, and used a copy of the original painting as a reference. All to give visitors, he says, “the sense — if they squinted — of what the [‘Night Watch’] might have looked like if it had not been cut down.”But terms like “digital restoration” can confer a misleading legitimacy. To make a 3-D re-creation of the Picasso underpainting, Oxia Palus used an X-ray available online and guided its algorithm with paintings from the artist’s broad “Blue Period.” They didn’t talk to art historians about the original work, but told CNN that “the treasure [Picasso has] hidden for future generations is finally being revealed.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementKenneth Brummel, who co-curated the new exhibition “Picasso: Painting the Blue Period” at the Art Gallery of Ontario, has reservations about Oxia Palus’s approach, noting that to re-create a canvas’s surface, they would need information accessible only to the museum that owns the work.“My concern about the methods used here is [not just] that there is incomplete data,” Brummel says, “but also that the algorithms that are used are based on a group of individuals’ arbitrary and highly subjective selection of works of art that they deem to be related.”Brummel’s exhibition explores technical methods used to learn more about Picasso’s underpainting, including advanced microscopy and spectroscopic imaging. He says he prefers to present the raw scientific data because it allows visitors to draw their own conclusions.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Part of the beauty of providing a narrative that is incomplete is that you’re inviting others to participate,” he says.From one perspective, mechanically reproducing lost art does the opposite: It offers a clean answer where there are none, and relies on the predictable when the beauty is, often, in the unexpected.“Whether it’s an artist or a composer or whatever, there is such a thing as genius,” Kallir says. “The reason that we are awestruck by a Beethoven symphony or a Klimt painting is because they had something that’s inimitable.”

From a technology that was looked at with mistrust as promises pushed it as a replacement for medical professionals, AI has grown into the second set of eyes that never need to sleep.Artificial intelligence, AI in medical diagnosis, and healthcare gives dependable support to overworked medical practitioners and institutions, reducing workload pressure and increasing practitioner efficiency.Artificial Intelligence’s Significance in Reducing Physician WorkloadPhysician burnout is a serious issue. Many medical professionals’ performance is being harmed by weariness and overwork. Physicians are quitting their professions, straining to provide high-quality patient care while dealing with complicated emotional issues.Long hours, heavy workloads, and a lack of support are all contributing factors. Physicians make difficult and life-changing choices daily, yet they frequently lack the space or time to efficiently manage their duties. The data in the latest Medscape National Physician Burnout and Suicide Report 2020 highlighted the dangers of putting too much pressure on doctors, particularly those juggling families, retirement plans, and the intricacies of their employment.This is where artificial intelligence (AI) can help. AI-based medical diagnosis, when designed with purpose, may not only relieve strain on clinicians when working with massive amounts of data and imaging, but it can also take on a substantial portion of the administrative burden.Medical practitioners may benefit from the correct technologies, which have been built expressly for the healthcare industry, to help them handle rising amounts of data, information, and imagery.With solutions designed to reduce stress and enhance time spent with patients, AI may give meaningful help to busy physicians.Applications and Use of AI in Medical Diagnosis1. Diseases Are IdentifiedTo effectively identify ailments, years of medical training are necessary. Diagnostics, on the other hand, can be a difficult and time-consuming process. In many fields, the demand for knowledge far outnumbers the available supply. This puts doctors under a great deal of stress, and it frequently leads to delays in life-saving patient diagnoses.Machine Learning algorithms, particularly Deep Learning algorithms, have recently made great progress in autonomously recognizing ailments, decreasing the cost of diagnostics, and making them more accessible.2. Drug DiscoveryAI has previously proven to be effective in all four stages of drug development:Stage 1: Identifying intervention targetsStage 2: Identifying pharmacological possibilitiesStage 3: Increasing the speed of clinical studiesStage 4: Identifying biomarkers for illness diagnosisDrug development is a famously costly procedure. Machine Learning can improve the efficiency of many of the analytical techniques used in drug development. This might save years of labor and hundreds of millions of dollars in investments.3. Neurotechnology and Bioelectronic MedicineThe domains of bioelectronic medicine and neurotechnology are two of the most interesting uses of AI in medical diagnosis. These domains make use of the massive quantities of data generated by the human brain and nervous system, which is exactly the type of challenge AI excels at addressing.We can train algorithms to make sense of neurological data using machine learning. Electrical impulses are used by our bodies to communicate between different sections of the brain as well as between the brain and the spinal cord or peripheral nervous system. To filter out the noise and attach meaning to the signals we detect, we need a lot of processing capacity to interpret them.Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested and years of labor have been put in.Challenges With Medical Datasets“Medical datasets” have one major obstacle: data scarcity. Even more so, there is a lack of data from the medical category, which is what we are most interested in forecasting using the models we create.Due to a lack of data, two major issues arise: class imbalance and the need to curate the test set. Other industries, such as manufacturing, may face similar issues. In manufacturing, for example, class imbalance occurs when the number of faulty components is considerably fewer than the number of non-defective components.EndNoteArtificial intelligence is already helping us to diagnose diseases more effectively , create pharmaceuticals, personalize therapy, and even modify DNA.But this is only the beginning. The more we digitize and integrate our medical data, the more AI can help us spot important patterns: patterns that can be utilized to make right, cost-effective decisions in complex analytical operations.

Artificial Intelligence is the science and practice of designing software and intelligent systems that exhibit artificial intelligent behavior. The main field of AI is machine learning – the ability for a machine to learn from experience – the machine can analyze data to generate an outcome.
The classic example is a baby. If we feed it images and sounds and say that it is learning then it would learn from those experiences and display the outcome, when it should, when it feels like it should. It is a very powerful concept and one that we will continue to hear a lot more about.
AI is the stuff of sci-fi films, where we see robots, called bots, and we see humanoid robots called DIMA, and we see AI machines, like Siri, and Alexa, and Cortana.
In the industry of Artificial Intelligence or AI, AI is defined as a branch of computer science that builds software, hardware, or hardware components that perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. AI is similar to software that can do things that a human being can do.
If you can’t make decisions as quickly as you want in a limited timeframe and don’t have all the relevant data you need to make those decisions, then you’d better start finding ways to automate that process. That’s why “AI” is such a buzzword right now.
Top Five Things You Need to Know About Artificial Intelligence


 It’s here to stay


Although AI has been around for decades, it hasn’t been widely applied. However, there is a strong push in recent years by companies such as Google and Microsoft to make the technology more commonplace by making it affordable for all businesses.
Just as smartphones came with the capacity to make calls, they also came with the ability to make and receive calls. And, just as today’s smartphones have powerful applications that make them indispensable, today’s business tools will have the ability to serve as powerful tools for a variety of uses — from inventory management to customer service and more.


 AI will speed your processes


If your processes are already organized and streamlined, chances are there’s not much that AI can do to improve them. However, if your processes aren’t organized at all, then AI can help a great deal.
As you know, data is king. However, collecting data is labor-intensive. And, the more data you have, the longer it takes to analyze it and come up with answers.
That’s where AI comes in. That’s because machines can think and make decisions much faster and more efficiently than humans.
For example, consider customer service. When you have a customer service representative who has worked with hundreds of customers, their skills become very valuable. However, it can be hard to give them the attention they need to do their job effectively.
When you have AI monitoring your customer service representative’s performance, AI can provide real-time feedback so they can better serve your customers.


 AI can improve your quality


We live in a very competitive world today. Customers are more discerning than ever and are not impressed with business just because it’s in their backyard. But, to stand out, businesses need to provide better quality and service.
In the same vein, businesses are going to need to provide better quality and service if they’re going to have better results from their marketing campaigns.
However, many businesses don’t have the expertise to do this type of work well. And, they can’t afford to hire more salespeople or marketing specialists to deliver more quality and service than they’re currently providing.
AI is now making it possible to turn most business problems into data problems, where AI’s ability to think and solve problems can be put to good use.


 AI can make your workforce more productive


As the productivity of the workforce declines, businesses are looking for ways to make the workforce more productive and decrease costs.
In fact, according to the research-by-research group, McKinsey, roughly half of workers in many companies are either over-or under-utilized. As these workers perform the same job but have different levels of productivity, there’s wasted revenue.
But AI is helping to remove the limitations of the workforce, allowing workers to do more with less.
Consider Amazon, which has an estimated 40,000 robots working in its warehouses, taking the jobs of the millions of employees in the company.
Robots can perform their tasks with much more efficiency, allowing them to produce the same results with a fraction of the workforce.


 AI is learning and developing its own capabilities


AI is a very unpredictable and ever-changing field. Since it’s new and isn’t well understood by most business leaders, you can’t be sure what tomorrow’s AI might be capable of.
However, what is for certain is that AI’s ability to learn will continue to expand.
Research company, Tractica, estimates that AI applications will generate roughly $3.9 trillion of revenue globally by 2025. This is a $2.3 trillion increase from 2017’s estimate. And, it’s a 57% increase from 2016.
That’s a pretty remarkable growth curve. It’s so astounding that one of the world’s leading venture capital firms, CapitalG, invested over $400 million in AI companies.
Its Effect on Humanity
Now we are going to discuss how artificial intelligence is good or bad for humanity-
Bad Effects

There will be huge social changes that will disrupt our way of life in the human community. Humans have to work hard to earn a living, but with artificial intelligence, we can simply program machines to do something for us without having to pick up tools. Human intimacy will gradually diminish as AI replaces the need for people to meet and exchange ideas in person. AI will stand amongst people as it will no longer require face-to-face meetings to communicate.
Unemployment is next as many jobs will be replaced by machines. Many automobile assembly lines today are full of machines and robots, leaving traditional workers out of work. Even supermarkets don’t need shopkeepers anymore because digital devices can outperform human labor.
Wealth inequality occurs when investors receive most of their income. The gap between the rich and the poor will widen. The so-called ‘M’-shaped distribution of wealth will become clearer.
New problems arise not only in a social sense but also in AI itself, as an AI that has been trained and learned how to perform a given task can eventually move to a stage beyond human control. It leads to unexpected problems and consequences. This refers to the ability of the AI to automatically function on its own, ignoring commands provided by a human controller, after loading all necessary algorithms.
AI can invent things that are racially biased or self-centered to harm certain people. or stuff. For example, the United Nations have decided to limit the spread of nuclear power for fear of using it indiscriminately to destroy humanity or attacking certain races or regions to achieve the goal of domination. AI could cause global catastrophe by targeting specific races or some objects programmed to execute programmers’ orders of destruction.

Good Effects

However, it has many positive effects on humans, especially in the field of health care. AI gives computers the ability to learn, reason, and apply logic. Scientists, medical researchers, clinicians, mathematicians, and engineers can work together to develop AI that targets medical diagnosis and treatment to provide a reliable and secure healthcare delivery system.
As health professors and medical researchers strive to find new and effective ways to treat disease, digital computers will not only support analytics but also create robotic systems to precisely perform some delicate medical procedures.


Fast and Accurate Diagnosis 


An IBM Watson computer was used for diagnosis with surprising results. AI diagnostics are provided when data is immediately downloaded to your computer. AI can also suggest different treatments to doctors.
The procedure is as follows. By downloading the digital results of the physical examination to your computer, it considers all possibilities, automatically diagnoses whether the patient has a disability or disease, and suggests different types of available treatments.


Reduce Human Fatigue Error 


Human error in the workforce is inevitable and often costly. The higher the fatigue, the higher the risk of errors. However, Al technology does not suffer from fatigue or emotional distractions. This eliminates errors and allows you to complete tasks faster and more accurately.


Artificial Intelligence Surgery 


Artificial intelligence-based surgical procedures were a choice for people. This AI will still have to be managed by medical professionals, but it can get the job done with minimal damage to the body. The da Vinci Surgical System, a robotic technology that enables surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures, is now available in most hospitals.
These systems provide a higher level of precision and accuracy than manual procedures. Less invasive surgery, less trauma, and less bleeding, less anxiety for the patient.


Virtual Existence 


Virtual presence technology enables remote diagnosis of disease. The patient does not have to get out of bed, but with the help of a remote presence robot, the doctor can see the patient without actually being there. Healthcare workers can move and interact efficiently as if they were there. This allows professionals to help patients who cannot travel.

The history of human civilisation has hinged around decisions and their consequences. Although history in posterity and retrospect judges the quality of decision making, traditionally it has been well known that culture, education, upbringing, risk-taking nature, age, experience, lifestyle, occupation, character, emotional state, and circumstances have influenced decision making. It has also been discussed and debated that decision-making competences take into account human intelligence, emotional makeup, motivation, experience, risk profile, and other factors. Whether the decisions were favourable or not, there was always the feeling that more and more information, data, and planning could have provided better insights to overall improve the decision-making process.With the world of Information Technology, computers, and telecoms permeating lives and businesses more and more, the humongous amount of data, insights, and advancement in analytics, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning brought about a revolutionary change in Decision Making: the era of Decision Intelligence. Way back in 2014, as mentioned in a McKinsey research, pondered about how the C-Level Executives would work along with Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms through the decision making process: leaving objectivity to the machines and subjective and soft aspects to humans. This also called for a sea change in the working and mindset of management teams especially in terms of empowerment and de-centralisation of decision-making processes due to the democratisation of the AI, data, and insights throughout the business functions, units of the enterprise. This also necessitates up-skilling and reskilling in functional, IT, and soft skills areas.In one of the LinkedIn articles just prior to the advent COVID-19 pandemic, the term Decision Intelligence was defined as a new discipline that gives a holistic view of evaluating and selecting options. This helps people and enterprises improve their lives and business outcomes, respectively by leveraging data sciences along with managerial and social skills, managerial science into a unified field that helps people use data to improve their lives, their businesses, and the world around them. It is the culmination and sort of the objective and conclusion of the AI journey and encompasses all skills and tips to lead the automation and AI and ML projects in a holistic, responsible and realistic manner with contingency management.In the post-COVID era, why is there a buzz about the Decision Intelligence market?First and foremost is the size of the market. Report Linker here estimates that the global Decision Intelligence market size will reach slightly under USD 10 billion by the end of 2021 and with a CAGR of just under 10%, reach well over USD 15 Billion by 2026.Gartner has also included engineered Decision intelligence amongst their top 10 analytics and data trends for 2021. With organisations increasingly adopting common data layers and fabrics, engineered decision intelligence can be aggregated, leveraged into reusable and auditable components. Decision intelligence has also been very recently included in Gartner&rsquo;s e-book on the top 12 strategic trends that will determine the scale and future of digital transformation in 20222 and beyond.Thirdly, Decision Intelligence Systems are an increasingly widely used scenario of Super Teams: in which Artificial Intelligence works along with Humans and Robotics to create outcomes of scale, diversity and acceleration which were not possible earlier. In fact, Deloitte in one of its reports clearly mentions that Super Teams are a key driver of the latest Human Capital trends.What are the components of Decision Intelligence?As mentioned before, Decision Intelligence merges Social Science covering user requirements and desired experiences along with Data Science as well as Managerial Science to implement the insights in an actionable and accountable manner.The fundamental components hence include Artificial Intelligence ready cleaned and sanitised dataset, centralised intelligence, and learning models, actionable user interface for implementation, monitoring, review, and fine-tuning as the basic building blocks. In addition to this, in the ethos of designing the decision itself, the Project Design and Management concepts including Requirements Analysis, Specifications definition, Quality Assurance, Scenario Modelling, Security as well as business dashboards, What-if Analyses and Assumption based planning help improve efficiency, effectiveness and implementation aspects of the decision intelligence exercise.Skills such as sensitivity analysis, causal loop diagrams, statistical regression analysis, data flow diagrams, operational research, and artificial neural networks are leveraged by the decision intelligence framework.Are there any practical examples of leveraging Decision Intelligence in Asia?Tookitaki, an intelligent decision-support system for compliance programs in the financial services sector, operates across the six larger Southeast Asian countries. Banking and Telecom Companies in Asia and Worldwide use recommendation engines which is another example of decision intelligence. Netflix leverages decision intelligence to enable their consumers to scroll through the thousands of titles, basis their likes, demographics and history. A transport company was able to successfully use decision intelligence and save millions of unnecessary miles, reduce driver fatigue and satisfaction and improve retention.What does the future hold, especially for Asia?Decision Intelligence which combines Statistics, Economics, Game Theory, Design Analytics, Psychology, Artificial Intelligence, User Experience, Machine Learning, and Data Science has immense potential, especially in the Asia Pacific. With a discernible gap in Data Scientists and Engineers, as well as the potential of vast automation and AI/ ML projects in the region, enterprises and teams across Asia can very well leverage Engineered Decision Making for substantial and consistent positive decision making. This coupled with the CHRO-CIO collaboration with relation to Super Teams and Digital Transformation in the APAC region, make Asia the best place to be.In the Post COVID recovery path, Decision Intelligence is indeed a critical lever for the organisational journey in this ever-so-complex world of intersecting realities and uncertainties.

             It wasn't long ago that artificial intelligence (AI) started as a revolution, and the world paced up with it rapidly. Consequently, we see an evergrowing AI-focused market of possibilities, even in Bangladesh. The industry has much to offer, from a first-rate salary to diverse, hands-on research works. The story of Intelligent Machines Limited: Working with AI is engaging. Intelligent Machines Limited is one company that started with the dream of empowering Bangladesh's talented youth to solve local business problems with tech solutions. It works extensively in AI and advanced analytics to give businesses technological headway. Potential to reach unprecedented heights: ""The medicine that costs Tk 15, would you like to help make it one-tenth of its current price without compromising anything, but by making it more efficient to produce and distribute? Not for its applications in Bangladesh, you can make fundamental contributions to the core body of knowledge. Have you ever wished you could have lived in the early time of scientific discoveries? Well, you are living in one now!"" stated Oli Ahad, the founder and CEO of the company. AI needs to be normalised in the industry to allow its growth, so thinks Mr Ahad.""We are in its early start-and everyone in the ecosystem is building the blocks as they are trying to make progress. First came mechanisation, then electricity and the internet. The inventors, early adopters, regulators, and everyone in the ecosystem needed to work their ways ahead. What could help this acceleration? The understanding level grew. We should stop giving AI the special treatment that we do now, to allow the growth,"" he added. ""Engaging with local resources is also of tantamount importance. From engineering to data annotation and beyond, the more widely we empower local talent, the faster we can build a thriving AI ecosystem,"" said Tamjeed Sayeed Kashem, finance lead of the company. The recruitment process at Intelligent Machines: The brand arranges position-based coding assessments, followed by a cultural get-to-know to see if the employee is the fit for them or not, and vice versa. The recruiters hire engineers through Workera.ai and Codility to compare the performance-level of local interviewees with global interview performances taking place at brands like Google. The brand encourages employees to have business knowledge, not only technical skills. Python and MySQL are on-demand languages. One needs to be good at scripting languages like Python and know database services like MySQL. Questions for an AI Engineer's post would include deep-learning frameworks. To work with backend tech, one needs to answer data structures and algorithms-related questions. For eligibility as an analytics engineer, one needs to answer the data visualisation questions and have a good grip on Python.The journey of eGeneration: eGeneration is a Bangladeshi brand providing technological services to its clients. In addition, the company specialises in AI and machine learning. The brand has created AI-based IT solutions on national levels. Research opportunities with AI: Sabbir Arif Siddique, technical architect at eGeneration, shared his insights on the bright sides of pursuing a career in AI. Mr Siddque, a Summa Cum Laude graduate from United International University, Bangladesh, is an Erasmus Mundus, EU - Full Funded Scholar to Computational Intelligence Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom. ""Research and development in artificial intelligence is now a reality in Bangladesh. A noticeable number of CSE students with experience in AI and ML (machine learning) research are finding their way into the industry. Collaboration between local brands and academia can take AI-based development to a much greater height. In addition, showcasing our local AI products to the international market will create more business opportunities. Support from the government and BASIS in this regard is significant.""AI offers cutting-edge technology. It's one of the main components of the 4th Industrial Revolution. B2B (Business-to-business) relationships, entertainment industry, educational sectors rely on AI. Every industry requires data-driven decisions. With AI, data analysis becomes a way to analyse customers' tastes. As a captive career opportunity: Why would AI be a captivating career option? AI stays as magic as its application surpasses the human brain in abilities and precision. An AI system doesn't forget while the human brain does. Pattern recognition, a way to identify anything/anyone through the analysis of their records, is one way of applying AI to numerous daily-life applications. AI also ensures job stability since there is always a demand for exploration, the trends and consumers' interests change, statistical models shift accordingly. ""AI allows you to create products that are rare yet on-demand, for example, aBangla Chatbot,"" said Mr Siddique.""I have led an AI project named 'h‡š¿i Af¨_©bv-Smart Receptionist' for ICT Division. The system can replace manual reception services in universities, hospitals, and banks. The system integrated Bangla speech synthesis, speech recognition, and automatic question answering. The system can talk in Bangla with any guest. It will identify a visitor using facial recognition and access the previous conversation in the cloud to better serve the visitor much quicker than a human receptionist,"" he added. The recruitment at eGeneration: AI projects, research projects related to Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, or other AI fields are encouraged from the applicants. Applicants need to face one written test and show their programming knowledge. A decent academic result is an added advantage. AI boosts the idea that technology is like magic. The Bangladeshi AI industry needs enthusiasts, skilled and optimistic minds to grow. Global recognition of the Bangladeshi AI industry would facilitate its development.
