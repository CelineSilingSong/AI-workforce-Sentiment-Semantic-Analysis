MIT SMR editor in chief Paul Michelman recently spoke with authors Paul Daugherty and H. James Wilson to discuss the research that went into their (and coauthor Nicola Morini Bianzino’s) 2017 article “The Jobs That Artificial Intelligence Will Create” and to find out what new developments in this space have their attention. 
Listen to the full conversation here:

Key takeaways from the discussion include:
Soft skills will be crucial for collaborating with smart machines.
A major focus of the Daugherty and Wilson article is what kinds of skills will enable job transformation in the age of AI. Surprisingly, they’ve found that STEM skills, while important, are certainly not a prerequisite for transformation. In fact, their research shows that four soft skills are becoming much more valuable as human-machine collaboration advances. These skills include complex reasoning, creativity, social and emotional intelligence, and sensory perception.

Training for AI will require shifts in learning.
Humans have never trained for many of the new jobs that AI will create — so the question becomes, how do companies develop their workforce? Daugherty and Wilson cite the importance of experiential learning through hands-on apprenticeships and using technology to advance skills in new categories of jobs. In addition, the burden for skilling and reskilling must shift from the individual employee to the collective institution or organization. If learning is going to become a core competency for global businesses, then organizations will need to step up to help build learning platforms for employees. 
Responsible AI marks a new frontier.
Daugherty and Wilson point out that responsible AI, which was hinted at in their original research and spelled out in more detail in their recent article “Using Artificial Intelligence to Promote Diversity,” has become a much more important question. Thinking about bias, transparency, and accountability will be crucial in the future development of AI systems. As the authors describe, “These are going to be really important issues for businesses and organizations to grasp and to make sure that as we have increasing numbers of people working in AI and more powerful solutions delivered with the AI, how do we make sure we deliver the right outcomes in all cases?”

Hi Paul / James, I am curious to learn more about ""trainer"", ""explainer"" & ""sustainer"" from the context of AI/ML. I have read that ML/AI algorithms becomes a black box once it starts learning and improving based on raw data fed to the algorithm. After sometime, even developers and model engineers would not be able to fully comprehend why algorithm produced a decision? In that case, how ""explainer"" would possibly able to perform his/her job? I appreciate your insights here ...

                        Artificial intelligence gets a bad rap as a job killer and human-worker replacer. In some areas this is true, but in others, particularly surrounding how data are cleaned and processed, AI is spearheading new jobs.
Data labeling and annotation is a burgeoning industry born from AI. Unstructured datasets from sources like cameras and social media data or structured sources, like databases, are labeled, marked, colored, or highlighted to show differences, similarities by people. To train a machine to learn what a stop sign is, a person must go into camera footage of a street and mark up all the stop signs in the photo. The machine is then fed data identifying thousands of these images. Overtime the system can more accurately identify what a stop sign is by processing the labeled data. This type of machine learning, where a system gets more accurate by being fed more data, is termed deep learning. 

As this process is essential for algorithms to accurately perform core parts of its function, the data labeling industry is set to take off over the next five years. In 2018, the market for AI and machine learning data preparation, a process that relies heavily on people to manually label data, stood at $500 million. According to Cognilytica, that is expected to more than double, reaching $1.2 billion by 2023. Third-party providers an expect to see a significant uptick in that growth, going from $150 million of the market to $1 billion over that same time frame. Data labeling is particularly essential for AI that deals with object and image recognition, autonomous vehicles, and text and image annotation.

Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun — sometimes called the ‘godfathers of AI’ — have been recognized with the $1 million annual prize for their work developing the AI subfield of deep learning. The techniques the trio developed in the 1990s and 2000s enabled huge breakthroughs in tasks like computer vision and speech recognition. Their work underpins the current proliferation of AI technologies, from self-driving cars to automated medical diagnoses. deep learning powers many contemporary applications of AIIn fact, you probably interacted with the descendants of Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun’s algorithms today — whether that was the facial recognition system that unlocked your phone, or the AI language model that suggested what to write in your last email. All three have since taken up prominent places in the AI research ecosystem, straddling academia and industry. Hinton splits his time between Google and the University of Toronto; Bengio is a professor at the University of Montreal and started an AI company called Element AI; while LeCun is Facebook’s chief AI scientist and a professor at NYU. “It’s a great honor,” LeCun told The Verge. “As good as it gets in computer science. It’s an even better feeling that it’s shared with my friends Yoshua and Geoff.”Jeff Dean, Google’s head of AI, praised the trio’s achievements. “Deep neural networks are responsible for some of the greatest advances in modern computer science,” said Dean in a statement. “At the heart of this progress are fundamental techniques developed by this year’s Turing Award winners, Yoshua Bengio, Geoff Hinton, and Yann LeCun.” The techniques of deep learning that Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun developed underpin many technologies, like self-driving cars.  Photo: AevaThe trio’s achievements are particularly notable as they kept the faith in artificial intelligence at a time when the technology’s prospects were dismal. AI is well-known for its cycles of boom and bust, and the issue of hype is as old as the field itself. When research fails to meet inflated expectations it creates a freeze in funding and interest known as an “AI winter.” It was at the tail end of one such winter in the late 1980s that Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun began exchanging ideas and working on related problems. These included neural networks — computer programs made from connected digital neurons that have become a key building block for modern AI. “There was a dark period between the mid-90s and early-to-mid-2000s when it was impossible to publish research on neural nets, because the community had lost interest in it,” says LeCun. “In fact, it had a bad rep. It was a bit taboo.”“It had a bad rep. It was a bit taboo.”The trio decided they needed to rekindle interest, and secured funding from the Canadian government to sponsor a loose hub of interrelated research. “We organized regular meetings, regular workshops, and summer schools for our students,” says LeCun. “That created a small community that [...] around 2012, 2013 really exploded.” During this period, the three showed that neural nets could achieve strong results on tasks like character recognition. But the rest of the research world did not pay attention until 2012, when a team led by Hinton took on a well-known AI benchmark called ImageNet. Researchers had so far only delivered incremental improvements on this object recognition challenge, but Hinton and his students smashed the next-best algorithm by more than 40 percent with the help of neural networks.“The difference there was so great that a lot of people, you could see a big switch in their head going ‘clunk,’” says LeCun. “Now they were convinced.” The deep learning framework that the trio created was later fueled by abundant processing power and data.  Photo: Vjeran PavicCheap processing power from GPUs (originally designed for gaming) and an abundance of digital data (given off by the internet the same way a car gives off fumes), offered fuel for these little cognitive engines. And since 2012, the basic techniques that Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun pioneered, including backpropagation and convolutional neural networks, have become ubiquitous in AI, and, by extension, in technology as a whole.  LeCun says he is optimistic about the prospects of artificial intelligence, but he’s also clear that much more work needs to be done before the field lives up to its promise. Current AI systems need lots of data to understand the world, can be easily tricked, and are only good at specific tasks. “We just don’t have machines with common sense,” says LeCun. If the field is to continue on its upward trajectory, new methods will need to be discovered that are as foundational as those developed by the godfathers of AI. “Whether we’ll able to use new methods to create human-level intelligence, well, there’s probably another 50 mountains to climb, including ones we can’t even see yet” says LeCun. “We’ve only climbed the first mountain. Maybe the second.” Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: ring any bells?

Cheap processing power from GPUs (originally designed for gaming) and an abundance of digital data (given off by the internet the same way a car gives off fumes), offered fuel for these little cognitive engines. And since 2012, the basic techniques that Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun pioneered, including backpropagation and convolutional neural networks, have become ubiquitous in AI, and, by extension, in technology as a whole.  

LeCun says he is optimistic about the prospects of artificial intelligence, but he’s also clear that much more work needs to be done before the field lives up to its promise. Current AI systems need lots of data to understand the world, can be easily tricked, and are only good at specific tasks. “We just don’t have machines with common sense,” says LeCun. 

If the field is to continue on its upward trajectory, new methods will need to be discovered that are as foundational as those developed by the godfathers of AI. 

“Whether we’ll able to use new methods to create human-level intelligence, well, there’s probably another 50 mountains to climb, including ones we can’t even see yet” says LeCun. “We’ve only climbed the first mountain. Maybe the second.”

Computers have become so smart during the past 20 years that people don't think twice about chatting with digital assistants like Alexa and Siri or seeing their friends automatically tagged in Facebook pictures.





But making those quantum leaps from science fiction to reality required hard work from computer scientists like Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. The trio tapped into their own brainpower to make it possible for machines to learn like humans, a breakthrough now commonly known as ""artificial intelligence,"" or AI.
Their insights and persistence were rewarded Wednesday with the Turing Award, an honor that has become known as technology industry's version of the Nobel Prize. It comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, a company where AI has become part of its DNA.
The award marks the latest recognition of the instrumental role that artificial intelligence will likely play in redefining the relationship between humanity and technology in the decades ahead.
""Artificial intelligence is now one of the fastest-growing areas in all of science and one of the most talked-about topics in society,"" said Cherri Pancake, president of the Association for Computing Machinery, the group behind the Turing Award.

Although they have known each other for than 30 years, Bengio, Hinton and LeCun have mostly worked separately on technology known as neural networks. These are the electronic engines that power tasks such as facial and speech recognition, areas where computers have made enormous strides over the past decade. Such neural networks also are a critical component of robotic systems that are automating a wide range of other human activity, including driving.






Their belief in the power of neural networks was once mocked by their peers, Hinton said. No more. He now works at Google as a vice president and senior fellow while LeCun is chief AI scientist at Facebook. Bengio remains immersed in academia as a University of Montreal professor in addition to serving as scientific director at the Artificial Intelligence Institute in Quebec.
""For a long time, people thought what the three of us were doing was nonsense,"" Hinton said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""They thought we were very misguided and what we were doing was a very surprising thing for apparently intelligent people to waste their time on. My message to young researchers is, don't be put off if everyone tells you what are doing is silly.""
Now, some people are worried that the results of the researchers' efforts might spiral out of control.

While the AI revolution is raising hopes that computers will make most people's lives more convenient and enjoyable, it's also stoking fears that humanity eventually will be living at the mercy of machines.
Bengio, Hinton and LeCun share some of those concerns—especially the doomsday scenarios that envision AI technology developed into weapons systems that wipe out humanity.
But they are far more optimistic about the other prospects of AI—empowering computers to deliver more accurate warnings about floods and earthquakes, for instance, or detecting health risks, such as cancer and heart attacks, far earlier than human doctors.
""One thing is very clear, the techniques that we developed can be used for an enormous amount of good affecting hundreds of millions of people,"" Hinton said.

CytoSMART, the Eindhoven-based company that develops and manufactures digital microscopes for monitoring live cell cultures, has received €5.2 million to fund the growth of their business. New investor Eindhoven Venture Capital Fund II joined existing investors Holland Capital and BOM Brabant Ventures. The funding will be used by CytoSMART to further develop its microscopes and to expand its international sales and marketing strategies.






Innovative microscopes
CytoSMART has created three highly innovative microscopes that scientists can use to digitally and remotely count, screen, check, and film their cell cultures. CytoSMART’s latest microscope is the Omni, the world’s fastest live-cell imager. The company has also created a wide range of options for using the collected images to conduct experiments in its own cloud service. The additional funding will be used for product innovation, expanding product functions, and upscaling the company’s international sales and marketing.
“Since the series A round in 2016, our sales have shot up by over 300 percent,” says Joffry Maltha, CEO of CytoSMART. “In order to continue growing, it is important that we keep innovating with our products and increase our investment in marketing and sales activities in the next few years. That means we will be focusing strongly on new image-analysis applications and continued hardware development.”

Artificial Intelligence and cloud technology
CytoSMART Technologies develops and manufactures smart microscope systems for life science labs. The company was founded in 2012 by a team of biologists and engineers who were convinced that a new generation of miniaturised microscopes, powered by artificial intelligence and cloud technology, would allow biologists to make more easily reproducible discoveries more quickly, which would be of benefit to humanity. CytoSMART’s microscopy solutions are already used in over a thousand laboratories around the world.

The three recipients of the Association for Computing Machinery’s 2018 Turing Award, known as the “Nobel Prize of computing,” are sharing the $1 million award for their pioneering work with artificial neural networks — but that’s not all they share.
Throughout their careers, the researchers’ career paths and spheres of influence in the field of artificial intelligence have crossed repeatedly.
Yann LeCun, vice president and chief AI scientist at Facebook, conducted postdoctoral research under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton, who is now a vice president and engineering fellow at Google. LeCun also worked at Bell Labs in the early 1990s with Yoshua Bengio, who is now a professor at the University of Montreal and an adviser for Microsoft’s AI initiative.
All three also participate in the Learning in Machines and Brains program sponsored by CIFAR, previously known as the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.
In Wednesday’s award announcement, ACM credited the trio with rekindling the AI community’s interest in deep neural networks — thus laying the groundwork for today’s rapid advances in machine learning.
“Artificial intelligence is now one of the fastest-growing areas in all of science, and one of the most-talked-about topics in society,” said ACM President Cherri Pancake, a professor emeritus of computer science at Oregon State University. “The growth of and interest in AI is due, in no small part, to the recent advances in deep learning for which Bengio, Hinton and LeCun laid the foundation.”
And you don’t need to work in a lab to feel their impact.
“Anyone who has a smartphone in their pocket can tangibly experience advances in natural language processing and computer vision that were not possible just 10 years ago,” Pancake said.
ACM called the three awardees the “Fathers of the Deep Learning Revolution.”
The current approach to machine learning, championed by Hinton starting in the early 1980s, shies away from telling a computer explicitly how to solve a given task, such as object classification. Instead, the software uses an algorithm to analyze the patterns in a data set, and then apply that algorithm to classify new data. Through repeated rounds of learning, the algorithm becomes increasingly accurate.
Hinton, LeCun and Bengio focused on developing neural networks to facilitate that learning. Such networks are composed of relatively simple software elements that are interconnected and weighted in ways inspired by the connections between neurons in the human brain. Fine-tuning the connections helps programmers build deep learning networks, with layers upon layers of artificial neurons.
All three continue to play leading roles in AI research:

In addition to his work with the Google Brain team and CIFAR, Geoffrey Hinton is chief scientific adviser at Canada’s Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a university professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.
In his role as vice president and chief AI scientist at Facebook, LeCun built up the social-media platform’s network of AI research labs — including its recently established Seattle lab. He’s also a professor at New York University’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.
Yoshua Bengio is a computer science professor at the University of Montreal and the scientific director of Mila, Quebec’s AI institute, as well as the Institute for Data Valorization, or IVADO. He and LeCun are co-directors of CIFAR’s Learning in Machines and Brains program. Bengio’s connection to Microsoft dates back to the company’s acquisition of a Montreal-based AI startup called Maluuba in 2017. Bengio was an adviser to Maluuba, and took on that role for Microsoft after Maluuba was acquired.

Previous Turing Awards have gone to the likes of Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web; and Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn, who are reckoned among the internet’s founding researchers. Oren Etzioni, CEO of Seattle’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, argued that this year’s Turing Award could also be seen as “nothing short of historic, because it underscores a paradigm shift in AI.”
“Today, in vision, natural language processing and machine learning research, it’s essentially ‘all deep learning, all the time,’ and the Turing Awards winners pioneered this paradigm,” Etzioni told GeekWire in an email. “Looking to the future, deep learning has benefited immensely from Moore’s Law, but that exponential is finally slowing down — what will happen over the next decades?”

Google Vice President Geoffrey Hinton, Facebook’s Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal, were jointly awarded the Turing Award for 2018 for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning, work that has led to everything from news aggregators to Netflix and the modern boom in practical artificial intelligence development.
“Artificial intelligence is now one of the fastest-growing areas in all of science and one of the most talked-about topics in society,” said Cherri Pancake, president of the computing society, in a statement on the Award. “The growth of and interest in AI is due, in no small part, to the recent advances in deep learning for which Bengio, Hinton and LeCun laid the foundation.”
Specifically, the three were cited for creating the “conceptual foundations” of deep neural networks, the kind of algorithms that powers how artificial intelligence systems learn new things. A system’s ability to learn something is crucial in artificial intelligence since a system cannot be programmed for every eventuality it will confront in real-world applications, it must be able to train to recognize patterns and act appropriately in response to what it has learned.
The Turing Award is presented every year by the Association for Computing Machinery and includes a monetary prize of $1 million, which this year will be split between the three recipients.
Recognition for the Conceptual Foundation of Neural Networks
Neural networks, inspired by the web of neurons that make up the human brain, had been the subject of research for decades, but no one had made much progress in making them do anything of value. Then, in 2004, Hinton used the support of the Canadian government to organize a community of researchers, including LeCun and Bengio, that would turn neural networks into the powerful computing tools that they are today.
[see-also]
Hinton first began pursuing neural networks as a graduate student in the 1970s, and then later at AT&T’s Bell Laboratories where he built a neural network that could learn to read handwriting. Then, after a grant of $400,000 by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, Hinton, LeCun, and Bengio developed the algorithms that first powered speech recognition systems for IBM, Microsoft, and Google.

Next, Hinton moved on to image recognition networks building off an algorithm of LeCun’s which would go on to power systems like a self-driving vehicle’s computer vision capability—its ability to see the road, recognize cars, pedestrians, etc.
Bengio, working as a professor at the Univeristy of Montreal, oversaw research into generative adversarial networks, which uses one neural network to engage another, where one is designed to generate something original like a picture of a person’s face and the other network operates on what was generated as a form of quality assurance.

By  Angela Chen Mar 28, 2019, 12:05 PM EDTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge“Prison labor” is usually associated with physical work, but inmates at two prisons in Finland are doing a new type of labor: classifying data to train artificial intelligence algorithms for a startup. Though the startup in question, Vainu, sees the partnership as a kind of prison reform that teaches valuable skills, other experts say the claim of job training is more evidence of hype around the promises of AI.Vainu is building a comprehensive database of companies around the world that helps businesses find contractors to work with, says co-founder Tuomas Rasila. For this to work, people need to read through hundreds of thousands of business articles scraped from the internet and label whether, for example, an article is about Apple the tech company or a fruit company that has “apple” in the name. (This labeled data is then used to train an algorithm that manages the database.) That’s no problem for articles in English: Vainu simply set up an Amazon Mechanical Turk account to have people do these small tasks. But Mechanical Turk is “not really that useful when you want to do something [with the] Finnish language,” Rasila says, and the company had only one trainee tagging lots of data in the Finnish language. “We saw that and said, ‘okay, this is not going to be enough,” he adds. The Vainu offices happen to be in the same building as the headquarters of the Criminal Sanctions Agency (CSA), the government agency that oversees Finnish prisons, and so, says Rasila, the founders had an idea: “Hey, we could actually use prison labor.”The partnership started about three months ago and Vainu is now working with two different prisons, one in Helsinki and one in Turku. Vainu shipped 10 computers to these prisons and pays the CSA for each task the prisoners complete. The amount is comparable to how much the startup would have paid for a task done on Mechanical Turk, though the CSA is responsible for figuring out how much of that goes to the prisoners, as well as selecting the inmates who do the data classification. “Hey, we could actually use prison labor”Finland is famous for its progressive prison policies. Approximately one-third of the country’s prisons are so-called open prisons, where inmates live and work like normal citizens. John Pratt, a researcher at the Victoria University of Wellington who studies different penal systems, notes that there is less of the “overwhelming emphasis on security” found in the United States. Prisoners are generally required to work or do vocational training, but are sometimes even allowed to work outside the prison or remain self-employed. Officials at the agency were excited to partner, according to Rasila, especially because the new jobs don’t require anything other than a laptop. “There’s no risk for violence,” he says, adding that when it comes to other forms of prison labor, like metalsmithing, access to tools that can be turned into makeshift weapons can make a prison workspace “a dangerous place.” Rasila estimates that, currently, a little less than 100 prisoners are working on Vainu’s project for a few hours a day. (A representative from the CSA did not respond to a request for comment.)Right now, Vainu and the CSA have an annual contract based on the number of tasks. The Vainu team hopes to expand elsewhere in Finland, and other countries where it can be hard to find people willing to do this type of work in local languages. To them, it’s a win-win situation. One motivation for the inmates is to make money, of course, but “a selling point of this was that the demand for training AI is actually increasing significantly, globally,” Rasila says. Similarly, the CSA wrote in a release that the program is part of its efforts to develop work activities that match “the requirements of modern working life,” and a PR representative pitched the partnership to The Verge as “an opportunity for inmates to have a job that can empower them.”It’s not surprising, either, that there would be an especially high demand for this type of work in other countries, according to Lilly Irani, a professor of communication at the University of California at San Diego. AI algorithms need to be trained in culturally specific ways, she says, and most Mechanical Turk workers are in the US. Though Rasila says that this is an example of developing skills that can be useful in the future, he also says that the tasks have “zero learning curve” and only require (presumably pre-existing) literacy, which calls into question how useful this skill is. This type of job tends to be “rote, menial, and repetitive,” says Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information science at the University of California at Los Angeles who studies information workers. It does not require building high level of skill, and if a university researcher tried to partner with prison laborers in the same way, “that would not pass an ethics review board for a study.” While it’s good that the prisoners are being paid a similar wage as on Mechanical Turk, Roberts points out that wages on Mechanical Turk are extremely low anyway. One recent research paper found that workers made a median wage of $2 an hour. For Irani, there’s nothing special about AI in this story. In the US at least, prison labor has long been controversial, with some saying that it economically exploits workers while others argue that it can help rehabilitate them. To her, the public relations push around the collaboration is more surprising than the fact that digital work has become part of prison labor. “The hook is that we have this kind of hype circulating around AI so that we can masquerade really old forms of labor exploitation as ‘reforming prisons,’” Irani says. “They’re connecting social movements, reducing it to hype, and using that to sell AI.”Update April 1st, 2019: This article has been updated to include more information about the Finnish penal system.

Production planning in manufacturing is a vital part of operations management, despite the fact that most production planning applications don't really plan anything. Traditional planning systems, including material requirements planning and its derivatives, do a great job of sorting out the varying requirements and dates. They then apply a type of fixed logic to that mass of data and lay out a plan or schedule that seems reasonable and may actually work. But any experienced planner will tell you that a typical computer-generated plan might contain elements that are impractical or downright impossible -- like launching a production order two weeks ago and finishing it today, or having a work center commit to three or four times as much production as it can complete in a day.









AI to improve production planning in manufacturing
The new generation of so-called advanced planning and scheduling (APS) overcomes many of those limitations by applying optimization algorithms instead of fixed logic that can trade off priorities and alternatives to come up with a more feasible plan that balances both resources and material date and quantities. But even APS, as ""smart"" as it is, still has its limitations. It takes a dedicated, knowledgeable human planner to interpret and apply the recommendations in the context of what's really happening out on the plant floor and in the customer's world by using intelligence that is not found in the data. Based on experience and knowing, or at least being able to anticipate, what is likely to happen under various scenarios moving forward?
The use of the word intelligence in the preceding paragraph is significant, for this is the human-like thinking that AI is designed to do. These production planning systems ""learn"" by collecting a massive amount of data and thoroughly analyzing it for cause and effect to build a model of the process. Then, as new information comes in, the system can perform thousands of what-if simulations to find the best path forward. The model is also refined based on additional data as these scenarios play out.
Production planning systems that incorporate AI capabilities will not replace human planners -- at least, not anytime soon. It will take some time to build up the necessary level of confidence needed to trust a computer to carry out this vital task. That being said, AI-developed plans and schedules will undoubtedly be ""better"" than any human could create. Plants will run more efficiently, product quality will improve and more work will be completed on time and at a lower cost.
So, what will the planner do after AI takes over the job of production planning in manufacturing? In addition to adding the ""sanity check"" on plans and planning system operations, human planners can focus on managing any special exceptions that the system might not be able to address. In addition, human insight and ingenuity can be directed toward process improvement.

The result was abstract crimson canvases that could be interpreted as clouds, flowers or fibroids.“While Rembrandt was addressing the power of medical science in his art I wanted to talk about the fascinating world of AI,” says the artist and human-computer interaction researcher. He first began tinkering with AI while studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2015. This series of works titled The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Algorithm, and was showcased at Gradient Descent, a first-of-its-kind AI art exhibition held at Delhi’s Nature Morte gallery in August.The work went on display again, yesterday, for a second edition of Gradient Descent, in Bengaluru, organised by Nature Morte and curated by an art collective called 64/1. Also on display are the works of AI artists Mario Klingemann from Germany, Jake Elwes and Anna Ridler from the UK and Memo Akten from Turkey. In January, artist and sculptor Sahej Rahal, 30, displayed his latest creation, Juggernaut, at Mumbai’s Chatterjee &amp; Lal. It’s an AI-driven audio-visual piece inspired by video games. The video traces the journey of a droid as it floats through an alternative civilisation, constantly evolving and building itself up by picking up totems and ruins of pillars to self-create a multi-limbed sculptural installation.Around the world, artists are exploring the interface between art and artificial intelligence, to create works, some of which are even being auctioned. The New York auction house Christie’s sold the AI-generated print, Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, by Paris-based art collective Obvious, for $432,500, last year. Sotheby’s followed suit and sold the two-screen installation Memories of Passerby I by Mario Klingemann for £32,000 earlier this month.“We have only just begun exploring AI-driven art as a genre in India and there is much scope for it to grow,” says artist Raghava KK, who is also co-founder of 64/1. “I have always thought of myself as a cyborg and there are a couple of others like me who find working with AI an extremely exciting prospect.” FIRST BRUSHSince 2014, Raghava has been using different forms of technology, from drawing on iPads and tapping into brainwaves, to create art. “Now the computer science department of Ashoka University also plans to include AI-driven art in their curriculum,” he says. Agrawal’s first tech-based art project was The Flying Pantograph in 2015, which used a pen-carrying drone to draw on a vertical wall. “The motion dynamics of the drone and the software intelligence added a new visual language to the art,” he explains. The art from that first experiment ended up being, essentially, a scribble. But this got him interested in how human and machine could come together for creative expression, which prompted him to design a software program called Tandem in 2016.Tandem uses an algorithm that lets the computer imagine and suggest a visual output. A roughly drawn figure of trees can be interpreted as dogs; the human artist interfacing with the AI can also add filters of emotions like happy, sad or dreamy, which the computer will interpret in the form of hues. Agrawal’s AI art created through Tandem has been exhibited at AI art exhibitions in South Korea, Germany, Austria, the US and Australia. His latest work, The Anatomy Lesson…, was created after he fed 60,000 images of surgical dissections into a similar algorithm. “The feedback I’ve got for this work has been as exciting as the creative process,” he says. One observer told him a painting reminded him of the interiors of a cave; a woman said she felt it celebrated womanhood.ONES &amp; ZEROESArtist Baiju Parthan says one thing holding back AI art in India is the large expense involved in creating your own algorithm.While Agrawal had considerable assistance from the MIT Media Lab, Rahal used his rudimentary programming knowledge and a free game development program called Unity to create Juggernaut. “After several messy rounds of programming, I managed to write a code that lets the droid perceive its space, choose objects around it, overcome obstacles and create an end product,” he says. The programme produces new sculptural forms every time the simulation is run. “My art is heavily inspired by the video games I’ve played all my life. This has a videogame feel but a deeper subtext of evolving time, history and cultures.”Artists have been using technology for a long time, and it was inevitable that AI would be part of this process as well, says art critic and curator Girish Shahane. Artist and curator Bose Krishnamachari, co-founder of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, disagrees.“I would like to think that AI-driven art is a temporary phase. Internationally, it has become a big trend and while I appreciate it, I don’t see it as something that is here to stay or is a big game-changer,” he says.Meanwhile, with a degree from IIT-Guwahati and a Masters in media, arts and science from MIT, Agrawal is keen on researching ways of merging science and art, but his mother is struggling to understand how her engineer son can also be an artist. “She was taken aback by the surgery images and it took her a while to understand how tech programs can help create art,” he says, laughing. “But she is slowly opening up to how both the fields can meet and I hope so can rest of the art world.”","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/meet-the-indians-using-artificial-intelligence-to-create-art/story-t6bL8UA0IG9WRW0IxwPmEK.html'}",,,,,,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'Hindustan Times', 'url': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com'}","['India News', 'Trending', 'Cricket', 'World News', 'Cities', 'Business', 'Opinion', 'Analysis', 'Lifestyle', 'Entertainment', 'Education', 'Astrology', 'HT Premium', 'Elections 2024', 'Videos', 'Photos', 'Sports', 'Web Stories', 'Science', 'HT Insight', 'Games', 'Podcasts']","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/images/htlogo-v1.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/hindustantimes', 'https://twitter.com/htTweets', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/hindustantimes', 'https://www.instagram.com/hindustantimes/', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ht']",lifestyle,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1.hdg1', 'h2.sortDec']}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com', 'name': 'News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle', 'name': 'Lifestyle'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture', 'name': 'art culture'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'item': {'name': 'Meet the Indians using artificial intelligence to create art'}}]",,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Hindustan Times House, 18-20, Kasturba Gandhi Marg', 'addressLocality': 'New Delhi', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '110 001'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91 – 11 – 60004242', 'contactType': 'Customer Service', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:00', 'closes': '18:00'}}",en,"{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/1600x900.jpg', 'caption': 'Bengaluru-based Harshit Agrawal’s artwork, created using an algorithm called Tandem, was showcased at Art Centre Nabi, in Seoul, South Korea, in 2016.', 'description': 'Bengaluru-based Harshit Agrawal’s artwork, created using an algorithm called Tandem, was showcased at Art Centre Nabi, in Seoul, South Korea, in 2016.', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The University of Toronto’s Geoffrey Hinton has been named one of three recipients of the prestigious A.M. Turing Award – dubbed by some “the Nobel Prize of computing” – for his decades-long work advancing the field of artificial intelligence.
Hinton, a U of T University Professor Emeritus who also works at Google, was named alongside two of his friends and longtime collaborators – Yann LeCun, of Facebook and New York University, and Yoshua Bengio, of Université de Montréal.
The Association for Computing Machinery lauded the three for making “conceptual and engineering breakthroughs” in deep neural networks – an area of AI inquiry that was once deemed fanciful, but is now considered transformational and is touching the lives of billions of people.  
""It's very nice that the group of us have been recognized as having a big impact,” said Hinton, who has sometimes been referred to as the “godfather” of deep learning, as the field is known.
“It's sort of an acceptance by the computer science community that this stuff isn't crazy.”
The A.M. Turing Award, named for British mathematician Alan Turing, who first articulated the mathematical foundation and limits of computing, is the premier international award for achievements in computing and includes a $1 million prize funded by Google.
It’s the second time the award has been given to a U of T researcher. University Professor Emeritus Stephen Cook won it in 1982 “for his advancement of our understanding of the complexity of computation in a significant and profound way.” Alumnus and former faculty member William Morton Kahan also won the award in 1989 while he was a faculty member at the University of California, Berkeley. Former postdoctoral researcher Silvio Micali, now a faculty member at MIT, won in 2012.
“I want to congratulate Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio for their incredible work – and sheer perseverance – in advancing the field of artificial intelligence over so many years,” said U of T President Meric Gertler.
“Their determination to follow paths others had rejected is testament to the importance of supporting basic research, which may not always produce results quickly – but can lead to profound discoveries over time that forever change our world.”
In recent years, the deep learning techniques Hinton, LeCun and Bengio helped pioneer have been used to achieve breakthroughs in a range of applications – everything from voice recognition software in people’s phones to algorithms that can spot cancerous tumours in medical scans. That, in turn, has sparked a gold rush for Canadian talent, prompting nearly a dozen multinational companies to set up AI labs in cities like Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton.
Canada’s early lead in deep learning also helped lay the foundation for initiatives like the Vector Institute of Artificial Intelligence, where Hinton is the chief scientific adviser. The centre will be moving into the first phase of U of T’s new Schwartz Reisman Innovation Centre – a 750,000 square-foot innovation complex on College Street that’s being supported by a $100-million donation by Onex Corp. founder and CEO Gerald Schwartz and Indigo founder and CEO Heather Reisman. 
It wasn’t always this way. Hinton recalled a time when he, LeCun and Bengio were relegated to the fringes of computer science research for their insistence that computers could learn in a way that mimics the human brain.
""We stuck to that when almost everyone else in artificial intelligence and computer science didn't,” said Hinton.
“It wasn't quite the same in psychology, where a lot of people believed in neural networks. But if you looked at the people doing computer science and machine learning, they became thoroughly disenchanted with them.""

Hinton said he first met LeCun at an academic conference in Paris in 1985. Intrigued by his work, he later agreed to become his external thesis adviser. There was only one small problem: “The exam was in French and I didn't speak French, so the only thing I understood in his thesis was the equations,” Hinton said. “But that was the important part.""
LeCun would later do post-doctoral research in Hinton’s Toronto lab before going on to work at AT&T’s Bell Labs, where his early work in convolutional neural networks would be used to read hand-written text. At the time, however, few people believed the technique could be applied to photographs of three-dimensional scenes.
Hinton’s relationship with Bengio, who also spent time at Bell Labs, would develop a few years later, though neither one can pinpoint the exact date.
Regardless, all three men were moving in the same circles and, research-wise, were on the same page.
Beginning in 2004, the trio’s work really started to come together. That’s when Hinton set up a program with the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) focused on machine learning and computer vision, which included both LeCun and Bengio.
Now meeting on a regular schedule, the three began regularly sharing ideas that informed each other’s work. In particular, Hinton recalled holding unofficial meetings in advance of a conference the three of them attended every year in Vancouver.
""Those were very important meetings,” Hinton said. “We would discuss all sorts of unpublished ideas and it was relatively small group of people, so you didn't need to waste time describing basic things.
“That was very useful for making progress.""
Hinton said the CIFAR program was key to advancing the group’s research. And he stressed it wouldn’t have happened without the help of past CIFAR head Chaviva Hosek, who was a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy and  “who got the point very quickly,” and another senior CIFAR executive named Mel Silverman, a University Professor Emeritus of medicine, who helped sketch out a research proposal.
""The funding allowed us to work together again.""
For Hinton, a big public breakthrough came in 2012 after he and two of his students, Alex Krishevsky and Ilya Sutskever, entered an image recognition and classification competition called ImageNet and shocked the computer vision community by almost halving the next-best error rate.
“We showed that the computer vision community was completely wrong and that Yann's convolutional nets, with a few extra tricks, could do much better than they could at recognizing things in photographs,"" Hinton said.
Deep learning had finally arrived, although it’s not like Hinton, LeCun or Bengio were the least bit surprised.
""We all had very similar basic beliefs about how neural networks were the right things to do,” Hinton said, “and that they would win in the end.""

According to a Korn Ferry Global survey, 63% of respondents said AI had altered the way recruiting happens in their organization. Not only do candidates have to get past human gatekeepers when they are searching for a new job, but they also have to pass the screening of artificial intelligence that continues to become more sophisticated. Recruiting and hiring new employees is an expensive endeavor for organizations, so they want to do all that’s possible to find candidates who will make valuable long-term employees for a good return on their recruitment investment.








Job Search In The Age Of Artificial Intelligence

Here are a few things candidates and organizations need to keep in mind when AI is part of the job search.
How AI helps in the recruiting process
Just like in other industries, artificial intelligence has the potential to streamline the job search process and take over time-consuming tasks for humans. There are several ways artificial intelligence helps candidates and companies during a job search and throughout the recruiting and hiring process.
PROMOTED
Candidates can use artificial intelligence job-seeking tools to find open positions that match their particular skill-set and discover organizations with the culture they want. This alone can save candidates an incredible amount of effort in an already time-consuming activity. Similarly, AI can conduct candidate outreach much more efficiently for companies so they can find candidates actually suited for the role.

When the CV screening process is automated, it is much more efficient—appreciated by candidates and human resources departments alike. Additionally, since recruiters won’t get bogged down in the CV review process, they have more time to nurture relationships with candidates.
AI-powered chatbots are responsive and quick to support a candidate during the application process. Having a chatbot handle inquiries from candidates is another way artificial intelligence frees up the time for human personnel to handle tasks only they can tackle.

Artificial intelligence helps organizations avoid the inevitable unconscious bias that seeps into the recruiting process when humans are determining which candidates to consider for a position. In addition, it can help companies identify growth opportunities for existing employees, training needs that set employees up for success and future promotions, and matches high-performers currently on staff to new opportunities.
Challenges presented by AI tools in the recruitment process
Candidates need to learn how to adjust their resumes and CVs to get through the artificial intelligence gatekeepers. If they don’t modify their approach, they won’t be matched with jobs and organizations that might be a good fit. They also need to be prepared to succeed if they are asked to an automated interview—where a candidate interacts with AI instead of a human. There are even businesses popping up that will help candidates “beat AI” in order to get a job.
Artificial intelligence allows organizations to scan multiple data points about each candidate. Not only are social media accounts reviewed, but it’s possible to critique multiple factors that make up the digital footprint of a candidate—something that would be impossible if only humans were assigned the task. This brings up interesting privacy questions regarding what information can be used to qualify candidates.
In addition to requiring a lot of data to work effectively, artificial intelligence can also learn human bias if the data set and algorithms they operate from have bias. Also, attitude, work ethic, and other attributes are difficult for a robot to critique but have also been a part of the hiring process.





Practical tips for job-seekers to prepare for AI in the job search

      Use keywords in your CV and cover letter that would be relevant for the position you seek

When you prepare your written materials to apply to a job, match the words you use with the terminology and keywords from the job posting. If they request someone who knows AP, be sure to have AP on your resume and cover letter and not accounts payable.

      Write like a human

Be sure your materials are still readable and grammatically correct. Don't assume that since a bot will be reviewing your materials, you must stuff your CV with keywords to get past their algorithms. If you make it past the bots, humans will still review your CV, and they won't be impressed by your skills if your written communication is barely intelligible.

      Have an online presence

While you must take care to have a respectable online presence, if you don’t have any at all, you might be at a disadvantage. Be sure your LinkedIn profile is up to date and depending on the role you seek, a personal website for your job search might also be helpful.

      Be sure your contact info is public

Make it easy for AI software and recruiters to contact you if they find you online. People can miss out on job opportunities if they have all of their online settings private. You can create an email address just for the job search and set up a Google Voice number that can be forwarded to your phone to take messages.

      Be prepared for digital interviews

Interviews conducted by AI bots won’t just be verifying what you say during the interview, but how you say it.

AI is the new buzzword in the maritime sector. As the shipping industry is under a big transformation at a global level, Artificial Intelligence is already making things easier by seamlessly integrating new shipping logistics and communication technology to evolve the business model within the shipping industry. Further, with the help of new algorithms, the shipping industry can fully rely on AI for mitigating security risks and reduce the cost of operations to a great extent. Along with that, AI can help the maritime sector to respond to and work in accordance with the new environmental regulations and policies in a better way.
This shipping industry has rapidly sustained pressures over environmental regulations which posed a challenge to fuel on which vessels run. This combined with global cyber threats, have made digitalisation an indispensable alternative for the maritime industry. Shippers are now keen on improvising systems to nurture innovation and find solutions to these concerns.
Amidst changing scenarios in global shipping, Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the hot topics. Inspiring and practical use cases are emerging on a daily basis, with organisations planning to adopt AI. However, while most of these technology implementations are in the conceptual stage, what and how much it takes to achieve business value and traction out of AI, depends on the reliance and robustness of products.
Artificial intelligence (AI) can collect and analyse data for the container shipping industry to chalk out plans more accurately. AI is pursued as the digital game changer in a variety of industries, which can render effective support to containerised supply chains with in-time transits and equipment availability.
Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. (MOL) announced that the company and its subsidiary MOL Information Systems, have signed a contract with Yokohama National University to conduct a joint study on the analysis and use of Big Data related to ocean shipping. The study aims at developing the capability of data analysis of economics and maritime affairs and forecast the ocean shipping market and bunker prices with greater accuracy.
Besides, ports and terminals are recognising the trend for using Big Data to collaborate with shipping lines, except, little is known on how to do this effectively. Kalmar also released its ‘Kalmar Insight’ tool, which has been designed to help terminals turn Big Data into actionable insight.
The logistics and shipping sector can reap major benefits from AI, as artificial intelligence is most focused on large-scale numbers. These figures are analysed and organised from different sources, shaped and then used as the basis for decision-making, at times with minimum or no human input.
With its harsh working conditions, isolated crew and high economical, ecological and human risks, any technology that is implemented through AI, should have a positive impact to address these issues. Technological advances must be directed to the benefit of seafarers, bringing them more safety and first world care, experts opined.
Shipping industry majors such as, Maersk, Panalpina and Flexport have initiated measures to harness AI, to simulate human intelligence, to address an array or issues surrounding the maritime industry. The issues in focus are, selection of the best alternative port, when the original destination is blocked and better estimation of the arrival time, to ensure seamless preparedness of logistics.
AI is also being tapped to forecast whether a shipper will cancel a booking or its container will get rolled by the carrier, and left on the dock.
Artificial intelligence is set to be a USD 16 billion dollar global market in 5 years and a recent study shows that 84 per cent of companies see the use of AI as ‘essential’ to competitiveness. Most press about AI in maritime has been about Rolls-Royce and their plans to use AI in “future remote and autonomous shipping operations”.
SailRouter (cloud application that helps ship owners to reduce fuel consumption and maintenance costs) and VesselBot (digital chartering marketplace for the bulk maritime industry) are also doing their part to bring shipping into the 21st century – and solve some very complex problems, with their AI powered solutions.
With technological advancements gripping all forms of businesses, sooner or later the maritime industry will have to adjust and introduce technology into its business model. At a juncture when the industry is poised to leap forward with multiple regulations and concerns revolving around safe, effective and economical shipping, the time is ripe for companies to develop and implement AI into their workflow.

Legal reviews of weapons, means and methods of warfare involving artificial intelligence: 16 elements to consider

Dustin A. Lewis  Senior Researcher, Harvard Law School Program 




 
What are some of the chief concerns in contemporary debates around legal reviews of weapons, means or methods of warfare involving techniques or tools related to artificial intelligence (AI)? One session of the December 2018 workshop on AI at the frontiers of international law concerning armed conflict focused on this topic. In this post, I outline a few key threshold considerations and briefly enumerate 16 elements that States might consider as part of their legal reviews involving AI-related techniques or tools.
It is imperative, in general, for States to adopt robust verification, testing and monitoring regimes as part of the process to determine and impose limitations and—as warranted—prohibitions in respect of an employment of weapons, means or methods of warfare. Where AI-related techniques or tools are—or might be—involved, the design and implementation of legal review regimes might pose particular kinds and degrees of challenges as well as opportunities. With respect to challenges, for example, in a forthcoming blog post Netta Goussac will highlight several legal and other concerns that might arise in respect of reviews of weapons involving AI, not least the potential to introduce uncertainty and corresponding issues regarding (un)predictably and (un)reliability. Furthermore, today it seems, from my perspective, that sufficient trust among States in this area seems to be lacking, at least among certain States with advanced technological capabilities. Against that background, robust legal reviews may not only contribute to legal compliance, but may also help foster normative stability and augment trust among States.
What do I mean by AI-related techniques and tools?
But first, a word on what I mean by AI-related techniques or tools. My starting point is that there is no generally recognized definition of AI. That said, it might be of value to focus on techniques or tools derived from, or otherwise related to, AI science broadly conceived. My understanding—drawn from the work of such scholars as Barbara J. Grosz—is that AI science pertains in part to the development of computationally based understandings of intelligent behavior, typically through two interrelated steps. One of those steps concerns the determination of cognitive structures and processes and the corresponding design of ways to represent and reason effectively. The other step relates to the development of theories, models, data, equations, algorithms and/or systems that embody that understanding.
So defined, AI systems are typically conceived as incorporating techniques—and leading to the development of tools—that enable systems to ‘reason’ more or less ‘intelligently’ and to ‘act’ more or less ‘autonomously’. The systems might do so by, for example, interpreting natural languages and visual scenes; ‘learning’ (or, perhaps more commonly, training); drawing inferences; and making ‘decisions’ and taking action on those ‘decisions’. The techniques and tools might be rooted in one or more of the following methods: those rooted in logical reasoning broadly conceived, which are sometimes also referred to as ‘symbolic AI’ (as a form of model-based methods); those rooted in probability (also as a form of model-based methods); and/or those rooted in statistical reasoning and data (as a form of data-dependent or data-driven methods).
Existing and purportedly new or emerging primary norms
By way of reminder, under international humanitarian law/law of armed conflict (IHL/LOAC), Article 36 of Additional Protocol I of 1977 provides that
[i]n the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party.
What is the legal nature of these reviews? A determination of lawfulness, or lack thereof, by a State in respect of those treaty provisions is not—at least according to the Rapporteur of those provisions’ drafting Committee (see O.R. XV, p 269, CDDH/215/Rev.1, para 30)—binding internationally. If we assume that that position is accurate, it would seem that the same contention might hold for the customary law counterparts, if any, of those treaty provisions. Instead, these legal review provisions—whether of a treaty or customary nature—might be seen as boiling down to an expectation that the obligation to make such a determination will be performed to ensure that weapons, means or methods of warfare will neither be developed nor adopted without at least a careful examination of their legality.
That contention, in turn, begs the question: what are the applicable primary norms? While there is widespread agreement on several primary norms, the possible development and employment of AI-related techniques or tools in respect of weapons, means or methods of warfare might nevertheless encounter several disagreements concerning aspects of the sources and/or content of some primary norms. Some of those disagreements stretch back decades (if not longer). Others are relatively new. Such differential approaches as to what constitutes lawful and unlawful conduct prevent normative uniformity and legal universality and thereby preclude the establishment of a comprehensive set of agreed primary legal norms against which all weapons, means or methods of warfare must be reviewed. Consider three examples.
Indiscriminate attacks
First, while there is, to my mind, no reasonable disagreement among States that, in general, indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under IHL/LOAC, some key aspects of that basic principle are currently contested. Take direct participation in hostilities as an example. In general, under IHL/LOAC civilians shall enjoy protection against the effects of hostilities. Certain aspects of those protections—including the so-called immunity from direct attack—might be withdrawn with respect to civilians who take a direct part in hostilities. There seems to be extensive support for the customary principle upon which Article 51(3) of AP I is based. (That provision, at least as a matter of treaty law, concerns direct participation of civilians in hostilities in respect of international armed conflicts as defined in that instrument.) Yet, according to the Law of War Manual (December 2016), the Office the General Counsel of the United States Department of Defense has noted that, at least in its view, that treaty provision, as drafted, does not reflect customary international law in all of its precise aspects.
Applicable legal frameworks
Second, with respect to applicable legal frameworks, there is, to my mind, no reasonable disagreement among States that relevant provisions of at least IHL/LOAC must be taken into account in legal reviews of weapons. Meanwhile, some States are considering whether international human rights law (IHRL) provisions must also be taken into account—and, if so, how and to what extent. The United Kingdom, for example, is apparently actively considering this issue. Such an assessment concerning the applicable framework(s) matters in no small part because the content of relevant IHL/LOAC provisions are at least traditionally perceived as tolerating more—indeed, in certain circumstances much more, though never unlimited—death, destruction and other harm in comparison to IHRL provisions.
A primary norm concerning AI-related techniques or tools?
Third, there currently seems to be a pivotal disagreement among certain States whether a new or emerging primary norm concerning AI-related techniques or tools and other relevant technologies can, should and/or must be developed. (According to certain scholars and advocates, such a norm might already be discerned.)
Here is where much of the normative debate currently seems to lie in respect of ‘emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons systems’ (to use the term from the title of the relevant Group of Governmental Experts). On one hand, for some States, such a primary norm might be formulated in conceptual terms drawn, for example, from the August 2018 proposal by Austria, Brazil and Chile to establish a mandate for a new binding international instrument. That proposal speaks of ‘ensur[ing] meaningful human control over critical functions in lethal autonomous weapon systems’. On the other hand, certain other States argue that existing IHL/LOAC is sufficient. According to that viewpoint, the ‘modernization’ or ‘adaptation’ of IHL/LOAC in respect of emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons systems is not needed.
16 elements or properties of interest or concern
While recognizing the significance of the disagreement on the existence and/or sources—or, at least, on some precise aspects—of certain primary norms identified above, it remains imperative for States to adopt robust legal review regimes. With that in mind, it may be of value to enumerate elements or properties of interest or concern that might be salient for the people responsible for conducting legal reviews of weapons, means or methods of warfare involving AI-related techniques or tools to consider.
A few caveats first. The listing order here is not meant to imply a hierarchy. Some of the elements or properties might overlap substantively and/or procedurally. Others might stand on their own. Inclusion on the list is not meant to represent a contention that international law does or does not already oblige a State to consider that particular element or property as part of a legal review. Nor is the list meant to exhaustively enumerate all possibly relevant considerations—far from it. With those caveats in view, here are 16 non-exhaustive assessments concerning elements or properties of interest or concern that might be considered as part of a legal review:

Legal agency: an assessment concerning the preservation of legal agency of humans—as grounded in international law—in respect of an employment of weapons, means or methods of warfare involving AI-related techniques or tools;

Thanks for putting these suggestions forward, Dustin.  Though I fear taking the conversation outside the scope of this series, do you think that these same elements are also relevant for the legal reviews of other ‘newer’ means and methods of warfare, such as cyber capabilities?

Dustin, thank you for writing such an interesting post of such an important topic. I completely agree that States must develop robust procedures for the legal review regimes. This is especially the case for new technology weapons such as AI-enhanced weapons that challenge existing IHL norms.  Unfortunately few States do (19 according to PREMT ).  Many of your elements or properties of interest or concern fall within a State’s prerogative to determine how it will conduct it internal legal reviews.  A State may regard your elements as issues to be considered in the context of the Martens Clause and develop its own position as to whether they represent an existing international law obligation or require a policy position.  I think such considerations should be made early in the study and development of an AI weapon and effectively be a design specification to ensure that the AI weapon is capable of review.  As such States should be investing now in the legal review of such weapons in parallel to their research into AI weapon capabilities.  The legal review of AI weapons will require an assessment of IHL and international law principles and rules are relevant to the weapon’s use, determining the standard of compliance that the reviewing State will require to pass an Article 36 review and developing a testing methodology that identifies the weapon’s ability to do so in a range of operating environments.  Determining the standard of compliance will be a challenge. For example, if an AI-enhanced weapon makes recommendations to a human operator whether certain persons or objects are lawfully targetable (i.e. because they are combatants or military objectives) what standard of certainty will the human operator be able to accept before acting on a recommendation?  Will the State Article 36 review require a standard equivalent to or superior to a human who does everything feasible to distinguish?  How will the Article 36 review consider AI bias, false assessments and human cognitive issues associated with information display?  Ultimately a weapon review should recommend that a weapon is not aquired or adopted or that its use is restricted if it is unable to satisfy the appropriate review standards.  The weapon review obligation will probably need to extend into the operational life of an AI weapon to address changes to its methods of operation or upgrades to the software that renders it ‘new’ for the purpose of Article 36.  Perhaps legal advisors deployed in compliance with Article 82 of AP1 will conduct in-service weapon reviews.  Thanks again for generating discussion on this important topic.  I think that there is a need for further discussion.

Netta, a great article.  You highlight many of the challenges for States will need to consider to develop their internal process for the legal review of AI enhanced or autonomous weapons.  In my view, to address the challenges you raise, States will need to rethink their internal processes for the weapon review of AI enhanced or autonomous weapons and develop a raft on policy positions to address these challenges.  From a process perspective,  I agree that legal reviews should commence at the earliest stages of study and development of an AI enhanced or autonomous weapon.  This may even extend to include study and research conducted through State sponsored Defence Industrt study and research (see for example the Australian Defence Science and Technology Groups ‘Trusted Autonomous Systems Defence Cooperative Research Centre’).   States should identify at the earlier stages their legal review requirements (e.g. explainable or recordable recommendations/decisions) and including them in the programming and design specifications of a new capability.  This will require States to identify what aspects of the proposed system or weapon functionality engage its international law and IHL obligations and how those obligations can be translated into code and the AI system trained.  For example, if an AI system makes ‘distinction’ recommendations about persons or objects on the battlefield for a human weapon operator to decide and act upon, the State will need to determine what standard of certainty the system must achieve to make a recommendation.  The State may require a standard equivalent to that of a trained human or seek a higher level of certainty.  All functionality that engages a States international law and IHL obligations will need to be tested to inform the legal review and allow the reviewer to identify limitations in the system or weapon. The testing may occur for the weapon’s normal or expected use in a range of anticipated operating environments designed to identify system limitations.   The legal review may ultimately restrict certain weapon functionality in certain environments or circumstances where it proves unreliable or unable to achieve the required standards set by the reviewing State.  For an AI enhanced weapon capable of machine learning, the legal review process will need to extend into the service life of the weapon to address not only self-learned changes and programming updates but also operational factors (rule of engagement, enemy counter-measures that necessitate a change in the weapons method of warfare), environmental and human factors that are unique to a particular mission.  Even for an AI or autonomous weapon that has passed a legal review a State will need determine how the weapon can be certified for operation in an specific mission or theatre.  I think there is merit in States developing a set of guiding principles for the legal review of AI enhanced or autonomous weapons.  These could include fundamental issues such as IHL apply to the use of AI enhanced or autonomous weapons, and legal reviews are to be conducted at least prior to the deployment.  I look forward to further guidance from the ICRC on the legal review of new technology weapons, including AI enhanced and autonomous weapons.

Gavin Newsom is urging Stanford researchers at the new Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence to stay true to their name and focus on the impact AI is having on people’s jobs.
‘We want to put philosophers and anthropologists and economists and political scientists in the lab with the technologists, so that ethical values and social scientific frameworks are baked in … to the very development of artificial intelligence.’Rob Reich, StanfordNewsom and Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates keynoted a symposium yesterday where university officials and scientists announced the formal launch of the institute. Its goal is to address both the peril and promise of AI, with human ethics and values as its lodestar.
Newsom said he was recently at the Port of Long Beach, talking with longshoremen worried that upgrades coming to the port will cost them jobs. He said longshoremen asked him not to implement the upgrades.
‘We’re moving forward–low-carbon green growth goals which are the envy of the rest of the nation,” Newsom said. “Our cap-and-trade program, our goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that means we’re moving forward with new technologies that are more efficient. The problem with the new technologies that are more efficient–you don’t need any people.’
In recent years, AI has managed to tangle itself in a pile of ethical problems. Facial recognition software doesn’t see faces that aren’t white. Speech recognition wants you to speak the King’s English. Or at least a solid American version of it–no accents. Longshoremen aren’t the only workers fearing job loss; truckers and restaurant workers also feel the hot breath of AI at their backs. And we can’t leave out Russian bots serving up lies to mess with our democracy.
“As technologists, it’s our responsibility to address the failings of our tools,” said Stanford HAI co-director Fei-Fei Li. “But it’s also our responsibility to realize the full extent of their potential.”
For example, she said, what if AI could keep an eye on patients in an emergency room, and alert staff when someone’s condition worsens? Or what if AI could help figure out how children learn, and improve education?
The new institute’s research will focus on enhancing and augmenting human lives across medicine, education and other fields, without replacing humans. KQED’s Brian Watt spoke about the new institute with two of its associate directors, computer science professor James Landay and political science professor Rob Reich. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Some key points from the interview …
What exactly is AI?
Landay: It’s a fuzzy term, and the definition has moved over the years. I’d say the simplest definition is: the capability of machines to imitate intelligent human behavior.
But that behavior could be as simple as Google Maps telling you which ways to get to work today because there’s different traffic, all the way to maybe making a diagnosis about some very complex cancer situation.
What is the one thing people get wrong about AI?
Landay: Thinking that it’s going to be this hyper-intelligent being that will be so much smarter than people, and therefore eventually take over the world like in some kind of “Terminator” movie. That’s really the biggest misconception we see.
Another thing we hear a lot is that AI will make millions of jobs obsolete. Should we be worried?
Landay: I think job disruption is always a thing to be worried about. Globalization led to some major structural problems for some people and created wealth for others. It’s this unevenness that occurs with these disruptions that we need to pay attention to, and get ahead of, to make sure the people who might be disrupted are learning new skills, so they have a future.
Now, some economists think AI might not even disrupt us, because the real problem over the long period is a lack of growth in the population — that there won’t be enough younger people to support all the older people. And that we may even need machines to help us move forward as a society in health care and other areas.
So it’s not even clear, in an economic sense, that AI will replace everyone’s jobs.

The institute’s work revolves around what you call ‘human-centered AI.’ What does that mean? 
Rob Reich: First, ensuring as best we can that the advancement of artificial intelligence ends up serving the interests of human beings, and not displacing or undermining human interests. The essential thing is to ensure that as machines become more and more intelligent and are capable of carrying out more and more complicated tasks that otherwise would have to be done by human beings, that the role we give to machine intelligence supports the goals of human beings and the values we have in the communities we live in, rather than step-by-step displacing what humans do.
Second, the bet that the institute is making here at Stanford is that the advancement of artificial intelligence will happen in a better way if, instead of just putting technologists and AI scientists in the lab and having them work really hard, we do it in partnership with humanists and social scientists.
So the familiar role of the social scientist or philosopher is that the technologists do their thing and then we study it out in the wild; the economist measures the effects of technology and the disruption it has, or the philosopher tries to worry about the values that are disrupted in some way by technology.
At HAI we want to put philosophers and anthropologists and economists and political scientists in the lab with the technologists, so that ethical values and social scientific frameworks are baked in, to the extent possible, to the very development of artificial intelligence.
What are your top two ethical concerns about AI?
Reich: First, when you’re developing an algorithm and making use of enormous oceans of data, that data typically encodes human decisions of the past. And humans, as we all know, have often been biased and engaged in all kinds of unethical behavior. So algorithms can encode into their predictive judgements those human biases of the past. Bias and discrimination can creep into the various forms of AI decision-making.  
The second big consideration is that AI, like lots of technologies, can be used for good, and it can also be used by human beings for bad ends. We want to call attention to the different ways that AI can be deployed and try to build in social frameworks and technical approaches that make it much more likely that AI is deployed for good rather than for ill.



I think about a car that’s programmed to protect the passenger inside. But if a passenger would have to choose between crashing or hitting a child, the human mind would say to save the child. How does AI sort this out?
Rob Reich: That’s exactly the kind of question that putting philosophers and social scientists and technologists in the lab together is meant to allow discussion about.
There’s research that shows if you ask a human being whether they think the car should optimize for all of human safety, rather than just passenger safety, people say of course it should optimize for all human safety. But if you’re asking, ‘What kind of car would you like to purchase, one that optimizes for all human safety or optimizes for passenger safety?’ they go for passenger safety.
This is what, to me, indicates that engineers have to make these value decisions while they’re developing the technology. And far better that it happens in the open with the full discussion amongst all the various stakeholders–including ordinary citizens–so that we can build toward a bigger social consensus.

Image credit: Allison Mitchell.ShareAfrican elephants, the biggest land animals on earth, are in grave peril: They could be extinct in the next decade. Poachers kill an estimated 55 elephants every day.The challenge of protecting elephants is vast, literally—reserves are sprawling, often remote, and understaffed. AI is starting to fill the gaps by being the eyes and brains behind spotting or predicting where the poachers might be. One of the most recent projects to stop attacks is TrailGuard AI, a system of small cameras with algorithms for image detection and object recognition built in.The name TrailGuard comes from the fact that despite the enormous areas some reserves cover, there are still choke points poachers have to travel through, allowing cameras to be setup up strategically in those places. To be helpful, the cameras have to work autonomously, be low-powered, and send photos in real time.

An earlier iteration of the TrailGuard camera didn’t have AI built in and sent back photos that 75 percent of the time had no humans in them. The cameras would be triggered by a cloud moving in front of the sun, swaying grass, or animals going by. These false triggers eat up precious battery life and become a nuisance to the rangers who have to drop what they are doing and look through images. Plus, changing batteries every few weeks puts people in danger and potentially gives away where the cameras are set up.Adding AI that detects whether a person is in the photo reduces the error rate to a fraction of previous attempts—and it improves its accuracy with time. Capturing and sending fewer images means TrailGuard cameras now last up to 18 months without having to swap the batteries out.The AI behind the smart cameras has been used in urban settings for years but hasn’t made an appearance to stop poaching until now. “It’s never been used in national parks where we need it the most,"" says Eric Dinerstein, the Director of Biodiversity and Wildlife at RESOLVE, a conservation nonprofit and a partner on the TrailGuard AI project.For cash-strapped national parks trying to stop well-funded poaching forces that can include anything from machine guns to helicopters, any help is appreciated.“This is a huge advantage for conservation,” says Alex Dehgan, the CEO of Conservation X Labs, a nonprofit looking to end human-driven extinctions with technology.Dehgan, who was not involved in the TrailGuard project, points out that rangers will still be crucial to the conservation efforts, but will now have more information to act on than ever before.“[It’s] going to make us all into the equivalent of superheroes,” he says.The goal is to deploy TrailGuard AI in 100 reserves in Africa by the end of the year, starting in the national parks in the Serengeti and Garamba. Ultimately, there are plans to take the technology to Southeast Asia and South America—and possibly use it to combat issues other than poaching, like illegal logging.“We think it's going to be a game changer,” Dinerstein says.

Saving the Natural World with Artificial IntelligenceHumanity is making it tough for the rest of the inhabitants on Earth to thrive. Deforestation, poaching, and urban sprawl are just some of the problems we’ve unleashed on our non-homo sapiens neighbors. Those pressures, as well as others like climate change and pollution (which aren’t good for humans either), are contributing to a loss of plant and animal species that scientists argue is nothing less than a massive and human-made sixth extinction event.Conservationists have long turned to technology—such as remote sensors and animal I.D. tags—to learn more about the species they study, bring attention to the worst problems, and inform solutions like protected refuges that can help species return to health. AI and machine learning are the latest technologies at their disposal. And luckily for perennially strapped conservation efforts, better-funded AI research is creating free tools, cheap cloud services, and open source resources that put cutting edge technology within reach for even small nonprofits.The need for large datasets, however, still holds backs many ecological AI projects. Most of the data that does exist for conservation isn’t digitized, is incomplete, or is housed in proprietary databases locked down at universities.Projects like Wild Me are trying to address these problems by aggregating large amounts of data for scientists. Wild Me lets researchers upload photos of the animals they study to an open-source platform, and scrapes large amounts of data from websites like YouTube and Flickr. When safari-goers upload footage of a pack of zebras they saw, for example, Wild Me’s computer vision algorithm spots the zebras and can identify individuals it has seen before, creating a record that lets biologists study the health and habitat of animals in new ways.Another data creation effort is Conservify, a lab dedicated to using technology to democratize data gathering to make an impact on conservation efforts. One way they’re doing that is by building low-cost sensors that can be placed in the wild to gather new data. They are also developing an online platform called FieldKit that will help researchers, students, and weekend naturalists share data.Trying out new technology does come with hazards. Communities aren’t going to be happy with tech that doesn’t work or affects them negatively. It might also disturb wildlife unaccustomed to its presence.“Once you go put it out in the field, that’s where the real risk happens,” says Shah Selbe, Conservify’s CEO and founder.Selbe points to the explosion of poorly-trained drone operators as an example of technology sometimes being put to use before it’s ready. Drones have major potential for conservation research, especially when combined with computer vision algorithms that can swiftly parse hours of footage, but drones need to be used carefully so as not to bother local communities or animals. Fortunately, Selbe says so far he hasn’t seen significant failures with new AI tools. The stakes are high because AI, done right, could open the world up to further exploration and understanding.“In terms of the work that I do, everything has absolutely changed,” he says.

Discovering Endangered Plants Before it’s Too LateIn a fluorescent-lit room lined with gray filing cabinets at the University of Maryland (UMD), a hundred thousand plant specimens are tidily housed in manila folders. The samples in the Norton-Brown Herbarium have been carefully collected for more than a century from across the globe, although the majority are from the mid-Atlantic region. One such sample is Phacelia covillei, a flowering plant with bottle-shaped blue blossoms found in scattered pockets in states like Maryland, North Carolina, Indiana, and Missouri.Due to factors like urban development and climate change, Phacelia covillei is at risk of extinction, according to NatureServe, a ranking system used to denote the relative imperilment of different plant and animal species in North America. It made the list thanks to a new machine learning tool that tries to identify threatened plants before it’s too late to save them.

It’s a big challenge. The vast majority of plants haven’t been assessed at all: Less than 10 percent of plant species around the world have been checked for the IUCN Red List, the premier directory for global extinction risks that is often used to make conservation decisions. Anahí Espíndola, a professor of evolutionary ecology at UMD who worked on the machine learning tool, wanted to see if she could find ways to zero in on those most in need of classification.Espíndola and her team trained a machine learning algorithm on details known about plants that are already on the IUCN Red List—like their location, range, and physical traits—and used it to assess 150,000 plant species whose vulnerability is currently unknown. Their method found that more than 10 percent of those unassessed plants were at risk.This AI tool could speed up conservation efforts and direct limited resources more effectively than current practices. Geographic bias is one problem: Plants are better studied in the U.S. and Europe because of bigger government and university research budgets. Espíndola says AI can quickly pinpoint the plants most at risk, regardless of where they might be. AI might also prevent another problem that plagues animal conservation: The cutest species get an outsized amount of the attention.“You don’t get that bias [with AI],” she says of our preference for the cute and cuddly. “It tells you where to go first.”Seeing the Forest for the TreesConservation AI isn’t just for remote areas; it could also make cities greener. For example, trees reduce the urban heat island effect, reduce stress in humans, and reduce flooding during storms. Despite all of these benefits, U.S. cities are losing 36 million trees a year, according to a study from the Forest Service.Knowing where the trees are (or aren’t) isn’t as easy as it sounds. Counting from the ground takes years and the results are often incomplete due to difficulties distinguishing trees on private property, or using satellite images that aren’t crisp or detailed enough for the human eye. Geospatial analytics startup Descartes Labs built a machine learning tool that can take one-meter resolution satellite imagery and count individual trees, without getting tricked by non-tree greenery or shadows that might appear to be trees. This would point out areas that are “tree deserts” and, over time, show changing areas that might need renewed attention.Descartes Labs originally developed the tool to predict corn harvests but could see the system being used as a deforestation prevention tool. Eventually, Descartes Labs might create layers of different informational maps that would be useful to people trying to manage land for all sorts of reasons, including conservation efforts.“You can be surprised by what you could see by combining layers,” says Tim Wallace, a geographer at Descartes Labs. “The more we combine, the more powerful it becomes.”Era of AI-Powered ConservationIt’s not just ecologists and startups working on saving the world. Some of the biggest companies in the world like Microsoft, Intel, and Google all have AI for good projects, including some that target conservation issues. Not only is this work potentially good for the planet, but it’s good for business, too. Creating cutting-edge tools and putting money into conservation programs is a great way to recruit top talent that doesn’t want to just work on improving advertising click-through rates. And there is an additional bonus: If technology can work in the field, it should also work in less rugged office and factory settings.“[Conservationists] always set the bar super high,” says Lucas Joppa, Microsoft's Chief Environmental Scientist. “And if you can jump that bar, you passed the bar for many, many, many other use cases by far.”Joppa has experience with clearing those bars with Microsoft’s AI for Earth, a five-year, $50 million initiative to back projects by environmental groups and researchers working on sustainable plans using AI. Joppa, who helps oversee the program, says that there is nothing harder or more important than creating technology that can solve these environmental problems.""People think that the hardest problem is how to route an autonomous car to the closest latte,” he says. “We have other problems we need to tackle.”Of course, there is always the concern that AI could do more harm than good for the environment. Previous industrial revolutions were driven by new technologies that ended up being harmful to the planet, from factories spewing smog to encouraging mining of precious metals for smartphones. This AI revolution, Joppa says, will have to be carefully designed to benefit the planet and not create problems, unanticipated or otherwise, for future generations.“That’s not easy to do,” he says.To learn more about researchers' testing of TrailGuard AI, which could someday help rangers better protect elephants and other endangered species, watch this video:

The thumbnail in the top right? That’s what Duke campus might look like if it were painted by a Chinese ink master. If you look closely, you can also see a Picasso version of the red bridge in the Gardens, and the Chapel recreated in the style of Van Gogh’s “Starry Night.”
These pieces may seem to be the work of human artists. But for the roughly two dozen entries in the first A.I. art competition at Duke, a big part of the creative process belonged to a machine.
      
Meet the Artists in the ‘A.I. for Art’ Competition 
Reception and viewing from 6 to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, March 20 in the Ruby Lounge at the Rubenstein Arts Center.

No brushes. No paints. Instead, the contestants used advanced computer algorithms that can sort through thousands of image examples, recognize patterns, and then generate new images of their own with the help of artificial intelligence.
See the results for yourself at a reception from 6 to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, March 20 at the Rubenstein Arts Center, hosted by the +Data Science initiative and the Vice Provost for the Arts.
Some of the entries in the ‘A.I. for art’ contest used artificial intelligence to create a mash-up of the style of one image and the content of another. By Scott Emmons '19 and Myla Swallow '19.
	The contestants used several different approaches in artificial intelligence to make art. Some teams focused on teaching machines to capture a specific style, like Monet's Impressionism or the dreamy surrealism of Dalí, and transfer it to another image.
That technique, called style transfer, is what’s behind a piece called “Bridged Reflections,” by undergraduates Scott Emmons ’19 and Myla Swallow ’19. First they trained the system on thousands of images of everyday objects so it could learn what things like faces and buildings typically look like. Then they gave it two images -- one of the lake at Duke Gardens, and another of Picasso's painting “Les Femmes d'Alger” -- and the algorithm reinterpreted the lake in the style of Picasso’s work.
Duke masters students Jingwen Wang ’20 and Yicheng Deng ’19, of data science and ECE respectively, played with a similar technique to create A.I. art inspired by Chinese brush painting.
The secret behind their entry is a class of algorithms called “generative adversarial networks,” or GANs. To get their algorithm to produce a convincing likeness of a traditional Chinese painting, they fed it 9,000 such paintings -- mostly monochrome images of mist-shrouded mountains and meandering rivers -- that they painstakingly scraped from the web.
Based on these, one side of the GAN generates new images, while the other decides if they are “real” or fakes. The generated images get better and better until the system can’t tell the difference.
A lazuli bunting (top) and a hooded warbler (bottom) as seen through the ‘eyes’ of an image recognition algorithm developed in the lab of Duke professor Cynthia Rudin.Yet another contest entry might look like a cubist remix of “Peterson’s Field Guide to Birds,” but the algorithm works a bit differently.
A team led by Duke computer science and ECE professor Cynthia Rudin used a neural network they developed to analyze thousands of bird photos ranging from pelicans to hummingbirds. Then, given a photo of a mystery bird, the A.I builds a surreal photo collage that shows which parts of the bird are most similar to typical species features it has seen before, remixing and overlaying patches of images together to create its own representation.
Co-creator and computer science Ph.D. student Alina Barnett selected the training data. “My parents are birders,” Barnett says.
The resulting mishmash essentially says: “This isn't just any warbler. It's a hooded warbler, and here are the features -- like its masked head and yellow belly -- that give it away.”
They’re “sort of Frankenbirds,” said co-creator James Hoctor, a masters student in computer science who also collaborated on the project with Ph.D. student Chaofan Chen and undergraduate Oscar Li ‘19.
“It’s what you might come up with if you saw a tern on a safari, and instead of taking a picture of it, you went home and drew a copy of it later from memory. And you’re really bad at drawing,” Hoctor said.
These portraits were produced using artificial intelligence by Duke undergraduate Daniel Zhou ’21.
	Art made by artificial intelligence raises difficult questions. How is human creativity different from what A.I. learns to do? How much of the credit for AI-generated art should go to the human versus the machine?
Swallow says she wrestles with these issues. Sure, the human artist chooses what images to feed the algorithm. But beyond those inputs, Swallow says, we “had almost no control over the output. You never really knew what you were going to get.”
Few of the contestants consider themselves artists per se. “I’m not the most artistically creative person,” said undergraduate Daniel Zhou ‘21, who identifies as a STEM guy. ""But I was curious to see if I could produce aesthetic art through machine learning."" 
STEM geeks are inspired by notions of beauty too, says math and computer science major Emmons. “I don’t paint or draw in my free time. But I study math because I think it’s beautiful.”
One of the benefits of using machine learning to create art is scale. With the touch of a button, Emmons said, he was able to “output 900 different paintings overnight. I wanted to hang them up on my wall.”
Similarly, Zhou used A.I. to churn out hundreds of trippy-looking portraits and landscapes, lined up like the repetitive heads of a Warhol painting.
Emmons says his take-away from the contest is that A.I. is no replacement for human artists, but it could be a way to enhance the creative process. “I think what machine learning and A.I. are doing is providing new tools for people to use.”
The submissions have been judged by faculty from Duke’s Art, Art History & Visual Studies Department, and from the Rhodes Information Initiative at Duke (Rhodes-iiD).
The top three entries will take home a share of $8500, with winners announced at the reception on March 20.
Duke Ph.D. student Zach Monge (psychology and neuroscience) used machine learning to transform forest images into abstract paintings and back.

Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict Violence in Movies Greta Harrison | March 20, 2019							
						
The film industry will soon be able to better predict MPAA ratings for movies, thanks to a new artificial intelligence tool. 



A research team at USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering has created a tool to help the film industry track the depiction of violence in the language of scripts.
For many in the film industry, seeing your film landed with an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) is the kiss of death. With your film no longer accessible to viewers under 17, you are presented with a choice between limited box-office takings or expensive re-editing, or even reshooting, to meet the requirements of a more palatable R rating.
But what if there were a more accurate way to determine a film’s likely classification at the script stage, before it moves through the expensive process of production and post-production? A research team from the Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab (SAIL) at USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering is using machine learning to analyze the depiction of violence in the language of scripts. The result is a new tool to assist producers, screenwriters and studios in determining the potential classification of their projects.
Presented at the 2019 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Conference, the new AI tool was developed by PhD students Victor Martinez,  Krishna Somandepalli, Karan Singla, Anil Ramakrishna, and their advisor Shrikanth Narayanan, the Niki and Max Nikias Chair in Engineering. This was done in collaboration with Yalda Uhls of Common Sense Media. The study is the first time that natural language processing has been used to identify violent language and content in movie scripts.
The research team built the script tool using machine learning language analysis of popular film scripts.
The AI tool was developed using a dataset of 732 popular film scripts that had been annotated for violent content by Common Sense Media. From this information, the team built a neural network machine learning model where algorithms intersect, work together and learn from input data (that is, the text of the scripts), in order to create an output (i.e., violence ratings for the movie). The AI tool analyzed language in the dialogue of screenplays and found that the semantics and sentiment of the language used was a strong indicator of the rated violent content in the completed films.
Narayanan and his team have been using AI to analyze human-centric data for over 15 years as part of their computational media intelligence research, which focuses on analysis of data related to film and mass media. They regularly work with partners such as The Geena Davis Institute for Gender in Media to analyze data from film and media to determine what it can reveal about representation.
Narayanan said that text analysis has a long history in the creative fields of evaluating content for hate speech, sexist and abusive language, but analyzing violence in film through the language of the script is a more complex task.

“Typically when people were studying violent scenes in media, they look for gun shots, screeching cars or crashes, someone fighting and so on. But language is more subtle. These kinds of algorithms can look at and keep track of context, not only what specific words and word choices mean. We look at it from an overarching point of view,” Narayanan said.
Martinez said that one example of the AI tool’s ability to detect implicit violence that current technology cannot detect was a portion of dialogue from The Bourne Ultimatum (2007):

“I knew it was going to end this way. It was always going to end this way…”

Martinez said that this line was flagged by the AI tool as violent, even though it does not have any explicit language markings for violence.
“In contrast to the way the MPAA rates, our models look at the actual content of the movie, and the context in which dialogue is said, to make a prediction on how violent that movie is,” Martinez said.
Somandepalli said that the research team is now using the tool to analyze how screenplays use violence in depictions of victims and perpetrators, and the demographics of those characters.
Such findings could play an important role in a post #MeToo Hollywood, with concerns about representation of women and perpetuation of negative stereotypes, and a renewed focus on strong female characters with agency.
The team anticipates that eventually this would be a tool that could be integrated into screenwriting software. Most screenwriting programs such as Final Draft or WriterDuet are already able to create reports showing the proportion of character dialogue by gender. This tool would allow content analysis in terms of the nature of violent language used by a character, displaying which characters are the perpetrators and which are the victims.
“Often there may be unconscious patterns and biases present in the script that the writer may not intend, and a tool like this will help raise awareness of that.” Narayanan said.

Psychologists warn against catastrophising; a belief that problems will likely end up with the worst possible outcome. And scientists warn against anecdotalism; a belief that your experience explains what is happening in the world. Any discussion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) must keep in mind these three warnings.The rate at which AI will affect the job market will only accelerate, impacting the highly trained and poorly educated alike. While recognising the imminent danger of how jobs are likely to be disrupted, we can say that many key jobs are safe from AI because AI still lags humans in fields where niche human qualities like communication, empathy, creativity, strategic thinking, questioning, and dreaming matter. Jobs that can essentially be performed by humans have three key elements: STEM education, creativity, and emotional intelligence.Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will continue to remain important as the prevalence of robots and automated systems will mean an increased need for engineers, technicians, and managers to build, maintain, and control the quality of the work performed by mechanised labour. A McKinsey report shows that the number of engineering professionals like computer scientists, engineers, IT administrators, IT workers, and tech consultants will increase by 20 million to 50 million globally by 2030. These jobs, however, require staying up-to-date with technology and moving into areas that are not automated by technology. AI-focussed automation will create shifts in IT service requirements in such a way that jobs like research analysts, data entry operators, system engineers and test engineers become obsolete while newer roles such as research scientists, language processing specialists, robotic process automation developers, and man-machine teaming managers emerge.While humans are innately capable of recognizing images, interpreting languages, drawing inferences and differentiating objects, machines require an exhaustive dataset to learn and mimic such skills. These hubs could employ people with primitive computer literacy to generate training material for AI systems. And, of course, the demand for AI professionals will rise as more mundane and repetitive work gets automated. Gartner Research Company estimates that in the next few years, there will be an increase in the number of AI professionals despite some entry-level AI positions being automated.Industries like healthcare, education and hospitality and professions like management need strong communication skills, empathy, and the capacity to inspire or gain a person&#039;s confidence; these jobs require emotional intelligence, which only a human being can give. The medical fraternity can use AI for analytical and administrative aspects of healthcare and make it cost effective for people. Managers with good human interaction skills will continue to have jobs. Managerial work will continue to be carried by humans and AI may be used to manage performance. Teachers will remain relevant in the context of helping students figure out their interests, and providing one-on-one mentorship; AI can be a tool to design curriculum.The book The Globotics Upheaval by Richard Baldwin suggests that AI will disrupt lives more than globalisation, industrialisation and automation did. While he believes that the changes are inevitable, there are adaptive strategies that can be used, employing the skills that no machine can copy; creativity and independent thought.

Laura Montoya, Founder of Accel.AI and Latinx in AI Coalition
Vjosana Shkurti





It wasn’t long after Laura Montoya began working in artificial intelligence that she noticed a dire lack of diversity in the field. From boot camps to job opportunities, many AI spaces catered mostly to white men and people with enough educational resources to have earned advanced degrees.

Montoya, who studied biology and physical science at Eastern Michigan University, wanted to change that. “I decided if no one else has created a space for women, other minority groups, or people from non-traditional backgrounds to get into the space, why not me?” she says.
In 2016, she launched Accel.AI, a California nonprofit devoted to lowering the barriers to entry in engineering artificial intelligence. The organization hosts workshops and study sessions, provides learning resources, and also hosts a “Demystifying AI” symposium.
PROMOTED
According to Montoya, it can be difficult for minorities to feel empowered to enter the AI space when there are few public role models to whom they can relate.
Women, people of color, and LGBTQ individuals, she says, are not often given the recognition they deserve for their achievements. Right now, she is working with many universities in Latin America who have been working in AI and machine learning for years. “These researchers are just as highly skilled, just as technical, pure mathematicians,” she says. “They publish regularly, yet they don’t get the same accolades or recognition that people do coming out of well known universities, which is why we are doing the work we’re doing to increase representation and provide that recognition for them.”

Within Accel.AI, Montoya also runs an initiative called the Latinx in AI Coalition, dedicated specifically to increasing Latin American representation in AI. She created the coalition after observing the success of organizations like Black in AI and Women in Machine Learning that are devoted to uplifting specific groups. “I thought, being Latina myself, this is a great opportunity, and again, why not me?”
Montoya explains that her initiatives are crucial for a number of reasons. To start, technology is steadily replacing many lower-skilled jobs, which disproportionately affects minority communities. Displaced workers can find more opportunities in tech if they have access to training and resources.

Additionally, Montoya emphasizes, a lack of representation leads to biased technology. When the technology is created by one group of people, then inevitably, it will only represent that group. She cites examples of facial recognition technology only working on lighter skinned individuals.
“With tech and especially with AI,” she says, “It spreads so quickly and is evolving so rapidly, its effects are greater than anything else we’ve ever seen, and that’s why there is so much more concern.” Montoya remains passionate about tech , but she wants to ensure the advancements make a positive impact on the world.
Along her journey, Montoya has learned the importance of having a strong community by her side. When she launched Accel.AI, she wasn’t focused enough on that aspect. “I always carried the burden of being an entrepreneur independently. I wanted to shoulder all the risk myself.”
Montoya learned, however, that to find long-term success, she needed to surround herself with other leaders who felt as passionate about her mission as she did. “Having those other people that care as much as you do at seeing the organization prosper will make it grow not only for the long term but much faster and in a way that will benefit society,” she says.
As Accel.AI grows, Montoya only plans to get busier. She hopes to use what she’s learned to help launch other organizations with similar missions. She already acts as an advisor to startups in the industry and hopes to ultimately work in both nonprofit and for profit spaces of social impact and emerging technologies. As long as the focus is on using technology to improve society, Montoya wants to be part of it.

		With five robots handling basic docketing processes, the county is enhancing efficiency, converting skeptics and escalating staff to higher-value work — and higher pay.	




 









Florida’s Palm Beach County is keeping five recent recruits in the dark to boost productivity: The Lights-Out Court Document Processing project has five “robots” working 24/7 to process some of the thousands of documents the county court receives each week. It’s an example of how artificial intelligence and humans can work alongside one another — and shows how enterprises can enhance manual systems with AI.
Attorneys and other frequent filers at Palm Beach County Court are required to submit documents electronically, using a dedicated portal that’s available 24/7. Altogether, they file about 40,000 court documents a week this way, each of which must be docketed — that is, associated with the correct case, tagged and indexed so that it can be found in the court’s records.

It’s a laborious process, one that Sharon R. Bock, clerk and comptroller for Palm Beach County, saw as ripe for automation.











 
 
 
Bock, who oversees around 700 employees and a $70 million budget, is always looking for more efficient ways to perform statutory and constitutional duties. With payroll accounting for 95 percent of her spend, using automation technology to deal with some out-of-hours- filings and help staff do more during regular office hours was an obvious target.

Narrowing the field
The project, which received a 2019 Digital Edge 50 Award for digital innovation, was undertaken in collaboration with Florida software developer Computing System Innovations (CSI), which supplies the software the county uses to redact court documents. CSI developed a machine-learning system to automate the docketing and to access relevant court filings, says Cindy Guerra, the county’s chief operating officer for courts and official records, and the project’s business sponsor. “We used the same interface, so it was actually very seamless,” she says.
Palm Beach County first identified the teams that would work on the project, and the types of filings the county would entrust to the system. They chose to work with “documents that were very frequently docketed but did not pose a risk if something went wrong,” Guerra says.











 
 
 
They also aimed for documents that would allow the highest quality OCR (optical character recognition). “For that reason, we excluded anything coming from a pro se filer, or self-represented litigant, because those tend to be handwritten, and the OCR quality is not going to be as good,” Guerra says.
Those criteria narrowed the load to seven docket codes, three of which were selected to begin the project: notice of hearing, notice of taking a deposition, and notice of cancellation. None of these documents require further action, such as the court asking the clerk to issue a writ or a summons, nor do they involve money.
Training the new recruits
To train CSI’s machine learning software, the county’s business analysts worked with the employee with the most knowledge of the county’s processes and documents to index 500 to 600 documents of each type, extracting and tagging the relevant information from them.











 
 
 
The county set up five instances of CSI’s automated docketing software on its servers, giving them “human” names, with a hint of robot in each: Arnold Connor, Hal Isaac, Rosie Tober, Walley Bishop and Kitt Robbie. Documents processed by these robots are electronically stamped with their names rather than ‘docketed by a robot.’ Guerra jokes: “We didn’t want to alarm our judges.”

Ask




Once the software was trained, it was time to audit it.
“We don’t audit 100 percent of our humans, but we did audit 100 percent of the machines,” says Guerra. “I was 100 percent skeptical, that’s why we did 100 percent auditing.”  











 
 
 
The documents were presented to auditors in the same way, whether they had been processed by a robot or a human. The audit found that the machine learning system was 98 or 99 percent accurate with its three document codes, much better than humans.
“We were the first instance in using this type of software, so we were very apprehensive, and we didn’t know we could trust it. Now we know,” says Guerra. “Machine learning is more accurate than humans in that, once you teach the machine that it made an error, it will never ever make that error again. When we teach our clerks that they have made an error, sometimes it takes multiple trainings for them to actually get it right.”
After the project went live, Guerra received a call from a supervisor who had spotted a mistake in a docket. “She called up saying, ‘I can’t find the clerk who made this error, I can’t find her in our telephone list, her name is Walley Bishop.’ Well, we had to chuckle!” Guerra says. “It’s so seamless that it just looks like a clerk did it.”











 
 
 
Since the system went live in March 2018, it has been trained to read and process 26 docket codes and now dockets more than one in six electronically filed documents, with the goal of docketing more than one in three by July 2019.
Right now, the five robots are doing the docketing work of eight employees, and there’s capacity available to do the work of 19, says Guerra. To reach that, the robots would have to be retrained to deal with less common or more risky documents.
The impact of shifting to AI
Palm Beach County employees needn’t fear for their jobs, according to Bock. With robots available to do the work that is most repetitive and error-prone for humans, “We have been able to retrain our staff into more ‘thinking’ jobs,” she says. “We have also now raised the level, the career level, the experience level and the technical level of our employees so that we’ve now reclassified them into higher wages.”











 
 
 
That move to higher-paid roles has had the slight downside of eroding some of the cost benefits of increasing capacity through adding robots rather than more staff, says Bock, but “AI in our experience is actually allowing our workforce to move from a minimum wage environment for a certain group of people into not only a living wage but into a technical career that’s transferrable, that is exciting, that is thought-provoking.”
She expects that virtuous circle to continue as staff seize the opportunity to learn something new and see that their greater understanding allows for further innovation and the creation of new applications.
Other would-be adopters of AI shouldn’t expect instant results, though. This is not an off-the-shelf, plug-and-play product, Bock cautions. The project took several years from inception to completion, with CSI and county staff working together a lot of the way. “[Guerra’s] deep distrust as the business sponsor is one of the reasons that we were successful,” she says. “Setting up the auditing team meant that we caught the mistakes and retaught, taught, retaught.”











 
 
 
Looking to the future, Guerra wants to start working with more risky documents, “Those that require further actions, so that the machine can learn to make those further actions whether it’s email someone, prepare a writ or prepare a summons,” she says. Another goal is to have the robots issue receipts for documents submitted with payment.
Meanwhile, Bock hopes that the system, currently dealing only with civil filings, can be extended into the criminal segment.
Visitors from the Federal Bankruptcy Court have come to look at the system, and Bock and Guerra both hope other courts will adopt lights-out document processing too. “As other counties in the state of Florida go online, we benefit from the work that they do,” Bock says.











 
 
 
Bock, a lawyer by training, concludes: “This is the most exciting thing I’ve ever done in the 27 years of my career.”

""With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), many HR tasks can be handled more efficiently to increase employee satisfaction drastically,"" says Joanna who is in <a href=""https://www.therfpsuccesscompany.com"">rfp consulting</a> for The RFP Success Company.

<a href=""http://www.atlanta-business-directory.com"">Many companies</a> have already taken steps to utilize AI in their human resources departments. You may find their experiences inspirational enough to consider making AI an integral part of your company’s human resources operation.
<h2>Artificial Intelligence Makes Recruiting A Breeze.</h2>
With AI technology, online information can be collected from the candidate’s entire online presence, then that information can be used in to rank the candidates you will eventually choose from.

By using this technology in this hiring process, candidates can be ranked based on the desired experience, salary expectations, work history, and skills.
<h2>Using AI to Engage With Candidates</h2>
For candidates applying for a position, it can be disheartening to not receive any type of response or have any sort of interaction with the employer after they apply. Artificial intelligence can use systems like <a href=""https://www.hubspot.com/"">Hubspot</a> to engage the candidate in a way that feels more natural than an automated email.

With AI, the messages and responses a candidate receives can be more personal and unique to the candidate, encouraging a more positive overall experience.
<h2>Onboarding New Hires With AI</h2>
Many organizations are also exploring AI to help new hires acclimate to their new positions. Artificial intelligence can help by answering questions, providing information, and sharing resources to familiarize the employee with the company’s culture, policies, and systems.

Given the magnitude of information new employees are asked to digest in the first few days on the job, AI can provide information and education reinforcement to help employees retain relevant information.
<h2>Chatbots For Employees to Access Information</h2>
Chatbots are a specific type of artificial intelligence technology that can be especially useful for employees. Communicating via text, chatbots can answer standard employee questions. Employees can use chatbots to ask about paid-time-off policies, absences, open enrollment, and more.
<h2>Artificial Intelligence to Automate Administrative Tasks</h2>
Administrative tasks like managing payrolls and compliance and examining performance review information are arguably the most laborious <a href=""https://www.humanresourcesedu.org/hr-specialist/"">HR duties</a>. By assigning these tedious tasks to AI, a significant amount of time and effort can instead be spent on employee training and workplace improvements.

An additional benefit to using AI for payroll and compliance management is the technology’s accuracy. AI can easily handle large pieces of information and can be relied on to perform tasks entirely error-free.
<h2>AI Personal Assistants Designed to Help Businesses</h2>
‘Amy Ingram’ is an AI personal assistant that can effectively perform a variety of tasks. Amy was made by <a href=""https://x.ai"">x.ai</a> and takes the hassle out of scheduling appointments and meetings. Amy is even able to write emails that sound so natural, you would think a human wrote them.

‘Leena AI’ is another AI assistant that can build HR chatbots that are able to answer employee questions. Leena can work with most collaboration apps and saves HR managers from having to dedicate time to inform employees about company policies.

According to <a href=""https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/ten-ways-hr-tech-leaders-can-make-artificial-intelligence/"">Personnel Today</a>, 38% of organizations are already using AI at work, while 62% are expecting to use it in the near future. Given the role that technology already takes in our personal lives, it’s no wonder that it’s beginning to ooze into the workplace.

THE advent of Artificial Intelligence is entering the economic stage through the back-door but many feel that it is so powerful that we can only ignore its influence at our own peril. It is no minnow.
Experts predict that it in ten years it will underpin $15.7 trillion of global economic growth. Some fear it will wreck job opportunities and create mass unemployment in certain sectors yet others are less sanguine and think that it simply transforms current jobs and create new ones.
The McKinsey Global Institute reckons that by 2030 up to 375m people, or 14% of the global workforce, could have their jobs automated away. Bosses will need to decide whether they are prepared to offer and pay for retraining, and whether they will give time off for it. Many companies feel sympathetic towards the need for workers to develop new skills, but mass education is the remit of national governments and should not come about at the employer’s expense.
This is debateable, since less advanced countries do not have the resources to train workers to reach the higher technical skills required once the AI revolution becomes mainstream. Technological change always causes disruption, but AI is likely to have a bigger impact than anything since the advent of computers, and its consequences could be far more disruptive. Being both powerful and relatively cheap, it will spread faster than computers did and influence many sectors.
Another important question is how to protect privacy as AI spreads. The internet has already made it possible to track people’s digital behaviour in minute detail. There is little doubt that in the coming years, AI will offer even smarter tools for businesses to monitor consumers behaviours, both online and in the physical world.
This may become a threat to privacy. A corollary of AI is machine learning. One can explain this as autonomous learning capacity which empowers a machine to learn by its own without being explicitly programmed. It is a subset of AI, that provides the underlying system with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience.
Today, many US firms are competing to provide AI-enhanced tools to companies. As can be expected, millions are invested to develop new technologies and companies that achieve a major breakthrough in artificial intelligence could easily race ahead of rivals and toughen global competition.
More likely, in the years ahead AI might contribute to the rise of monopolies in industries outside the tech sector where there used to be dynamic markets, eventually stifling innovation and consumer choice. The fear is that smart computer programs will eliminate millions of
jobs, condemning a generation to minimum-wage drudgery or enforced idleness. Never mind the robots, fear the software.
But real-life experience has shown otherwise. For example, the arrival of automated teller machines (ATMs) spared bank employees the job of handling out cash and freed them to offer financial advice to customers.
Obviously, some jobs could be made a lot easier by AI. One example is taxi drivers. Some fear that taxi drivers will be replaced by autonomous vehicles. But in future taxis will still be manned particularly when needed in town to manoeuvre around busy streets which is far harder than driving long distances down the motorway. Interesting advances powered by AI are happening across many medical areas.
Other potential uses of AI, is to detect cyberattacks, or coordinate fleets of drones, in hospitals and where many people congregate it is useful for mass surveillance through facial recognition. Furthermore, increased automation gives more physical control to digital systems, which in turn makes cyberattacks even more dangerous.
Regulation is needed to ensure that AI engineers are employing best practices in fighting cybersecurity and limiting the intrusion of cyber thieves especially in banks and sensitive data centres.
The fusion of AI and Blockchain systems will further enlarge the arsenal with tools for fighting cybercrime and make DLT databases tamper proof. To give an example, when any, say transaction, is recorded on blockchain, that transaction is made known throughout the chain connecting users’ to each other.
Therefore, it is not possible to tamper with a blockchain, which is why trust is built into the system rather than guaranteed by a ‘central owner’ of the data. Thus, this powerful technology is silently ushering the fourth industrial revolution. It will allow individuals to regain control of their own data, such as medical health or education
records, and use it in ways that would not have been possible in the past. Blockchain and DLT technology will improve the tracking of intellectual property rights, as well as strengthen the concept of ownership in the digital sphere.
Having discussed briefly the uses of AI, one may ask if and how can tiny Malta ever partake of this success story. The answer is blowing in the wind as it so happens that Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has called for a global framework for regulating research into, and the development of, artificial intelligence technologies when last year he addressed a top conference in Shanghai China.
AI, the internet of things and a best-in-class regulatory framework are now high on the government’s agenda, following the successful introduction of the world’s first comprehensive set of blockchain laws last year.
Castille is smelling the coffee and the penny has dropped to lay the foundations for a digital innovation hub. The fly in the ointment is having superlative technical facilities to train a workforce with the right skills. It is a tall order, since millions are needed to train a workforce proficient in AI.
But it is never too late to start. Government recently announced the funding of a scholarship bourse for post-graduate degrees, as well as hosting a lab to encourage the exploration of emerging technologies.
One looks forward with courage to the next Delta Summit this year sponsored by the government with the hope that it will attract tech-evangelists and AI engineers to help us build a local ecosystem. One augurs this fulfils the vision of the prime minister and hallmarks his legacy at a time when he is rumoured to be contemplating his exit from the political stage.

These technologies are referred to as “emotion AI.” Emotion AI is a subset of artificial intelligence (the broad term for machines replicating the way humans think) that measures, understands, simulates, and reacts to human emotions. It’s also known as affective computing, or artificial emotional intelligence. The field dates back to at least 1995, when MIT Media lab professor Rosalind Picard published “Affective Computing.”
Javier Hernandez, a research scientist with the Affective Computing Group at the MIT Media Lab, explains emotion AI as a tool that allows for a much more natural interaction between humans and machines.“Think of the way you interact with other human beings; you look at their faces, you look at their body, and you change your interaction accordingly,” Hernandez said. “How can [a machine] effectively communicate information if it doesn’t know your emotional state, if it doesn’t know how you’re feeling, it doesn’t know how you’re going to respond to specific content?”


The paradigm is not human versus machine — it's really machine augmenting human.

While humans might currently have the upper hand on reading emotions, machines are gaining ground using their own strengths. Machines are very good at analyzing large amounts of data, explained MIT Sloan professor Erik Brynjolfsson. They can listen to voice inflections and start to recognize when those inflections correlate with stress or anger. Machines can analyze images and pick up subtleties in micro-expressions on humans’ faces that might happen even too fast for a person to recognize.
“We have a lot of neurons in our brain for social interactions. We’re born with some of those skills, and then we learn more. It makes sense to use technology to connect to our social brains, not just our analytical brains.” Brynjolfsson said. “Just like we can understand speech and machines can communicate in speech, we also understand and communicate with humor and other kinds of emotions. And machines that can speak that language — the language of emotions — are going to have better, more effective interactions with us. It's great that we’ve made some progress; it’s just something that wasn’t an option 20 or 30 years ago, and now it’s on the table.”
Which industries are already using emotion AI?
Advertising — In 2009, Rana el Kaliouby, PhD ’06, and Picard founded Affectiva, an emotion AI company based in Boston, which specializes in automotive AI and advertising research — the latter for 25 percent of the Fortune 500 companies.
“Our technology captures these visceral, subconscious reactions, which we have found correlates very strongly with actual consumer behavior, like sharing the ad or actually buying the product,” el Kaliouby said.
In the case of advertising research, once a client has been vetted and agreed to the terms of Affectiva’s use (like promising not to exploit the technology for surveillance or lie detection) the client is given access to Affectiva’s technology. With a customer’s consent, the technology uses the person’s phone or laptop camera to capture their reactions while watching a particular advertisement.
Self-reporting — like feedback during a test group — is helpful, el Kaliouby said, but getting a moment by moment response allows marketers to really tell if a particular ad resonated with people or was offensive, or if it was confusing or struck a heartstring.
Call centers — Technology from Cogito, a company co-founded in 2007 by MIT Sloan alumni, helps call center agents identify the moods of customers on the phone and adjust how they handle the conversation in real time. Cogito’s voice-analytics software is based on years of human behavior research to identify voice patterns.
Mental health —  In December 2018 Cogito launched a spinoff called CompanionMx, and an accompanying mental health monitoring app. The Companion app listens to someone speaking into their phone, and analyzes the speaker’s voice and phone use for signs of anxiety and mood changes.
The app improves users' self-awareness, and can increase coping skills including steps for stress reduction. The company has worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston.
Another emotion AI-driven technology for mental health is a wearable device developed at the MIT Media Lab that monitors a person’s heartbeat to tell whether they are experiencing something like stress, pain, or frustration. The monitor then releases a scent to help the wearer adjust to the negative emotion they’re having at that moment.

Media Lab researchers also built an algorithm using phone data and a wearable device, that predicts varying degrees of depression.
Automotive — Hernandez, the Media Lab researcher, is currently working on a team putting emotion AI into vehicles.
While much attention has been paid to safety in the environment outside of a car, inside there a range of distractions that can impact safety. Consider a car that could tell if a driver was arguing with the passenger next to them, based on elevated blood pressure, and adjust the speed of the distracted operator. Or a sensor that signaled the steering wheel to subtly maneuver the car into the middle of the lane, after a sleep-deprived driver unknowingly is listing to the curb.
Affectiva has a similar automotive AI service of its own, which monitors a driver’s state and occupants’ experiences to improve road safety and the occupant experience.
Assistive services — Some people with autism find it challenging to communicate emotionally. That’s where emotion AI can be a sort of “assistive technology,” Hernandez said. Wearable monitors can pick up on subtleties in facial expressions or body language in someone with autism (like an elevated pulse rate) that others might not be able to see.
Hernandez said there are also “communicative prostheses” that help autistic people learn how to read other’s facial expressions. One example is a game in which the person uses the camera on a tablet to identify “smiley” or “frowny” faces on the people around them.
“That is a way for them to engage with other people and also learn how facial expressions work,” Hernandez said, adding that this video technology that measures moods in “smiley” or “frowny” faces could work for customer feedback in crowded theme parks or hospital waiting rooms, or could be used to provide anonymous feedback to upper management in a large office.
Is emotion AI something to welcome or to worry about?
Hernandez recommended any business interested in applying this technology needs to promote a healthy discussion — one that includes its benefits and what is possible with the technology, and how to use it in private ways.
“What I tell companies is think about what aspects of emotional intelligence should play a critical role in your business,” Hernandez said. “If you were to have that emotional interaction, how would that change, can you use technology for that?”
El Kaliouby said she sees potential in expanding the technology to new use cases, for example,  using the call center technology to understand the emotional well-being of employees, or for other mental health uses. But concern over coming off as Big Brother is a legitimate worry, and one that will have to be continuously addressed within the scope of privacy and this technology. To that point, el Kaliouby said that Affectiva requires opt-in and consent for all use cases of its technology.
Another thing to keep in mind is that the technology is only as good as its programmer.
Brynjolfsson warned as these technologies are rolled out, they need to be appropriate for all people, not just sensitive to the subset of the population used for training.
“For instance, recognizing emotions in an African American face sometimes can be difficult for a machine that’s trained on Caucasian faces,” Brynjolfsson said. “And some of the gestures or voice inflections in one culture may mean something very different in a different culture.”
Overall, what’s important to remember is that when it’s used thoughtfully, the ultimate benefits of the technology can and should be greater than the cost, Brynjolfsson said, a sentiment echoed by el Kaliouby, who said it is possible to integrate the technology in a thoughtful way.“The paradigm is not human versus machine — it's really machine augmenting human,” she said. “It's human plus machine.”

Technology will bring a dramatic shift in our lives. But how can we guarantee that we will benefit from it?Elisa Camorani·FollowPublished inDataDrivenInvestor·7 min read·Mar 10, 20192ListenShareAI revolution is clearly different from the previous industrial revolution. The introduction of machinery should have improved our lives by delegating work to appliances, but it actually boosted a way of living where the distinction between private life and work is blurred. According to the most recent futurist predictions, AI, instead, will give us the possibility to experience a new form of life, endued with more time for ourselves, which frees us from obligations, such as physically intense, stressful works.However, there is an important matter to consider. In a society where algorithms will be in charge of the most important decisions, can we still define ourselves as free? Which regulations and limits should we implement upon AI, to be sure that we will gain more freedom, and we will not be ‘dominated by machines’?4 Books that Challenge Your View on Artificial Intelligence and Society - Data Driven InvestorDeep learning, robots thinking like humans, artificial intelligence, neural networks- these technologies have sparked…www.datadriveninvestor.comIn my opinion, the answer to this question depends on which philosophical concept of freedom the reader bears in mind. In this essay, I will discuss two notions of freedom, and how AI will indeed provide us with it.Ultimately, I will examine potential concerns regarding political reality and cultural transformation.First of all, it is essential to consider the changes that will occur in our society, due to technological development.Artificial Intelligence is already being widely employed, and its applications are likely to expand further, both affecting work life and governance.In fact, AI ends the era of specialists. Nowadays, data analysis and machine learning are capable of quickly evaluating the course of actions, by assigning risks scores and comparing the outcomes of each choice.Data analysis predictions always take into consideration a greater number of factors, possible consequences, and longer time perspectives than any human assessment could ever do. Therefore, the cost-benefit analysis developed by algorithms will always turn out to be more efficient.For this reason, AI already manages many operations in companies and government.For instance, forms of AI, such as social media control and prediction of individual behaviour for crime prevention, highlight terrorist activity and major threats to national security where intervention is required.AI, through drones and geo-maps, coordinates disaster response worldwide, and monitors the optimal allocation of social welfare funding, which guarantees social and economic sustainability. AI plays a fundamental role in public healthcare as well, by auditing statistics on diseases’ conditions, providing preventive diagnosis and planning treatments.Other examples that could be added to this list: urban planning, financial fraud prevention and analysis, and law enforcement are just some of the most developed branches of AI.In sum, it is clear that AI can substitute the role of governance. The only actions needed are collecting data and setting short-, medium- and long-term goals. After that, AI will basically indicate to us the best path towards such goals.Working life will be revolutionised in the same way. We are already witnessing the use of AI in many job fields: not only manufacturing but also farming, financial services, healthcare, and retail.For this reason, a transatlantic network of thinkers is currently advocating a profoundly different future for countries, which offers alluring promises: a life with much less work, or no work at all, calmer, more equal, more communal, more pleasurable, more thoughtful, more fulfilled. Even though this post-work forecast still present issues, it is not perceived anymore as a utopia.Will we really be free however, in a future where robots work for us, decide how to allocate funds, and how to manage firms and regulate international policy relations?The technological revolution, if properly governed, will endow us with freedom for two reasons.First, AI-based societies could finally provide each of us with the basic opportunities to plan the life we desire. Secondly, it will donate us the most precious resource we are always running out of: time.The first statement recalls the concept of freedom discussed by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, and the republican freedom as non-domination by Philip Pettit.According to the ‘human development approach’, society should ensure a minimum threshold of capabilities and leave the decision about whether to exercise them, or not, in the hands of the public. For instance, a good society should give everyone the possibility to live a healthy life. Then, each individual should be free to decide if he or she wants to live in a healthy or unhealthy way without judgement being passed upon them.As the Human Development Index clearly demonstrates, the minimum threshold of capabilities can be defined quantitatively. Statistics and ciphers can tell us when a life can be considered of ‘normal length’ and ‘healthy.’ Once again, we see the relevance of data. Data can measure if fundamental human rights are respected. It is important to note, that anything, which can be translated into data, is part of the language of artificial intelligence.My outlook assumes that any individual, that lives in a society where the fundamental rights are guaranteed and is able to live the way he wants, can be considered free.Consequently, algorithms can play a great role in securing freedom. The minimum threshold can be translated as the score AI needs to achieve: the best options, in order to accomplish the result, will be clearly pointed out.AI intervention however, must be limited to the social sphere. The role of AI should be committed to ensuring equal possibilities for the well-being of everyone in society.Therefore, it should deal with decisions at a global or national level, without interfering with private life. The resulting freedom can be understood as non-arbitrary interference.The second hypothesis states that by gaining time, we will gain freedom.Thanks to AI, we will have more time for ourselves, to rediscover humanities. We will hence be free — free from duties and free to focus on what makes us different from robots: social relations, creativity, and innovation. To do this, humans will need to nurture those features that distinguish them from robotics. Forecasts and futurologist analysis state that aspects such as philosophy, art, artisanal work, and social relations will be reawakened, due to the time we will have available. Our technological future will be all about humanity, instead of technology.The increasing deployment of AI will not revolutionise citizens’ role in political reality, but will bring meaningful cultural changes to society.Possible concerns, in fact, could question what will be the role left for us in policymaking. Will it just become a matter of setting targets and delegate their achievement to tools that function better than us?This might sound unacceptable. Nonetheless, I estimate it as equivalent to our present-day situation.In the current elective system, participation is minimal. Representation does not promote direct civic engagement. Democracy is perceived as the possibility to choose who will decide for us — selecting the representative whose ‘menu of proposal’ better suits our interests — and not as first-hand involvement in political reality.Moreover, global matters are becoming too complex to be handled by singular individuals.Therefore, it would be more efficient to leave such decision-making processes to the best specialist we can employ — artificial intelligence.Finally, futurist predictions look at the skills to develop in such an environment. They will be no more that of specialist narrow knowledge, but lateral thinking, inventiveness, originality. Being able to think, to criticise, to formulate your own opinion. Will this mean that we will be intellectually free, not dominated by any kind of ideology or common sense?To conclude, the future can be positive for us, if we welcome Artificial Intelligence in the proper way.We are being given the chance to achieve human emancipation through technology.Irrational fears such as machine domination must not blind us towards this opportunity. We must remember that the concept of ‘seeking power over another’ is solely human.We will be able to forget the continuous pressure we perceive because of time, and we will have to rely more on our inner human features.Nevertheless, there are many other implications, and possible threats, posed by the employment of AI, that I will not discuss here.Here is my final question that I would like to conclude with: if we suppose this scenario will become true, will humans be able to handle the amount of freedom they are given? Will we dedicate ourselves to humanities, or will we come up with new alleged problems, or works, or obligations, because, after all, we need our life to be ruled?Please, feel free to comment and share your opinions about this topic.",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,Will Artificial Intelligence provide us with more freedom?,2019-03-10T18:55:42.818Z,2021-12-08T21:38:16.933Z,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Elisa Camorani', 'url': 'https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/@elisacamorani5'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'DataDrivenInvestor', 'url': 'medium.datadriveninvestor.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 308, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:616/1*OMF3fSqH8t4xBJ9-6oZDZw.png'}}",['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*gUrZFqqMV5CXYW1HKzwVzg.jpeg'],https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/will-artificial-intelligence-provide-us-with-more-freedom-2315e6ea8a72,,https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/will-artificial-intelligence-provide-us-with-more-freedom-2315e6ea8a72,,,,,,,,Will Artificial Intelligence provide us with more freedom?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-03-10T18:55:42.818Z,,,2315e6ea8a72,['Elisa Camorani'],,,,,

Humans and machines can improve accuracy when they work together

										 by Davide Valeriani, 										 										 The Conversation

Whether artificial intelligence systems steal humans' jobs or create new work opportunities, people will need to work together with them.





In my research I use sensors and computers to monitor how the brain itself processes decision-making. Together with another brain-computer interface scholar, Riccardo Poli, I looked at one example of possible human-machine collaboration – situations when police and security staff are asked to keep a lookout for a particular person, or people, in a crowded environment, such as an airport.
It seems like a straightforward request, but it is actually really hard to do. A security officer has to monitor several surveillance cameras for many hours every day, looking for suspects. Repetitive tasks like these are prone to human errors.
Some people suggest these tasks should be automated, as machines do not get bored, tired or distracted over time. However, computer vision algorithms tasked to recognize faces could also make mistakes. As my research has found, together, machines and humans could do much better.






Two types of artificial intelligence
We have developed two AI systems that could help identify target faces in crowded scenes. The first is a facial recognition algorithm. It analyzes images from a security camera, identifies which parts of the images are faces and compares those faces with an image of the person that is sought. When it identifies a match, this algorithm also reports how sure it is of that decision.

The second system is a brain-computer interface that uses sensors on a person's scalp, looking for neural activity related to confidence in decisions.
We conducted an experiment with 10 human participants, showing each of them 288 pictures of crowded indoor environments. Each picture was shown for only 300 milliseconds – about as long as it takes an eye to blink – after which the person was asked to decide whether or not they had seen a particular person's face. On average, they were able to correctly discriminate between images with and without the target in 72 percent of the images.
When our entirely autonomous AI system performed the same tasks, it correctly classified 84 percent of the images.
Human-AI collaboration
All the humans and the standalone algorithm were seeing the same images, so we sought to improve the decision-making by combining the actions of more than one of them at a time.
To merge several decisions into one, we weighted individual responses by decision confidence – the algorithm's self-estimated confidence, and the measurements from the humans' brain readings, transformed with a machine-learning algorithm. We found that an average group of just humans, regardless of how large the group was, did better than the average human alone – but was less accurate than the algorithm alone.





                Factoring humans’ decisions, and confidence level in those choices, together with algorithmic judgments, yields a more accurate result than people or machines can deliver independently. Credit: Davide Valeriani and Eleonora Adami, CC BY-ND
 


However, groups that included at least five people and the algorithm were statistically significantly better than humans or machine alone.
Keeping people in the loop
Pairing people with computers is getting easier. Accurate computer vision and image processing software programs are common in airports and other situations. Costs are dropping for consumer systems that read brain activity, and they provide reliable data.
Working together can also help address concerns about the ethics and bias of algorithmic decisions, as well as legal questions about accountability.
In our study, the humans were less accurate than the AI. However, the brain-computer interfaces observed that the people were more confident about their choices than the AI was. Combining those factors offered a useful mix of accuracy and confidence, in which humans usually influenced the group decision more than the automated system did. When there is no agreement between humans and AI, it is ethically simpler to let humans decide.
Our study has found a way in which machines and algorithms do not have to – and in fact should not – replace humans. Rather, they can work together with people to find the best of all possible outcomes.

By Bill Snyder | March 11, 2019FacebookXLinkedInRedditPinterestShareArtificial intelligence will shift jobs, not replace them. | Reuters/Issei Kato
Some good news: The robots aren’t coming for your job. Experts at the Conference on the Future of Work at Stanford University last month said that fears that rapid advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation will leave all of us unemployed are vastly overstated.
But concerns over growing inequality and the lack of opportunity for many in the labor force — serious matters linked to a variety of structural changes in the economy — are well-founded and need to be addressed, four scholars on artificial intelligence and the economy told an audience at Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB).
That’s not to say that AI isn’t having a profound effect on many areas of the economy. It is, of course. But understanding the link between the two trends is difficult, and it’s easy to make misleading assumptions about the kinds of jobs that are in danger of becoming obsolete.
“Most jobs are more complex than [many people] realize,” said Hal Varian, Google’s chief economist, during the forum, which was sponsored by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.
Today’s workforce is sharply divided by levels of education, and those who have not gone beyond high school are affected the most by long-term changes in the economy, said David Autor, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“It’s a great time to be young and educated. But there’s no clear land of opportunity” for adults who haven’t been to college, said Autor during his keynote presentation.

When predicting future labor market outcomes, it is important to consider both sides of the supply-and-demand equation, said Varian, founding dean of the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. Most popular discussion around technology focuses on factors that decrease demand for labor by replacing workers with machines.
However, demographic trends that point to a substantial decrease in the supply of labor are potentially larger in magnitude, he said. Demographic trends are also easier to predict, since we already know, aside from immigration and catastrophes, how many 40-year-olds will live in a country 30 years from now.
Comparing the most aggressive expert estimates about the impact of automation on labor supply with demographic trends that point to a workforce reduction, Varian said he found that the demographic effect on the labor market is 53% larger than the automation effect. Thus, real wages are more likely to increase than to decrease when both factors are considered.
Automation’s slow crawl
Why hasn’t automation had a more significant effect on the economy to date? The answer isn’t simple, but there’s one key factor: Jobs are made up of a myriad of tasks, many of which are not easily automated.
“Automation doesn’t generally eliminate jobs,” Varian said. “Automation generally eliminates dull, tedious, and repetitive tasks. If you remove all the tasks, you remove the job. But that’s rare.”
Consider the job of a gardener. Gardeners have to mow and water a lawn, prune rose bushes, rake leaves, eradicate pests, and perform a variety of other chores. Mowing and watering are easy tasks to automate, but other chores would cost too much to automate or would be beyond the capabilities of machines — so gardeners are still in demand.


Automation doesn’t generally eliminate jobs. Automation generally eliminates dull, tedious, and repetitive tasks. If you remove all the tasks, you remove the job. But that’s rare. –Hal Varian, chief economist, Google


Some jobs, including within the service industry, seem ripe for automation. However, a hotel in Nagasaki, Japan, was the subject of amused news reports when it was forced to “fire” its incompetent robot receptionists and room attendants.
Jobs, unlike repetitive tasks, tend not to disappear. In 1950, the U.S. Census Bureau listed 250 separate jobs. Since then, the only one to be completely eliminated is that of elevator operator, Varian observed. But some of the tasks carried out by elevator operators, such as greeting visitors and guiding them to the right office, have been distributed to receptionists and security guards.
Even the automotive industry, which accounts for roughly half of all robots used by industry, has found that automation has its limits.
“Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated,” Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of Tesla Motors, said last year.

The pace of jobs change
Technology has always changed rapidly, and that’s certainly the case today. However, there’s often a lag between the time a new machine or process is invented and when it reverberates in the workplace.
“The workplace isn’t evolving as fast as we thought it would,” Paul Oyer, a Stanford GSB professor of economics and senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, said during a panel discussion at the forum. “I thought the gig economy would take over, but it hasn’t. And I thought that by now people would find their ideal mates and jobs online, but that was wrong too.”
Consider the leap from steam power to electric power. When electricity first became available, some factories replaced single large steam engines on the factory floor with a single electric motor. That didn’t make a significant change to the nature of factory work, says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. But when machinery throughout the factory was electrified, work changed radically.

The rise of the service sector
Employment in some sectors in which employees tend to have less education is still strong, particularly the service sector. As well-paid professionals settle in cities, they create a demand for services and new types of jobs. MIT’s Autor called these occupations “wealth work jobs,” which include employment for everything from baristas to horse exercisers.
The 10 most common occupations in the U.S. include such jobs as retail salespersons, office clerks, nurses, waiters, and other service-focused work. Notably, traditional occupations, such as factory and other blue-collar work, no longer make the list.
Looming over all of the changes to the labor force is the stark fact that birth rates in the U.S. are at an all-time low, said Varian. As has been widely reported, the aging of the baby boom generation creates demand for service jobs but leaves fewer workers actively contributing labor to the economy.
Even so, the U.S. workforce is in much better shape than other industrialized countries. The so-called dependency ratio — the proportion of people over 65 compared with every 100 people of working age — will be much higher in Japan, Spain, South Korea, Germany, and Italy by 2050. And not coincidentally, said Varian, countries with high dependency ratios are looking the hardest at automating jobs.
As the country ages, society will have to find new, more efficient ways to train and expand the workforce, said the panelists. They will also have to better accommodate the growing number of women in the workforce, many of whom are still held back by family and household responsibilities.
The robots may not be taking over just yet, but advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning will eventually become more of a challenge to the workforce. Still, it’s heartening to be reminded that, for now, “humans are underrated.”

These solutions require advanced infrastructures and an ecosystem of thriving innovators. How does that affect countries around the world, and especially developing nations? Should AI be a priority to tackle in order to reduce the digital and social divide?These are some of the questions explored in a Working Paper entitled ‘Artificial Intelligence in Education: Challenges and Opportunities for Sustainable Development’ presented by UNESCO and ProFuturo at Mobile Learning Week 2019. It features cases studies on how AI technology is helping education systems use data to improve educational equity and quality.Concrete examples from countries such as China, Brazil and South Africa are examined on AI’s contribution to learning outcomes, access to education and teacher support. Case studies from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Bhutan and Chile are presented on how AI is helping with data analytics in education management.  The Paper also explores the curriculum and standards dimension of AI, with examples from the European Union, Singapore and the Republic of Korea on how learners and teachers are preparing for an AI-saturated world.Beyond the opportunities, the Paper also addresses the challenges and policy implications of introducing AI in education and preparing students for an AI-powered future. The challenges presented revolve around:Developing a comprehensive view of public policy on AI for sustainable development: The complexity of the technological conditions needed to advance in this field require the alignment of multiple factors and institutions. Public policies have to work in partnership at international and national levels to create an ecosystem of AI that serves sustainable development.Ensuring inclusion and equity for AI in education: The least developed countries are at risk of suffering new technological, economic and social divides with the development of AI. Some main obstacles such as basic technological infrastructure must be faced to establish the basic conditions for implementing new strategies that take advantage of AI to improve learning.Preparing teachers for an AI-powered education: Teachers must learn new digital skills to use AI in a pedagogical and meaningful way and AI developers must learn how teachers work and create solutions that are sustainable in real-life environments.Developing quality and inclusive data systems: If the world is headed towards the datafication of education, the quality of data should be the main chief concern. It´s essential to develop state capabilities to improve data collection and systematization. AI developments should be an opportunity to increase the importance of data in educational system management.Enhancing research on AI in education: While it can be reasonably expected that research on AI in education will increase in the coming years, it is nevertheless worth recalling the difficulties that the education sector has had in taking stock of educational research in a significant way both for practice and policy-making.Dealing with ethics and transparency in data collection, use and dissemination: AI opens many ethical concerns regarding access to education system, recommendations to individual students, personal data concentration, liability, impact on work, data privacy and ownership of data feeding algorithms. AI regulation will require public discussion on ethics, accountability, transparency and security.The key discussions taking place at Mobile Learning Week 2019 address these challenges, offering the international educational community, governments and other stakeholders a unique opportunity to explore together the opportunities and threats of AI in all areas of education.Download the working paperShare                             Copied to clipboard More on this subject   Event Sixth International Conference on Learning Cities3 December 2024 - 5 December 2024     Event UNESCO International Forum on the Futures of Education 20242 December 2024 - 4 December 2024     Event Global Network of Learning Cities webinar ‘Shifting paradigms: fostering sustainable lifestyles and rethinking our relationship with nature’20 November 2024     Event Global Media and Information Literacy Week Feature Conference 202430 October 2024 - 31 October 2024  Other recent news   News Celebrating Youth’s Power in Safeguarding Traditional Building Skills16 July 2024     News UNESCO funds fire prevention efforts at the World Heritage site Los Alerces National Park, Argentina15 July 2024     News Summer Schools 2024: Ocean Literacy from the Tremiti Islands to Malmö via the Dolomite15 July 2024     News UNESCO joins hands with Tanzania to celebrate 2024 World Kiswahili Language Day15 July 2024   ",https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'The challenges and opportunities of Artificial Intelligence in education', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'representativeOfPage': 'True', 'url': 'https://www.unesco.org/sites/default/files/ai_in_education_policy_paper.jpg', 'width': '708', 'height': '368'}, 'datePublished': '2023-04-20T16:56:50+0200', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'True', 'dateModified': '2023-04-20T16:56:50+0200', 'mainEntityOfPage': 'https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/challenges-and-opportunities-artificial-intelligence-education'}, {'@type': 'Event', 'eventAttendanceMode': 'MixedEventAttendanceMode', 'location': {'@type': 'Place', 'address': {'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': ''}}}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amit Dua23 StoriesFriday March 08, 2019 , 7 min ReadAs a concept, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around for decades. However, it was in the last 20 years that the successful application of Machine Learning (ML) enabled the boom of AI. The ability of a machine to perform cognitive functions associated with the human mind, AI is used everywhere from Siri conversing with a user to IBM Watson’s autonomous weaponry. AI for businessToday, AI has begun to infiltrate board rooms and engage the workforce. It is helping employees manage their time better and add strategic value to the business. It includes a range of capabilities that can solve several business problems. In fact, AI has the potential to make a tectonic shift in the efficiency and productivity of various industries by introducing full-scale automation for tedious, time-consuming tasks and augmenting various human capabilities and functions. According to a new McKinsey Global Survey, most organisations are implementing AI devices across their standard business processes or are at least contemplating it. However, the adoption of AI is still in its nascent stages. Roughly 30 percent of the respondents of the McKinsey survey claimed to pilot the use of AI. Many others are exploring ways of utilising it to improve their productivity, ease and efficiency. The organisations already using AI have confirmed that it has resulted in a progressive transformation of their core processes such as manufacturing, marketing, human resources, etc. The relevance and scope of AI in HR TechHR is one of the core functions of any organisation. AI adoption can spell transformation for this function too. A Deloitte survey confirmed that 40 percent of respondent companies were using some form of AI in HR. However, the benefits are not immediate in nature.

Some of them are already being witnessed while others are expected with growing investments in AI and its adoption. A growing number of startups are providing AI-based technology and services to HR functions for various activities. Some of the key ways in which AI can play a significant role in HR technology are given below:1. Talent managementEvery organisation has human capital needs and talent management refers to the organisational planning done to meet the workforce needs. As part of it, HR undertakes activities such as talent acquisition, employee management, performance management, succession management, etc. For example, organisations like Greenhouse Software are integrating IBM-AI capabilities through the IBM Watson Candidate Assistant, a suite of AI-powered tools that matches jobs to the candidates and vice-versa based on their personalities, skills and interest areas. Greenhouse collects candidate data through various funnels including social media. For example, it would observe minute details such as whether an employee submitted their work sample through LinkedIn or Glassdoor. It maintains scorecards for all the employees based on its own analysis with zero human intervention. This helps the interviewers sort through the applications ahead of time and keep the talent funnel ready.2. RecruitmentAI helps companies through the process of pre-hire assessments. While assessments are nothing new, in the era of AI, a company can predict which candidate will be a better hire in the future. Sample this, a candidate applies for a role in a company by entering his resume. An AI-powered system analyses the resume and compares it to the successful employees in the same role. A chatbot reaches out to the candidate and asks some pre-screening questions. The candidate data is collected, and AI uses it to score the candidate and present the result to a recruiter. The recruiter then decides whether to move forward to the interview stage or not. Such data cumulatively collected can be used along with employee performance and retention data to evaluate how well a candidate will perform on the job. In this way, AI capabilities minimise the scope of human bias and speed up the recruitment process. 3. SchedulingAlready, AI personal assistants like Amy Ingram are scheduling meetings, interviews and even ordering food. Amy is a human-like AI assistant who learns from observing employee preferences over time and then manages it in an automated manner for them. Similarly, AI based tools like zoom.ai allow employees to offload and automate regular tasks like look for a file and schedule meetings. By automating the repetitive and low value add tasks, employees can focus on more strategic work. It means the employees do not have to get involved in unproductive tasks that hamper employee productivity and waste organisational time. 4. Onboarding ProcessStudies suggest that employees who go through structured onboarding are 58 percent more likely to remain with the organisation after 3 years. HR can automate the many tasks of onboarding that would take hours otherwise. AI tools like zoom.ai can collect relevant data from new employees as well as generate their offer, send out the documents and answer the queries. The queries may range from how to fix the printer to setting up passwords, etc. Not only does it save HR’s time and energy, but it also makes all the above processes swift for the new employee. Once such issues are taken care of, HR teams can focus on integrating the employee into the mainstream of the organisation. 5.  Sentiment analysis A company called Ultimate Software has built an AI platform-based sentiment analysis system ‘Perception’ to gauge employee sentiments and solve Valvoline’s workplace issues. A sentiment analysis software is an AI-based tool that can give organisations an insight into their work processes and issues. This can help them resolve the problems that can nag the employees and impact their performance. Perception’s system uses machine language processing algorithms – a sub-domain of AI. By collecting and analysing the languages accumulated over a period of time, Perception gauges employee feelings through it. The company then uses the learnings in order to iron out any issues related to employee well-being, boosting employee engagement. Factors required for successful AI implementation in HR While there is no denying that AI can lead to a significant impact on the HR value chain, there needs to be a facilitation of some fundamental factors.

As a concept, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around for decades. However, it was in the last 20 years that the successful application of Machine Learning (ML) enabled the boom of AI. The ability of a machine to perform cognitive functions associated with the human mind, AI is used everywhere from Siri conversing with a user to IBM Watson’s autonomous weaponry. 

AI for business

Today, AI has begun to infiltrate board rooms and engage the workforce. It is helping employees manage their time better and add strategic value to the business. It includes a range of capabilities that can solve several business problems. In fact, AI has the potential to make a tectonic shift in the efficiency and productivity of various industries by introducing full-scale automation for tedious, time-consuming tasks and augmenting various human capabilities and functions. 

According to a new McKinsey Global Survey, most organisations are implementing AI devices across their standard business processes or are at least contemplating it. However, the adoption of AI is still in its nascent stages. Roughly 30 percent of the respondents of the McKinsey survey claimed to pilot the use of AI. 

Many others are exploring ways of utilising it to improve their productivity, ease and efficiency. The organisations already using AI have confirmed that it has resulted in a progressive transformation of their core processes such as manufacturing, marketing, human resources, etc. 

The relevance and scope of AI in HR Tech

HR is one of the core functions of any organisation. AI adoption can spell transformation for this function too. A Deloitte survey confirmed that 40 percent of respondent companies were using some form of AI in HR. However, the benefits are not immediate in nature. 

Keeping that in mind, adoption of AI-based HR technology can yield both short-term and long-term benefits. Some of them are already being witnessed while others are expected with growing investments in AI and its adoption. 

A growing number of startups are providing AI-based technology and services to HR functions for various activities. Some of the key ways in which AI can play a significant role in HR technology are given below:

1. Talent management

Every organisation has human capital needs and talent management refers to the organisational planning done to meet the workforce needs. As part of it, HR undertakes activities such as talent acquisition, employee management, performance management, succession management, etc. 

For example, organisations like Greenhouse Software are integrating IBM-AI capabilities through the IBM Watson Candidate Assistant, a suite of AI-powered tools that matches jobs to the candidates and vice-versa based on their personalities, skills and interest areas. Greenhouse collects candidate data through various funnels including social media. 

For example, it would observe minute details such as whether an employee submitted their work sample through LinkedIn or Glassdoor. It maintains scorecards for all the employees based on its own analysis with zero human intervention. This helps the interviewers sort through the applications ahead of time and keep the talent funnel ready.

2. Recruitment

AI helps companies through the process of pre-hire assessments. While assessments are nothing new, in the era of AI, a company can predict which candidate will be a better hire in the future. Sample this, a candidate applies for a role in a company by entering his resume. An AI-powered system analyses the resume and compares it to the successful employees in the same role. 

A chatbot reaches out to the candidate and asks some pre-screening questions. The candidate data is collected, and AI uses it to score the candidate and present the result to a recruiter. 

The recruiter then decides whether to move forward to the interview stage or not. Such data cumulatively collected can be used along with employee performance and retention data to evaluate how well a candidate will perform on the job. In this way, AI capabilities minimise the scope of human bias and speed up the recruitment process. 

3. Scheduling

Already, AI personal assistants like Amy Ingram are scheduling meetings, interviews and even ordering food. Amy is a human-like AI assistant who learns from observing employee preferences over time and then manages it in an automated manner for them. Similarly, AI based tools like zoom.ai allow employees to offload and automate regular tasks like look for a file and schedule meetings. By automating the repetitive and low value add tasks, employees can focus on more strategic work. It means the employees do not have to get involved in unproductive tasks that hamper employee productivity and waste organisational time. 

4. Onboarding Process

Studies suggest that employees who go through structured onboarding are 58 percent more likely to remain with the organisation after 3 years. HR can automate the many tasks of onboarding that would take hours otherwise. AI tools like zoom.ai can collect relevant data from new employees as well as generate their offer, send out the documents and answer the queries. The queries may range from how to fix the printer to setting up passwords, etc. 

Not only does it save HR’s time and energy, but it also makes all the above processes swift for the new employee. Once such issues are taken care of, HR teams can focus on integrating the employee into the mainstream of the organisation. 

5.  Sentiment analysis 

A company called Ultimate Software has built an AI platform-based sentiment analysis system ‘Perception’ to gauge employee sentiments and solve Valvoline’s workplace issues. 

A sentiment analysis software is an AI-based tool that can give organisations an insight into their work processes and issues. This can help them resolve the problems that can nag the employees and impact their performance. 

Perception’s system uses machine language processing algorithms – a sub-domain of AI. By collecting and analysing the languages accumulated over a period of time, Perception gauges employee feelings through it. The company then uses the learnings in order to iron out any issues related to employee well-being, boosting employee engagement. 

Factors required for successful AI implementation in HR 

While there is no denying that AI can lead to a significant impact on the HR value chain, there needs to be a facilitation of some fundamental factors. These factors should create a value proposition for future HR processes and workforce. The organisations need to begin with the right mindset towards AI adoption with a clear business vision. The responsibility of which does not lie only with the HR heads, but with the overall leadership. The leadership also needs to propagate AI technology adoption at every level. 

For HR processes, there has to be a change management strategy in place as well to deal with the workforce’s emotional and work-related issues resulting from an organisation’s focus in this space. The initial AI pilots in HR technology need to be leveraged as examples of AI success within the HR sphere. This can be done by scaling them into initiatives that can impact the entire workforce. 

The purpose of AI adoption in HR tech is to improve the productivity and efficiency of HR so that it can meet its core objectives. Employee engagement and improved employee experience are at the heart of any successful HR operation. This should be borne in mind that the ultimate role of AI in HR technology is to facilitate employee experience at all levels.

As one (human) study participant put it: “I felt very stressed competing with the robot. In some rounds, I kept seeing the robot’s score increasing out of the corner of my eye, which was extremely nerve-racking.”









AI, at your service.

The key is to help employees get comfortable, and trained and ready to collaborate -- not compete -- with AI systems. Business leaders are hoping that their employees are going to be accepting of AI in their worklives, because companies have big plans for AI -- and many hope that it will ultimately extend -- not replace -- worker capabilities. A recent study of 1,200 business leaders and 14,000 workers, conducted by Accenture Research, suggests AI will bring about significant changes to peoples' daily tasks, essentially redefining or redesigning their current jobs. Nearly half of the executives surveyed (46 percent) said that ""traditional job descriptions are obsolete"" as machines take on routine tasks, and as people move to project-based work. Executives at 29 percent of the most advanced AI companies  leaders report that they have already extensively redesigned jobs.
PROMOTED
The Accenture  survey found close to three quarters of executives (74 percent) plan to use AI to automate tasks to a ""large"" or a ""very large extent"" in the next three years. At the same time, almost all (97 percent) also say its purpose is to enhance worker capabilities. They envision their people productively collaborating with intelligent machines.
At the same time, executives underestimate the willingness of employees to acquire the relevant skills,  according to the report's authors, Ellyn Shook and Mark Knickrehm, both with Accenture. On average, executives deem only about a quarter (26 percent) of their workforce as ""ready for AI adoption,"" and cite resistance by the workforce as
a key obstacle. However, from the workers' perspective, 68 percent of highly skilled workers and nearly half (48 percent) of their lower-skilled peers are positive about AI’s impact on their work. Overall, 67 percent of workers consider it important to develop their own skills to work with intelligent machines.

So, executives are optimistic that AI will enhance jobs, but don't seem to quite grasp that their employees want to begin learning how to work with AI. To address this disconnect, Shook and Knickrehm provide the following advice to ""reimagine work"" and pivot the workforce in the coming age of AI:
Continually assess tasks and skills, not jobs.  ""Companies need to identify the new kinds of tasks that must be performed,"" and ""allocate those tasks to people or machines."" Such an effort is ongoing and requires constant re-evaluation, ""some companies are finding that they need to correct their initial allocation of work to machines. After all, many AI systems are not fully autonomous and require considerable input and adjustment from humans.""
Create new roles. This is essential, as ""AI enables people to take on higher-value work,"" Shook and Knickrehm state. ""Operational jobs will become more insight-driven and strategic, while mono-skilled roles will become multiskilled."" For example, ""consumer brands will become increasingly dependent on AI chatbots to represent them in the mass market. Personality trainers will be required to develop the appropriate tone, humor and level of empathy needed for different situations. A health care AI agent must appreciate the sensitivity of patients in a different way than a supermarket AI agent would need to appreciate the mood and mindset of a groceries customer.""
Map skills to new roles. In many cases, employees  whose roles have been automated can take on higher-value work, ""using AI and other technologies to provide more informed services to clients,"" the Accenture authors state. ""Take order processing and accounts payable collections. One Accenture client has produced a human–AI hybrid workforce where algorithms predict which orders have issues, such as a risk of cancellation or payment disputes. Employees can therefore spend more time paying attention to high-risk situations and be more proactive in mitigating negative outcomes. This approach has required training people to help them develop a range of expertise and capabilities — from industry sector knowledge to analytics and data interpretation, to the soft skills required to work with customers in new ways.""
Prioritize skills for development.  In the Accenture survey, the most important skills for effective AI deployments include resource management, leadership, communication, complex problem-solving and judgment/decision-making. ""Among the most valuable human skills required to collaborate with AI will be the judgment skills needed to intervene and make or correct decisions when machines struggle to make them,"" Shook and Knickrehm state.
Employ digital learning experiences. ""Digital learning methods, such as virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, can provide realistic simulations to help workers master new manual tasks so they can work with smart machinery,"" the authors state.

We know artificial intelligence technology will change the future of jobs and the labor market. What we don't know yet is how.
In less than a decade, machines could take over 52 percent of the current workload, compared to 29 percent today, according to a report from the World Economic Forum.
It's not all bad news, the report claims. The growth of AI will mean a rise in tech jobs and create more job opportunities in new industries. It is also likely to boost demand for ""human-centric"" jobs that rely on ""intrinsically human qualities.""
Here's an overview of industries already feeling the impact of AI.
The AI will see you now 
Inline illustrations by Tom Jay for POLITICO
When a woman gets a mammogram in Europe, it’s standard practice virtually everywhere for two radiologists to take a look at the X-rays to check for signs of breast cancer. Soon, that second opinion could come from a computer.
A range of private companies around the world, from small startups to global tech behemoths, are developing software that uses artificial intelligence to analyze medical images. Berlin-based MX Healthcare, for example, trained its software on a data set of up to 1 million mammograms.
But a diagnosis, even if dispatched with breathtaking speed, isn't able to replicate the relational quality and therapeutic nature of the doctor-patient relationship. Health and disease are strongly influenced by emotional, subjective and social factors that for machines are difficult to access.
Robot Picasso 
Can robots be creative? Judging by a canvas sold by auction house Christie's last year for €380,000 — nearly 45 times the highest estimate of its worth — they can be.
The artwork was created by a trio of 25-year-old French students who used a machine-learning algorithm to create the image. The resulting portrait — ""Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy"" — is the first piece of AI-generated art to come to auction and it's unlikely to be the last.
A U.K.-based robotics company this year will launch Ai-Da, the first ever robot artist to draw without any human input. The ""ultra-realistic humanoid robot"" — which was made to look like a female artist —  will draw people from sight using a microchip in her eye and a pencil in her bionic hand.
New kid in the bus lane 
Experiments with self-driving cars reach back to the 1980s — with varying degrees of success. And as automakers continue to hone the technology of autonomous cars for individual consumers, researchers are also looking into making self-driving buses a reality.
In Stockholm, two self-driving shuttle buses last year started sharing the road with pedestrians, cyclists and other vehicles, driving at a speed of up to 24 kilometers per hour. The Swiss town of Neuhausen Rheinfall, meanwhile, has fully integrated an all-electric self-driving bus into its regular public transport network.
At the moment, buses in both places are not operated fully autonomously — there is always a driver on board who can take control in case of an emergency. But it's only a matter of time, researchers claim.
Killer robots 
Militaries and manufacturers worldwide are working on weapons that could one day be deployed to fight on their own. Fully autonomous weapons, also known as killer robots, can select and engage targets without human intervention, rendering humans on the frontlines obsolete.
The U.K. has said it wants to use drone squadrons in combat by the end of this year. But the development of killer robots is controversial, with many NGOs and experts calling for a preemptive ban, and 61 percent of people opposing its development, according to a 2018 global poll.
Last September, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for an international ban on the production and use of weapons that can fire without a human to pull the trigger. Twenty-eight governments have called for a United Nations ban on AI-powered weapons, but the effort has run into strong resistance from military powers such as Russia, the United States, South Korea, Israel and Australia.
Automatic asset managers 
Would you trust a robot to manage your money? Banks and financial services companies are increasingly planning to incorporate AI technology into their business models. Some already have.
Robo-advisers, AI-driven virtual financial advisers, are cheaper than their human counterparts and prove to be better in managing long-term funds, Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.
In 2018 — a difficult year for the stock market — Germany's 12 biggest mixed equity funds lost 8 percent, while funds managed by the country's 16 robo-advisers fell on average by 6 percent. Germany's most successful robo-adviser has some 35,000 customers who, collectively, have invested more than €1 billion in the company that produced it, Scalable.

Self-driving vehicles, dating apps which give out relationship advice, humanoid robots that crack jokes and get upset… With a global market that is expected to reach US$35,870 million by 2025 from its direct revenue sources, artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just the subject of science fiction books. It’s already here.
According to a study carried out by IDC, in the ASEAN region, AI adoption rates are currently on the rise and growth has almost doubled in comparison to last year.
When it comes to adopting this emerging technology, Indonesia is leading the way, with 24.6% of companies already embracing AI in some capacity. Thailand comes in second and the bronze medal goes to Singapore.
 
 
 













 
 

This is somewhat surprising, considering the city state is normally something of a trailblazer in the region when it comes to embracing new technologies.

It doesn’t look like this trend is set to slow down any time soon, with businesses, startups and the government in Singapore all taking serious steps to reposition themselves as leaders in the AI market.
In 2018, the national initiative AI Singapore (AISG) announced two new initiatives in partnership with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the year before that, AI Singapore was set up with express instructions “to catalyse, synergise and boost Singapore’s AI capabilities to power [Singapore’s] future, digital economy.”
 
 
 













 
 

The government has also identified AI as one of the four core technologies essential to the country’s push towards being “digitally ready”.
Embracing the technology could help the country to overcome some of its current economic challenges of slowing growth, falling capital investment, soft workforce growth and decelerated productivity.
Artificial intelligence has the potential to reinvigorate the state-island’s economy and boost its industrial profits as, according to a recent report by Accenture, AI could add up to US$215 billion in gross value across 11 industries by 2035.
 
 
 













 
 

Asia’s First Model AI Governance Framework
At this year’s Davos, the Singaporean government announced it was working with the World Economic Forum’s Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution (WEF C4IR) to help drive the ethical and responsible deployment of artificially intelligent technologies. The framework is the first of its kind to exist throughout Asia and provides guidance which is both detailed and readily implementable to help organisations throughout the city-state navigate the complex ethical questions that often arise when AI technologies and solutions are deployed.

According to the Singaporean Minister for Communications and Information who announced the Model Framework, it is underpinned by two key principles the will help organisations to ensure: decisions made by or with the assistance of AI are explainable, transparent and fair to consumers and the artificial intelligence solutions they deploy are human-centric.
Singapore has long been pushing to become a global leader in artificial intelligence and this Model Framework will be welcomed by those who work with this emerging technology. It builds on themes that were first raised back in 2018 and pays particular attention to deployments that involve internal governance, risk management, operations management and customer relationship management. Furthermore, it has the full support of the Singaporean Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data – a group which consists of international AI leaders, consumer advocates and company leaders and helps to engage stakeholders on issues that support the development of AI governance capabilities and frameworks.
 
 
 













 
 

By announcing the Model Framework and its collaboration with WEF C4IR, Singapore is hoping to advance its position as a leading digital economy and Smart Nation. Being first Asian nation to develop an artificial intelligence framework will not only allow the country to continue investing in and building AI capabilities, it will also allow Singapore to remain competitive on a global scale.
Which industries are already benefiting from AI capabilities?
Healthcare
Healthcare is a field that is already reaping the benefits of AI use in Singapore. AI tools and assistants are now able to detect skin cancers, analyse chest x-rays or perform diabetes screens from a patient’s retina scan.
AI is also showing its value in healthcare research by helping to filter the vast amount of papers and reports that are being produced every year, helping doctors making the best decision when choosing new treatments.
 
 
 













 
 

Dr Joanne Ngeow Yuen Yie, senior consultant at the National Cancer Centre Singapore, thinks that the extensive body of available medical literature is a huge cognitive overload for physicians. “Nearly 60% of doctors are walking out on healthcare because they feel overwhelmed”, she said in a recent seminar titled SGInnovate’s Health Futures: AI & Genomics.
In a pioneering study published in April, scientists at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research’s (A*STAR) Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) developed a new type of AI known as machine learning computer models to accurately pinpoint roots of gastric cancer.
The AI methods and technology developed through this study will aid researchers in understanding the impact of mutations in non-coding DNA in other types of cancer.  
 
 
 













 
 

Steve Leonard, CEO of SGInnovate, a government-owned company which is also participating in AI Singapore and which funds deep tech startups, believes that the Asian country is positioning itself at the avant-garde of a healthcare AI revolution.
Taking the example of a Singapore-based surgeon who was able to reduce his patients’ recovery period by using robotics in his surgery and thus freeing up beds for other patients, Leonard said that the doctor was “able to get patients out the same day, when it used to take four days for them to recover”.
The biggest challenge for Leonard at the time of applying AI to healthcare lies in the mistrust and discomfort of some patients who might think that robots are replacing human doctors. “Social adoption is a bigger challenge than the technology”, he said. However, “it’s not replacing the doctor – it’s giving a tool to them; just like the stethoscope didn’t replace the doctor”.
 
 
 













 
 

Transport
New legislation coming into effect during the second half of 2018 and that will affect the use of autonomous vehicles in the island-state has recently attracted world attention and made the country a testing ground for this innovative way of transportation.

In 2015, nuTonomy, a self-driving car company that focuses on developing software for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots, began testing self-driving cars in Singapore. Shortly afterwards they partnered with Grab (the most popular shared-ride service in the country) to make autonomous taxis widely available to the general public. However, until this kind of vehicles can be deemed completely safe, all taxis still have a driver in case of an emergency.
Ng Chee Meng, Singapore’s former second minister for transport, reiterated Singapore’s support to autonomous vehicles during a speech at the Committee of Supply Debate last year. “We are focusing on self-driving technology in a big way because they have the potential to dramatically improve public transport”, he said. “Initiatives are underway to develop self-driving buses and to explore how the technology can be applied for use in freight transport and utility vehicles.”
 
 
 













 
 

Taking into account that only 15% of Singaporeans own a car, an expansion of the autonomous cars market would significantly reduce the cost of shared rides and taxis.
Vehicle manufacturers estimate that autonomous vehicle technology will only start to take off between 2025 and 2030, a calculation not shared by nuTonomy, which is looking to launch commercial services in the country this year. Rather than creating cars that are designed to be specifically autonomous, nuTonomy wants to integrate their technology with existing cars and speed up the process of introduction.
Separately, Chinese bike sharing platform Mobike, which has operations in Singapore, uses an AI data monitoring platform to make forecasts of supply and demand for bike rentals to help improve the company’s operational efficiency.
 
 
 













 
 

Airport operations are also implementing AI technologies, particularly with the use of facial recognition to get passengers from the terminal to the aircraft in shorter times. Innovative CT X-ray machines, which do not require passengers to remove their laptops from their bags, are also being implemented.
Early in 2018, the Ministry of Transport said that the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) is launching and Aviation Transformation Programme (ATP) that will promote the use of new technologies, including AI, to improve airport operations.
Financial and business services
The finance and business worlds are also experiencing an increase in AI use in Singapore. In these sectors it’s mainly being applied to enhance customer experience and to drive efficiencies.
 
 
 













 
 

Financial services are using facial recognition technology to resolve issues of verification and thus speeding lending processes.
Business services, covering a wide range of activities from real estate to accounting and legal, are expected to benefit the most from AI in the country.

AI-powered tools can help enhance productivity with document mining, pattern recognition for fraud detection, information extraction and analysis, thus transforming and innovating ways to generate insights.
 
 
 













 
 

Evie.ai, a Singapore-based startup, is behind Evie, an AI scheduling assistant that optimises resources with automation. Apart from scheduling meetings and organising diaries, Evie is able to coordinate calls, follow up with attendees and send out invitations.
AI-enabled legal services could develop an AI engine to automatically review legal contracts and highlight any issues based on a business’s legal policies and in this way ensuring consistency. It could also manage contract approvals and escalation which would get the right tasks to the right people automatically.
Manufacturing
With the world’s leading chemical manufacturing sites, the industry remains an important actor within Singapore’s economy.
 
 
 













 
 

Over 100 global petroleum, petrochemical and speciality chemical companies are housed on 12 square miles of land.

Today, Singapore is the world’s fifth largest refinery export hub and amongst the top ten global chemical hubs by export volume.
Therefore, it would make sense that Singapore focuses its AI potential in the manufacturing industry.
AI adoption would not only make manpower more efficient, it will also lead to the realisation of the full potentials of existing machinery on the factory floor.
 
 
 













 
 

Accenture’s research calculates Singapore’s manufacturing projected growth with AI in 2035 to increase by 40%: that is US$101.1 billion compared to US$71.3 billion without AI.
In late 2015, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) started a Future of Manufacturing (FoM) Initiative in close consultation with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), the Economic Development Board (EDB) and SPRING Singapore under the government’s Research, Innovation & Enterprise 2020 plan. 
The deliberations involved extensive engagement with industry and the trade associations.
The goal of the initiative is to sustain Singapore’s competitiveness in manufacturing and technology innovation so that it is a location of choice for developing, test-bedding and deploying advanced breaking-ground technologies in the manufacturing sector.
The 3 key thrusts of A*STAR’s FoM Initiative are the public-private partnership platforms of Tech Access, Tech Depot and Model Factories, that aim to drive technology innovation, knowledge transfer and adoption across the manufacturing industry.
Retail
The way people shop has changed dramatically since the advancement of digital technologies, resulting in a growing number of retailers now integrated artificial intelligence capabilities into the retail experience.
In Singapore, a company called Untitled Project have made it their mission to remake retail with AI. The services it offers help retail companies to improve everything from the supply chain, to providing a customised shopping experience, and enabling predictive modelling.
Using a number of sophisticated suggestion tools and self-learning AI algorithms which, once implemented, allows consumers find their way easily and quickly across the store and ultimately improves their overall shopping experience.
In addition to enhancing the way we shop; artificial intelligence has already helped to shape buying trends throughout the city state.
One startup, Crayon Data, is helping to do this through its ‘Maya’ product offering. It uses big data and artificial intelligence to map the personal tastes of customers to create personalised, digital experiences for them every time they connect digitally with the retailer of their choice.
Furthermore, everyone from your big-name high-street stores to the newest boutiques are experimenting with AI-enabled chatbots to help improve and enhance the experience of their customers long after they’ve left the store.
Education
When it comes to the education sector, artificial intelligence impacts in two different ways.
First, its through technology that is being developed to actively help teachers to educate their students. EdTech is still in its infancy but research has shown that the need exists, and VCs and investors have started to take note, with a precited US$250million expected to be spent on the tech in 2020.
In one preschool in Singapore, robots have already been brought in to help teach the children. KIBO has been designed to allow young children to take on the role of an engineer, constructing the robot and then using wooden blocks to programme sequential instructions from the robot to follow.
The robotics kit needed to build KIBO doesn’t come with a computer, electronic screen or any other digital device that could lead to criticism about the damaging nature of pro-longed screen time on such young children.
This is not the first robot to assist pre-school teachers in Singapore, however. Two humanoid robots called Pepper and Nao were sent to two schools in 2016 to take part in a 7-month trial. To date, 160 KIBO robots have been sent to pre-schools throughout the country.
The second way artificial intelligence impacts on the education sector is through the global need for more AI talent.
Artificial intelligence is one of the fastest growing sectors and currently, no country in the world has the necessary number of qualified workers to meet current demands.
Like a number of other countries around the world, Singapore is looking to change this with a number of different education initiatives.
One such programme is being led by AI Singapore (AISG) and aims to target around 12,000 industry professionals and young students in an effort to build up local skillsets in AI.
The programme is designed to outline the practical use cases associated with AI whilst simultaneously helping AI professionals to boost productivity through the use of intelligent tools.
AISG are also hoping to raise the importance of having government backing for initiatives such as AI-enabled, user-friendly public services to allow people to see just how vital this technology will be to the future of the country.

BERLIN — Robot reporters have arrived in the newsroom. Algorithms are writing up company earnings, covering sports championships and dabbling in crime and politics. One day, if the techno-optimists are to be believed, they will be doing much of the work journalists do today.
For now, your loyal correspondent’s job seems to be safe. Despite the galloping pace of technological progress, computers are still far from being able to develop sources, provide high-level analysis or infuse a narrative with character and color.
But as news organizations integrate artificial intelligence into their operations, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the media industry — and its workforce — is not safe from disruption.

Automatically generated articles
Robots are already performing routine tasks once done by human reporters.
Once, on mornings when companies published quarterly earning reports, business journalists at the Associated Press would get up early, wait for the numbers and hammer out copy as fast as they could.
“Earnings and sports were obvious for us because they're data driven"" — Lisa Gibbs, AP's director of news partnerships
No longer. In 2014, the AP automated the process. Now, a software monitors the earnings, then spits out a basic story onto the wire in under five minutes — faster than any reporter ever did the job.
Similarly, the newswire has automated its coverage of minor league baseball and college basketball.
“Earnings and sports were obvious for us because they're data driven,” said Lisa Gibbs, AP's director of news partnerships. “The sources of data are clean, and there is a value of having information about them out very quickly.”

The agency estimates it will publish roughly 40,000 automatically generated articles by the end of this year — still just a fraction of the more than 700,000 articles, including revisions, it puts out each year.

The AP is not alone. Newsrooms around the world have begun using software to report on sports scores, earnings' reports and election results. Bloomberg News has automated its earnings coverage. The Washington Post uses software to cover high-school games. The Los Angeles Times has a bot tweeting about earthquakes.
In Europe, the Austrian Press Agency is planning to use software during the upcoming European Parliament election to quickly push out articles with election results from each of Austria's more than 2,000 municipalities. Norwegian news agency NTB said it has been running automatically generated stories about football games for three years, and plans to expand its coverage to the country's minor leagues this year, bringing its automated coverage to up to 170,000 games per year.
Templates
Whatever the subject of the coverage, the process for this kind of automated journalism is similar.
First, reporters identify reliable data sets. They team up with programmers to write a template spelling out what a story needs to say, how it is supposed to sound and what possible variations there should be: Have the earnings of a company “soared,” or have they “plummeted”?
After any glitches are ironed out, the software is let off its leash to write its stories. But this doesn’t mean that the work of the journalists is done: At the AP, reporters still make tweaks to headlines, or mess around with some of the language. And they continue to monitor developments that might make their templates out of date.

If the U.S., for instance, decides to make changes to its tax law, business editors must decide whether to turn off automation because the risk of stories being inaccurate or incomplete is too high.
“We have editors now who used to spend their time writing and editing earning stories,” said Gibbs, who led the AP’s business desk when it first introduced automated reporting. “Now it’s about maintaining a very large database.”
Her agency currently has no plans to expand the use of automatically generated articles into other areas, she said, adding that “we're not in the business of automating things just because we can.”

In the fall of 2015, researchers from “Structured Stories,” a now-dormant academic project, approached reporters covering car chases in a local NBC Los Angeles newsroom with a request.
After the journalists filed a story, they were asked to enter facts about the incident into a database.
Every car chase is different, but if you think about them as narrative structures, they all have reoccurring plot elements. Every chase has a triggering event: someone is killed or a police officer notices a speeding vehicle. And every pursuit has an ending: an accident, a surrender, a shooting. By compiling enough examples, the researchers were seeking to teach their machines how to cover a car chase.

And it worked. The subfield of artificial intelligence underlying most newsroom robots is called “natural language generation” — or NLG. The basic idea is that if you want a computer to be able to write something, you must provide it with the information in a form it is able to process, and then you have to teach it how to use it.
Using examples from more than 60 car chases, the researchers came up with a way to encode the races so that a computer could understand them and a template for a typical story about an L.A. car chase. When they fed it data from another chase, the software spit out an article that read like classic journalistic prose:
Driver Drives Off 300 Ft Cliff During Pursuit
July 13th, 2015 (Point Fermin Park, San Pedro, California) — A vehicle pursuit that began in Wilmington during the late evening of July 13th later ended with the crash of the suspect in Point Fermin Park, San Pedro. The incident began at about 11:00 PM when an unidentified driver, driving a Toyota Prius, fled from officers of the Los Angeles Port Police following a traffic stop on Pacific Coast Highway in Wilmington. The suspect was then pursued by the LAPP along Alameda Street to San Pedro, and then further along Alameda Street to Point Fermin Park in San Pedro. The incident concluded with the crash of the suspect in Point Fermin Park, where the suspect drove over a cliff. The unidentified suspect was injured. Referring to the incident, witness Manuel Castro said ""We peeked our heads and it was just a gray Prius and we saw the wreckage and the cops over here."" The suspect was treated for injuries at the scene and was expected to be arrested. 
What made this experiment different from articles about quarterly earnings reports is that the machines weren’t just punching numbers into a template. They were recounting a series of events. In other words, they were telling stories.
The outcome proved that ""it’s possible to represent most news stories, and certainly formulaic news stories, as data, and it is also possible to generate news products, say articles, that are very similar to what journalists produce,” said David Caswell, who oversaw the ""Structured Stories"" project before joining the BBC last year as the executive product manager of its News Labs incubator.

Mass production
Robot journalists are not yet able to produce articles by themselves, beyond stenography-style reporting about straightforward facts. Even in cases where they’re able to write the story, they still need human reporters to tell them how to process information first. They serve primarily as virtual assistants, allowing one journalist to do work that might have required dozens — if not hundreds.
That’s the idea behind Radar, an “automated news service” that offers a glimpse at the cutting edge of computer-assisted journalism.
Radar — the name is an acronym for “Reporters and Data and Robots” — was launched in September 2017 as a joint venture of the U.K.'s Press Association and startup Urbs Media, with more than €700,000 of funding from Google’s News Initiative.
It seeks to use the vast but often untapped troves of public data that is released by the British government and other institutions, some of which drills down to the level of the U.K.'s hundreds of local authorities.
“In a way, these tools make it more likely that more of us will be able to do more sophisticated reporting"" — Lisa Gibbs
A story produced by Radar starts like any other: with an idea. The group’s reporters root around data sets, looking for something interesting. ""To my mind, the best judge to a story is still a human journalist rather than a machine,"" said Radar Editor-in-Chief Gary Rogers.

Once the team has identified a subject worth picking up — say, how often ambulances are delayed across the U.K. — reporters might make some phone calls or conduct interviews to understand the broader context and harvest general quotes for their articles.
Only then does the automation begin. The reporters write a template, which will allow them to generate hundreds of individual articles from just one data set — in this case, noting how often ambulances are delayed in the community and how that compares to the national average.
They add some analysis and feed it into their NLG software, which spits out hundreds of ""localized"" articles Radar offers to its subscribers.

Sometimes, local newsrooms publish the stories as they come in; sometimes, they have their own journalists pick them up, do additional reporting and turn them into larger features.
Radar’s team of five reporters, plus the startup’s two founders, hammers out around 8,000 stories per month, covering issues ranging from crime to transport, education, environment, health and social policy.
Some of the data they use has been available for years but had remained, so far, untouched by journalists — partly because so many local U.K. newspapers have shut down, and partly because much of the material is too detailed for it ever to have been profitable for human reporters working on their own.

""We're using NLG technologies as a writing tool, in effect,"" said Rogers.
Tailored content
Newsroom executives interviewed for this article argued that rather than making journalists redundant, robot reporters will allow them to focus on elements of the job that add more value.
Historically, in most newsrooms, only a small fraction of reporters have been free to truly dig deep into stories. Many of the tasks being performed can be — or one day soon could be — done by robots.
“In a way, these tools make it more likely that more of us will be able to do more sophisticated reporting,” said Gibbs, who now leads AP’s newsroom AI efforts.
Traditionally, most journalism is a single-use product. A reporter is assigned a story, gathers information, and then writes. Over time, they build up sources and knowledge, and get better at what they do — but when it comes to the writing part, they have to start fresh each time.
“The editorial side of journalism is going to be more important than ever. But it’s going to be completely different"" — David Caswell, BBC

That's where robot-journalists could revolutionize the business, technologists like the BBC’s David Caswell believe. He envisions that instead of writing articles, breaking news reporters of the future will work on templates that — fed with new data — can produce a limitless number of stories.
Newsrooms will build up libraries of templates, enabling them to quickly produce stories, sometimes for multiple audiences. The reporting about a car chase in L.A. could, for example, be run through five templates, producing, in turn, a short summary, a listicle, a colloquial blog post, a colorful article with lots of detail and a version in Spanish for the city’s Latino community.
“The editorial side of journalism is going to be more important than ever,” said Caswell. “But it’s going to be completely different.”
'Double-edged sword'
For some journalists, that will mean new opportunities. For others, it could mean having to learn new skills — or risk losing their jobs.
Some fields of journalism — investigative projects, magazine features, in-depth political and business analysis, op-eds and commentaries — seem, for now, to be safe from technologies like NLG.
Templates and databases can only do so much. “You can’t automate creative writing,” said Alexander Siebert, one of the CEOs of Berlin-based tech company Retresco. “Artificial intelligence can grasp the structure of grammar and turn data into creative language — but the ‘creative idea’ is and remains in the hands of humans. It will take many additional years of research until this can be done by machines.”

But other newsroom areas could see significant disruption.
""There are new ways of doing journalism that will be completely accessible and possible for new generations of journalists,” said Caswell.  “But it’s maybe harder for older journalists to adapt to those kinds of thinking.""
""If the emphasis on AI … is motivated to further reduce costs and resources — meaning people’s jobs — then that’s a problem"" — Sarah Kavanagh, Senior NUJ official
To write templates, journalists will have to learn to look for recurring patterns in whatever they're covering — similarly to what computer scientists and developers do when they write code. Such computational thinking is a skill most working journalists currently lack.
“It’s essential that employers provide training,” said Sarah Kavanagh, a senior campaigns and communications officer at the U.K.’s National Union of Journalists.
Kavanagh described recent efforts to automate reporting in the industry as a “double-edged sword.” While her union welcomes the use of technology, including AI, to enhance reporting — particularly in underserved news deserts — she also warned that the option to automate reporting could bring newsrooms to lay off reporters.

Similarly, disruptive innovations had been used in the past, she warned, ""in a way that is it not supporting quality, sustainable journalism, but about cutting costs.”
“If there are technological tools that are developed that will help people to dig into lots of information and to save time in their work of journalists, then … they should be welcomed,” she said. “But if the emphasis on AI … is motivated to further reduce costs and resources — meaning people’s jobs — then that’s a problem.”
Fake news
Just what changes artificial intelligence will ultimately bring to the newsroom is still unclear. While there are distinct limits to NLG, other avenues are just being explored.
“It’s not far-fetched to assume that in five to 10 years from now, technology will be at a place that, depending on the story one is writing, the machine will just make suggestions about sentences, or an outline for the piece,” said Seth Lewis, an emerging media researcher at the University of Oregon.
Enter ""deep learning.""
Unlike NLG, where computers are told what to do, deep learning analyzes vast troves of data and learns from that experience. That makes it highly effective, but it also turns computers into black boxes, making it impossible to fully understand the reasons behind their decisions.

In February, the American nonprofit OpenAI made headlines when it said it had created a software that uses ""deep learning"" to generate text and that it is so good — and has so much potential for misuse — that it wouldn’t release its full research.
Human journalists might not be superseded by robot reporters just yet | Image via iStock
It was trained by being fed 8 million documents. Using an approach similar to the predictive text generator on a smartphone, the program produces articles that read like near-perfect prose by predicting what word is likely to follow another one.
The only problem: As authentic as the stories may seem, the facts they contain are completely made up. Asked to generate an article about the OECD, the software created a straightforward news piece, including a fabricated quote attributed to a chairperson at the organization.
This makes the program, arguably, a potential competitor to fiction writers, novelists or poets, who aren't necessarily constrained by the facts. But it's much less useful for reporters, whose job is to stick to the truth.
For journalists, including your loyal correspondent, that should come as a relief. We won’t have to dust off our resumes. At least not yet.

In a world where technology is constantly evolving, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become prevalent in our everyday routine, whether we realize it or not.
But what about cybersecurity? As multiple systems continuously gather and transmit information, how can the government ensure the safety of that information? To fully understand the capabilities of AI, it takes teams of highly skilled researchers in an innovative workspace to analyze the competencies of these machines and understand why they do the things they do.
“I’m a little hesitant to define artificial intelligence since it has always sounded a little too much like science fiction to me,” says Liz Russell, an Applied Research Mathematician at National Security Agency (NSA). She splits the concept of AI into two sectors: machine learning and data science. Machine learning is the process in which a system learns trends to make predictions, whereas data science revolves around using large sets of data to make observations.
Liz tackles both in her everyday work.
“I research national security problems where a machine learning or data science solution might be appropriate,” she explains. “The problems typically come from intelligence analysts hoping for better ways to handle or answer questions involving large sets of data.”
In other words, she’s a data-mining superhero who comes up with solutions for some of the nation’s most complex technological problems.
“Before I came to NSA, I had the same false impression that most people probably have about federal agencies: suits and dark sunglasses,” she jokes. “When I got here, I was surprised to see so many people like me.”
“Before I came to NSA, I had the same false impression that most people probably have about federal agencies: suits and dark sunglasses.”
She commends NSA for its supportive culture and opportunities to grow. Liz has been enrolled in the Cryptologic Mathematician Development Program, where she did rotational tours throughout the agency in her first three years at NSA, and the Advanced Studies Program, which allowed her the time to further her education. She also served as a mentor for NSA’s graduate math internship.
Through these experiences, Liz utilized her skills in different ways, expanded her knowledge of the agency and was exposed to a broad variety of situations.
“In addition, NSA has funded me to attend many conferences and workshops to refine my practical knowledge of machine learning techniques and to meet professionals in the larger community,” she says. Coupled with employee development programs, these are just a few of the many ways NSA fosters the advancement of its employees.
NSA not only hires top talent, but it also has a wealth of technical support and subject matter experts that make its collaborative work environment stand out from the rest. From analysts to statisticians and mathematicians like herself, Liz says the incredible community of experts is what makes NSA different and creates a productive atmosphere that promotes cooperation.
One of the most satisfying aspects of Liz’s career is that she feels connected to the mission. Prior to working at NSA, she was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the U.S. Military Academy, also known as West Point, where she was working alongside military personnel every day.
“I have hundreds of former students and old colleagues who are active duty members of our military. I know that my work at NSA impacts their lives directly; it’s a feeling that is both humbling and a little scary.”
This connection is what drives Liz to excel in her line of work and make a positive impact in the Intelligence Community.
“Every project that NSA offices support  – crypt, research, operations, you name it – directly supports programs that aid warfighters, thwart terrorist activity and support the security of the United States,” she says. “The reason why we work so hard is always clear.”
“The reason why we work so hard is always clear.”
If you’re passionate about making a difference in the Intelligence Community, NSA is always searching for the best and brightest to help safeguard the nation. With perks like generous leave programs, affordable healthcare benefits and flexible hours to give you the perfect balance between work and life, your road to a rewarding career can start here.

7wireVentures Perspective on the Expectations and Future of Artificial Intelligence


Given the technological development of Artificial Intelligence, market adoption trends, and recognition of value potential, we believe there will be newly reconstructed processes leveraged by the healthcare workforce that ultimately impact the delivery of healthcare services. Such processes should provide a consistent feed of data to Artificial Intelligence tools that will continuously evolve and improve models. Ultimately, as the technology matures and becomes further integrated into the healthcare system, more roles and strategies for human work to be complemented by machines will arise.
PREDICTION 1: HEALTHCARE ROLES WILL BE REFORMED TO INTEGRATE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Considering this new human and machine mix, some functions of existing roles will be modified and optimized with the integration of Artificial Intelligence. An estimated 64% of healthcare roles will be impacted and these jobs will need to be re-engineered to optimize the value of the talent portfolio.[1]











FIGURE 1: Estimated Percentage of Tasks to be Automated from Select Roles




As a result, new capabilities will be required to meet patient needs and appropriately leverage tools. When hiring talent, organizations should consider how skill needs will change as digital solutions evolve, and how they can leverage new sourcing channels to fill gaps as needed.
This redesign of talent roles and functions also aligns with a shift within healthcare payers towards project work: 79% of payer executives note that work in the future will be structured by projects rather than job functions.[2] This enables payers to develop recruiting strategies and programs aimed at reskilling workers, including training on AI-enabled tools, and to invest in automation, digital tools and Artificial Intelligence solutions that will improve employee performance and engagement.
Given the maturity timeline of Specialized AI of 10+ years, the near-term integration of machine learning tools will augment the intelligence of providers rather than outright replace a majority of current tasks. As a result, human responsibilities (e.g., clinical, administrative and technology) will extend to training models, explaining results, and sustaining model efficacy. In return, machines will enhance human capabilities by amplifying speed and accuracy, interacting with patients and providers, and learning to embody provider characteristics.
 
PREDICTION 2: PHYSICIANS SHOULD BECOME MORE INTEGRATED IN THE DESIGN OF AI TOOLS FOR OPTIMAL SUCCESS 
The value potential created by providers leveraging AI tools is only possible with those who are willing to adopt such technologies. While generating substantial evidence is a key facilitator in gaining provider adoption, integrating provider knowledge early into the design of AI-powered tools not only increases willingness of user adoption and confidence in the technology, but it also improves accuracy of the model. Strategic physician insights and their ability to handle edge cases that break rules and patterns will become increasingly important in model design to improve efficacy.
Physician input can help identify key checkpoints and ultimately improve algorithm performance.  Given that for many tools, physicians only gain insight into the results and have limited transparency into key assumptions of the process, involving providers early can highlight areas where increased transparency or checkpoints are required. Physicians can also provide insight on how humans handle anomalies or conflicting pieces of clinical information that software might overlook in favor of the dominant pattern. Additionally, physicians might be better equipped to identify biases than programmers working off of decontextualized data.
As AI evolves from Specialized to Generalized and begins to operate on deep learning protocols – where machines learn to reprogram themselves without human intervention—provider experience and institutional knowledge will be critical for designing the most doctor-like decision making process.
 
PREDICTION 3: AI WILL ENABLE GREATER PATIENT SELF-CARE
Our thesis at 7wireVentures is that successful healthcare leaders will drive towards empowering an Informed, Connected Health Consumer. Aligning with this belief, as the trend of consumerism perpetuates, patients will become more familiar with and increasingly want to receive care on their own terms similar to other non-healthcare products and services.
Accenture estimates that self-care will meet up to 10% of demand for healthcare services by 2030. Healthcare consumers are already using technology-enabled tools, such as biometric devices and wearables for self-care. Physician willingness to integrate tools also matches their interest- with nearly 66% of physicians noting they “would prescribe an app to help patients manage their chronic diseases.”
Tools such as virtual nurses, technologically-enabled home-monitoring devices, and digital therapeutics are applications that enable personalized patient self-care powered by Artificial Intelligence.
The future healthcare consumer will be familiar with patient self-care and expect to engage in self-care activities both prior to engaging with a provider and as part of ongoing treatment post engagement.

Verily’s India project reveals the work of applying AI to real-world clinical care

Verily's Jessica Mega, M.D., leads the company's clinical and science efforts. (monsitj/Getty Images)
A new machine learning eye disease screening tool wasn't conceived by an eye doctor, or any physician for that matter, but by a research scientist at Google with an interest in artificial intelligence. That scientist, Varun Gulshan, was looking for a medical or science project that might ideally help people in his home country of India.But since no one on the Google team had any experience creating medical devices, turning the AI model into an actual medical device required turning the project over to Verily, Alphabet's healthcare and life sciences research arm.Three years later, eye doctors at Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai, India, are using that machine learning algorithm to screen patients for diabetic retinopathy, with the aim of using technology to fill gaps in patient access to eye doctors. By integrating the machine learning algorithm into their screening process, hospital physicians have more time to work closely with patients on treatment while increasing the number of screenings that can be performed.The real-world clinical use of the machine learning-enabled screening tool—essentially an algorithm trained to quickly interpret retinal scans for signs of disease—marks an important step in taking AI from research to the patient bedside. And it's an example of Verily's quietly expanding footprint in the world of healthcare and its ambitions to lead the industry in overcoming challenges that have so far stymied the broader use of AI in clinical care.""I think our unique role here is taking and understanding what’s currently going on with health conditions, but then saying, what new tools could be used? I think the diabetic retinopathy program is a great example of that,"" Jessica Mega, M.D., chief medical and scientific officer at Verily, told FierceHealthcare. In her work as a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a medical researcher, Mega explored novel cardiovascular therapies and using genetics to tailor therapies to patients. Leading Verily's clinical efforts builds on her interest in the use of technology to solve complex health problems, she said. Diabetes-related eye disease presented a good clinical use case for machine learning because it is a significant healthcare problem: diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of preventable blindness in adults, Mega said.RELATED: Google, Verily use machine learning to detect diabetic eye disease“If you think about AI and image recognition and all of the advances, even outside of healthcare, you can take those tools and apply it to something like reading an eye scan,"" Mega said. ""It’s the perfect marriage of a medical situation that is high need and technology that has matured in the last few years with the end goal of reducing blindness.”Proof of conceptGoogle and Verily—both under the Alphabet umbrella—have been conducting a clinical research program with a focus on India, where studies involving Aravind as well as Sankara Nethralaya, an eye hospital in Chennai, India, demonstrated that the algorithm performed on par with general ophthalmologists and retinal specialists assessing the images for disease. According to Verily officials, the two companies started the clinical research in India due to an increasing need to expand access to screenings there. There is a shortage of more than 100,000 eye doctors, and only 6 million out of 72 million people with diabetes are screened for the eye disease, the companies said. Hospital officials are optimistic that technology can help fill that gap.Verily, originally Google Life Sciences, once part of Google X, was spun out back in 2015 to lead Alphabet’s healthcare and life sciences research.Mega joined the research organization before the spinout and said early work on the algorithm for the retinal imaging program began within Google. “Over time, we realized it was best to co-develop the product going forward because it’s one thing to have an algorithm and it’s another thing to wrap it around with what it really means to have an end-to-end solution that clinicians can start using. On the Verily side, we bring some of the clinical expertise, the regulatory expertise, and the quality systems to bring this clinical product to market.”At the same time, Mega acknowledged that integrating machine learning into care delivery is a significant challenge. “You’re going to see this across the board, with people coming up with an interesting idea, but how do you actually scale this? How do you get the right tools, in this case, getting the right image of the eye with the algorithm that’s working in real time, and then getting a clinical diagnosis? We’ve been working hard on making this a reality.”RELATED: More clinical evidence needed to accelerate adoption of AI-enabled decision support: reportCurrently, one limitation is getting the technology to work in different clinical environments in order to scale it. “There are tools that may work in certain urban centers, but if you want to have a global impact, how do you create tools that work in rural environments?”As part of the research program in India, physicians and screening technicians at Aravind vision centers in remote locations continue to test the screening tool. One challenge they are trying to tackle is the quality of the images coming in as the remote clinics use different technology. “We’re using this as a testing environment to see what is going to work and what we can scale,” Mega said.Mega sees use cases for AI in other clinical applications including imaging, pathology, radiology, and clinical decision support. “It’s a tool to help us solve clinical problems, and I think we’re going to see this tool used more and more,” she said.Verily’s work at the intersection of healthcare and technologyThe retinal imaging program is one of more than a dozen Verily healthcare partnerships and projects. Onduo, a Verily-Sanofi collaboration launched two years ago, is a digital diabetes management program that provides patients with sensors and other tools to manage their conditions and access to a virtual clinic.“We’re bringing in continuous glucose data to try to get a deeper understanding of the biology and wrap that around with support to improve outcomes with diabetes,” she said. “We’re starting to see some early positive signals.”The Project Baseline study is much broader in scope and aims to collect patient data from myriad sources—sensors, imaging, EHRs—to study the transition from health to illness. The company is partnering with Duke University and Stanford Medicine to collect, organize and analyze broad phenotypic health data from approximately 10,000 people over the course of four years.“We have programs and projects that are addressing today’s health situations, but we want to think broadly about what health looks like in the next 10 to 20 years,” Mega said.As clinicians and researchers look to integrate AI into medical practice, the technology raises some ethical questions: how do clinicians understand what comes out of a technology “black box” and how do they avoid bias in the algorithms? Many medical groups, including radiologists, are tackling these issues.Addressing the issue of bias, Mega said many of the same principles of developing clinical trials apply to the development of AI systems.“Think about a clinical trial, if you only have a very limited sample, or you only recruit people with a certain background, then the question is, do the results that you see generalize to the broader population? We just need to have that level of rigor when it comes to AI,” she said. “We need to make sure that when we create, train and then validate algorithms that we’re dealing with a diversity of input and make sure that this is going to be representative of the population.”

I think unless you actually create jobs and wealth, it’s great that you have this research, but without commercialization it means nothing.“We should be world leaders in health and A.I., in oil and gas and A.I. and so on … Hopefully what we have here is a cluster out of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the next big boom will come out of that.“All software in the next decade will have an element of A.I. and M.L. as a part of it. We want to be a part of building out those platforms, those applications. We’ll be kind of the smaller, grittier, blue-collar one (A.I. company) that picks our fight.”Janssen is a master at creating interesting work for himself, having started out as an entrepreneur when he was still a U of A business student. In the late 1990s tech boom, when investors were flocking to put money into dot-com start-ups, Janssen and friend Cory Wagner rented a cramped downtown office and went to work on a number of ideas, one of which they built into Investopedia.com, a financial education website.Headline NewsGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.There was an error, please provide a valid email address.Sign UpBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.Thanks for signing up!A welcome email is on its way.

Instead, they started to build out an investment dictionary, thinking it was timeless content that might attract traffic for years.Investopedia quickly became one of the fastest growing businesses in the province and the largest financial website in Canada, all from a tiny Edmonton office. “That’s one of the great things about the internet, it’s an equalizer,” Janssen says. “The proof is in the pudding. We drove results. It didn’t matter we were a bunch of 22-year-old Canadians teaching Americans how to invest.”In 2007, Wagner and Janssen sold Investopedia.com to Forbes.Afterwards, Janssen built on the same model, starting businesses like Techopedia, Safeopedia and Corrosionpedia.He also hooked up with the U of A’s machine learning crew when he tried to find a way to get computers to generate rough drafts of articles for his various sites. They had no success whatsoever in this attempt, Janssen says, partly because they had taken on an extremely complex and difficult problem.Advertisement 4Story continues belowArticle contentBut the challenge made Janssen think about the potential of A.I. He then realized the U of A computing science department had grown into one of the most elite institutions on earth for artificial intelligence and machine learning.“I was amazed at the quality of M.L. engineers and data scientists there was at the university,” he says. “I felt like an idiot for not actually realizing that this (A.I. expertise) was here. And meanwhile all the profs at the U of A are like, ‘How come no one gives us any respect? How come no one realizes what we’re doing here?'”Janssen’s new company AltaML has gone from zero to 40 people in 14 monthsTo engage in machine learning, Janssen says you need both data to mine and a problem to tackle. Large Alberta businesses have both data and efficiency issues.When he first approaches companies, Janssen says they’re often skeptical and misinformed about what A.I and M.L. is all about. “They think that A.I. is robots doing backflips and Skynet and all this other stupid stuff. But it’s a lot more boring. It’s going in and doing a very specific task really, really well.”One of his goals, he says, is to keep all the brilliant foreign scientists now being trained at the U of A here in Edmonton. Only three of his 20 leading AltaML data scientists are Canadian born, he says. “We’re proving that if you have interesting projects and the right team, they will stay here.”Essentially, Janssen hopes to take a new Alberta strength and build on an old Alberta strength.Sounds like a plan — and one that we could use.Oil and gas won’t be here forever and neither will those computing science geniuses if we can’t employ them.dstaples@postmedia.comArticle contentShare this article in your social network         Share this Story : David Staples: Edmonton biz whiz sets out to make big bucks in artificial intelligence       Copy Link   Email   X   Reddit   Pinterest   LinkedIn   Tumblr Virginia: Big Changes Near Chantilly Leaves Drivers FumingDo not pay your auto insurance bill until you read this.Penny Pincher | SponsoredSponsoredRead MoreUndoConnor McDavid's fiancée shares wedding details but Oilers fans are talking about sunscreenEdmonton JournalUndoAfter Jack Campbell signs in Detroit, Oilers ink veteran stopper to add organizational depthEdmonton JournalUndoThese Barefoot Shoes are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarefoot Vitality | SponsoredSponsoredBuy NowUndoChantilly: These $300/Month Senior Living Apartments Are StunningNation.com | SponsoredSponsoredLearn MoreUndoOnly Needs a Super-Light Touch to Instantly Cut Even the Toughest Toenail.Toenail Clipper | SponsoredSponsoredLearn MoreUndoThis New AC Cooler Cools the Room In SecondsSherum | SponsoredSponsoredLearn MoreUndoCommentsYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.Create an AccountSign in  Join the Conversation Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

Artificial intelligence is a creation of Human Intelligence which will surely ease our lives in future but let us understand if it can emerge as a threat to Human Intelligence?What is it?Artificial Intelligence in simple words is a part of science where machines are loaded with algorithms that let them work as humans. It is machine intelligence which comprises of Planning, Problem-solving ability along with Speech recognition and so on.Algorithms strengthen AI and provide it with the power to do reasoning and correct itself when required. It is basically a gift of human intelligence to humans. We have created intelligent machines to work on our commands. Alexa and Apple Siri are among the few examples of on-going AI machines.Will they snatch human’s opportunities?Jack Ma, the world’s richest man once said in his interview that AI will become a threat to humans. What he actually meant was, AI will snatch job opportunities from humans. The tasks that are being done today by human hands will be performed by bots in the future. Is it true? Well, we can’t predict future but one thing is certain that we have created AI for our ease and Human Intelligence is always going to be on top.There is not much to worry about as the future will reveal more and more job opportunities and humans will be having various opportunities regarding their career. Actually, these thoughts are the results of our over-expectations, we expect that one day AI will become so powerful that it will snatch our jobs and lead us to another world war. Many have started believing that AI has made quantum leaps as well. We are living in the real world and not in a fictional life like Hollywood movies.We should control our expectations. You will be shocked to hear that according to a report by Sage survey 43% of Americans don’t know what AI is? So firstly, the biggest issue is lack of awareness among a number of peoples regarding AI.It is an Autonomous Process Automation -You must have to understand that we have not created another human brain rather we have created a machine that works like a human brain. AI does the analysis, it solves the problems and it performs autonomous automation based on its experience, knowledge, and data. Don’t be negative and consider AI as a helping hand that is going to ease our lives.AI is different from humans -Alexa and Apple Siri are AIs but they are far different from us. Whatever you speak to them, they translate it to sound bites and then work on them. You will have to come out of the fictional world. These are not self-learning machines, they do what we command them to do.After regular intervals, you get an e-mail that has a new set of commands for Alexa. Hence we command them to work in our directions. You will have to understand that these are not Einstein or Hawkins, not even close to them. Human Intelligence is creative and we keep doing innovative researches. AI is just a result of our creative intelligence. AI can’t be innovative, these can’t think and neither these can become creative.What should we do?The next big question that must be revolving in your brain is what should we do? Well, just control your expectations. Einstein and Hawkins were having human brains which can think far more than any supercomputer. AIs are made to ease our lives and we should not live in threat. More than 5000 peoples work on improving Alexa, they are creating a better bot for us.We will have to come out of the fictional world that Hollywood movies have created around us. They are called machines for a purpose. You need not put a lot of stress on the word “intelligent”. You should aware of the data and information that you are sharing with them as once you have shared something it is impossible (virtually) to bring it back.Be aware and be educated.","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://yourstory.com/mystory/is-artificial-intelligence-a-threat-to-humans-u8xioq0of2'}",is-artificial-intelligence-a-threat-to-humans-u8xioq0of2,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://yourstory.com/mystory/is-artificial-intelligence-a-threat-to-humans-u8xioq0of2', 'url': 'https://yourstory.com/mystory/is-artificial-intelligence-a-threat-to-humans-u8xioq0of2', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'name': ' Is Artificial Intelligence a threat to Humans?', 'datePublished': '2019-03-12T08:08:35.002Z', 'dateModified': '2019-03-12T08:08:35.002Z', 'description': 'While watching sci-fi movies you must have encountered bots doing heavy tasks with great precision and you might be wondering, are we driving ourselves to this future?

When we are little, we can’t communicate very well through words and voice because we are still learning to write and speak, so drawings are a special resource to express our emotions and our relationship with the family and even other things in the world.Drawings give us a tremendous idea about children’s fears, joys, nightmares, experiences and also personalities. A drawing contains every key information about them.It’s not a definitive way to get to know the child, let’s accept it, sometimes, it means nothing, it’s just a product of getting fun but sometimes the drawing can reveal what they are feeling and thinking in that moment.Artificial Intelligence Trends To Watch This Year - Data Driven InvestorExpect a broad range of AI-enabled significant advancements in 2019. From Google searches to handling complex jobs like…www.datadriveninvestor.comDetect children’s emotions through drawingsDetecting children’s emotions through their drawings is an old technique and very used by psychology professionals.Family Drawing TestYou may have been part of these common tests made at school when you were little. Therapists use different techniques involving drawings to evaluate children’s emotions and maturity. One of the most popular is the Family Drawing Test. The Family Drawing Test gives an understanding of how the child perceives their closest relationships. It’s a simple way to understand the quality of the relationships and communication, and how children construct their reality based on family relationships.This technique has been here for over six decades. Psychiatrist Miles Porot created it in 1951 and it’s now one of the most common techniques used to evaluate the personalities of children between 5 to 16. There are other similar techniques like the Tree Test.Artificial Intelligence in Drawing techniquesAfter reading about this interesting tool, came up with this great idea of combining the old technique and Artificial Intelligence to detect different children’s emotions, extracting representative features from each category, so we can decode children’s drawings and assign an specific emotion.By far, I consider this is a great use of Artificial Intelligence. I can imagine how this AI model can help psychologists and therapists in schools. I don’t pretend this can replace the hard work done everyday, but can be of much help. A computer vision model can speed up the work and help to diagnose children.Creating a labeled datasetI couldn’t find papers or datasets about this idea to start this experiment, so I took the job to create a new dataset. I read from different sources about how to decode children’s drawings depending on the color, shapes, positions, style and other different aspects about the drawing. I’m not a psychology or therapist but found out very interesting information about these drawings and their potential.I must tell, my search for drawings on the internet was really heartbreaking and an eye-opener experience. I was shocked by seeing real children’s drawings from different websites. Most of them were part of Art Therapy programs to heal children that experimented symptoms related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD). Other kind of drawings I found were about child abuse and domestic violence. I also found drawings from children whose parents divorced.So after collecting a good amount of children’s drawings, the next task was to label the dataset. This is what I found on the Internet that helped me to label the dataset:Type of drawing depending the gender (shapes and colors)We can find differences between girl and boy’s drawings. It’s very true that girls prefer to use pink and soft colors while boys prefer cooler colors like blue. Also shapes vary. Girls will typically draw rounded shapes such flowers, hearts while boys will do angles, boxes, straighter lines, along with cars, buses and rockets. It’s very common they draw something representative of their gender.Let’s talk more about the colorThere’s much more behind the color they use in their drawings:Let’s start with black and purple. These colors suggest dominance and can be favored by a child who is relatively demanding. Blue is popular with children who have a caring nature and enjoy company.Red represents excitement and it’s commonly used by children that don’t want to miss out on anything.Pink, girl’s favorite color shows need for love and appreciation. Green is the color of those who enjoy being different. Mostly, for kids that are artistic and intelligent. Yellow is a happy color and demonstrates intelligence and a sunny nature.Personality depending the styleThe way children draw also reveals important information about their personality.Detailed and elaborated drawings reveal a child who feels the need to try very hard. Bold strokes, especially if close together can be a sign of stress, strong feelings, determination or anger, while soft marks express gentler nature. Quality of the line is very important, too. A figure drawn with light, wavering, broken lines, reveals a hesitant, insecure child who appears to think as he goes along. By contrast the bold, continual, freely drawn line is expressive of self-confidence, and a feeling of security. You may have heard about this one, but the absence of arms is sometimes interpreted as indicating timidity, a sign of non-aggressive children, whereas exaggerating the size of the hands is seen as symbolic of aggressive tendencies if the figure is a self-portrait. Likewise, tiny feet are seen as a sign of insecurity, literally an unstable foundation.Position of the drawingI also found on the internet that position is very important in the drawing. The left side is commonly associated with the past and with nurturing, also with mother. The right side is the opposite and is related with the future,the need to communicate and also with fathers.Sizes also matter, a child who places a drawing of a good size on the page is considered to be a well-balanced and secure, while small figures drawn at or near the lower edge of the paper, or in a corner express insecurity.What about shapes?An impulsive child may draw big figures, no necks, and asymmetry of limbs. An anxious child would do clouds, rain, flying birds, no eyes on the figures. A shy child will typically draw short figures, no nose or mouth, tiny figures and arms close to the body like hiding something behind. An angry child would do big hands and teeth, long arms and crossed eyes. An insecure child is similar to a shy one, and will draw monstrous figures, tiny head, no hands and slanted figures.Creating the classesI found it kind of hard to create categories. There are many emotions a child can express. So, what I did is to focus on 3 categories:HappinessAnxiety and DepressionAnger and ViolenceThe reason I did that it’s because a drawing can express many feelings, some feelings are similar, so I combined some of them in the same category. When I saw the drawings about the war, I saw violence, anger and sadness. Drawings about domestic violence and children experiencing parents divorce expressed anxiety and depression.So, it was easy for me to combine Anger and Violence for drawings about war, children drawing themselves with angry faces or figures expressing violence.The Anxiety and Depression class contains drawings of children with faces crying and landscapes with rain and and clouds.The happiness class was the easiest one, I found many drawings of happy families with a pet, colorful landscapes with sun, flowers and rainbows.PyTorch ModelUsed a pre-trained model and PyTorch. I split the dataset 80:20, training and validation, respectively. After some epochs and tuning the model to work well with the dataset I made, results were good, reached an accuracy of 87%!See the results below:This is a prove that Anger & Violence and Anxiety & Depression can be found in the same drawing. Sometimes, we experiment all those feelings in one situation.Sad faces, a feature associated with Anxiety and Depression classAn eye crying, feature also associated with Anxiety and Depression classWar and dramatic colors: red and orange for fire and black for bombs and explosions. Features associated with Anger and Violence classMore warWar. This drawing ma be associating colors with anxiety and Depression classWarwarHappy family and sunny day. Colorful drawing associated with Happiness classColorful drawing. Almost a 100% sure it’s in Happiness classConclusionsDrawings express more than we can imagineIt would be amazing to share this technique with some foundations. I may consider this in the future, once I get a better model and a bigger dataset.Having an efficient AI method to detect children’s emotions is a way to help psychology professionals. Let’s not forget there are more tools used all together to give a better accuracy in diagnosisI can easily see more categories but that’s a long work to do and gather more drawings for the same purposeHaving professionals to see and label the data would improve this project for sure!ReferencesLearn to code children’s drawingsLearn to decode children's drawings | Novak Djokovic FoundationLearn how to decode children's drawings and get to know your child and his inner personality better.

The Ministry of Education and Microsoft Malaysia partner to advance STEM education in Malaysia with STEM4ALL, an initiative that aims to transform the education industry in Malaysia 
It is important to equip the future workforce to adapt to technology advancements like AI. According to Microsoft’s Study on Assessing Asia Pacific’s Growth Potential Through AI, the rate of  innovation Malaysia will be doubled by 2021
As part of the Ministry’s efforts to enhance STEM education, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka was chosen to pilot the ‘Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science Curriculum’ (MPP), making it the largest MPP curriculum to have ever been rolled out in the education world 

KUALA LUMPUR, 12 March 2019 – Ministry of Education in partnership with Microsoft (Malaysia) today launched the STEM4ALL campaign, an education initiative that aims to bring together parents, educators, students, and policymakers towards advancing STEM education for all Malaysians.
STEM4ALL aims to transform the education industry in Malaysia by promoting STEM education among Malaysians and ensuring our graduates are equipped with right skill set to drive their employability in this digital age. The campaign provides vision and direction to one of the goals under the Malaysia Education Blueprint, that is to enhance STEM education in the country.
(From L to R) YB Dr. Maszlee bin Malik, Minister of Education, Serena Zara Taufiq, CEO of Serena’s Secret, Chloe Soh Ke Er, robotics enthusiast and Dr. Jasmine Begum, Director of Legal, Corporate & Government Affairs for Microsoft Malaysia & New Markets in a panel discussion during the STEM4ALL launch, moderated by the minister himself.
The jobs of today will not be the jobs of tomorrow. Technology advancements happening all around us require the workforce to transform itself into the skilled and talented learners that the future needs and the STEM4ALL is a key campaign in the Ministry’s efforts to futureproof our workforce. The launch ceremony was graced by YB Dr. Maszlee bin Malik, Minister of Education in conjunction with Bett Asia 2019, the world’s largest education summit
The highlight at the event was not only the Minister himself but also two talented students, who had been invited to join a panel session with the Minister (image above):

Serena Zara Taufiq, aged 10, a Super CEO of a social enterprise called ‘Serena’s Secrets’ that aims to raise funds for youth with autism. She is also an accessibility advocate and advisor for the National Autism Society of Malaysia.
Chloe Soh Ke Er, aged 10, a robotics enthusiast and creator. During the event, Chloe did a demonstration of one of her creations, an agricultural robot that is designed to help with soil management. Together with her team, she interviewed farmers, collected information and developed a robot that can help farmers and combat climate change.

“Digital skills are a passport to new opportunities for millions of citizens and a building block to attract investment, innovation and new jobs in a global economy,” said YB Dr. Maszlee bin Malik, Minister of Education Malaysia. “To be competitive in today’s digital-first world, it is imperative to be fast adopters of best-in-class technology, including AI. In fact, according to a study by Microsoft, over 67% of our business leaders also feel that technologies like AI will augment the jobs of tomorrow and will enhance the workforce productivity. STEM4ALL aims to equip the future workforce to adapt to advancements in such technologies and increase their employability by develop these skills and navigating their learning in line with requirements of digital age.”
With advances in technology like AI, today’s kindergarteners need new skills to be life-ready by the time they graduate as the class of 2030. STEM4ALL campaign also focuses on how technology support the educational journey of our students.

Raman, Managing Director of Microsoft Malaysia added, “It is increasingly harder to imagine a job that is untouched by technology. We often hear that more than half of today’s primary school students will perform jobs that have not been invented yet. This is the reality of the digital age we live in and through the STEM4ALL campaign, we hope to shed light on how STEM education can help pave the way for future generations. We are proud to be working closely with the Ministry of Education to help make STEM education possible for all.”
Cognizant of the fact that the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will bring forth a shift in the skills demanded in the future, Microsoft’s efforts are aligned to equip educators with technology and skills that are capable of delivering 21st century learning. Its recent study with IDC titled “Future Ready Business: Assessing Asia Pacific’s Growth Potential Through AI” analyses the impact of AI on future skills of our workforce.

“AI is undoubtedly a game-changer in this digital world,” adds Raman. “According to our study, 64% of Malaysian workforce feel that AI will augment their work. This indicates that our society is prepared to embrace AI technology and that the onus falls on organisations to do their part in preparing this future workforce, providing them with the right training to ensure that they are not left behind.”
In line with the theme for Bett Asia this year, “Building a change culture to deliver 21st century learning”, the primary objective of the STEM4ALL campaign is to build a culture of inclusivity among all Malaysians when it comes to STEM education, which in turn will help enhance the quality of STEM education in Malaysia.
“Through this campaign, we want to ensure that STEM education is ‘for all’, regardless of background or whether a student decides to pursue a non-STEM profession,” added Maszlee. “We are glad to partner with Microsoft, that has been at the forefront of technology-driven innovation and together with them, we look forward to honing our education system to embrace the shift in technology and embrace new ways of thinking about skills and training.”

In furtherance of their efforts under the STEM4ALL campaign, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM) was chosen by the Ministry of Education to pilot the ‘Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science Curriculum’ (MPP). The execution of this curriculum in UTeM also makes it the largest MPP curriculum to have ever been rolled out in the education world, with over 250 students from the first batch to go through the curriculum and to receive data science certificates from Microsoft. This effort is also in line with our nation’s vision to produce 20,000 data scientists by the year 2020.
In order to promote education in the realm of AI, Microsoft also recently launched their AI Business School, an engaging master class series for business leaders that is focused on leadership in the age of AI. This groundbreaking school aims to empower business leaders to be successful by leveraging the power of AI as well as foster an “AI Ready” culture.

AI for the Caribbean





		Rachael Espinet								
	



Thursday 14 March 2019




The robot revolution is here. There is no escaping it. The world is now in the fourth wave of the industrial revolution where cloud-based computing, big data and a proliferation of sophisticated algorithms are being used to create artificial intelligence (AI) programmes that are transforming the way the world works.
Business Day met with general manager of Microsoft Caribbean Herbert Lewy, at TT Microsoft's head office on Mucurapo Road, Port of Spain, when he visited the country in February to discuss AI and the opportunities Microsoft is providing for developers.
“The definition of AI is amplifying human ingenuity. The human being is a unique species and what we are proposing is to amplify and augment this capacity,” he said.

Lewy said AI is a powerful tool that not only reshapes the way work is done but will transform human ingenuity to help workers perform more efficiently.



AI, he said, can help replace repetitive tasks that do not require human inventiveness. AI chat bots can deal with customer service issues and AI programmes can protect against fraud.
“For financial services, a bank can use it to protect a user from fraud and protect identity. AI has a very easy use of cameras and algorithms to protect the identity of the individual,” he said.
Lewy described a problem Uber, a digital ride-share taxi service, had with drivers committing fraud. Though Uber would do background checks on employees to ensure there were no sex offenders or criminals working for them, drivers could allow someone else to drive their car under their profile.
He said Uber contacted Microsoft for assistance and in less than three weeks Microsoft programmed Microsoft Azure’s Cognitive Service, AI tech which utilises speech and facial recognition, into Uber’s app to ensure the correct driver was working in the system.
“You cannot trick the system by putting a picture up of that person. You see a very simple service with investment in time and resources. You get the impact,” Lewy said.
Lewy describes AI technology as a levelling platform that can help emerging economies compete with global powerhouses.
At its annual developer conference, Build 2018, Microsoft announced AI for Accessibility program, aimed at harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to amplify human capabilities for people around the world with disabilities.
He said AI can be a great equaliser in business as all countries have access to the same technology for the same price. This, he said, can improve the quality of products and efficiencies of business.
He identified the agricultural sector as one that can greatly benefit from AI. The Dominican Republic, he said, utilised AI and saw a 14 per cent improvement in their GDP in that sector.



“In Dominican Republic there is a huge project going on where it is getting all the information on the weather, crossing the data with information of meteorological places with certain sensors. Just by understanding when it would be raining, that can save a huge number of crops,” he said.
The AI programme was able to sense the wind speed, determine if the crops would have been uprooted by the wind or how often the plants would need watering.
He said the knowledge farmers have is invaluable and cannot be replaced by AI technology, but AI can help amplify their knowledge. Lewy said the agricultural sector is one area that is more laggard in terms of developing technologies, but by utilising the AI tools available, farmers can optimise their crop yield.
During a recent interview with Business Day, Herbert Lewy, general manager of Microsoft Caribbean said the knowledge farmers have is invaluable and cannot be replaced by AI technology, but AI can help amplify their knowledge.
""We have a huge challenge as humanity needs to feed the whole world. Having access to food, that implies getting the best of farming environment and agriculture, that means just improving certain percentages of the yield would generate a huge impact in terms of populations having access to food,” he said.
After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, he said the University of Columbia submitted a project to the AI for Earth Grant programme to find out how much of the ecosystem was affected in terms of biodiversity and the continuity of some species. Today the AI information is being used to detect how different plants and trees and different bio-elements are subsisting so the continuity of the species could be managed.
In fact, Lewy flew in to Trinidad to discuss the opportunity Microsoft is offering globally for organisations who want to use AI technology to improve the environment or help people with disabilities.
Developers, non-government organisations (NGOs) and people who want to do good in the world can access Microsoft's AI for Good grant programmes – AI for Earth and AI for Accessibility.
Globally, there is a US$25 million grant available for AI for Accessibility for which proposals are accepted from people who want to use Microsoft's AI technology to empower people with disabilities.



AI for Earth has a US$50 million global grant that seeks projects focusing on four pillars: agriculture, biodiversity, climate change and water. Anyone from TT is welcomed to apply for these grants.
Lewy said he is seeing AI being utilised more in the Caribbean region, and governments, business owners and workers should prepare themselves for the new tools AI.
“The opportunity is huge, the potential is fantastic, but there is a huge but. Leaders, policy makers, government officials have to take this very seriously and build the necessary framework and environment for people to succeed in this digital era with AI,” he said.
Regarding TT’s government, Lewy said there is curiosity and interest, but some Caribbean regions need to be more intense with their curiosity.
“They need to ask for more and get behind things using the power of these disruptive technologies otherwise we would be missing the trends and that is a key characteristic of this revolution.”
Sixty-five per cent of primary school students will be working in jobs that haven’t been created yet thanks to AI technology.
Lewy suggests the students who are interested in focusing on AI technology get familiar with two coding languages, Python and R. He said most importantly, a student must be proficient in mathematics.
“If you want to go deeper on algorithms you probably would have to work on R or Python. But you mostly have to be proficient in maths and statistics than in technology per say, because these systems respond in these types of way of thinking.”
While having sufficient computer science programmes in all schools is important, the rapid change technology is introducing to the work force means workers, regardless of age or job position, must re-skill themselves to adapt to the robot revolution.



“I am super positive about the future. I am also ensuring that my message is clear about re-skilling. Re-skilling does not mean you have to go from zero to be a software engineer. The thing is, many of our colleagues are reinventing themselves doing more tweaks on what they used to do to be present in digital times,” he said.
Lewy said many people are fearful of AI replacing them at their jobs, and emphasised that AI is there to help boost human ingenuity and reduce repetitive tasks.
“We encourage people to differentiate between rational questions and curiosity to emotional fear. The emotional fear will paralyse you. It won't be allowing you to make thing happen and you will just get multiple excuses why not to do things. If you go into a rational process of externalising what you are feeling, what you need, what your services are, you can overcome that, basically owning a path to success,” he said.
Microsoft offers massive open online courses (MOOCs) for free on sites such as edx.org . He also suggests that people who want to organise training sessions contact the Microsoft head office.
“There are multiple sites we put in the web for people to have access to the information. The beauty of having a local office is people can contact directly our local people. We would be more than glad to create spaces for training for people and get them much more involved in the uses of AI,” he said.
Lewy is optimistic about the future of AI in the Caribbean. He says there is no rule book to success with AI. People just have to embrace the changing technology to move forward into the future and be prepared to be life-long learners during this fourth industrial revolution.

Automation, AI seen killing more PH jobs

 Philippine Daily Inquirer / 05:02 AM March 15, 2019














Advances in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) over the next decade are poised to take a brutal toll on workers, especially those engaged in manual labor and low-skilled agricultural roles.
This was according to comprehensive study released by technology giant Cisco and Oxford Economics, which forecast that at least 1.1 million jobs in the Philippines will disappear by 2028 as rapid technological innovations force workers to adapt or go unemployed.
In the Philippines, major areas of displacement are jobs in agriculture (1.2 million), wholesale/retail (880,000) and manufacturing (380,000). Overall, displaced workers will amount to 4.5 million, or over 10 percent of the workforce.

The study noted that other roles will open up as governments and companies retool the skills of their workers.FEATURED STORIES

It cited new jobs in wholesale/retail (1.3 million), transportation (490,000) and construction (460,000).
“Government needs to do more and so do citizens. Citizens also need to acknowledge that this is an investment that they are making toward lifelong learning,” Naveen Menon, Cisco president for Asean, told reporters in a recent briefing.



Menon noted, as an example, that as low-skilled agricultural roles disappear, there would be new opportunities for managers in the retail segment.



The Cisco-Oxford study was conducted across six Asean countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The goal was to build a model and quantify the impact AI-enabled technologies would have on workers through 2028.




The study noted that across the six economies, 28 million jobs would be displaced while 6.6 million roles would vanish or be considered redundant.
Menon said there was time for economies to begin preparing their workers, explaining that training for new skills could take around four years to complete.

Progress in the Philippines, however, could be slower due to unique factors such as regulatory constraints, “prolabor” policies, and the still relatively low cost of labor compared to some of its regional counterparts.
Menon said these factors could affect the Philippines’ readiness to transition to the jobs of the future.



The study also identified the top areas where skills are mismatched.
It said 41 percent across the six Asean economies lack IT skills while 10 percent lack management skills.



The shortfall is also significant when it comes to so-called soft skills.

And soon, their system sparked a technological revolution. Suddenly, machines could “see” in a way that was not possible in the past.This made it easier for a smartphone app to search your personal photos and find the images you were looking for. It accelerated the progress of driverless cars and other robotics. And it improved the accuracy of facial recognition services, for social networks like Facebook and for the country’s law enforcement agencies.But soon, researchers noticed that these facial recognition services were less accurate when used with women and people of color. Activists raised concerns over how companies were collecting the huge amounts of data needed to train these kinds of systems. Others worried these systems would eventually lead to mass surveillance or autonomous weapons.How should we, as a society, deal with these issues? Many have asked the question. Not everyone can agree on the answers. Google sees things differently from Microsoft. A few thousand Google employees see things differently from Google. The Pentagon has its own vantage point.This week, at the New Work Summit, hosted by The New York Times, conference attendees worked in groups to compile a list of recommendations for building and deploying ethical artificial intelligence. The results are included here.But even the existence of this list sparked controversy. Some attendees, who have spent years studying these issues, questioned whether a group of randomly selected people were the best choice for deciding the future of artificial intelligence.One thing is for sure: The discussion will only continue in the months and years to come.ImageCredit...John HerseyImageCredit...John HerseyAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe RecommendationsTransparency Companies should be transparent about the design, intention and use of their A.I. technology.Disclosure Companies should clearly disclose to users what data is being collected and how it is being used.Privacy Users should be able to easily opt out of data collection.Diversity A.I. technology should be developed by inherently diverse teams.Bias Companies should strive to avoid bias in A.I. by drawing on diverse data sets.Trust Organizations should have internal processes to self-regulate the misuse of A.I.

The industrialized world’s future may hang on mankind’s ability to answer a single, deeply disturbing question--if thinking machines do most of the work, what do humans do? It is a problem without an obvious solution.
What is known for sure and confirmed by dozens of research studies and real-life experiences is that the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning over the next few decades will have a profound and disruptive effect on workers in every industry around the world.
A new report titled “More Than Meets AI: Assessing the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Work of Government” from The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works to revitalize the federal government and the IBM Center for The Business of Government, sees difficult times ahead for government workers as well as AI takes root. From the report:
“AI is sure to change the composition of the federal workforce, creating new jobs related to managing AI systems or requiring critical thinking. Jobs based mainly on tasks that can be automated would likely be phased out, and employees would have to learn new or different skills for other jobs.
“Jobs based mainly on tasks that can be automated will likely be phased out, and employees would have to learn new or different skills for other jobs in order survive.

Just how disruptive will AI be to federal workers?
The analysis found more than 80 different federal occupations for which data shows there is substantial opportunity for job automation. More than 130,000 U.S. federal employees worked in these occupations in fiscal 2017, holding a wide-range of responsibilities from examining taxes and inspecting food to scheduling cargo and operating cranes. Multiply those numbers by the government workforce of major countries around the world and you’re talking about millions of people whose jobs and lives will be greatly disrupted in the coming few decades. According to the report:
Ten or 20 years from now, a federal workday is likely to unfold differently than a workday today. An AI transformation is expected to start with the automation of repetitive tasks, freeing up employees’ time to focus on mission-critical work. In the long term, however, AI will change the nature of jobs and how humans work alongside machines.

The report notes that the changes brought on by AI will not be the first substantial disruption of the federal workforce. In 1985, 19 percent of full-time federal employees held clerical positions. In 2017, they constituted just 4.3 percent in the workforce, according to Office of Personnel Management data. During those years, desktop computers and other technologies automated many clerical tasks, and new employees were hired to deliver programs in newly created agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security.
Based on that experience, whatever changes AI brings will not be immediate but an evolution that will play out over years and decades. Still, the report suggests that leaders and managers should begin preparing their employees now for the inevitable changes to come:
Leaders should communicate with employees early and often about the potential of AI to disrupt and alter their work. Leaders and managers should learn from early adopters of AI, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, NASA and the Department of Health and Human Services.

They should find out the extent to which the workday changed for employees, what types of agency work AI helped these organizations accomplish, which tasks were automated successfully, and what kind of work employees might start doing in place of current, repetitive tasks that AI could perform.

What jobs are likely to be most impacted?
Some agencies are more likely than others to be significantly impacted by AI in the near-term future. The research shows that more than a third of the Treasury Department’s staff (36%) are in occupations that would be affected by technology. The Government Publishing Office (28%) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (22%) also have considerable room to use AI in select occupations.


 



My Take
Like all the industry-friendly studies and optimistic pronouncements you see these days about the impact of AI on lower skilled workers, this one is filled with cheerful prattle about how AI will allow machines to handle routine jobs and allow people to perform more meaningful and interesting work, spend more time working directly with customers, perform other mission-related tasks and even learn new skills related to managing AI systems or requiring critical thinking. Another recommendation of the report:
Federal employees should receive training that emphasizes skills for handling interactions with agency customers with the help of AI. “Social literacy” entails skills such as active listening, communication, critical thinking, negotiation, persuasion, reading comprehension and writing. These skills will become more important as employees are able to spend more time with customers.

At the moment, there is no cross-agency strategy or plan to retrain those workers whose jobs are at risk to AI to provide them with the technical, digital and data literacy they will need to survive. Although it’s not specifically mentioned in the text—I suspect deliberately—there is a chart that shows more than half of the at-risk workers are over 50. This is a predictable and possibly avoidable human tragedy in the making.

The widening rift between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley endangers national security in an era when global powers are embracing strategic military-technical competition. As countries race to harness the next potentially offsetting technology, artificial intelligence, the implications of relinquishing their competitive edge could drastically change the landscape of the next conflict. The Pentagon has struggled—and continues to struggle—to make a solid business case for technology vendors to sell their products to the Defense Department. This is made especially urgent by Russia and China’s increasing artificial intelligence capabilities and newly created national strategies. While making the economic case to Silicon Valley is critical, building a lasting relationship will necessitate embracing the ethical questions surrounding the development and employment of artificial intelligence on the battlefield. Ultimately, this requires more soul-searching on the part of both military leaders and technologists.It is hard to overstate the importance of ethics in discussions of artificial intelligence cooperation between the military and private sector. Google chose not to renew a Department of Defense contract with Project Maven—a Defense Department project using artificial intelligence for drone targeting—when thousands of employees protested the company’s involvement. Thousands of artificial intelligence researchers followed their letter by signing a pledge to not build autonomous weapons. Computer science students from Stanford and other top-tier universities, a primary talent pipeline for tech companies, wrote a letter to Google’s chief executive officer saying they would not interview with Google if it did not drop its Maven contract.

However, Google isn’t the only case where working with the military has prompted debate and resulted in modifications to corporate behavior. Microsoft employees wrote an open letter demanding the company not bid on the Pentagon’s new cloud contract or sell augmented reality headsets to the Army, and Amazon employees wrote a letter to Jeff Bezos demanding he not sell facial recognition technology to the U.S. government, saying, “We demand a choice in what we build, and a say in how it is used.” Even at Clarifai, a company heavily involved in Project Maven, the project was said to have “damaged morale, complicated recruitment, and undermined trust within the company.”The Defense Department is beginning to recognize the importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and realizes the engine of innovation with regards to artificial intelligence lies almost exclusively in the private sector. As such, the Pentagon needs help from commercial leaders and innovators to stay competitive. This requires courting tech chief executive officers charged principally with increasing shareholder value. More importantly, however, it necessitates working closely with the engineers who develop the technology. As in the military, people are a technology company’s most valuable resource. As such, tech executives should pay as close of attention to their engineers as to their bottom line. Additionally, the Pentagon must not only demonstrate it is an attractive potential customer, but must also show how the handiwork of engineers will help, rather than harm, humanity. In this effort, the Defense Department is making significant progress in marketing itself as a customer as well as creating mechanisms for companies to effectively work with the military; however, it still needs to do more to address the ethical challenges to build a lasting relationship.Making the Business CaseThe Pentagon has made great strides in positioning itself a more viable tech customer. For example, the Defense Innovation Unit has successfully executed contracts with dozens of technology companies not only in Silicon Valley, but across the country. It has lowered barriers to entry by creating the Commercial Solutions Opening, which de-jargons military requirements by publicizing plain-language problem statements on easily accessible websites rather than the sometimes hundreds of pages long requirements documents that can be found on Fed Biz Opps, a labyrinth only defense contractors can understand. Additionally, Other Transaction Authorities, the contracting mechanism used in the Commercial Solutions Opening, are more flexible and operate orders of magnitude faster than traditional defense contracting.These authorities do more to protect vendors’ intellectual property rights and provide non-dilutive capital to companies, making them a great resource for start-ups and amplifying any external (non-Department of Defense) investments.But the Defense Innovation Unit is not the only option. If technology companies aren’t mature enough to sell a commercial product to the military in a short timescale, they still have options. The military offers early-stage research and development funding through Small Business Innovation Research grants and partners with technology accelerators, like Techstars.

Ultimately, the Defense Department is recognizing the danger of its sluggish acquisition system and taking concrete steps to make doing business with the military easier. Cultural change must follow these efforts, but it’s promising the heads of Army, Navy, and Air Force acquisition all have backgrounds in rapid acquisition. Yet, while the Pentagon has made strides in building a better economic case for company executives, it has shown less concrete progress in addressing the ethical concerns of the research and engineering pioneers of artificial intelligence.All About Talent“The real ‘arms race’ in artificial intelligence is not military competition, but the battle for talent.” The Department of Defense Chief Information Officer recently testified before the House Armed Services Committee’s Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, saying the Pentagon’s new Joint Artificial Intelligence Center is “all about talent.” The Department of Defense’s Chief Data Officer said, “Finding, borrowing, begging and creating [artificial intelligence] talent is a really big challenge.” The best artificial intelligence talent is in the private sector, so the Department of Defense must go outside the Pentagon to tap into this talent pool.There are only a few thousand artificial intelligence researchers worldwide capable of leading new artificial intelligence projects. Known as 10x programmers, these individuals are capable of doing the work of 10 people. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft spend hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire and retain this talent; after all, it’s the life blood of their organizations. Without it, their products suffer, profits shrink, and business models collapse. In her War on the Rocks article, Rachel Olney notes, “When Google chose not to pursue follow-on work from the Maven contract, it was driven by an employee petition. For a company as large as Google, Maven was a fairly small contract and the public relations fiasco was hardly worth the revenue it would bring.” However, the heart of the economic decision sits atop an ethical decision: should artificial intelligence experts build products for war? If the Pentagon cannot convince engineers to do that, efforts to effectively integrate and capitalize on the novel commercial products they create will prove to be futile.Neither the Commercial Sector, nor the Military is InfallibleSome fear Russia and China will militarize artificial intelligence without the ethical constraints to which the United States military is subject. The Chinese government has already rolled out ethically murky projects such as the new social credit system built on a panopticon of financial surveillance and facial recognition. But the U.S. military operates on a code of ethics, not a code of economics, and recent studies have found Americans hold the most institutional trust in the military; Amazon and Google rank second and third. That said, technologists will not, and should not, take at face value the Pentagon’s assurances the military will use their creations for moral purposes. History is filled with technologists who regretted the end-uses of their creations, from the idea that Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Peace Prize due to his regret over creating dynamite to the inventor of pepper spray, Kamran Loghman, and his regret over its use by police against protesters. The story of the world’s most destructive weapon, the atomic bomb, cannot be told without the regret of its contributors. Upon witnessing detonation of the first nuclear bomb, Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, once said, ""We [at the Manhattan Project] thought of the legend of Prometheus, of that deep sense of guilt in man's new powers that reflects his recognition of evil, and his long knowledge of it."" Albert Einstein, whose discoveries led to the development of the bomb, penned a letter to President Roosevelt saying, “Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in developing an atomic bomb, I would have done nothing.”By cooperating with tech companies on ethics, the Pentagon does more than better itself by becoming more educated on emerging ethical dilemmas; importantly, it has the chance to positively influence the future of artificial intelligence.This is not to say the commercial sector is infallible. After all, market forces alone have not delivered a consistent alignment of societal values, especially over time. For instance, Facebook did not do enough to prevent ethnic cleansing in Myanmar and paid teenagers to install spyware on their devices. Further, Google is accused of violating European privacy laws in seven countries and planned to launch one censored search engine in China and another in Russia. By cooperating with tech companies on ethics, the Pentagon does more than better itself by becoming more educated on emerging ethical dilemmas; importantly, it has the chance to positively influence the future of artificial intelligence.What The Pentagon Should Focus OnThe Google Maven letter, signed by over 3,100 employees at the company, says, “We cannot outsource the moral responsibility of our technologies to third parties.” This is something both the Pentagon and Silicon Valley can agree on, which is why technologists need to be intimately involved in how their work is deployed and battlefield commanders must understand the risks in using artificial intelligence when making life and death decisions. Both algorithms and the data that feed them are affected by people, who maintain an inherent level of bias, enabling small bugs to have large, unforeseen impacts. For example, some algorithms exhibit systematic bias. Codified discrimination is a key unintended consequence of artificial intelligence. Google’s facial recognition algorithm mis-identified photos of African-American individuals as gorillas, a Flickr algorithm labeled Native-American dancers as “costume,” and Nikon cameras questioned “Did someone blink?” after taking a photo of an Asian-American person’s face. In military systems, bias can have a much higher cost; misidentifying a military-aged male could threaten his life.Even if technologists refuse to develop or sell certain technologies to the military, their hesitations should be held in high esteem, because they can help the military mitigate worst-case-scenarios.

Yet, just as the Pentagon seeks the best technologists, it must seek out brilliant  ethicists to address technology deployment problems. Department of Defense Directive 3000.09 on autonomy in weapon systems is a start, but only that. Some suggest allowing people to stay in the loop will suffice. However, even with human involvement artificial intelligence decision making can result in tragedy, as when the USS Vincennes shot down a civilian passenger jet. Deeper conversations are needed on how to find, address, and combat bias in algorithms, ensure proper disclosure of algorithm faults and failures, and consider how artificial intelligence interacts with human rights. All these efforts must be underpinned by public, accountable conversations of how artificial intelligence should be used. Even if technologists refuse to develop or sell certain technologies to the military, their hesitations should be held in high esteem, because they can help the military mitigate worst-case-scenarios. To use the phrasing of computer security expert Bruce Schneier, the Pentagon must ensure it is “doing the right things [morally]” rather than just “doing things right [by the letter of the law].”The Department of Defense Must ActThe Pentagon is moving in the right direction when it comes to pursuing safe and ethical artificial intelligence principles, but has failed to clearly articulate how it will take action. The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center was established with a “strong commitment to military ethics and [artificial intelligence] safety,” and the Defense Innovation Board is creating ethics guidelines and recommendations for artificial intelligence development and implementation, currently holding public listening sessions to hear the concerns of industry, academia, and the public. Furthermore, the recently released unclassified summary of the 2018 Department of Defense Artificial Intelligence Strategy has a section specifically outlining the Department’s desire to serve as a leader “in military ethics and [artificial intelligence] safety.” These commitments and listening sessions are critical to starting an open, direct, and ongoing dialog between technologists and the Pentagon.But dialog means little without concrete action behind it. What remains to be seen is how much the Defense Department is willing to integrate with the engineers, designers, and ethicists working on developing artificial intelligence products for the military. To build upon its artificial intelligence ethics efforts and concretely demonstrate its commitment to responsible and ethical artificial intelligence use, the Pentagon should: Solidify an ongoing dialog in which trusted advisors can be briefed on and give input to ongoing military projects. These experts should have a similar role as Defense Innovation Board experts, but should also have more working-level knowledge of artificial intelligence research and experience deploying artificial intelligence systems at scale. Follow Facebook’s lead: after its privacy issues, it hired three of its biggest critics.Integrate wherever possible. Bring in artificial intelligence talent to help lead projects such as reforming the military's talent management system or helping to streamline health care. Allow technologists to get exposure to the military, and the military to capitalize on the talent of leading edge technologists. Start on non-controversial projects, such as helping to enhance individualized job detailing as well as ongoing efforts in predictive maintenance and humanitarian response. Once successful, the Pentagon should then slowly transition towards efforts with a more apparent military foci, such as imagery analysis and target     classification.Enable military members to capitalize on experiences working in the private sector, specifically with regards to artificial intelligence. Expand existing programs such as the U.S. Navy’s Tours with Industry or the U.S. Air Force’s Education with Industry, and enable highly talented individuals with technical experience to pursue extended artificial intelligence related residencies.Create virtuous circles. The technology community won’t trust the ethics advisor program from the outset. The Department of Defense must use the ethics advisors and enable them to apply the brakes on small-scale, non-controversial projects like back-end business practices (e.g., logistics, maintenance, talent management) at first. Learning to mitigate, identify, acknowledge, and address bias in non-controversial projects will provide lessons learned for doing it in higher-stakes projects. Small successes will build trust and confidence in the process.ConclusionThe proliferation of artificial intelligence will likely continue to increase in pace, largely driven by the commercial sector. While the economics of contracting will play a key role in bringing companies to the table to work with the U.S. Department of Defense, ethics will be critical in ensuring they remain for the long haul. The ethical dialogue is an important one and cannot simply be brushed off as “catchy headlines or impassioned debate.” The United States has a free and open society, where technologists with ethical qualms aren’t forced to cooperate with the government. Russia and China don’t face this constraint. If the U.S. military is serious about maintaining its competitive edge with respect to artificial intelligence, ethics must play a central role in its strategy for working with the private sector.

Exploring AIHow libraries are starting to apply artificial intelligence in their work

I have recently started to hear more phrases such as, “I don’t have to visit a library; I just ask Alexa [or Siri or Google Assistant] and it tells me everything I need to know. I speak to it all day.”
The impact of even this early wave of artificial intelligence (AI)—including voice assistants and machine learning (ML)—is still uncertain in many fields, but it is time to include AI on our professional agenda and in our national conversation.
In talking with librarians working in this area, it’s clear that while AI can be useful, it also raises
familiar concerns about privacy, intellectual freedom, authority, and access. And there are diversity considerations, as well, including access for people with different linguistic styles or abilities.
Fortunately, librarians are looking at AI from several perspectives. Some are using it to teach
information literacy and critical-thinking skills to help patrons formulate questions for these devices
and learn how to evaluate responses. University of Rhode Island, for example, is housing its collaborative efforts around AI in the library. Cambridge (Mass.) Public Library (CPL) partnered with MIT Libraries and Harvard metaLAB to host the installation “Laughing Room,” in which participants enter an artificially intelligent room that plays a laugh track whenever something is said that the room’s algorithm deems funny. CPL Director Maria McCauley says this helped people to consider the impact of surveillance and AI on their lives. To further engage library users with big issues in science and technology shaping our society, the library will host a public dialogue about humor, culture, and AI with Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic this spring.
At MIT, Chris Bourg, director of libraries, is focusing on building a technical infrastructure so its collections are accessible by APIs and therefore can be used by machine-learning algorithms. MIT Libraries is working with AI/ML researchers at the university to analyze various library tasks and workflows that might be enhanced by AI. As Bourg says, it is important for academic libraries to make their collections accessible to AI tools like Alexa so that when someone asks a voice assistant for information, reputable scholarly literature is available. To make this successful, libraries will have to work to ensure scholarly information is openly accessible, not locked behind paywalls.
All this may be a lot of new information to process. But Catherine Nicole Coleman, digital research architect at Stanford Libraries in Palo Alto, California, has a good approach: Last year, Coleman conducted “Library AI Conversations” to help library workers familiarize themselves with the latest research and issues. She also worked mostly with bibliographers, archivists, and catalogers to explore the possibilities of AI for metadata and collection development. Additionally, they are collaborating with computer science faculty and faculty in the humanities and social sciences to explore human–machine collaboration, interaction, and interface.
At ALA, we have resources to help library workers understand AI, these new devices, and the role of libraries. The Center for the Future of Libraries has written about voice-control devices; the January issue of Library Technology Reports explores AI and ML; and many of our conferences—including the Library and Information Technology Association’s forum and the Association of College and Research Libraries national conference—include sessions on AI.
My fellow library workers, the future of libraries will continue to be about the communities we serve. Librarians and library professionals will need to be at the forefront to support communities as these technologies transform our world. Let’s continue the conversation and learn together.

Sotheby’s First Auction of an AI Artwork Fails to Incite a Robo-Frenzy, Fetching a Modest $51,000
After a six-figure sale at Christie's in New York, Mario Klingemann's innovative installation that creates surreal portraits sells for $51,000.

Sotheby’s dipped its toes into the market for artwork created using artificial intelligence this morning in London, selling a work by Mario Klingemann titled Memories of Passersby I. The innovative installation by a pioneer of AI art went for £40,000 ($51,012) with fees. The first auction of an AI work in Europe proved to be something of an anticlimax after Christie’s entered the market last October, selling a work attributed to an algorithm for an unprecedented $432,500 in New York.
Klingemann’s work uses neural networks to generate an infinite stream of imaginary portraits, which are projected onto the two-screen installation. The German artist was among the first creative coders to experiment with artificial intelligence and art. The art movement, which Klingemann calls “neurography,” has grown in profile since the Christie’s sale, and many were watching to see whether the rival auction house would match the hype.
The bidding at Sotheby’s started at a more muted £20,000 (or $26,000) and ended just over a minute later with an online bidder securing the work for £32,000 ($42,000), well below its upper estimate of £40,000 ($51,012) without the buyer’s fee. 
Like Christie’s in New York, Sotheby’s opted to sell Klingemann’s work in a day sale. However, where the algorithm-attributed work at Christie’s counted among the prints and multiples, Klingemann’s installation was among the early lots in the auction house’s contemporary day sale, which included work by Peter Doig and Harold Ancart, and the sale marked Rose Wylie’s auction debut (her work Listening to Miss S sold for $135,501 with fees). Klingemann’s work hit the block 9th among the sale’s 223 lots. Shortly afterwards, a work by Gerhard Richter reached $1,120,989 with fees, and an untitled 1983 work by Keith Haring fetched $1,243,418 with fees.
Sotheby’s describes Klingemann’s work as creating unique portraits in real time, writing in a statement that, for the viewer, “the experience is something like watching an act of endless imagination take place in the mind of a machine—while the human subject matter of its visions adds a further layer of poignancy.”
Klingemann spent around three months creating the work. He trained the neural network that produces the surreal images based on of thousands of portraits from the 17th to 19th centuries. He also taught it to share his own aesthetic leanings using a Tinder-like selection process. In the installation, the computer generates new faces as you watch it, each strange feature morphing into the next, sometimes stuttering as it “thinks” about the next image. The end result is something that Sotheby’s likens to the simultaneously disturbing and appealing “convulsive beauty” of the French writer behind the first Surrealist Manifesto, André Breton.
Another edition of the work is currently on view at the Colección Solo in Madrid. Other examples of Klingemann’s work have been shown at the Ars Electronica Festival, MoMA and the Met in New York. In 2018 he received the Lumen Prize which recognizes artwork created with technology.
Sotheby’s contemporary art specialist Marina Ruiz Colomer presented the piece as a breakthrough when the sale was announced in February. “It is the nature of Contemporary Art to push boundaries,” she said. “AI art is the latest innovation winning its place in art history books, and Klingemann’s work stands on the precipice of an exciting new era in our field.”

Sure, technologies like machine learning, natural language processing, and automation could help reshape how your association works and serves its members. But finding the right opportunities, and staffing with those opportunities in mind, is the hard part, especially if there’s resistance within your team. Overcoming these challenges could open up a lot of opportunities to take advantage of artificial intelligence down the line. Here are a few considerations for getting your AI ducks in a row. Forge the Right Internal Team You don’t necessarily need AI experts on your staff, said Amith Nagarajan, chairman of the AI-driven newsletter platform Rasa.io. What does matter is whether those staff members have a “growth mindset,” a degree of curiosity, and focus on continued learning that isn’t defined “by their list of prior job functions and tasks they’ve completed.” 



 

“Associations generally won’t be creating any new AI technology but rather applying it,” said Nagarajan. “They don’t need deep AI skills; they need to have people who can apply the AI, at times with a little boost from outside help when it makes sense.” Peter Fitzsimmons, founder and CEO of Contexture, which specializes in machine learning and natural language processing solutions, agreed that collaboration between internal teams and outside AI experts, when the latter are needed, can produce good results. “Engage with and have good working relationships with those technology experts that do understand AI technology and can provide important perspectives at the right times to the whole senior team,” he said. Find the Right Use Case Nagarajan suggested that the best place to implement AI isn’t at the center of your technology stack, but in “edge-case scenarios” that don’t require integration with existing systems. “The problem is that since changing existing processes has so many issues, you end up spending more time on politics, systems integration, and other things that don’t advance your organization’s ability to learn about AI and its applications in real time,” he said. AI is often a good fit for new projects, Fitzsimmons noted. “Look at the critical areas that up until this point have been either so expensive or too time-consuming or ineffective in impact that you haven’t been able to consider them,” he said. AI shouldn’t be a solution in search of a problem, he added, but rather a technology that “might be able to add value in the right solution for you.” Integrate the Right Way Although associations might not yet need techies with extensive AI skill sets, Fitzsimmons said it’s important that someone in the organization “owns” artificial intelligence. But “owning” AI isn’t the same as being in charge of managing a piece of enterprise software, Nagarajan noted, because it’s less a tool and more a discipline. “AI is not a one-shot deal like implementing an AMS or [learning management system]; you need to think of it as a series of small and rapid experiments with the goal of some successes,” he said. “But constant learning along the way is the overarching goal. If you don’t spend time to learn about these capabilities by testing them out, you will quickly fall behind.”

Some of the top minds in tech and policy shared their outlooks for artificial intelligence and its applications at The New York Times’s New Work Summit/Leading in the Age of A.I. conference.CreditCredit...Mike Cohen for The New York TimesBy Cade MetzMarch 1, 2019HALF MOON BAY, Calif. — When a news article revealed that Clarifai was working with the Pentagon and some employees questioned the ethics of building artificial intelligence that analyzed video captured by drones, the company said the project would save the lives of civilians and soldiers.“Clarifai’s mission is to accelerate the progress of humanity with continually improving A.I.,” read a blog post from Matt Zeiler, the company’s founder and chief executive, and a prominent A.I. researcher. Later, in a news media interview, Mr. Zeiler announced a new management position that would ensure all company projects were ethically sound.As activists, researchers, and journalists voice concerns over the rise of artificial intelligence, warning against biased, deceptive and malicious applications, the companies building this technology are responding. From tech giants like Google and Microsoft to scrappy A.I. start-ups, many are creating corporate principles meant to ensure their systems are designed and deployed in an ethical way. Some set up ethics officers or review boards to oversee these principles.But tensions continue to rise as some question whether these promises will ultimately be kept. Companies can change course. Idealism can bow to financial pressure. Some activists — and even some companies — are beginning to argue that the only way to ensure ethical practices is through government regulation.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We don’t want to see a commercial race to the bottom,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, said at the New Work Summit in Half Moon Bay, Calif., hosted last week by The New York Times. “Law is needed.”The new ethics position at Clarifai never materialized. As this New York City start-up pushed further into military applications and facial recognition services, some employees grew increasingly concerned their work would end up feeding automated warfare or mass surveillance. In late January, on a company message board, they posted an open letter asking Mr. Zeiler where their work was headed.ImageBuilding ethical artificial intelligence is an enormously complex task. It gets even harder when stakeholders realize that ethics are in the eye of the beholder.Credit...John HerseyA few days later, Mr. Zeiler held a companywide meeting, according to three people who spoke on the condition that they not be identified for fear of retaliation. He explained that internal ethics officers did not suit a small company like Clarifai. And he told the employees that Clarifai technology would one day contribute to autonomous weapons.Clarifai specializes in technology that instantly recognizes objects in photos and video. Policymakers call this a “dual-use technology.” It has everyday commercial applications, like identifying designer handbags on a retail website, as well as military applications, like identifying targets for drones.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThis and other rapidly advancing forms of artificial intelligence can improve transportation, health care and scientific research. Or they can feed mass surveillance, online phishing attacks and the spread of false news.Discovering a BiasAs companies and governments deploy these A.I. technologies, researchers are also realizing that some systems are woefully biased. Facial recognition services, for instance, can be significantly less accurate when trying to identify women or someone with darker skin. Other systems may include security holes unlike any seen in the past. Researchers have shown that driverless cars can be fooled into seeing things that are not really there.All this means that building ethical artificial intelligence is an enormously complex task. It gets even harder when stakeholders realize that ethics are in the eye of the beholder.As some Microsoft employees protest the company’s military contracts, Mr. Smith said that American tech companies had long supported the military and that they must continue to do so. “The U.S. military is charged with protecting the freedoms of this country,” he told the conference. “We have to stand by the people who are risking their lives.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThough some Clarifai employees draw an ethical line at autonomous weapons, others do not. Mr. Zeiler argued that autonomous weapons will ultimately save lives because they would be more accurate than weapons controlled by human operators. “A.I. is an essential tool in helping weapons become more accurate, reducing collateral damage, minimizing civilian casualties and friendly fire incidents,” he said in a statement.Google worked on the same Pentagon project as Clarifai, and after a protest from company employees, the tech giant ultimately ended its involvement. But like Clarifai, as many as 20 other companies have worked on the project without bowing to ethical concerns.After the controversy over its Pentagon work, Google laid down a set of “A.I. principles” meant as a guide for future projects. But even with the corporate rules in place, some employees left the company in protest. The new principles are open to interpretation. And they are overseen by executives who must also protect the company’s financial interests.“You functionally have situations where the foxes are guarding the henhouse,” said Liz Fong-Jones, a former Google employee who left the company late last year.In 2014, when Google acquired DeepMind, perhaps the world’s most important A.I. lab, the company agreed to set up an external review board that would ensure the lab’s research would not be used in military applications or otherwise unethical projects. But five years later, it is still unclear whether this board even exists.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle, Microsoft, Facebook and other companies have created organizations like the Partnership on A.I. that aim to guide the practices of the entire industry. But these operations are largely toothless.Workers Speak OutThe most significant changes have been driven by employee protests, like the one at Google, and pointed research from academics and other independent experts. After Amazon employees protested the sale of facial recognition services to police departments and various academic studies highlighted the bias that plagues these services, Amazon and Microsoft called for government regulation in this area.“People are recognizing there are issues, and they are recognizing they want to change them,” said Meredith Whittaker, a Google employee and the co-founder of the AI Now Institute, a research institute that examines the social implications of artificial intelligence. But she also told the conference that this change was slow to happen, as the forces of capitalism continued to drive these companies toward greater profits.Image“We don’t want to see a commercial race to the bottom,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, said at The New York Times’s New Work Summit in California. “Law is needed.”Credit...John HerseyEmployees at Clarifai worry that the same technological tools that drive facial recognition will ultimately lead to autonomous weapons — and that flaws in these tools will open a Pandora’s box of problems. “We in the industry know that technology can be compromised. Hackers hack. Bias is unavoidable,” read the open letter to Mr. Zeiler.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThousands of A.I. researchers from across the industry have signed a separate open letter saying they will oppose autonomous weapons.The Pentagon has said that artificial intelligence built by the likes of Google and Clarifai has not been used for offensive purposes. And it is now building its own set of ethical principles, realizing it needs the support of industry, which has snapped up most of the world’s top A.I. researchers in recent years.But many policy experts say they believe these principles are unlikely to hold any more influence than those laid down at the big corporations, especially because the Pentagon is motivated to keep pace with China, Russia and other international rivals as they develop similar technology. For that reason, some are calling for international treaties that would bar the use of autonomous weapons.Is Regulation the Answer?In their open letter, the Clarifai employees said they were unsure whether regulation was the answer to the many ethical questions swirling around A.I. technology, arguing that the immediate responsibility rested with the company itself.“Regulation slows progress, and our species needs progress to survive the many threats that face us today,” they wrote, addressing Mr. Zeiler and the rest of the company. “We need to be ethical enough to be trusted to make this technology on our own, and we owe it to the public to define our ethics clearly.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut their letter did not have the desired effect. In the days after Mr. Zeiler explained that Clarifai would most likely contribute to autonomous weapons, the employee who wrote the letter and was originally tapped to serve as an ethics adviser, Liz O’Sullivan, left the company.Researchers and activists like Ms. Whittaker see this as a moment when tech employees can use their power to drive change. But they have also said this must happen outside tech companies as well as within.“We need regulation,” Ms. Whittaker said, before name-dropping Microsoft’s chief legal officer. “Even Brad Smith says we need regulation.”A version of this article appears in print on March 1, 2019, Section F, Page 2 of the New York edition with the headline: Promises to Keep.

Eighty-six percent of U.S. finance leaders believe the traditional finance talent profile needs to change quickly and dramatically, according to an Accenture report on the future of finance. While much of routine accounting, control and compliance tasks are getting automated, the ability to innovate is among the top desirable skills for new finance executives. And increasingly, success relies on soft skills like the ability to educate through story-telling and collaborative working, besides traditional quantitative analysis.These shifts are happening everywhere. The biggest effect of intelligent technologies in the workplace isn’t automation of jobs; it’s the reconfiguration of all positions, as tasks evolve and worker capabilities are augmented by machines.However, today’s education and training systems are not well equipped to build skills unique to humans. By their nature, those skills are not taught in the classroom but, rather, are acquired through doing (ongoing practice and experience), often over long periods of time. The U.S. stands to lose $975 billion in GDP growth promised by investment in intelligent technologies over the next decade if we fail to overhaul our learning approaches and close the skills gap.To solve for this, we should first look to what neuroscience tells us. Experiential learning, it points out, is particularly effective for adults. On-the-job training, design thinking or using simulation tools turn learners into active participants, leading to faster and deeper learning. Organizations should accelerate apprenticeships and use new technologies, like virtual reality, to make experiential learning more accessible and engaging. Artificial intelligence can be also used to respond to a person’s progress and adapt courses to their needs to make learning more personalized. Additionally, our current education systems do not usually address the needs of an individual learner, and we need a more learner-centered approach and design metrics and incentives that encourage the blending of skills in each person. The demand for more creativity doesn’t necessarily mean we need more ballerinas and sculptors; it means that each of us must be more creative in our daily activities. Government could incentivize universities to create greater blends of skills within each individual, as should organizational training programs. Educators should begin encouraging a better-rounded set of skills from elementary school.Finally, businesses and government need to provide vulnerable learners with access to training and help them participate in the upside of the innovation economy. Less-educated and lower-income workers are not only more likely to be in roles that will be automated, but also often have less access to learning opportunities, compounding their disadvantage. Experiential techniques are especially appropriate to help these people develop new skills for entirely new forms of work. Also critical to success will be offering modular, bite-sized courses that are flexible around the work and life commitments of adults.The disruption of employment caused by new technologies must be matched by disruption of our approach to education and learning.

Launching in autumn 2020/21, the degree will be one of the first online courses that focuses on Machine Learning and its applications.
The degree, developed in partnership with the online education platform Coursera, will teach students in the computational, mathematical and statistical foundations of Machine Learning.Students will also have the opportunity to work with industry-standard tools like PySpark and PyTorch to develop and apply their Machine Learning and data science skills. Over the coming year a number of specialisation courses will be released which will give students the opportunity to explore these areas.
What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms that computer systems use to perform specific tasks without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead1. It is seen as being closely related to Artificial Intelligence and has a number of applications in products and services used in daily life. 
""[We are] equip[ping] the data scientists and Machine Learning specialists we train with the skills to ethically apply these techniques to their future work."" Professor Niall Adams Department of Mathematics
Professor Niall Adams, one of the course leaders for the new degree, said: ""The degree integrates training in ethics and the limitations of Machine Learning in order to equip the data scientists and Machine Learning specialists we train with the skills to ethically apply these techniques to their future work. ""This is a rigorous programme with a deep focus on the foundations of Machine Learning; applicants should have an undergraduate degree in a subject such as computer science, mathematics, statistics, economics, or physics.""
Imperial's Machine Learning heritage
The College is world-renowned for its AI and Machine Learning expertise. One of the first high-level programming languages, Autocode, was invented at Imperial, and the university has more than 600 people working in areas related to AI.
Imperial's alumni are also having a big impact in the world of AI, with one start-up, Improbable, recently valued at $1billion. Alum, Peter Lipka (MEng, Computing 2011) founded the company which uses cloud-based distributed computing to enable the creation of virtual worlds for use in games and massive scale simulations of the real world.In April 2018 the College's reputation was confirmed by the decision by the UK government to launch its £1bn artificial intelligence fund on the campus. The deal, announced by Business Secretary Greg Clark and then Digital Secretary Matt Hancock, will fund 1,000 new government AI PhDs to keep the UK at the forefront of innovation and build the UK’s status as an AI research hotspot.
Talent shortage
There is an enormous demand for AI professionals globally, with the sector estimated to contribute £630bn of value to the UK economy alone by 2035. The next generation of Machine Learning and AI leaders will have to be prepared not only to exploit these opportunities, but also to grapple with a number of global challenges. 

Gideon Shimshon

""AI and Machine Learning are rapidly growing sectors. Through this new online Masters we are helping to train, at scale, the future workforce of highly skilled workers and researchers.” said Gideon Shimshon, Director of Imperial's Digital Learning Hub. “We are providing a flexible learning experience that enables people from all over the world to access content that otherwise would only be available to a few who can reach our campus.”
Delivering digital
“Degrees continue to be the most valuable credential in today’s job market, and this new program provides learners with critical machine learning skills businesses all over the world want to leverage."" Jeff Maggioncalda CEO, Coursera
The degrees Imperial is offering on Coursera provide students with flexible learning options. The MSc in Machine Learning is module-based, allowing learners to start by studying individual courses that can count toward their degree upon acceptance to the full program.“Degrees continue to be the most valuable credential in today’s job market, and this new program provides learners with critical machine learning skills businesses all over the world want to leverage,” said Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO of Coursera. “We’re thrilled to partner with Imperial College London, a world-renowned university with a reputation for excellence in teaching and research, to offer a flexible degree program that will open doors for learners everywhere.”

As we approach the third anniversary of Panama Papers, the gigantic financial leak that brought down two governments and drilled the biggest hole yet to tax haven secrecy, I often wonder what stories we missed.
Panama Papers provided an inspiring example of media collaboration across borders and using open-source technology at the service of reporting. As one of my colleagues put it: “You basically had a gargantuan and messy amount of data in your hands and you used technology to distribute your problem — to make it everybody’s problem.” He was referring to the 400 journalists, including himself, who for more than a year worked together in a virtual newsroom to unravel the mysteries hidden in the trove of documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.
Those reporters used open-source data mining technology and graph databases to wrestle 11.5 million documents in dozens of different formats to the ground. Still, the ones doing the great majority of the thinking in that equation were the journalists. Technology helped us organize, index, filter and make the data searchable. Everything else came down to what those 400 brains collectively knew and understood about the characters and the schemes, the straw men, the front companies and the banks that were involved in the secret offshore world.
If you think about it, it was still a highly manual and time-consuming process. Reporters had to type their searches one by one in a Google-like platform based on what they knew.

            How ICIJ deals with massive data leaks like the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers

What about what they didn’t know?
Fast-forward three years to the booming world of machine learning algorithms that are changing the way humans work, from farming to medicine to the business of war. Computers learn what we know and then help us find unforeseen patterns and anticipate events in ways that would be impossible for us to do on our own.
What would our research look like if we were to deploy machine learning algorithms on the Panama Papers? Can we teach computers to recognize money laundering? Can an algorithm differentiate a legitimate loan from a fake one designed to shuffle money among entities? Could we use facial recognition to more easily pinpoint which of the thousands of passport copies in the trove belong to elected politicians or known criminals?
The answer to all of that is yes. The bigger question is how might we democratize those AI technologies, today largely controlled by Google, Facebook, IBM and a handful of other large companies and governments, and fully integrate them into the investigative reporting process in newsrooms of all sizes?
One way is through partnerships with universities. I came to Stanford last fall on a John S. Knight Journalism Fellowship to study how artificial intelligence can enhance investigative reporting so we can uncover wrongdoing and corruption more efficiently.
Democratizing Artificial Intelligence
My research led me to Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and more specifically to the lab of Prof. Chris Ré, a MacArthur genius grant recipient whose team has been producing cutting-edge research on a subset of machine learning techniques called “weak supervision.” The lab’s goal is to “make it faster and easier to inject what a human knows about the world into a machine learning model,” explains Alex Ratner, a Ph.D. student who leads the lab’s open source weak supervision project, called Snorkel.
The predominant machine learning approach today is supervised learning, in which humans spend months or years hand-labeling millions of data points individually so computers can learn to predict events. For example, to train a machine learning model to predict whether a chest X-ray is abnormal or not, a radiologist might hand-label tens of thousands of radiographs as “normal” or “abnormal.”
The goal of Snorkel, and weak supervision techniques more broadly, is to let ‘domain experts’ (in our case, journalists) train machine learning models using functions or rules that automatically label data instead of the tedious and costly process of labeling by hand. Something along the lines of: “If you encounter problem x, tackle it this way.” (Here’s a technical description of Snorkel).
“We aim to democratize and speed up machine learning,” Ratner said when we first met last fall, which immediately got me thinking about the possible applications to investigative reporting. If Snorkel can help doctors quickly extract knowledge from troves of x-rays and CT scans to triage patients in a way that makes sense — rather than patients languishing in queue — it can likely also help journalists find leads and prioritize stories in Panama Papers-like situations.

Ratner also told me that he wasn’t interested in “needlessly fancy” solutions. He aims for the fastest and simplest way to solve each problem.
In early January, my newsroom, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and Re’s Stanford lab launched a collaboration that seeks to enhance the investigative reporting process. To honor the “nothing needlessly fancy” principle, we call it Machine Learning for Investigations.
For journalists, the appeal of collaborating with academics is twofold: access to tools and techniques that can aid our reporting, and the absence of commercial purpose in the university setting. For academics, the appeal is the “real world” problems and datasets journalists bring to the table and, potentially, new technical challenges.
Here are lessons we learned so far in our partnership:
Pick an AI lab with “real world” applications track record.
Chris Ré’s lab, for example, is part of a consortium of government and private sector organizations that developed a set of tools designed to “light up” the Dark Web. Using machine learning, law enforcement agencies were able to extract and visualize information — sometimes hidden inside images — that helped them go after human trafficking networks that thrive in the Internet. Searching the Panama Papers is not that different from searching the depths of the Dark Web. We have a lot to learn from the lab’s previous work.
Make sure there are incentives on both sides.
There are many civic-minded AI scientists concerned about the state of democracy who would like to help journalists do world-changing reporting. But for a partnership to last and be productive, it helps if there is a technical challenge academics can tackle, and if the data can be reproduced and published in an academic setting. Sort out early in the relationship if there’s goal alignment and what the trade-offs are. For us, it meant focusing first on a public data medical investigation because it fit well with research Ré’s lab was already doing to help doctors anticipate when a medical device might fail. The partnership is helping us build on the machine learning work the ICIJ team did last year for the award-winning Implant Files investigation, which exposed gross lack of regulation of medical devices worldwide.
Choose useful, not fancy.
There are problems for which we don’t need machine learning at all. So how do we know when AI is the right choice? John Keefe, who leads Quartz AI Studio, says machine learning can help journalists in situations where they know what information they are looking for in large amounts of documents but finding it would take too long or would be too hard. Take the examples of Buzzfeed News’ 2017 spy planes investigation in which a machine learning algorithm was deployed on flight-tracking data to identify surveillance aircraft (here the computer had been taught the turning rates, speed and altitude patterns of spy planes), or the Atlanta Journal Constitution probe on doctors’ sexual harassment, in which a computer algorithm helped identify cases of sexual abuse in more than 100,000 disciplinary documents. I am also fascinated by the work of Ukrainian data journalism agency Texty, which used machine learning to uncover illegal sites of amber mining through the analysis of 450,000 satellite images.
‘Reporter in the loop’ all the way through.
If you are using machine learning in your investigation, make sure to get buy in from reporters and editors involved in the project. You may find resistance because newsroom AI literacy is still quite low. At ICIJ, research editor Emilia Diaz-Struck has been the “AI translator” for our newsroom, helping journalists understand why and when we may choose to use machine learning. “The bottom line is that we use it to solve journalistic problems that otherwise wouldn’t get solved,” she says. Reporters play a big role in the AI process because they are the ‘domain experts’ that the computer needs to learn from — the equivalent to the radiologist who trains a model to recognize different levels of malignancy in a tumor. In the Implant Files investigation, reporters helped train a machine learning algorithm to systematically identify death reports that were misclassified as injuries and malfunctions, a trend first spotted by a source who tipped the journalists.
It’s not magic!
The computer is augmenting the work of a journalist not replacing it. The AJC team read all the documents associated to the more than 6,000 doctor sex abuse cases it found using machine learning. ICIJ fact-checkers manually reviewed each of the 2,100 deaths the algorithm uncovered. “The journalism doesn’t stop, it just gets a hop,” says Keefe. His team at Quartz recently received a grant from the Knight Foundation to partner with newsrooms on machine learning investigations.
Share the experience so others can learn. In this area, journalists have much to learn from the academic tradition of building on one another’s knowledge and openly sharing results, both good and bad. “Failure is an important signal for researchers,” says Ratner. “When we work on a project that fails, as embarrassing as it is, that’s often what kicks off multiyear research projects. In these collaborations, failure is something that should be tracked and measured and reported.”
So yes, you will be hearing from us either way!
There’s a ton of serendipity that can happen when two different worlds come together to tackle a problem. ICIJ’s data team has now started to collaborate with another part of Ré’s lab that specializes in extracting meaning and relationships from text that is “trapped” in tables and other strange formats (think SEC documents or head-spinning charts from ICIJ’s Luxembourg Leaks project).
The lab is also working on other more futuristic applications, such as capturing natural language explanations from domain experts that can be used to train AI models (It’s appropriately called Babble Labble) or tracing radiologists’ eyes when they read a study to see if those signals can also help train algorithms.
Perhaps one day, not too far in the future, my ICIJ colleague Will Fitzgibbon will use Babble Labble to talk the computer’s ear off about his knowledge of money laundering. And we will trace my colleague Simon Bowers’ eyes when he interprets those impossible, multi-step charts that, when unlocked, reveal the schemes multinational companies use to avoid paying taxes.
In the meantime, we stay real. Nothing needlessly fancy.

Part of the series “Supporting Today’s Workforce”

In my work as a career, executive and leadership coach for women, we often engage in the process of developing stronger resumes and LinkedIn profiles that stand out, as well as identify strategies for networking and applying for top-level roles that represent significant advancement and growth.


A question that frequently comes up has to do with the role of artificial intelligence in screening resumes, and how candidates can craft a winning a resume that will pass the bots and the system and get into human hands.

To learn more about this, I caught up with Dr. Jon Christiansen, the Chief Intelligence Officer of Sparks Research, a company that conducts primary market research and business intelligence to help executives make data-driven decisions in all areas of their business models, from hiring and onboarding, to customer service and product pricing.

PROMOTED
Christiansen serves Fortune 500 firms in the Banking, Automotive, Retail, Healthcare, and Energy industries, to name a few. He was trained in Computational Analytics at Carnegie Mellon, and holds both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Economics, and a PhD in Higher Education from Clemson University. Christiansen is also certified as a Senior Professional of Human Resources (SPHR) and a SHRM Senior Certified Professional (SHRM-SCP).
Here’s what Christiansen shares on writing your resume so that it passes the AI test with flying colors:
Kathy Caprino: Jon, how exactly do recruitment and screening algorithms work?

Jon Christiansen: Very similar to how SEO works for websites, Application Trackers and like programs use natural language processing to sift through resumes. Doing this, a program can score a resume according to a candidate’s fit for the job. The program does so largely by searching for keywords and linked phrases within the resume itself.

You will often find these keywords within the job posting. These keywords are usually the knowledge, skills and abilities a company is looking for in the ideal candidate, and often include the duties of the job. Most commonly, the most important keywords are found within the job description.

The reason for that is that HR folks are trained to defer to the job description in determining which candidates are qualified for an open position. The algorithm will sift through resumes to find matches within a resume to match against the keywords in the job description. Then, the program will look for job specifications (often called ""requirements,"" although these are often not ""required) - the qualifications necessary to be able to perform the job. This is experience, training, education, licenses and certifications. Obviously, if you are applying for a job as a CPA, you want to say you have a CPA license or certificate. If a firm is looking for a CPA with experience in working with small businesses, you want to emphasize your experience here.
From here, a program commonly scores a resume according to the number or percent of matches within the resume and will rank candidates according to match. Often, hiring managers can emphasize an order of magnitude for knowledge, skills, and abilities. So, one skill might have a greater weight in whether a candidate is a fit for the job.
Additionally, the more sophisticated programs out there can actually use the dates from a job in a resume and calculate the length in the role. So, if it wants four to six years, that program will do the calculation to see how close a candidate is to that window of experience.
Caprino: What does it mean to “algorithm optimize” your resume?
Christiansen: Just as I mentioned how the program works in searching for keywords and phrases, a candidate will want to write a resume tailored to the job itself. Ensuring the resume contains the terms that are showing up in the job description, specs and competencies. Make sure a resume hits on these keyword items.
Does the company want an individual highly competent in a specific software? Make sure to have a section that speaks to that. In my industry, there tend to be very specific skill sets within a skill cluster (multiple regression, econometric modeling, cluster analysis, etc.). They could roll these up and call them ""statistical modeling,"" but they don't, because they know these are the core important techniques. So a candidate will want to match this tit-for-tat. You’ll want to say, ""Experience in statistical modeling, specifically in____ (insert the specific ones you asked for).""
Caprino: Where are the keyword clues most often found in an online job posting?
Christiansen: There are a few things to look for. The first is the surface-level attributes, which are usually found in the job requirements. Usually the length of experience (which often includes a specific emphasis of experience), educational background desired, licenses, and other related skills. This usually shows up in the Job Specifications/Job Requirements. These are usually more observable, measurable items about a candidate. I can tell you I have a degree in Economics. It's hanging on my wall. You can call Clemson University and verify it. But you can't easily measure how I have lead teams or managed complex processes.
The next key clue is the background - does the candidates background match what we are looking for? Have they demonstrated an ability to write surveys, conduct analysis, report to senior management, etc.?
Third, there tend to be skills that are less tangible, but are highly important. Things like ""people management,"" ""project coordination,"" or other phrases that suggest something about an ability to execute a task. A job description might say they want a candidate to ""manage a project from initiation through completion."" So you want to hit on how you have produced work from end to end. More sophisticated programs will have different ways of linking text to determine this is what is being communicated.
Finally, there is some level of expressed magnitude for a skill or task. This usually shows up in the form of adverbs or adjectives - some emphasis on the desire for a skill, ability, or experience. An adjective might be terms like ""significant,"" ""strong,"" or ""compelling."" An adverb might be ""successfully,"" ""effectively,"" or ""efficiently."" This also shows up in emphasized nouns, like ""mastery,"" ""proficiency,"" or ""competency.""
Caprino: Cover letters: how important are they nowadays?
Christiansen: Highly. The job of a smart resume is to speak to the job description, job requirements, etc. The cover letter is often the product that a hiring manager will see once a candidate gets past the screening process.
The cover letter is the opportunity to speak to the job in more intimate detail in ways a resume cannot. A candidate can speak to those intangibles through experiences and stories. And speak to why he or she is a fit for the company. It is an opportunity to speak directly to the hiring manager, get noticed, and is often the key talking points when folks get in a room and decide who to bring in for an interview.
Some companies use algorithms to sift through cover letters, but the algorithms tend to be more open ended. It is less about keywords and more about sentiment, enthusiasm, and some sort of fit characteristics. These are rare, however, because a good hiring manager is going to want to see the cover letters of the top leading candidates.
Caprino: In your experience, what’s the biggest mistake job seekers make when submitting their resume digitally?
Christiansen: The first mistake is the obvious one: sending a generic resume that does not speak to the specific job. Sending out the same generic resume is a sure way to get called by a bunch of jobs that are just looking for warm bodies. Not exactly the ideal job. In terms of passing the AI test, candidates that go too far against the grain on a resume will make an algorithm throw up. Any artwork or images won't do well with a computational model. Unique fonts, while cool, won't translate well in the machine. A candidate will want to use a pretty standard template when formatting a resume. Use bullets and indention instead of tables.
Also, keep in mind that many job postings are written and search for more generalizable terms. Having a bachelor's degree that sounds unique or a job title that was a bit creative (""Brand Guru"") won't do well passing the AI test. Candidates can go on to O*Net (www.onetonline.com) and search for their job title. If the job title isn't listed anywhere, consider whether to use it. You can find one similar to use, and in doing so, make sure to open the job and check the summary report to make sure it works.
Lastly, a candidate’s LinkedIn page is becoming increasingly important, and should be consistent with the resume. If someone in HR or the hiring manager sees two different looks in a candidate, it's a red flag.
Caprino: Are there are any red flags you’d highlight for job candidates when looking through a job posting?
Christiansen: When looking at a job posting, you need to read it as if this came directly from the individual you would be reporting to. If it doesn't, then you might not want to go down that road. It's a red flag for you. A company that doesn't put thought into a job posting likely doesn't have the culture to care about that job.
If a job is seeking certain criteria that seems off, it probably is. For example, I just pulled up a job posting in a field similar to mine, and the job wanted a candidate with a bachelor's degree in marketing research. In looking into the degree, one doesn't even exist. This tells me the hiring manager doesn't really have a lot of experience in the field, or let HR come up with the job posting on their own, and they got it wrong.
Caprino: Any final thoughts for job seekers?
Christiansen: To all those job seekers out there, don't get discouraged if you don't meet all the requirements. As I noted, these are often not ""requirements"" as much as they are preferences. The key is to look at the job description. If you look at it, and it fits you, then you can do that job. It doesn't matter if they'd like a college degree and five years of experience. Companies rarely get everything they want out of a candidate, so if you don't have 100%, that's OK.
Use your cover letter as an argument for why you would fit. If you don't fit the observable traits, use your cover letter to tell that hiring manager how you would be a great fit for their team, the company, and an active part of their culture. Often, postings will include details about why that company exists. Speak to how you could be an asset to making the company's heartbeat. I've known folks in my field with two years of experience that is the equivalent of ten and others with twenty years experience doing the same thing for the last fifteen. Which one would you want to hire?

AI:  MORE THAN HUMAN



This interactive Barbican exhibition will explore the terrifying and beautiful relationship between humans and artificial intelligence.

“Alexa, play Auld Lang Syne.” An annual joke amongst me and my group of friends when one New Year’s Eve descended into madness as we shouted endless song requests into the virtual assistant pod when a pal was gifted  it for Christmas.
There’s no denying it. Technology’s presence and intervention in our day-to-day lives is becoming so increasingly commonplace, and shows like Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror only serve to heighten our fears and insecurities at our increasing reliance on tech.
And when it comes to artificial intelligence, there is an endless wealth of fear propaganda, sensationalised by that iconic impossible-to-extinguish red eye on Arnie in the Terminator films.
And now, this May, the Barbican in London will be opening its doors to a major new exhibition: AI: More than Human, which will look at the evolving relationship between humans and technology.
Telling the rapidly developing story of AI, the exhibition will include immersive installations, allowing visitors to directly interact while exploring what it means to be human, as well as other themes such as consciousness and dependancy.
One of the contributors is Matt Pyke of Universal Everything, whose studio’s previous projects have included virtual reality,  “weather installations” at fashion shows (giving the appearance of a snow storm whipping around models at Christopher Raeburn), digital sculptures, and even 360° wall projections (where a monster stomps around the room).
For the Barbican, he has created a large-scale installation where your reflection learns from your movements, eventually evolving in front of you. Terrifying stuff.
We talked to Matt about Stanley Kubrick, human behaviour and how his work has brought about emotive responses…

How would you describe your work?
The studio is a digital art and design collective, creating original artworks and brand collaborations. Our work spans video, sound, installation and architecture.
Can you explain how your interest in AI came about?
Growing up in the 1980s, “What are you doing Dave?” from Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey was a recurring phrase in my head.
How did you start your career?
I started as a graphic designer for the music industry, during the birth of the electronic music scene, designing sleeves for Warp Records and directing music videos. I started my own studio Universal Everything in 2004 to pursue self-initiated projects and design commissions for the emerging display technologies of the time, from mobile to architectural video walls. Now we are a collective which evolves from 3 people to 30 people depending on the ambition of the project.
Which installation are you bringing to this Barbican exhibition, or have you created something new?
We are bringing a new interactive installation called “Future You.” You are faced with a unique reflection of your potential, synthetic self. Starting as a primitive form, it learns from your movements to adapt and evolve, suggesting an agile, superior version of you. This artwork evolves, creating a new visual response for each visitor.
Alongside that we are screening Machine Learning, a series of futurist films exploring human-machine collaboration through performance and emerging technologies. It builds on the studio’s past experiments with motion studies, and asks: when will machines achieve human agility? 
What’s your favourite piece and why?
The favourite work is always our newest; we are striving to make something new and never seen before, everyday.
On your website it says Universal Everything is a “study of human behaviour on a mass scale” – what interests you about this?
We are interested in how the human and living forms can be represented through the eyes of today’s technology – from the movement of a single figure tracked using motion capture, to a simulation of a crowd of thousands revealing collective patterns of human behaviour.

You’ve used dance performances and botanical influences in your art – can you talk about this?
We strive to find links between mathematics and nature, between figurative and abstract form, and creating emotional technological experiences with a soul.
Your audience’s participation is actually needed to make your art work – what interests you about this symbiosis?
We love the idea that the work would not exist without the presence of the visitor. They become part of the experience, unique to each person.
How do you want people to feel when they come away from your exhibitions?
That they have witnessed a possible future.
What’s the best or most interesting piece of feedback you’ve had about your art?
At our current digital installation “Vehicle of Nature,” part of the Leonardo Da Vinci exhibition, a digital river flows across the floor of the gallery. A mother who was visiting with her autistic child told me the installation had inspired him to speak for the first time in months.
Why do you think our interest with AI has increased so much in the recent past years?
AI is becoming visible in our everyday lives, thanks to Alexa, Siri, OK Google and Cortana. Now we have a human-like relationship we can see the flaws, inadequacies and future potential of AI firsthand.
How do you feel about people vilifying AI or lauding it as the future?
Perhaps it is history repeating itself. People naturally fear the new and the unknown – from luddites reacting to the industrial revolution 
What’s next for you? What are you working on next?
We are developing some large scale video art for public screens which evolve every minute, every day – always reinventing itself, forever.
AI: More than Human will run between 16 May—26 Aug 2019 at The Curve at Barbican. Find out more here.

Estonia Thinks SoEstonia plans to use an artificial intelligence program to decide some small-claims cases, part of a push to make government services smarter.WIRED Staff; Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThe AI Database →ApplicationPredictionEnd UserGovernmentTechnologyMachine learningGovernment usually isn't the place to look for innovation in IT or new technologies like artificial intelligence. But Ott Velsberg might change your mind. As Estonia's chief data officer, the 28-year-old graduate student is overseeing the tiny Baltic nation's push to insert artificial intelligence and machine learning into services provided to its 1.3 million citizens.""We want the government to be as lean as possible,"" says the wiry, bespectacled Velsberg, an Estonian who is writing his PhD thesis at Sweden’s Umeå University on using the Internet of Things and sensor data in government services. Estonia's government hired Velsberg last August to run a new project to introduce AI into various ministries to streamline services offered to residents.Deploying AI is crucial, he says. “Some people worry that if we lower the number of civil employees, the quality of service will suffer. But the AI agent will help us."" About 22 percent of Estonians work for the government; that’s about average for European countries, but higher than the 18 percent rate in the US.Trending NowWIRED25: Sebastian Thrun & Sam Altman Talk Flying Vehicles and Artificial IntelligenceSiim Sikkut, Estonia’s chief information officer, began piloting several AI-based projects at agencies in 2017, before hiring Velsberg last year. Velsberg says Estonia has deployed AI or machine learning in 13 places where an algorithm has replaced government workers.For example, inspectors no longer check on farmers who receive government subsidies to cut their hay fields each summer. Satellite images taken by the European Space Agency each week from May to October are fed into a deep-learning algorithm originally developed by the Tartu Observatory. The images are overlaid onto a map of fields where farmers receive the hay-cutting subsidies to prevent them from turning forests over time.The algorithm assesses each pixel in the images, determining if the patch of the field has been cut or not. Cattle grazing or partial cutting can throw off the image processing; in those cases, an inspector still drives out to check. Two weeks before the mowing deadline, the automated system notifies farmers via text or email that includes a link to the satellite image of their field. The system saved €665,000 ($755,000) in its first year because inspectors made fewer site visits and focused on other enforcement actions, according to Velsberg.AdvertisementIn another application, resumes of laid-off workers are fed into a machine learning system that matches their skills with employers. About 72 percent of workers who gain a new job through the system are still on the job after six months, up from 58 percent before the computer-matching system was deployed. In a third case, children born in Estonia are automatically enrolled in local schools at birth, so parents don't have to sign up on waiting lists or call school administrators. That’s because hospital records are automatically shared with local schools. The system doesn’t truly require AI, but it shows how automated services are expanding.In the most ambitious project to date, the Estonian Ministry of Justice has asked Velsberg and his team to design a “robot judge” that could adjudicate small claims disputes of less than €7,000 (about $8,000). Officials hope the system can clear a backlog of cases for judges and court clerks.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThe project is in its early phases and will likely start later this year with a pilot focusing on contract disputes. In concept, the two parties will upload documents and other relevant information, and the AI will issue a decision that can be appealed to a human judge. Many details are still to be worked out. Velsberg says the system might have to be adjusted after feedback from lawyers and judges.Estonia’s effort isn’t the first to mix AI and the law, though it may be the first to give an algorithm decision-making authority. In the US, algorithms help recommend criminal sentences in some states. The UK-based DoNotPay AI-driven chatbot overturned 160,000 parking tickets in London and New York a few years ago. A Tallinn-based law firm, Eesti Oigusbüroo, provides free legal aid through a chatbot and generates simple legal documents to send to collection agencies. It plans to expand its “Hugo-AI” legal aid service matching clients and lawyers to Warsaw and Los Angeles by the end of the year, said CEO Artur Fjodorov.The idea of a robot judge might work in Estonia partly because its 1.3 million residents already use a national ID card and are used to an online menu of services such as e-voting and digital tax filing.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Artificial IntelligenceGovernment databases connect with each other through something called the X-road, a digital infrastructure that makes data sharing easier. Estonian residents can also check who has been accessing their information by logging into a government digital portal.Estonia’s well-documented move to digital government services hasn’t been without at least one glitch. Outside experts revealed a vulnerability in Estonia's ID system in 2017 that led to some embarrassment; it was fixed and the ID cards replaced. But government officials say the country hasn't had a major data breach or theft since it began its digital drive in the early 2000s. In 2016, more than two-thirds of Estonian adults filed government forms on the internet, almost twice the European average.“The really private and confidential things are not in the hands of government, but banks and telecoms,” says Tanel Tammet, a professor of computer science at Tallinn University of Technology. Tammet is a member of an Estonian government AI task force that will report its findings in May and suggest an additional 35 AI-related demonstration projects by 2020.Stanford University’s David Engstrom, an expert in digital governance, says Estonian citizens might trust the government's use of their digital data today, but things might change if one of the new AI-based decision-making systems goes awry.In the US, agencies such as the Social Security Administration are using AI and machine learning algorithms to speed sorting and processing, while the EPA is using AI to determine which factories should be checked for pollution violations. But a coordinated AI effort across the federal government has gone slowly, Engstrom says, mainly because federal databases in each agency are different and aren’t easily shared with other agencies. “We’re not there yet,” he said.Engstrom and a team of law school and computer science students at Stanford are studying how AI can be better used in US government agencies. They will soon report their findings to the Administrative Conference of the United States, an independent federal agency charged with recommending improvements to administrative processes.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDHe doesn’t see a AI-driven robo-judge coming to US courtrooms anytime soon. The US has no national ID system and many Americans have an innate fear of Big Government. “We have due process in the Constitution and that has something to say about fully automated decision making by a government agency,” Engstrom said. “Even with a human appeal, there could be a constraint.”Still, Engstrom foresees a time when AI-driven legal assistants might be presenting judges with case law, precedents, and the background needed to make a decision. “The promise of an AI approach is you get more consistency than we currently have,” he said. “And maybe an AI driven system that is more accurate than human decision making system.”The flip side is that an AI is only as good as the programming that goes into it. The sentencing algorithms, for example, have been criticized as biased against blacks.""You also worry about automation bias,"" Engstrom says. As the machines make more decisions, humans are less likely to inject their own expertise into a system, he says. ""That’s one of these creeping things that privacy advocates and good government advocates worry about when the government digitizes in this way.""For now, though, Estonian officials like the idea of an AI robot solving simple disputes, leaving more time for human judges and lawyers to solve tougher problems. Deploying more AI in government services ""will allow us to specialize in something the machines can never do,” President Kersti Kaljulaid noted at the recent North Star AI conference in Tallinn. “I want to specialize in being a warm compassionate human being. For that we need the AI to be safe, and demonstrably safe.""Corrected, 3-26-19, 1:50 pm: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the subject of Ott Velsberg's PhD thesis and the amount of money saved in the first year of using satellite images to monitor the cutting of hayfields.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

The ancestors of modern birds were the sole survivors of one of the most severe mass extinction events in the history of the world. Today, 10,000 known bird species exist, all of them the descendants of dinosaurs. Polar adaptations, seed-based diets and even nest designs may have played roles in determining who lived and who died. 
In the fourth industrial revolution era, enterprises and human workers are equally at risk of becoming extinct. This time, being proactive is essential and adaptability is the answer.

      Fourth industrial revolution: sorting out the real from the unreal




Stemming from my work on transforming passive bystanders into agents of change, I propose that understanding one’s own behaviours is key to adapting in the AI era.
Adapting to an AI era
The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has started. The technology is maturing very rapidly. The question is no longer whether we use the technologies or not, but rather how to better collaborate with them.
Ambient technologies, such as Siri, Alexa or Cortana, are integrating seamlessly in our interactions. We walk into a room and interact with them to turn on the light, play a song, change the room temperature, keep track of a shopping list, book a ride to the airport or be reminded to take the right medication at the right time.
And this is only the beginning.
Emotion AI works on teaching robots how to feel empathy. Google AI stories are about how AI is helping people solve problems. Experts race to predict how we will be living with AI in the near future. 
More-than-human work
Disruptive technologies are advancing, demographics are shifting, customers are gaining power and the gig economy and global talent markets are rising. This is shaping the future of work in all fields including education, cybersecurity, delivery, coaching, management, marketing and sales, health care, music and agriculture.
Human+ workers are individuals who work alongside machines to reach collaborative intelligence. They consolidate their individual knowledge, skills and experience with a set of tech-driven capabilities to enhance their performance.
Adaptability training
“Adapt or die” is a business mantra, and the adaptability of a workplace’s employees is their key to the future where many of the tasks cannot be imagined yet.
The next generation of employees will need to be trained as humans+ before they enter the job market, and the existing workforce will require continuous reskilling and upskilling. 
Little has been done to reimagine the training and reskilling needed for the future workplace. This said, similar to creativity (another in-demand soft skill) there is more to adaptability than meets the eye. 


Organizations and the future of work (Singularity University)

Adaptability is the capacity to adjust to new conditions and to thrive in new environments. 
To adapt is a performance that goes beyond knowledge and skills. It requires an attitudinal change that will only happen if we revise our constructs, consider new perspectives and start to perceive technology as augmenting our own capabilities instead of replacing them.
Human vs. machine
Many associate AI with science fiction stories such as the Terminator franchise or Isaac Asimov’s Robot series, where technology’s prime goal is to control or even exterminate human existence. 
Others are influenced by worldwide experts who relentlessly warn against AI and technological domination. Tesla founder Elon Musk has said on several occasions that AI is more dangerous than nuclear weapons and that it can become an immortal dictator.
Technology has eliminated jobs in the past and will eliminate others in the near future.

      How to prevent the 'robot apocalypse' from ending labor as we know it




New jobs will require the current workforce to commit to lifelong learning.
Besides, AI’s ethical problems are yet to be addressed, and establishing an AI code of ethics is complicated. Since its inception in 2017, 1,130 citizens and 28 organizations have signed the Montréal Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence, a commitment to the socially responsible development and implementation of AI that serves and benefits society.
Empathetic evolution
So can dinosaurs adapt? I say they can, but it will take an empathetic village. 
Enterprises that expect their workforce to be ready for the future of work must learn fast. They must adopt a proactive mindset and support their employees in their quest to belong to the future workplace. Mostly, they need to understand where resistance to change comes from in order to address it.


How can organizations prepare for the future of work?

At the same time, enterprises need to close the digital divide between themselves and their workforces. Most importantly, they need to find ways to keep their people employed. The fear of being replaced can reinforce human dinosaurs’ unwillingness to change.
Team dynamics should function in an empathetic way to facilitate human/human and human/machine collaborations and to support individual members in their adaptation process.
On an individual level, we need to develop our mental and emotional capacity and our knowledge and skills to embrace the human+ identity and attitude. And last, we need to want to adapt, which requires a change in how we view the world. Once we identify, analyze and address the core of our resistance to change, we can move to strategies to equip and empower us to deal with uncertainties and actively experiment with new possibilities.
To adapt, training to develop knowledge and skills are necessary but will not be enough. An empathetic and supportive environment and learning about oneself are also important.

It portrays a gigantic robot who has assumed monarchy and now carries the earth as its orb and poses with its sceptre. It grins as the humans who had created it are now at its mercy. Adjacent to it stands a helpless, suited up human (symbolic of an unscrupulous businessman who had once mindlessly empowered the artificially intelligent robot and in his quest of wealth, didn’t know where to stop). He now sticks his tongue out and sheds a tear as he regrets his thoughtless actions.Doodle courtesy: Ujjaini Basu)The term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ (AI) was coined by John McCarthy to define the theory and development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks which normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making and translation between languages. Much of the early development of AI could be attributed to the theory that all intelligent behaviour was the result of feedback mechanisms which could possibly be simulated by machines.This led to the emergence of the question, “Can a machine think?” whose affirmative answer led to the formation of the underlying principle of AI.Post this revelation, mankind saw the birth of self-learning systems that could efficiently solve problems which required the collection of huge sums of information, too cumbersome to be processed by humans. This development lured business men and industry experts into making AI an indispensable part of their fields of work as they employed it to reduce manual labour intensive jobs, thereby cutting costs and reaping huge profits. But trouble arose in Paradise when humans started succumbing to gluttony and greed. They didn’t know where to draw the line.Empowering artificially intelligent bots/robots to think and behave like a human could prove to be detrimental to the society for human thinking is often influenced by emotions, triggered by experiences, and rarely disinterested. One may refute this objection by urging people to look upon a robot as just another human but the problem lies with its strength and special abilities which it may use to its advantage over humans. Consider the following excerpt from a 2017 publication by the Independent, to understand the problem better:Facebook abandoned an experiment after two artificially intelligent programs appeared to be chatting to each other in a strange language only they understood. The two chatbots came to create their own changes to English that made it easier for them to work – but which remained mysterious to the humans that supposedly look after them. The robots had been instructed to work out how to negotiate between themselves, and improve their bartering as they went along. But they were not told to use comprehensible English, allowing them to create their own ""shorthand"", according to researchers. Indeed, some of the negotiations that were carried out in this bizarre language even ended up successfully concluding their negotiations, while conducting them entirely in the bizarre language.In the enchanting era of Netflix and chill, I urge every human to pause for a moment and travel back in time to the 1980’s to witness an American sci-fi sitcom, Small Wonder, named after its protagonist, a Voice Input Child Identicant (V.I.C.I). The show tells the tale of a family of a robotics engineer who clandestinely creates an android modeled after a 10-year old human girl, then tries to pass it off as his adopted daughter. The robot had been invented in an effort to assist handicapped children and was taken home by its inventor so that it could mature within a family environment. Upon close observation, the apparently comic sitcom unfolds some important traits of human behavior. Most conspicuously, it highlights a human’s tendency to find the easy way out to get his job done by over relying on machines, even if that means paralyzing his own abilities, just as how the inventor’s pre-teen son is shown to surreptitiously use the robot to get his homework done. The show also highlights that humans are prone to disillusionment as they are susceptible to bond with a robot emotionally, just as how all the members of the inventor’s family look upon the robot as a real human despite knowing the truth. The revelations made by the show decades ago hold true even to this day.The rise in demand for pleasure droids not only demonstrates the rapid withdrawal of humanity from humans but also highlights human submission to machines powered by AI. Read a horrific excerpt from a 2018 publication by The Sun to understand the gravity of the situation:MORE access to artificially intelligent sex robots could fuel a rise in sex addiction, warn psychology experts. While their creators claim they can prove a boon for struggling marriages and lonely or disabled men, experts aren’t convinced about their benefits to society at large. Dr Birchard, who serves as the clinical director of the Marylebone Centre for Psychological Therapies, said they serve the same purpose as alcohol for people with drinking problems.This precisely shows how unscrupulous humans are capitalising on the weaknesses of fellow humans, both parties digging their graves subconsciously!The World Health Organization reports that more than 300 million people currently live with depression, but nearly half of them aren’t getting the help they need. In such trying times, when humans, the ‘higher mammals’, are expected to reach out to each other, heal each other and uplift each other, robots are being built exclusively to render companionship. Target markets for companion robots include single children and the elderly people. Yet another fact to exemplify the submission of humans to Artificial Intelligence!While the effort to create Bandicoot, a robotic system for manhole and sewer line cleaning aimed at the complete elimination of manual scavenging from the face of earth, deserves appreciation and encouragement, the effort to create Sophia, a humanoid robot modeled after the desirable Audrey Hepburn that ended up becoming the first of its kind to attain the citizenship of a nation, doesn’t deserve the hype that it garnered. On the official website of Hanson Robotics, that created Sophia, the humanoid robot urges viewers to :“Think of me as a personification of our dreams for the future of AI, as well as a framework for advanced AI and robotics research, and an agent for exploring human-robot experience in service and entertainment applications.”It also adds:“With my science evolving so quickly, even many of my wildest fictional dreams may become reality someday soon.”Now that sounds really spooky!Artificial Intelligence is gradually wiping out the human touch. Not only labor intensive jobs but creative jobs like journalism are also under threat owing to its outreach. The vicious circle of humans programming robots to act like humans and disillusion them is eventually mechanizing humans. With the magnitude of autonomy that is being granted to robots, robots procreating robots may not be a distant phenomenon.

Two New Planets Discovered Using Artificial Intelligence

AUSTIN, Texas — Astronomers at The University of Texas at Austin, in partnership with Google, have used artificial intelligence (AI) to uncover two more hidden planets in the Kepler space telescope archive. The technique shows promise for identifying many additional planets that traditional methods could not catch.
The planets discovered this time were from Kepler’s extended mission, called K2.
To find them, the team, led by an undergraduate at UT Austin, Anne Dattilo, created an algorithm that sifts through the data taken by Kepler to ferret out signals that were missed by traditional planet-hunting methods. Long term, the process should help astronomers find many more missed planets hiding in Kepler data. The discoveries have been accepted for publication in an upcoming issue of The Astronomical Journal.
Other team members include NASA Sagan fellow at UT Austin Andrew Vanderburg and Google engineer Christopher Shallue. In 2017, Vanderburg and Shallue first used AI to uncover a planet around a Kepler star — one already known to harbor seven planets. The discovery made that solar system the only one known to have as many planets as our own.
Dattilo explained that this project necessitated a new algorithm, as data taken during Kepler’s extended mission K2 differs significantly from that collected during the spacecraft’s original mission.
Reaping the benefits of attending a premiere research university, undergraduate Anne Dattilo, a senior in the Department of Astronomy, led the discovery of the new planets. (Credit: Anne Dattilo.)
“K2 data is more challenging to work with because the spacecraft is moving around all the time,” Vanderburg explained. This change came about after a mechanical failure. While mission planners found a workaround, the spacecraft was left with a wobble that AI had to take into account.
The Kepler and K2 missions have already discovered thousands of planets around other stars, with an equal number of candidates awaiting confirmation. So why do astronomers need to use AI to search the Kepler archive for more?
“AI will help us search the data set uniformly,” Vanderburg said. “Even if every star had an Earth-sized planet around it, when we look with Kepler, we won’t find all of them. That’s just because some of the data’s too noisy, or sometimes the planets are just not aligned right. So, we have to correct for the ones we missed. We know there are a lot of planets out there that we don’t see for those reasons.
“If we want to know how many planets there are in total, we have to know how many planets we’ve found, but we also have to know how many planets we missed. That’s where this comes in,” he explained.
The two planets Dattilo’s team found “are both very typical of planets found in K2,” she said. “They’re really close in to their host star, they have short orbital periods, and they’re hot. They are slightly larger than Earth.”
Of the two planets, one is called K2-293b and orbits a star 1,300 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius. The other, K2-294b, orbits a star 1,230 light-years away, also located in Aquarius.
Once the team used their algorithm to find these planets, they followed up by studying the host stars using ground-based telescopes to confirm that the planets are real. These observations were done with the 1.5-meter telescope at the Smithsonian Institution’s Whipple Observatory in Arizona and the Gillett Telescope at Gemini Observatory in Hawaii.
The future of the AI concept for finding planets hidden in data sets looks bright. The current algorithm can be used to probe the entire K2 data set, Dattilo said — approximately 300,000 stars. She also believes the method is applicable to Kepler’s successor planet-hunting mission, TESS, which launched in April 2018. Kepler’s mission ended later that year.
Dattilo plans to continue her work using AI for planet hunting when she enters graduate school in the fall.

But there's a catch, although the AI system can fool the bot test it doesn't live-up to the promise its creators give it.CAPTCHAs are the tests used by websites to battle back against bots, asking website visitors to prove they're human before proceeding. The leading system is Google's reCAPTCHA, which has previously asked website visitors to prove their humanity by checking words scanned from books or photographs of street signs. That was replaced with behavioural analysis, requiring humans to simply tick a box proclaiming ""I'm not a robot"".Such systems have been hacked before. Indeed, the text and image based CAPTCHAs have been so frequently cracked that researchers in China and Lancaster University dubbed their paper on generative adversarial networks ""Yet another text CAPTCHA solver"". The accessible audio version was even targeted using speech-to-text tools to listen to the audio clips and upload an answer.Trending NowMoistCr1TiKaL Answers The Web's Most Searched QuestionsBut that all got harder at the end of last year, when Google revealed a CAPTCHA-less reCAPTCHA. Rather than unpicking garbled text or street signs, or even ticking a box that a website visitor is not a robot, version 3 of reCAPTCHA analyses a range of signals, giving a score between zero and one. Lower scores are more likely to be bots, while higher scores are more likely  to be human.That ranking happens entirely in the background; there's no human interaction at all. Google hasn't explained what goes into the bot-or-not score — no surprise, as hackers would be sure to make use of that information — but it appears to include the browser used, IP address, and whether they're logged into a Google account. After all, if Google knows it's you, it knows you're not a bot.That system hasn't yet been hacked, despite the title claim of the authors of a recent paper, ""Hacking Google reCAPTCHA v3 using Reinforcement Learning."" Instead, Mohamed Akrout, of the University of Toronto, and his co-authors focused on tricking a secondary system with machine learning. The invisible scoring system isn't abused, but nevertheless they claim they could still get past reCAPTCHA v3.AdvertisementIn reCAPTCHA v3, websites set their own score threshold for what they are willing to consider a bot or not. If a visitor falls under that threshold at a set point, such as when they're entering a review or login details, the website has two options, says Akrout. The first is to immediately show a page denouncing that visitor as a bot, which is a little awkward if the system is wrong and it's a human; imagine working your way through an online purchase to suddenly have the page you're looking at disappear and be shown a ""You're a bot"" accusation out of nowhere. ""This is a bad practice from a user experience perspective,"" says Akrout.Instead, Akrout says, many sites choose to negotiate the process a little more kindly. If a website visitor falls below the bot-or-not threshold, the site will surface a page with the older style ""I am not a robot"" checkbox, letting humans better understand why their online shopping experience or whatever else was interrupted and giving them a chance to prove their humanity.  ""Most programmers I know add checkboxes because they don't know how to choose a time at which they ask v3 about its belief."" By that, he means that version 3 has a constant score; websites can access it at any time. Do it at random, and a site will suddenly stop working.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDRead more: Captcha is dying. This is how it's being reinvented for the AI ageAnd it's in that gap that Akrout and his fellow researchers strike. The ""I am not a robot"" checkbox was introduced in version 2 of reCAPTCHA, analysing behaviour including mouse movements to spot bots. The researchers have created an automated system that can fool that part of reCAPTCHA.It's not directly addressing version 3's invisible scoring, but the mouse-movement analysis first introduced in version 2 — but because of how the system is implemented on some websites, it doesn't have to fool the newer system. In other words, they've found another way around reCAPTCHA using AI but it isn't quite as grand as promised.That doesn't convince Nan Jiang of the University of Bournemouth, who wasn't involved with this research. ""Theoretically, any CAPTCHA scheme purely relying on examining user behaviour can be hacked with tailored machine learning algorithms as such algorithms can be used to simulate a real user’s interaction on a page easily,"" he notes. ""However, Google ReCAPTCHA… combines other technologies to predict how much a client can be trusted and then try to whitelist that client. Once you get whitelisted, whatever you do will still allow you to pass the test.""Akrout and his fellow researchers fool the one section of reCAPTCHA using a type of machine learning called reinforcement learning, in which a software agent tries to find the best possible path, encouraged via rewards for each step it takes in the right direction. Their system lays a grid of squares across the page, working the mouse diagonally through the grid towards the ""I am not a robot button"". Given positive reinforcement if it's successful and negative if not, the system learns the right ways to move to convince reCAPTCHA the mouse is being controlled. The paper claims it works with 97.4 per cent accuracy. At the time of publication, Google had not responded to a request for comment about the paper.But Jason Polakis, assistant professor in computer science at the University of Illinois who cracked reCAPTCHA version 2, notes that there's more to v3 of reCAPTCHA than the work described in the paper. ""The attack that this paper attempts to demonstrate is simply moving from a random starting point in the page to the checkbox,"" he says. ""That is a very specific and limited subset of the interactions a user will have with an actual page in practice (e.g., filling out forms, interacting with multiple page elements, moving across more complicated patterns, etc).""He adds: ""If Google has also improved the use of more advanced techniques like browser/device fingerprinting (indications of which we had found when we did our extensive in-depth analysis and breaking of ReCaptcha v2), an attack will be even more complicated in practice.""Akrout agrees that the mouse-movement based attack has limits, but those reveal a bit about how reCAPTCHA v3 works. ""If you're connected with your Google account from a normal IP, then the system most of the time will return that you're a human,"" he says.

Akrout says the attack requires appearing neutral to Google — so no logged in accounts, but not coming in via a proxy or using browser control tools such as Selenium, either. ""It's as if I'm asking the system to go directly to the second [page], just to get the mass movement detection,"" he says.Akrout adds there are easy ways Google could protect reCAPTCHA from this technique, notably tracking the amount of time a user takes to click the button. ""The agent spends more time than humans to click on the checkbox,"" he noted. ""Anyone can always leave reCaptcha working in the background without any interaction,"" adds Akrout, leaving his attack unworkable.Shujun Li, professor of cyber security at the University of Kent, has previously designed his own systems to crack earlier versions of reCAPTCHA, but wasn't involved in this project. He says the work looks technically sound, but added that Google would be able to update its system easily to avoid the proposed attack. ""It remains unclear to what extend the proposed attack can be retrained to catch up,"" he said. ""A potentially more robust approach would be to collect real human users' responses to reCAPTCHA and build a machine learning model to simulate such responses, which can be easily retrained and will be guaranteed to work unless reCAPTCHA becomes unusable for normal human users.""Indeed, there's plenty of other ways to crack these systems, Li notes. While this particular attack may be limited, the fact that reCAPTCHA would continue to fall prey to artificial intelligence systems isn't a surprise. ""It has not been news that CAPTCHAs are crackable. Recent AI advances have significantly improved success rates of automated attacks,"" Li added. ""In principle, CAPTCHA as a technology has proved unable to resist advanced attacks.""

This means that India must do more to educate its general population in proper coding skills, the survey underscores.Meanwhile, the US engineers perform four times better than the Indian engineers in coding, with only 4% of them not able to write comilable code despite the fact that the base of the engineering population in the US is approximately four times smaller than in India, the report mulls.Also Read: What went wrong with Indian higher education It further emphasises that the Indian engineers need to move beyond basic coding skills to keep up with the demands of the 21st century. The tech industry needs graduates to be equipped with skills in AI, Machine Learning (ML) and data science to keep up with the changing requirements of the sector.The findings underline the sorry state of affairs in the engineering education parlance which is mainly theory-based where only 40 % of students perform internships while only 36 % undertake projects beyond their required coursework.The survey further stresses on the lack of industry exposure amongst students. &amp;quot;Students are trapped in a college bubble. They have little industry exposure. Only 47% of students attend industry talks. Sixty percent of faculty do not discuss how engineering concepts apply to industry,&amp;quot; it rues.Also Read: Good news for engineering students! Wipro plans to double campus hiring this year The report recommends that the concerns at hand can be addressed by a mix of counseling programmes and technology including AI along with tools that can aid students assess their skills, find company matches and prepare for interviews accordingly.&amp;quot;Our students need counseling to understand the kinds of jobs that are available; how to determine which job profiles match their interests and skills; the skill gaps that may disqualify them; and how to address those skill gaps.&amp;quot; It concludes.",https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/indian-engineers-tech-jobs-survey-80-per-cent-of-indian-engineers-not-fit-for-jobs-says-survey-181442-2019-03-25,,,,,,,,"80% of Indian engineers not fit for jobs, says survey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.headline', '.summary']}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businesstoday.in', 'name': 'News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businesstoday.in/latest', 'name': 'LATEST'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate', 'name': 'Corporate'}}]",,,,en_US,"{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/201903/engineering-students_660x450_032519065709.jpg?size=1280:720', 'caption': 'There has been no change in the employability prospects of Indian engineering graduates in the past nine years, with only a handful of them possessing next-gen tech skills, according to the new Annual Employability Survey 2019 report by Aspiring Minds.', 'width': '1200', 'height': '900'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
