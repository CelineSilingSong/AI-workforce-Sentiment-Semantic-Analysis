“Ensuring that human rights are strengthened and not undermined by artificial intelligence is one of the key factors that will define the world we live in”, says Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatović, in a Recommendation published today.
This Recommendation – entitled “Unboxing artificial intelligence: 10 steps to protect human rights” – provides a number of steps which national authorities can take to maximise the potential of artificial intelligence systems and prevent or mitigate the negative impact they may have on people’s lives and rights. It focuses on 10 key areas of action:

human rights impact assessment;
public consultations;
human rights standards in the private sector;
information and transparency;
independent oversight;
non-discrimination and equality;
data protection and privacy;
freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association, and the right to work;
access to remedies; and
the promotion of artificial intelligence literacy.

The Recommendation also contains an annexed checklist to help implement the measures recommended in each key area.
“Artificial intelligence driven technology is entering more aspects of every individual’s life, from smart home appliances to social media applications, and it is increasingly being utilised by public authorities to evaluate people’s personality or skills, allocate resources, and otherwise make decisions that can have real and serious consequences for the human rights of individuals. Finding the right balance between technological development and human rights protection is therefore an urgent matter”, says Commissioner Mijatović.
The Recommendation builds on work done in this area by the Council of Europe, as well as other international organisations. It is rooted in the existing universal, binding and actionable framework provided by the international human rights system.

Here are 8 tips on how best to do it.",,"Implementing artificial intelligence may seem like an insurmountable task, but it is vital. Here are 8 tips on how best to do it.",,https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,"
Don’t ignore AI – whatever you do
The most important thing for executives is to just start engaging with AI today – tomorrow is not good enough,” warns Shamus Rae, partner and head of digital disruption at KPMG UK. “Business leaders need to understand the capabilities of these new technologies and put in place an AI strategy that includes some clear self-challenge. This ensures that they don’t get stuck in ‘play’ mode and fail to make any tangible change to their operations or business model.” Mr Rae predicts that, due to the common misconception of AI, “we will see some major missteps by household names failing to adapt fast enough”.
Work out what specific challenge you’re trying to solve
“Think hard about what problem in your business you want to solve, not with artificial intelligence but with data,” advises Kim Nilsson, founder and chief executive of data science hub Pivigo. “The solution always needs to come from that intersection of where your business challenges overlap with available data sets. Only there will significant value lie in data science and AI.” Antony Bourne, industries president of global enterprise software company IFS, agrees. “Before you initiate any project, you must figure out your ‘why’,” he says. “What exactly do you want to improve and enhance? The more targeted your objectives, the more competitive and transformative your results.”
Target low-hanging fruit 
Clare Barclay, chief operating officer of Microsoft UK, advises business leaders to aim at small targets, or minor improvements – the so-called “low-hanging fruit” – when it comes to AI. “If you start thinking of the really big things, you do nothing,” she says. “Ask yourself: ‘What is the problem I am trying to fix?’” Dr Will Venters, assistant professor of information systems and innovation at the London School of Economics’ Department of Management, adds: “Starting with process improvement – perhaps through robotic process automation or simpler and proven AI algorithms – is more likely to be more profitable and successful than trying to push the envelope.”
Understanding data is critical to business success
David Gonzalez, head of big data for Vodafone Business, believes employees at every level should analyse data to maximise the potential of AI technologies. “A chief data officer and trained data scientists are very important to organisations looking to implement AI solutions,” he starts. “The integral role that data plays in powering businesses to succeed in today’s economy means that understanding data even at a basic level really has to be everyone’s job. The entire C-suite has to provide support, ensuring that their area is primed to harvest robust data and that stakeholders understand the value of using it in conjunction with analytics and AI.”
Decide whether to build or buy AI solutions
John Abel, Oracle’s vice principle of cloud and innovation in the UK and Ireland, says: “The next logical question is: ‘How do I implement?’” He continues: “This essentially boils down to either buying a pre-built AI application, or building your own. If you choose the former, your implementation time will likely be shorter, costs lower and maintenance easier. You won’t have to employ data scientists or pay for development platforms and architectural components to learn, buy, maintain and integrate. Buying a ready-to-go AI application provides the lowest barrier to entry, near-immediate benefits and they are often bundled with third-party data sources.”
Don’t forget about ethics
“A major issue with AI is trust,” posits Mr Abel. “The machine provides an output, but how can the user trust it made the right decision, or is recommending the correct action? To establish trust, a machine-learning algorithm needs to show its working and what data was important for the machine to make a particular output.” Ms Barclay of Microsoft UK urges executives to “establish a clear set of ethics, commitments and values around the use of AI. Not only will this ensure ethically grounded innovation, but it can support your bottom line, too. Microsoft research shows companies that consider what AI ‘should’ do have been shown to outperform those that don’t by 9 per cent.”

Take advantage of AI democratisation 
In a bid to help overcome the barrier to AI adoption because of a huge skill shortage, the introduction of pre-built algorithms and open-source machine-learning libraries is helping non-experts grapple with organisations’ data, and deliver insights through AI. Mark Skilton, professor of practice in information systems and management at Warwick Business School, heralds a newfound accessibility for AI solutions – the so-called democratisation of AI. He lauds the “astonishing” amount of, often free, online machine-learning and AI training on offer from Coursera, Udemy, as well as Stanford and Harvard universities, and many others.

Preach to the converted to accelerate workplace AI adoption
According to Maximising the AI Opportunity, Microsoft’s study published in October, some 67 per cent of the 1,000 executives and 59 per cent of employees surveyed are open to experimenting with AI – however, almost all of them will require training and development. For AI to stand the best chance of success in your organisation it is critical to seek out those workers who are most excited by its potential and nurture that interest. “By involving employees, you’re culturally engaging with them around the things that are going to change, and you’re equipping them with new skills,” suggests Ms Barclay.

The adoption of AI and machine learning is expanding rapidly across the manufacturing segment in countries like the U.S., owing to several key applications and benefits the technology delivers to enterprises that aim to enhance their business processes and product value.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in manufacturing has come a long way from the initial pilot project phase to becoming an imperative component of modern facilities around the world. The ease at which AI-powered machines and robots seem to be developed today have invigorated a sense of industrial revolution, fueled by accelerating investments in technologies like machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. AI can be considered to possess the potential to transform manufacturing processes at a global level, analogous to what Ford had achieved with the introduction of its moving assembly line nearly a century ago.
Worldwide, AI has already brought dramatical changes across industries such as enterprise software, cybersecurity, healthcare, finance and retail. It has influenced not only the way companies approach product development and service delivery but has also helped them keep pace with the evolving consumer demands and behaviors. Essentially, with abilities like machine learning at its core, AI can provide manufacturers with enhanced engineering, sensing, data analytics and quality control features that can boost their productivity and save considerable expenses.
The tremendous interest and acceptance of AI can be construed from the fact that in 2018, a record $9.33 billion was raised by AI start-ups in the U.S. from venture capital investments. Home to a vast number of manufacturing industries like automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical, food & beverage and electronics, the U.S. is certainly poised to witness a rapid expansion in the global landscape of AI in manufacturing marketOpens a new window .In addition, the achievements of tech giants like IBM, Intel, Google, Qualcomm and Microsoft in the deployment of AI software and hardware solutions for manufacturers have paved a critical path for emerging players to follow. From reducing unplanned process downtime to advancing product quality, workflow efficiency and employee safety, AI is leading the digital transformation of manufacturing companies and supporting the growth of process automation. 
Enumerating the benefits of deploying AI in manufacturing:
Worker injuries and losses due to inadequate demand forecast, equipment failure and poor planning have plagued the manufacturing industry for long and innovators have attempted to address these concerns with the help of technology. Replacing humans in hazardous tasks with AI-powered robots has undoubtedly averted countless injuries to factory staff globally, while optimizing energy utilization and improving production yield. AI in manufacturing effectively delivers multiple direct and indirect benefits to businesses and the overall community they cater to. The advantages delivered by the deployment of this technology are certain to help manufacturers gain access to a wide range of lucrative growth opportunities.
Cost Savings
Manufacturers have to bear huge expenses on material procurement, power supply and maintaining a reliable supply chain. AI has the potential to help companies estimate demand and keep track of raw material usage for ensuring there is no wastage of resources or shortage of inputs that can lead to a break in productivity. This is a crucial function since over or underestimating production targets cause revenue losses. An AI-based solution could also be deployed for connecting supply chain components like inventory management, order management, transport and procurement on a single platform to ease up and automate the processes. 
A prominent effect of adopting the technology at manufacturing facilities is that it saves immense amount of staff expenses, as lesser number of workers are needed to complete production activities. It must be noted that in a developed country like the U.S., labor costs are considered to be high, which is why major businesses establish plants in Asia. The remarkable cost savings achieved with the help of AI solutions will thus boost the manufacturing industry in the U.S. and tackle the increasing problem of labor shortfall. 
Inspection
Quality checks constitute one of the most important part of a manufacturing process, as any issues with a product, after reaching the end consumer, invariably damage the company’s reputation besides having to incur unnecessary losses. Inspecting products with the help of AI and machine learning could minimize the possibility of a defective product leaving the factory. Apparently, computer vision makes use of high-resolution cameras backed by AI to spot the tiniest of details and defects which even the most trained human eye can miss. 
ML enables these systems to improve through a small amount of sample images, saving considerable time and money. The rise of enterprise level connectivity solutions based on the cloud will supplement the growth of computer vision technologies in sectors like auto parts manufacturing and chip making, where mass production is carried out and instant response to identified defects is critical. 
Predictive maintenance
Traditionally, manufacturers have been undertaking preventive maintenance of machinery and equipment, often leading to long term contracts with third party services and expenses that run in thousands of dollars. Although this helps in avoiding production delays, valuable resources are diverted towards these activities and it also surges labor costs. 
However, using ML, businesses can make use of sensors and cutting-edge analytics integrated into the manufacturing equipment, which evaluate their condition in real time and provide alerts when any machine problem is to be resolved. The International Society of Automation estimates that every year, nearly $647 billion is lost due to machine downtime worldwide. As such, ML can be used to analyze current and historical data to predict future events, to optimize the use of resources and improve the reliability of plant equipment. 
Engineering and Design
Business have to face various challenges in meeting consumer demand and high product standards, including the development of new products or upgrading designs of the existing portfolio. By the adoption of a novel method called generative design, AI-based software are able to provide numerous solutions to a design or engineering problem. Supposedly, after users input the material, dimension, cost and process constraints in the system, ML tests and learns from every possible combination to see which solutions work as required.
Generative design allows for faster solving of design issues and is slated to offer enormous benefits in terms of resource efficiency and product quality. Representing one of the most innovative uses of the technology, General Motors had begun to use generative design to achieve vehicle weight reduction by exploring numerous permutations of auto part designs and coming up with hundreds of high-performance design options. 
Predictably, development of light and zero emission vehicles would offer significant opportunities for AI in manufacturing, especially with the likes of Ford, General Motors and many auto part companies in the U.S. working towards a more energy efficient future. Combined with the unprecedented growth in the consumption of IoT devices and the emergence of AI-based start-ups in the North America, the manufacturing segment can be expected to integrate AI along every step of the production lifecycle.

LinkedInFacebookWhatsAppXTelegramShare




Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing technology, which has become an integral part of several organisations. Many companies have started deploying this recent technology to get a better reach among consumers and clients. In fact, the trends in AI have huge implications on several industries including software, healthcare, automobile, manufacturing and more.






The rapid progress of Artificial Intelligence has led to trends such as deep learning, facial recognition, privacy, AI-enabled chips and cloud computing. When implemented the right way, these trends have the potential to transform the entire industry and garner a lot of traction among users.

The Barbican dives deep into artificial intelligence with More Than Human exhibition

Chatbots, facial recognition tech, deep-fake videos and newly commissioned installations by Es Devlin and Lawrence Lek are on display at The Barbican's sprawling AI: More Than Human exhibition.



The exhibition takes a wide-ranging approach to the topic of artificial intelligence, with immersive and interactive displays spread throughout the brutalist cultural centre.
Alter by Hiroshi Ishiguro is on display the Barbican's AI: More than Human exhibitionAs well as showcasing recent research projects out of innovation hubs like MIT, it incorporates historical artefacts such as a world war two-era Enigma Machine.
These sit alongside snippets from influential cultural products like Bladerunner and Frankenstein, and contemporary artworks with something to say about the intersection of nature and technology.
Devlin and Lek join Yuri Suzuki, TeamLab, Universal Everything, Neri Oxman, Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg, Yoichi Ochiai, DeepMind, Jigsaw, IBM and Google Arts and Culture in having contributed work to the exhibition.



Co(AI)xistence by Justine Emard is an interface between data and human motionCurators Barbican International Enterprises (BIE) produce one major show every two years, often looking at a topic of public interest through a mixed historical, scientific, social and creative lens.
""Artificial intelligence is a key marker of the zeitgeist and we are thrilled to be exploring the subject, both as a motive for scientific progress and a stimulus for creativity,"" said BIE head Neil McConnon.
Joy Buolamwini's work AI Ain't I A Woman explores how AI can discriminate against minority ethnic facesThe main exhibition is installed in The Curve gallery. It opens with a look at the golem figure from Judaism and the concept of animism — the attribution of a living soul to everything around us, even inanimate objects — from the Shinto faith.
This is part of a section called The Dream of AI, which also looks at early experiments in alchemy, and asks the audience to consider how human history might have primed the ground for our current relationship with technology.
2065 by Lawrence Lek allows visitors to explore an imagined future where humans exclusively play video gamesThe next section is called Mind Machines and focuses on early innovations in AI stretching back to the 1800s. It looks at Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine and Ada Lovelace, often considered the first computer programmer.
Alan Turing and the codebreakers of Bletchley Park, IBM's chess-playing computer Deep Blue, robots like MIT's swimming SoFi and chatbots such as Mitsuku also feature in this part of the exhibition.
Es Devlin's PoemPortraits sits outside the main exhibition spaceData Worlds follows, which explores how artificial intelligence can help us improve aspects of our lives such as road safety, medical diagnostics and city planning through the likes of the Kreyon City project by Sony Computer Science Laboratories.
This allows visitors to build a city out of Lego — with one eye on their citizens' projected quality of life.
TeamLab's WALABW can be found in the Pit theatre of the cultural centreThis section also includes more dystopian aspects, such as the University of Washington's Synthesizing Obama ""deep fake"" video, which shows the former US president saying things he hasn't said.
Another theme here is the replication of human biases through limited data-sets, with Joy Buolamwini's work showing how often facial-recognition fails to recognise black faces.
The final section of the main exhibition is the most experimental. Called Endless Evolution, it presents Massive's Attack's Mezzanine album encoded into artificial DNA contained in spray cans, Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine's bioengineered tissues and organs, and Neri Oxman's Synthetic Apiary to help bee populations.
Myriad (Tulips) by Anna Ridler demonstrates the way in which algorithms ""learn"" from dataMost of the large-scale, commissioned installations sit outside of the main exhibition, occupying other spaces in The Barbican.

In The Pit theatre is TeamLab's interactive digital installation What a Loving and Beautiful World, a calming environment populated by butterflies and Chinese letterforms.
In the foyer is Es Devlin's PoemPortraits, created with Google Arts and Culture, where visitors can contribute a word and have AI weave it into a cumulative, collaborative poem.
Totem by Chris Salter is a digital art work that stands floor to ceiling in the Barbican's foyerNearby is Lawrence Lek's playable 2065, created for a speculative future where we spend all day playing video games, and Yuri Suzuki's Electronium, where visitors can compose with AI.
There's also Universal Everything's interactive Future You, which will evolve throughout the exhibition by learning from visitors' movements, Chris Salter's ceiling-high digital Totem and Certain Measures' A Machine View of London video work mapping one million buildings in London.
What-a-Loving-and-Beautiful-World is an immersive digital art work by TeamLabMuseums around the world are exploring themes of technology, robotics and the future — including, recently, fellow London institution the V&A with The Future Starts Here — but The Barbican's may be the biggest and most ambitious attempt to date.
BIE worked with guest curators Suzanne Livingston and Maholo Uchida on the exhibition, which will tour after it finishes its run at The Barbican. BIE's previous exhibition, 2017's Into the Unknown: A Journey Through Science Fiction, is still touring.
AI: More Than Human opens at The Barbican today and runs until 26 August 2019.

Beneath the surface web, the public form of the internet you use daily to check email or read news articles, exists a concealed ""dark web."" Host to anonymous, password-protected sites, the dark web is where criminal marketplaces thrive in the advertising and selling of weapons, drugs, and trafficked persons. Law enforcement agencies work continuously to stop these activities, but the challenges they face in investigating and prosecuting the real-world people behind the users who post on these sites are tremendous.
""The pop-up nature of dark-web marketplaces makes tracking their participants and their activities extremely difficult,"" says Charlie Dagli, a researcher in MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Artificial Intelligence Technology and Systems Group. Dagli is referring to the fast rate at which dark-web markets close down (because they are hacked, raided, abandoned, or set up as an ""exit scam"" in which the site shuts down intentionally after customers pay for unfulfilled orders) and new ones appear. These markets' short lifetimes, from a few months to a couple years, impede efforts to identify their users.
To overcome this challenge, Lincoln Laboratory is developing new software tools to analyze surface- and dark-web data.
These tools are leveraging the one benefit this whack-a-mole-like problem presents — the connections sellers and buyers maintain across multiple layers of the web, from surface to dark, and across dark-web forums. ""This constant switching between sites is now an established part of how dark-web marketplaces operate,"" Dagli says.
Users are making new profiles constantly. Although they may not be employing the same usernames from site to site, they are keeping their connections alive by signaling to each other through their content. These signals can be used to link personas belonging to the same user across dark-web forums and, more revealingly, to link personas on the dark web to the surface web to uncover a user's true identity.
Linking users on the dark web is what law enforcement already tries to do. The problem is that the amount of data that they need to manually shuffle through — 500,000 phone numbers and 2 million sex ads posted a month — is too large and unstructured for them to find connections quickly. Thus, only a low percentage of cases can be pursued.
To automate the persona-linking process, Lincoln Laboratory is training machine learning algorithms to compute the similarity between users on different forums. The computations are based on three aspects of users' communications online: ""How they identify to others, what they write about, and with whom they write to,"" Dagli explains.
The algorithm is first fed data from users on a given Forum A and creates an authorship model for each user. Then, data from users on Forum B are run against all user models from Forum A. To find matches for profile information, the algorithm looks for straightforward clues, such as changes in username spelling like ""sergeygork"" on Forum A to ""sergey gorkin"" on Forum B, or more subtle similarities like ""joe knight"" to ""joe nightmare.""
The next feature the system looks at is content similarity. The system picks up on unique phrases — for example, ""fun in the sun"" — that are used in multiple ads. ""There's a lot of copy-and-paste going on, so similar phrasings will pop up that are likely from the same user,"" Dagli says. The system then looks for similarities in a user's network, which is the circle of people that the user interacts with, and the topics that the user's network discusses.
The profile, content, and network features are then fused to provide a single output: a probability score that two personas from two forums represent the same real-life person.
The researchers have been testing these persona-linking algorithms both with open-source Twitter and Instagram data and hand-labeled ground truth data from dark-web forums. All of the data used in this work are obtained through authorized means. The results are promising. ""Every time we report a match, we are correct 95 percent of the time. The system is one of the best linking systems that we can find in the literature,"" Dagli says. 
This work is the most recent development in ongoing research. From 2014 to 2017, Lincoln Laboratory contributed to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Memex program. Memex resulted in a suite of surface- and dark-web data analysis software developed collaboratively with dozens of universities, national laboratories, and companies. Ten laboratory technologies spanning text, speech, and visual analytics that were created for Memex were released as open-source software via the DARPA Open Catalog.
Today, more than 30 agencies worldwide are using Memex software to conduct investigations. One of the biggest users, and a stakeholder in Memex's development, is the Human Trafficking Response Unit (HTRU) in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. stated in a written testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives that his office used Memex tools to screen more than 6,000 arrests for signs of human trafficking in 2017 alone. ""We also used Memex in 271 human trafficking investigations and in six new sex trafficking indictments that were brought in 2017,"" he stated. With the introduction of Memex, prostitution arrests screened by HTRU for human trafficking indicators increased from 5 to 62 percent, and investigations of New York Police Department prostitution-related arrests increased from 15 to 300 per year.
Jennifer Dolle, the deputy chief of HTRU, visited the laboratory to present how the unit has benefited from these technologies. ""We use these tools every single day. They really have changed how we do business in our office,"" Dolle says, explaining that prior to Memex, a human trafficking investigation could take a considerably longer time.
Now, Memex tools are enabling HTRU to quickly enhance emerging cases and build sex trafficking investigations from leads that have little information. For example, these tools — including one called TellFinder (built by Memex contributor Uncharted Software) for indexing, summarizing, and searching sex ad data — have been used to identify additional, underage victims from data in a single online prostitution advertisement. ""These additional investigative leads allow HTRU to prosecute traffickers on violent felony charges and hold these defendants responsible for the true nature of the crimes they commit against vulnerable victims,"" says Dolle.
Researchers are continuing to learn how emerging technologies can be tailored to what agencies need and for how the dark web operates. ""Data-driven machine learning has become a demonstrably important tool for law enforcement to combat illicit online marketplaces on the dark web,"" says Lin Li, a principal investigator of this continuous work in the laboratory’s Human Dynamic Dark Networks program, which is funded through the laboratory’s Technology Office. ""But, some of the ongoing challenges and areas of research include expanding our understanding of the demand economy, disrupting the supply economy, and gaining a better overall situational awareness.""
A better understanding of how the supply-and-demand chains of the dark-web economy work will help the team develop technologies to disrupt these chains. Part of the goal is to raise the risks of participating in this illicit economy; linking personas on the dark web to those on the surface web is one potentially powerful tactic.
""This fast-growing illicit economy was shown by DARPA to fund terrorist activities and shown by HTRU as a driver of modern-day slavery. Defeating terrorism and eliminating slavery are national and humanitarian needs,"" says Joseph Campbell, leader of the Artifical Intelligence Technology and Systems Group. ""Our group has extrodinary expertise in AI, machine learning, and the analysis of human networks based on information extracted from multilanguage speech, text, and video combined with network communications and activities. The state-of-the-art technologies that we create, develop, and advance are transferred to our sponsors, who use them daily with tremendous impact for these national and humanitarian needs.""

Since before the dawn of the computer age, scientists have been captivated by the idea of creating machines that could behave like humans. But only in the last decade has technology enabled some forms of artificial intelligence (AI) to become a reality.
Interest in putting AI to work has skyrocketed, with burgeoning array of AI use cases. Many surveys have found upwards of 90 percent of enterprises are either already using AI in their operations today or plan to in the near future.
Eager to capitalize on this trend, software vendors – both established AI companies and AI startups – have rushed to bring AI capabilities to market. Among vendors selling big data analytics and data science tools, two types of artificial intelligence have become particularly popular: machine learning and deep learning.
While many solutions carry the “AI,” “machine learning,” and/or “deep learning” labels, confusion about what these terms really mean persists in the market place. The diagram below provides a visual representation of the relationships among these different technologies:
As the graphic makes clear, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. In other words, all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning.
Similarly, deep learning is a subset of machine learning. And again, all deep learning is machine learning, but not all machine learning is deep learning.

AI, machine learning and deep learning are each interrelated, with deep learning nested within ML, which in turn is part of the larger discipline of AI.
Artificial Intelligence ‘Contains’ Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Computers excel at mathematics and logical reasoning, but they struggle to master other tasks that humans can perform quite naturally.
For example, human babies learn to recognize and name objects when they are only a few months old, but until recently, machines have found it very difficult to identify items in pictures. While any toddler can easily tell a cat from a dog from a goat, computers find that task much more difficult. In fact, captcha services sometimes use exactly that type of question to make sure that a particular user is a human and not a bot.
In the 1950s, scientists began discussing ways to give machines the ability to “think” like humans. The phrase “artificial intelligence” entered the lexicon in 1956, when John McCarthy organized a conference on the topic. Those who attended called for more study of “the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.”
Some of these early researchers believed it would be only a few years before they solved these problems. In reality, however, it took several decades for computer hardware and software to advance to the point where AI applications like image recognition, natural language processing and machine learning became possible.
Critics rightly point out that there is a big difference between an AI system that can tell the difference between cats and dogs and a computer that is truly intelligent in the same way as a human being. Most researchers believe that we are years or even decades away from creating an artificial general intelligence (also called strong AI) that seems to be conscious in the same way that humans beings are — if it will ever be possible to create such a system at all.
If artificial general intelligence does one day become a reality, it seems certain that machine learning will play a major role in the system’s capabilities.
Machine Learning: A Key Driver of AI
Machine learning is the particular branch of AI concerned with teaching computers to “improve themselves,” as the attendees at that first artificial intelligence conference put it. Another 1950s computer scientist named Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as “the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”
In traditional computer programming, a developer tells a computer exactly what to do. Given a set of inputs, the system will return a set of outputs — just as its human programmers told it to.
Machine learning is different because no one tells the machine exactly what to do. Instead, they feed the machine data and allow it to learn on its own.
In general, machine learning takes three different forms: 
Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is one of the oldest types of machine learning, and it is very useful in teaching a computer how to play a game.
For example, Arthur Samuel created one of the first programs that used reinforcement learning. It played checkers against human opponents and learned from its successes and mistakes. Over time, the software became much better at playing checkers.
Reinforcement learning is also useful for applications like autonomous vehicles, where the system can receive feedback about whether it has performed well or poorly and use that data to improve over time.
Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is particularly useful in classification applications such as teaching a system to tell the difference between pictures of dogs and pictures of cats.
In this case, you would feed the application a whole lot of images that had been previously tagged as either dogs or cats. From that training data, the computer would draw its own conclusions about what distinguishes the two types of animals, and it would be able to apply what it learned to new pictures.
As the system absorbed more data over time, it would become better and better at the task. This technique is said to be “supervised” because it requires humans to tag the images in advance and oversee the learning process.
Unsupervised Learning
By contrast, unsupervised learning does not rely on human beings to label training data for the system. Instead, the computer uses clustering algorithms or other mathematical techniques to find similarities among groups of data.
Unsupervised machine learning is particularly useful for the type of big data analytics that interests many enterprise leaders. For example, you could use unsupervised learning to spot similarities among groups of customers and better target your marketing or tailor your pricing.
Some recommendation engines rely on unsupervised learning to tell people who like one movie or book what other movies or books they might enjoy. Unsupervised learning can also help identify characteristics that might indicate a person’s credit worthiness or likelihood of filing an insurance claim.
Various AI applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, facial recognition, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, knowledge engines, emotion recognition, and other types of systems, often make use of machine learning capabilities. Some combine two or more of the main types of machine learning, and in some cases, are said to be “semi-supervised” because they incorporate some of the techniques of supervised learning and some of the techniques of unsupervised learning. And some machine learning techniques — such as deep learning — can be supervised, unsupervised, or both.
Deep Learning: The Powerhouse Driving ML and AI
The phrase “deep learning” first came into use in the 1980s, making it a much newer idea than either machine learning or artificial intelligence.
Deep learning describes a particular type of architecture that both supervised and unsupervised machine learning systems sometimes use. Specifically, it is a layered architecture where one layer takes an input and generates an output. It then passes that output on to the next layer in the architecture, which uses it to create another output. That output can then become the input for the next layer in the system, and so on. The architecture is said to be “deep” because it has many layers.
To create these layered systems, many researchers have designed computing systems modeled after the human brain. In broad terms, they call these deep learning systems artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs come in several different varieties, including deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and others. These neural networks use nodes that are similar to the neurons in a human brain.
Neural networks and deep learning have become much more popular over the last decade in part because hardware advances, particularly improvements in graphics processing units (GPUs), have made them much more feasible. Traditionally, system designers used GPUs to perform the advanced calculations necessary for displaying high-quality video and 3D gaming.
However, those GPUs also excel at the type of calculations necessary for deep learning. As GPU performance has improved and costs have decreased, people have been able to create high-performance systems that can complete deep learning tasks in much less time and for much less cost than would have been the case in the past.
Today, anyone can easily access deep learning capabilities through cloud services like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and IBM Cloud.

How will AI and machine learning change how sleep medicine providers treat their patients?

By Lisa Spear
Right now it’s typical for sleep technologists to mull over pages of polysomnography (PSG) data related to eye movements, respiration, brain activity, and more, to look for indicators of sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea or narcolepsy. Machine learning could revolutionize sleep medicine by taking over the diagnostic process, identifying gaps in care, and helping predict CPAP adherence even before therapy begins.
“I think [sleep medicine] is a field that is ripe for disruption in really being able to apply big data and big data tools to our field and perhaps even be a leading force in terms of how machine learning and artificial intelligence can really impact patients in the way that we deliver care,” says sleep specialist Dennis Hwang, MD, director of Kaiser Permanente’s San Bernardino County Sleep Center.

This is why sleep technology companies across the globe are taking the initiative to develop new programs that will one day make artificial intelligence (AI) a mainstay in sleep clinics. One Iceland-based sleep technology company, Nox Medical, created a branch in 2015 called Nox Research, which focuses on developing AI tools to automate sleep study scoring and extract new insights from sleep study data. Since the program began, Nox has released an AI-powered automatic sleep detector as part of the company’s sleep analysis software Noxturnal.
“We see this as an opportunity to empower the sleep techs and doctors to improve diagnosis or serve larger patient populations without adding to their workload,” says Jon S. Agustsson, co-director of Nox Research.
The Nox researchers are also working on AI tools to detect arousals during sleep. “The identification of arousals is important for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, but manual scoring is time consuming and requires expertise,” says Halla Helgadottir, co-director of Nox Research.
Agustsson adds, “A very difficult project to apply AI to is detecting rare events, which either are not well defined, where humans do not agree well on the scoring, or the scored labels do not overlap exactly over the periods where the event occurs. An example of this is AI to detect arousals in EEG. Arousals are only a small part of EEG signals.
“To further complicate things, when arousals are typically scored there is usually not concern with [their] exact timing….The timing of the manually scored event may vary by multiple seconds from the actual timing of the event. In this case it is difficult for the AI tool to learn what is an arousal (since it learns from the data it sees), and it is difficult to measure the performance of the AI tool since it will not always agree with the human-scored labels. To make things even worse is that arousals can occur at any time and can last for various amounts of time. This is much more difficult to deal with than classifying each 30-second epoch.”
Nox researchers are making progress on automated scoring of arousals, and their results from the latest version of the arousal scorer will be presented as an abstract at SLEEP 2019.1
Another healthcare tech company, Somnoware, has deployed a cloud-based platform that uses machine learning to help physicians estimate the likelihood of 90-day CPAP therapy compliance. The software works by mining patient data from electronic medical records, patient questionnaires, and lab visits. This data includes demographic information and comorbidities, which all help to build a machine learning model to predict short- and long-term CPAP compliance even before the patient is put on therapy, according to a release.
As more data comes into the program, the model automatically updates its predictions. This way, clinicians can track trends in compliance and determine the likely impact of certain interventions on patient outcomes.

“Our goal is to bring valuable information to physicians early, so it can be used for proactive patient care management,” says Raj Misra, PhD, chief data scientist and vice president of marketing at Somnoware.
AI could also change the diagnostic process. For instance, researchers from the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine developed an AI system to analyze sleep stages to diagnose narcolepsy, finding that AI could use datasets to pinpoint unusual sleep staging more accurately than a human sleep tech. Results were published in a 2018 paper in Nature Communications.2
“Right now [sleep test scoring] is done by technicians, and clearly, there is no reason why it couldn’t be done by a computer,” says sleep specialist Emmanuel Mignot, MD, PhD, an author of the study and the director of the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine.
The Stanford researchers first told six techs to analyze and score sleep data, looking for changes in sleep staging that could indicate narcolepsy. After the researchers averaged those scores, they then trained an AI program to “learn” specific data trends. They did this by providing it with 3,000 sleep study recordings. The results demonstrated that the AI system could actually score sleep tests more accurately than its human counterparts.
“Sleep studies are quite complicated, a bit subjective, so artificial intelligence is really ideal,” says Mignot.
AI-powered sleep test autoscoring software is a tool that could one day be a common way to save time and resources in sleep clinics. Madison, Wis-based tech company EnsoData has moved in this direction, creating the software EnsoSleep, which combines American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring recommendations with algorithms that analyze sleep data; the company says this can help diagnose sleep disorders like sleep apnea, according to a Wisconsin State Journal article written by EnsoData co-founder and CEO Chris Fernandez.3

“Our mission at EnsoData is to create more time for direct patient care and the cultivation of meaningful patient relationships, the aspect of medicine that the majority of clinicians report as the most satisfying part of the practice, by automating these heavily manual data tasks with powerful artificial intelligence software,” Fernandez wrote.
EnsoSleep received FDA 510(k) clearance in 2017 to automate PSG and home sleep tests. According to the article, since the FDA clearance, EnsoSleep has been used by dozens of clinics across the country to improve patient access to care and preserve sleep clinic resources.
“As growth of the patient population increasingly outpaces the size of our clinical workforce, artificial intelligence will play a critical role in empowering clinicians with tools that scale and amplify their ability to provide care for a far greater number of patients,” Fernandez says in the article.
Other technologies are also on the horizon. Morpheo, an open-source initiative to help develop machine learning models for automatic and predictive diagnosis of sleep disorders, is a project based in Paris, France. “The idea was to develop algorithms that would help and assist doctors with clinical sleep work,” explains Marco Brigham, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at École Polytechnique.
“Basically we are working on the AI aspect of the project to assist physicians in sleep medicine,” says Brigham. Since the funding for this project is wrapping up in June, it is unclear if clinicians will ever get to use it, but Brigham says there is still plenty of potential for AI to impact patient care.
At Kaiser Permanente in California, sleep researchers have been having discussions to brainstorm the concept of an “AI bot.” It’s not going to be the cyborg one might envision but would likely be a downloadable smartphone app, according to Hwang.
The AI bot would be a companion to help troubleshoot problems with sleep apnea care. If a patient is struggling to adjust to the air pressure of their CPAP, they might first chat with the AI bot before consulting a physician. The AI bot would then be able to check in on the patient to ask them how they are and inquire about their sleep quality or daytime sleepiness. “It would utilize true intelligence to provide an interactive process,” says Hwang.
“Part of our vision is developing an AI bot that would be able to interact with a patient frequently in an intelligent way. It would ask the patient how they are doing, how they are feeling, and be able to provide some mechanism to improve some cognitive behavioral aspects of care,” says Hwang. “There may be some issues that can be dealt with by the AI bot that may not involve a sleep provider.”

Introduction
What if going to school means learning from robots and making stuff which gets paid by the government? What if you get a chance to jump grades and do cooler stuff simply because you are already at that stage of professional knowledge and competency? What if graduating from University or Polytechnic is not good enough? What if you need to be an expert by the time you graduate from school simply because autonomous machines and automation have taken over work that is predictable and regular? What if you don’t have the time and opportunity to formulate and develop your expertise? What should you do?
I was in AI 30 years ago and by that, I mean Armoured Infantry, during my national service days. I understood what it meant to fight tanks with tanks. It was really no use using rifles to shoot at tanks. Similarly, we need to use AI to compete with AI because any other way is likely to be futile. To be clear, it is still early days yet for AI but the potential of AI represents a huge leap in the processing capability of machines, moving into areas such as visual recognition, and analysis of big data.
“Fight tanks with tanks, AI with AI”
We need to use AI to learn faster, better and more effectively. Human learning has to increase at an exponential rate because machine learning outscores and outlasts human learning on almost all counts.
 
 
How to Better Equip Ourselves in the Face of Artificial Intelligence and Automation
In the story of two men foraging for food in a forest and a bear appearing out of nowhere, we were told that to survive, one does not need to run faster than the bear but to outrun the other person.
In this analogy, if we take artificial intelligence (AI) and automation as the bear, and ourselves as the men who need to outrun each other or if possible, the bear itself, the challenges and our corresponding plans may become clearer to us. Hence, one solution that we may consider is simply to outcompete the other person and not necessarily the bear.
“But how does this analogy work?”
Technology has moulded and shaped the workforce over the years. From improving efficiency to workplace safety, it has forever changed how we approach and do work. In fact, every industrial revolution of the past were sparked by a new breakthrough in technology: the first was brought forth by the invention of steam engines, liberating us from overdependence on animal labour, the second was made possible by using electricity to drive mass production, which helped feed the rising demand of the global population and more recently, the third, where digital technology has helped to connect billions online.
It does not stop there, though. A fourth industrial revolution is on the horizon and it mainly revolves around Artificial intelligence (AI). With improvements in technology, machine learning algorithms are becoming ever versatile and AI can be eventually programmed to perform activities that follow a predictable pattern. These include cooking, cleaning, driving, reviewing MRI scans and many other behaviours. The implication is that many processes performed by human specialists can and will be automated. In fact, in their (2017) report, McKinsey & Co. predicts 60% of all jobs have at least 30% of activities which are able to be automated and this will result in a loss of 400 to 800 million jobs by the year 2030. For companies, this presents higher efficiency and profit margins as AI and automation eliminate human error and limitations. However, for the employee, the outlook turns negative. The encroaching AI and automation (the ‘Bear’) results in stiffer competition as both human and machine race for that job role.
The Global Status Report on Road Safety (2018), published by WHO in December 2018, highlights that the number of annual road traffic deaths has reached 1.35 million fatalities. Road traffic injuries are now the leading killer of people aged 5-29 years globally and the majority of those killed are the pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists.
Research by Ohio University (2017) indicates that with driverless vehicles, also known as Grade 5 Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), we can benefit from AI in at least three ways:

Reduced rate of accidents due to human misjudgement and lapses in decision-making


Reduced travelling time due to more efficient pathing and avoiding of congestion


Reduced carbon emission due to more efficient braking and acceleration

 
Where do humans figure in this equation? 
It seems that human intervention is still required whether remotely or physically when the AV is in operation. Currently, most AVs’ autopilot is not extremely reliable and humans still has to take over the wheel when needed. Refer to the diagram on the 6 stages of automation in vehicles.
 

The 6 stages of automation in road vehicles
 
In the long run, if full automation were to take place, human drivers will monitor and control the AVs remotely from a control centre, overriding the automation when necessary (e.g. Calderone (n.d.) on Robotics Tomorrow). Imagine a whole army of driving controllers in every state and city, overseeing millions of AVs globally.
Hence, while AI encroaches into the driving industry, displacing millions of jobs, there are new jobs which will appear. Some of these jobs will have better compensation packages than current jobs. The critical question is which of the displaced drivers will be able to take on these new jobs.
 
Job mobility is important as it can provide you with more career pathways
If you are currently a professional driver, will you be able to outcompete other drivers to take on these new roles? Interestingly, the concept of feeder role is not new (e.g. Career Framework by Mercer). What this means is that employers will require staff with new capabilities. Often, these new capabilities require the layering on of new competencies and mindsets over current professional beliefs and values. 
 
As 2-time winners of the national InnovPlus Competition (2017 and 2018 editions) in Singapore, our team developed chatbots to drive a new experience for online learning. With chatbots for learning, curriculum designers no longer work on lesson plans or storyboards but on conversational trees. It utilises a branching methodology to drive learning scenarios and decision-making. The new designer capability is demanding. It layers new engagement pedagogy over foundational adult education beliefs and principles. Conversational tree designers are required to have strong foundational skills in designing online courses before they can be considered to take on this new role. What makes a potential conversational tree designer? The feeder capabilities include a sensitivity to learner needs, scripting fluency and instructional design.
In the 2019 survey by the Ministry of Manpower (MoM), the highest number of job vacancies was for trainers and assessors, over and above jobs such as accounting and computing.
Going forward, the Continuing Education and Training sector will require even more professionals especially those with technology-enabled learning skillsets.
Based on research published by Carl Benedikt and Michael A. Osborne from Oxford University (2013), jobs requiring:
Creativity and Innovation (R&D), Complexity and Management (Entrepreneurship) or Empathy and Compassion (social-workers, care-givers)
 
Teachers and trainers are high in demand but low in supply are less at risk of automation. It will be difficult for AI to replicate these roles due to the intrinsic nature of such work.
Automation will not be able to replace the entire workforce, so it is important to understand how AI and us will work together in the future. Homing in the evolving skillsets that are valuable to your job description can help you remain competitive as well as offer you opportunities to progress either horizontally (Across industries) or vertically (Within your industry).
Knowing how to make space for AI and automation will be critical for human workforce development so that human workers perform the roles that involve decision-making and pre-empting errors. Remember technology has the capability to multiply impact enormously so any mistake can be horrifyingly catastrophic.
So when the bear appears, we can either…
 Run faster than the other person by developing our capability to fit into the feeder jobs
Or
Move into spaces which AI may not necessarily encroach into at this point in time
 
As an Adult Educator trainer and mentor, I have coached more than 10,000, teachers, trainers and instructional designers over the past 20 years – some at novice levels but also many at intermediate and expert levels.
More recently, one of my learners working in a semiconductor industry was told to codify his skills so that the organisation can automate his role. John (not his real name) understood his role so well that besides codifying his skillsets, he also highlighted areas which would need a lot more work and could not be automated.  John’s boss was so impressed with John’s meticulous work that he kept John to oversee the automation process while his counterpart performing the same role in Switzerland was retrenched. In short, John outdid the competition by getting into the feeder role, which was to manage the on-going and future automation process.
What John provided was a blueprint on how a worker could get into the feeder role during the automation process; he carried out the following tasks: 

Codified key skillsets
Value added by signalling where machines cannot yet do the job
Specialised in plugging the skills gaps 
Facilitated the business process transformation
Operated at expertise level by reviewing the automation process by putting on strategic, innovative and metacognitive lenses
Maintained a resilient mindset even though he was given advance notice of a possible retrenchment or job redesign

As with John’s organisation, all enterprises seeking to automate will eventually need experts to manage the automation at the operational, supervisory and management levels. These experts work with intelligent machines to automate some of the current manual processes and in the long run, pre-empt errors as well as override the machines in the event of faults and accidents. The Air Ethiopia and Lion Air crashes involving the Boeing Max planes in 2019 taught us a few valuable lessons. One of which must be the re-examination of how humans think in relation to intelligent machines and automation.
 
Have pilots forgotten how to fly without autopilot? 
Due to the high level of trust built up over the years of usage, pilots stop questioning the validity and accuracy of data put forth by machines and the corresponding behaviour of these machines. To actually rise above the curtain of trust and question the machine data and behaviour requires a different manner of training approach.
“With so much automation in the flight deck nowadays … pilots may feel safer psychologically to keep relying on some autopilot functions ...”

Prof. Terence Fatt (Singapore Management University)

Effectively, pilots are trained to rely on machines and data to make decisions and this can be disastrous as the two air crashes demonstrate. Deciding when to cart over from relying on machines and automation to human decision-making is not a choice to be made lightly, especially under time pressure. Hence, this decision-making to question machines must be part of the training.
One approach that we have adopted over the years was to design errors intentionally into training, to develop metacognition and expertise. Through errors, practitioners are facilitated to question underpinning beliefs and assumptions during training, thus building elements of metacognition and deep expertise. However, most training in Singapore and globally does not deal with expertise training, only competency-level training.
With AI taking over competency-level tasks, we will short-change our learners if we do not shift learning designs to developing expertise. The race has changed. As AI is trained through massive data and feedback, any behaviour that can be tracked with the outcomes measured and feedback given, AI can and will improve at breakneck speed. Hence, competency-based tasks are perfect for AI to tap on, primarily because all competency-based training (CBT) are underpinned by measurable outcomes. If humans continue to depend on CBT, we will likely be outrun and out-thought over time.
 
Conclusion
In short, we can no longer win a 100-metre race; we have to stretch it to 110 metres. The intelligent machines can complete 100m in less than 1s (as an example). Humans take on average, about 10s. However, most intelligent machines cannot yet reach 110m. They do not quite have the metacognition, innovative mindsets, ability to pre-empt errors and question assumptions. Humans can complete the additional 10m run only if they are appropriately trained.
However, the majority of the workforce are trained to be only competent. Moving them into the expertise zone (i.e. the additional 10 m) will take a concerted effort to coach and mentor them, so that they can outcompete the intelligent machines and human resources in other countries.
The bears are coming!
We cannot assume things will remain the same. However, if you ask any man on the street how he is preparing for AI, the response is usually a puzzled look or to take each day as it comes. Some expect the government to resolve the challenges brought about by AI. Not many are thinking about the future, nor can they do anything about it. The learned helplessness can be incapacitating and disempowering.
We need a more ingenious and simple approach to get people into feeder roles, by training them to reach expertise levels. The competition will be stiff, the learning will be unprecedented but the opportunities and rewards can be immense and satisfying, only if we can ride the oncoming AI wave – to run and keep on running.

Artificial Intelligence at AT&T: Our Guiding Principles
By Tom Moore





share
































It started with a mouse in 1950 – a mechanical mouse that learned how to navigate a maze from experience. It was developed at AT&T’s Bell Labs, and it’s often considered the world’s first example of machine learning.
The mouse has grown into the field of Artificial Intelligence – a game-changing technology we use across our business. AI helps build and optimize the 5G network. It helps to fight fraud and enhance cybersecurity. We even use AI to guide our truck dispatch, helping technicians reach customers on time.
Artificial Intelligence is defined as a non-human system that mimics human intelligence. But another term is equally important: Ethics. It’s a system of moral standards and human values. It still belongs to people, and people still have responsibility for the outcomes generated by AI.
Here are the guiding principles that AT&T has adopted for working with Artificial Intelligence:
1.       By People, For People
We incorporate human oversight into AI. With people at the core, AI can enhance the workforce, expand capability and benefit society as a whole.
2.       Accessible and Shared
We support open-source communities whenever appropriate to further access, collaboration, standardization and participation in industry discussion.
3.       Secure and Ethical
We are grounded in ethics, safety, and values at every stage of AI, including our privacy principles and security safeguards.

­   Design: We use varied, validated datasets and diverse human input to achieve objectives.
­   Development: We use a transparent approach to algorithms that includes safeguards.
­   Deployment: We monitor outcomes to ensure accuracy and help minimize biases.

These may seem simple and common sense. But as AI leaders, we believe their importance can’t be overstated. These principles will guide our decisions from design to deployment.
Here’s a hypothetical example. AI can make our network more efficient. It reduces power needs and physical duplication by offering fast and smart routing decisions. But what if a new algorithm to skirt outages kept favoring urban customers at the expense of rural ones? Not on purpose – but as an unintended consequence.
No organization will be perfect, but that’s what humans must try to anticipate, catch and repair. The people who run AI decide on the data used, the goals set, the algorithms deployed, and the outcomes monitored.
What’s Next?
AI continues to evolve at a rapid pace. In addition to our principles, we’re developing an internal set of  operating guidelines, compliance tools and governance. We’re refining and expanding our AI training programs.
We’re committed to doing it right. When outcomes are owned by people, no one should be able to claim, “The machine did it.”
Tom Moore is AT&T’s chief privacy officer and senior vice president-compliance.

The big question is will AI affect the next generation of the labour force or it will change the job market completely in the era of automation?.The World Economic Forum has dubbed the age of AI, Automation is the new dawn of Industrialization, or Industry 4.0, which will change and re-define the way we communicate and transact..The new age disruptive technologies led by AI will change the job market bringing in more of automation, intelligence and creation of new opportunities. Almost no occupation will be unaffected by the technological change in the AI era. The most affected will be the ones which are rule-based and monotonous, like bookkeeping, record maintenance and manual excel based reconciliation..Technology leaders are drumming up the thought that the emergence of new technologies is going to be the new drivers of employment..Unplanned Automation May Cause Havoc.Experts say that if automation is not planned well and addressed holistically, it can lead to disaster without a doubt, affecting 60% to 70% of the current jobs. They will either get marginalized or eliminated once and for all. According to a World Bank research, automation is threatening 69% of the job market in India, while it's 77% in China..Automation has economy-wide implications at the macro level and workplace-level implications at the micro level for the worker..Automation will bring three main changes in the changing job market at the macro level, these include, gender disparity in the redeployment of the workforce, firm re-organisation and changes in skill demand. Skill will be more based on how does an employee and organisation adapts itself to the changing workspace credited to automation..The New age Human Cloud Platform.Automation has given rise to the new age digital workforce that is increasingly mobile. Dubbed as the Human Cloud Platform, this new breed of workers will redefine the changing Job Market where they can be hired from any location to perform tasks..Going at the micro level, automation will change how job profiles are looked at, jobs will be described as a set of independent tasks. Expect more of independent workers to perform a portfolio of tasks for pre-determined wage rates. More work will be decentralised and distributed to remote workers who may decide to work on their own terms..This will bring a new change in HR policies with respect to obligations on social benefit, collective bargaining and minimum wage rates set..The Age of Flexible Jobs, Transient Wages, and Distributed Risks.With the advent of Automation, there are three major areas in labour policy that will need a change, these include rethinking social policy and re-skilling workers in the short-term, in addition to re-examining employment potential of new sectors like the digital technologies in the long-term..In this case, Universities and the higher centres of learning will continue to play a leading role reskilling and re-modelling the resumes with certifications of new technologies studied. On-demand courses which give the flexibility to learn at one's own pace is no doubt a big hit now. The present workforce has to adapt, and un-learn and re-learn with the new codes of the digital era..Mitigating the Damage.As evidenced by ongoing discussions in the business community, companies have fully committed to a new wave of automation. Doing so makes business since—it will help bolster firm productivity and improve companies' bottom lines. However, these decisions will also have significant impacts on the lives of millions of workers. Therefore, policymakers at all levels must step in with new investments to mitigate the worst impacts of automation and to ensure a just and equitable transition to a 21st-century economy. Without urgent and consequential action, we should expect the coming decades to look much like the last: considerable economic benefits for some, but significant strain and disruption for many others..In a crux, it is predefined that AI will make some labour obsolete, but we cannot hide from the bigger picture of the potential benefits that AI will bring along, easing its way into the economy retraining humans for jobs overlooking a new set of activities. AI and Its allied technologies will no doubt create a difference in the workforce and in a crux will bring about changes that will be exciting and ground-breaking in terms of the policy, job roles and working without the cubicles.. A change which we all can't watch to watch unfold!.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

AI is considered the most disruptive technology, according to Gartner’s 2019 CIO Survey (it includes over 3,000 CIOs from 89 countries). So yes, this is big reason why there has been a major increase in adoption and implementation.

Yet there is a bottleneck that could easily slow the progress – that is, finding the right talent. The fact is that there are few data scientists and AI experts available.
“In our recent State of Software Engineer report, we found that demand for data engineers has increased by 38% and demand growth for machine learning engineers has increased by 27% in the last year,” said Mehul Patel, who is the CEO of Hired. “Based on data from our career marketplace, we believe the difficulty of recruiting for tech talent with specialized skills in machine learning and AI will continue to become increasingly competitive. Machine learning engineers are commanding an average salary of 153K in the SF Bay Area, which is nearly 20K above the global tech worker’s average salary.”
Actually, this is why one approach is to acquire companies that have strong teams! This appears to be the case with McDonald’s, which recently paid $300 million for Dynamic Yield. It’s an AI company that helps personalize customer experiences.
PROMOTED
But of course, this option has its issues as well. Let’s face it, acquisitions can be difficult to integrate, especially when the target has a workforce with highly specialized skillsets.
So what are other approaches to consider? Well, here’s a look at some ideas:
Automation: With the growth in AI, there has also been the emergence of innovative automation tools, whether from startups or even the mega tech operators. For example, this week Microsoft introduced a new set of systems to streamline the process.
“The biggest and most impactful way that organizations can leverage their current team for data science is to implement a data science automation platform,” said Dr. Ryohei Fujimaki, who is the founder and CEO of dotData. “Data science automation significantly simplifies tasks that formerly could only be completed by data scientists, and enables existing resources -- such as business analysts, BI engineers and data engineers -- to execute data science projects through a simple GUI operation. Automation of the full data science process, from raw business data through data and feature engineering through machine learning, is enabling enterprises to build effective data science teams with minimal costs, using their current talent.”
Now this does not mean that a platform is a panacea, as there still needs to be qualified data scientists. But then again, there will be far more efficiency and scale with AI projects.
“If organizations have data scientists already, an automation platform frees up highly-skilled resources from many of the manual and time-consuming efforts involved, and allows them to focus on more complex and strategic analysis,” said Ryohei. “This empowers data scientists to achieve higher productivity and drive greater business impact than ever before.”
Reskilling: If you currently have employees who are business analysts or have experience with data engineering, then they could be good candidates to train for AI tasks. This would include focusing on skills like Python and TensorFlow, which is a deep learning framework.
“From a training and learning perspective, there are an abundance of online resources via Coursera, Udacity, open.ai, and deeplearning.ai that can help companies develop their employees’ AI/ML skills,” said Mehul. “Additionally, it will be valuable for a company to acquire someone with existing experience in AI to be a leader and mentor for developing employees. The interesting thing about AI/data science is that you don't need to be an experienced software engineer to do it.  The field is so exciting because of the diversity of talent and backgrounds spanning science, engineering, and economics.”
But the training should not just be for a small group of people. It should be company-wide. “Without a data-driven culture and mindset, data science and AI cannot be truly implemented,” said Ryohei. “It is important for enterprise leaders and business teams to understand how to best work with the data science team to meet the organization’s key business objectives. While the business stakeholders do not need to be data experts, they need to know ‘How to use’ AI and ‘How it changes their businesses.’”

			How artificial intelligence and robotics are changing our lives		

 May 3, 2019 
 
				Dominic Lill			

  AI,  artificial intelligence,  employees,  productivity,  robotics

At this present moment in time, humanity stands on the cusp of a revolutionary change; a change that is happening through our own creations, and in which is beginning to transform every aspect of the way we live; artificial intelligence and robotics. 
This integration of artificial intelligence and robotics into more and more aspects of our everyday lives has the potential to be both a salvation for some, whilst also the downfall for others. 

Not only will this technological revolution improve medicine, crime prevention and the way countries both protect and defend themselves, but it will also take the jobs of many different people, becoming the cheaper, (and in many ways) more efficient replacement for employees with the potential for human error. 
Whilst the AI and robotics field have not yet seen the creation of sentient machines, as the typical Sci-Fi films would lead you to believe, the machines civilisation uses daily are getting increasingly smarter, and furthermore increasingly entangled into our everyday lives. From the likes of our smartphone’s live-in assistants (Siri), to robot surgeons, artificial intelligence is gaining an increasing presence in the lives of each and every one of us, changing our lives for the better and for the worst. 
One of the more trivial influences AIs and robotics have had on people’s lives during this period of technological revolution would be the gaming industry. AI advancements in this field have learnt how to play numerous different games to impressively skilled levels – for example, an AI created by Google’s DeepMind learnt how to play chess in under four hours. 
Not only does teaching AIs such strategies give those online someone to play with, but also, as Max Tegmark claimed in his book Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, it can further ‘challenge the best human strategists even beyond game boards. For example, with investment strategy, political strategy and military strategy. Such real-world strategy problems are typically complicated by human psychology.’ 
Another huge area that has, and will continue to be, massively affected by artificial intelligence and robotics is the work sector. Big companies are starting to look at replacing their delivery staff with drones, and proof-readers are increasingly becoming a thing of the past with the likes of AI powered applications. There are many benefits to using AIs in these types of jobs, the main one being that it eliminates the chances of human error, and further ensures a more efficient and successful outcome in that specified sector of a company. 
However, although replacing human staff with such AIs can lead to an increased efficiency and thereby productivity, it can also cause mass unemployment and further significantly decrease the quality of life for those in the industry. Therefore, although the incorporation of AIs and Robotics within the work sector can significantly improve the rates of efficiency and productivity, it also has the potential to cause a sharp increase in unemployment rates.
Another, potentially more controversial, way in which artificial intelligence and robotics are changing our lives would be through the sex industry. One of the latest technological advancements in this field has seen the creation of robotic sex dolls, with the goal for models to become more lifelike getting closer and closer with each new development. Some of the AIs in this area can now offer a more emotionally-driven connection with its customers, by now having the ability to flirt as well as making a spectrum of different reactionary facial expressions. Research from Online Casino Betway predicted that by 2025 there will be sexual compatibility between AI and humans.
Robotic sex dolls have
however been a cause for concern since their creation, with experts in the
field of robotics and the ethics surrounding them claiming that such products
have the potential to damage real-life relationships. These types of robots do
not accurately portray real life people, but rather a submissive and
unrealistic alternative that can damage its user’s perception of a real sexual
relationship and subsequently cause issues in forming such bonds outside of
their robotic dolls. 
A more overtly positive way in which artificial intelligence and robotics have changed our lives for the better would be through its advancements in the medical field. Over the past decade, hospitals have been using robots to perform certain tasks during surgery that require intense precision, and have little room for human error. 
The types of robotics used in operating theatres are not self-operated, but rather are controlled by surgeons. However, as artificial intelligence develops further, the future may see robotics in the medical field operate such complex tasks as patient diagnoses; with built-in algorithms able to efficiently sift through mass amounts of data, reducing the amount of deaths caused by medical record mix-ups.

The drug, sold under the brand name Lamisil by pharma giant Novartis, had come onto the market in 1993 for the treatment of fungal skin infections and thrush. But three years later, the agency had received a number of reports of suspected adverse reactions, including 11 reports of liver toxicity. By 2008, three deaths from liver failure and 70 liver reactions had been pinned on oral terbinafine.Researchers in Canada identified the biochemical culprit behind terbinafine’s liver toxicity—a compound called TBF-A that appeared to be a metabolite of terbinafine—in 2001. Clinicians quickly learned to monitor and manage this potential toxicity during treatment, but no one could work out how the compound actually formed in the liver, or could experimentally reproduce its synthesis from terbinafine in the...Then, in 2018, graduate student Na Le Dang at Washington University in St. Louis hit upon a way to use artificial intelligence (AI)—specifically, a machine learning algorithm—to work out the possible biochemical pathways terbinafine takes when it is metabolized by the liver. Trained on large numbers of known metabolic pathways, the algorithm had learned the most likely outcomes when different types of molecules were broken down in the organ. With that information, it was able to identify what no human could: that the metabolism of terbinafine to TBF-A was a two-step process.It’s really our ambition to automate as much as possible, so the chemists are just focusing on the much higher level, the difficult problems, the strategy.—Adrian Schreyer, ExscientiaTwo-step metabolites are much more difficult than direct metabolites to detect experimentally, which is likely why this potentially lethal outcome wasn’t flagged until after the product was on the market, says S. Joshua Swamidass, a physician scientist and computational biologist at Washington University and Dang’s supervisor. The discovery not only shed light on a long-standing biochemical mystery, but showed how the use of AI could more broadly aid drug discovery and development.Given enough data, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns, and then use those patterns to make predictions or classify new data much faster than any human. “A lot of the questions that are really facing drug development teams are no longer the sorts of questions that people think that they can handle from just sorting through data in their heads,” Swamidass says. “There’s got to be some sort of systematic way of looking at large amounts of data . . . to answer questions and to get insight into how to do things.”AI is well positioned to handle the complexity of the rules that must be applied to understand these data, too, says Regina Barzilay, a computer scientist at MIT and a scientific advisor for drugmaker Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. “When we study chemistry, we definitely study a lot of rules and we understand the mechanism, but sometimes they’re really, really complex,” she says. “If [a] machine is provided with a lot of data, and the problem is formulated correctly, it has a chance to capture patterns which humans may not be able to capture.”Machine learning couldn’t have matured at a better time for the pharmaceutical industry, says Shahar Keinan, cofounder and chief scientific officer at Cloud Pharmaceuticals, a company focusing on AI–based drug discovery. She argues that the steady decline in the number of new drug targets, new mechanisms, and novel first-in-class drugs coming to market each year is an indication that the current system of drug discovery is insufficient to meet modern challenges. “Right now, you need to do more work to get to those kind of first-in-class [drugs],” she says. “The way to overcome that . . . is to find something new in what [data] we have, and this is where artificial intelligence will come in.”The pharmaceutical industry and its investors seem to agree. Last year Cloud Pharmaceuticals entered into a drug discovery collaboration with pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline. And UK-based BenevolentAI, which describes its mission as “accelerating the journey from data to medicine” in areas ranging from drug discovery to clinical development, recently earned an eyebrow-raising multibillion-dollar valuation.Using artificial intelligence to design better drugsMore than 450 medicines worldwide have been withdrawn from the market post-approval in the last half century as a result of adverse reactions, with liver toxicity the most common side effect. But the metabolism of compounds by organs such as the liver is extremely complex and, as in the case of terbinafine, difficult to anticipate.This is exactly the sort of problem that machine learning can help solve—and the data are already available to help that process. For example, the US federal government’s Tox21 program, a collaboration among the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration, maintains a large data set of molecules and their toxicity against key human proteins—perfect fodder for AI to digest in search of patterns of association between structure, properties, function, and possible toxic effects, Keinan says.Cloud Pharmaceuticals is one company that makes use of these data as part of their workflow. “Now you can train a machine learning algorithm on this data set, then a new molecule comes along, and you can just use your prediction to say, ‘Is this molecule toxic or not?’” says Keinan.As well as identifying potential toxicities, machine learning algorithms could predict how a candidate molecule will respond to different physical and chemical environments, and so help drug developers understand how that molecule might behave in various tissues in the human body.If a machine is provided with a lot of data, and the problem is formulated correctly, it has a chance to capture patterns which humans may not be able to capture.—Regina Barzilay, MITA group led by physical chemist Scott Hopkins of the University of Waterloo, in collaboration with researchers at Pfizer, has been training an algorithm to do just that, using data on 89 small-molecule drug candidates obtained by performing a type of spectrometry that measures how quickly molecules absorb or lose water.“If our drug molecule absorbs a lot of water very quickly and doesn’t give it up, it tells us that that drug is going to be very soluble in water,” Hopkins says. “It’s going to dissolve easily in your stomach and enter your bloodstream fairly quickly.” After the algorithm learned the associations between certain molecular structures and solubility from those 89 molecules, it was able to accurately predict the key properties of a similar molecule, the team reported at the end of last year.Although screening for potential toxicities and for biochemical properties are essential sub-tasks in the process of drug development, a more tantalizing question is whether AI could suggest the structure of a new therapeutic molecule from scratch.At Maryland-based biotech Insilico Medicine, CEO Alexander Zhavoronkov and colleagues are using a type of algorithm called a generative adversarial network to help develop entirely novel small-molecule organic compounds aimed at treating everything from cancer to metabolic disease to neurodegenerative disorders. This algorithm consists of two deep neural networks pitted against one another, Zhavoronkov explains.The first deep neural network has the challenge of coming up with outputs—molecular structures—in response to a series of inputs, namely the desired functional and biochemical characteristics of those structures, such as solubility, targets, or bioavailability. The other deep neural network has the job of critiquing those outputs. “They engage in this adversarial game,” Zhavoronkov says. “They basically kind of compete with each other . . . and in this process, after many, many iterations, they learn to generate something new.”Insilico Medicine recently synthesized its first molecule from this process in partnership with China-based pharmaceutical company Wuxi AppTec. The two companies have now entered into a collaboration agreement to test other candidate molecules designed by the adversarial network approach for multiple orphan drug targets.Other companies, such as Exscientia, a UK-based, AI-driven drug discovery company, are bringing machine learning to bear on the entire process of drug discovery. Exscientia is building a platform that aims to mimic the decision making of a medicinal chemist while also learning from human medicinal chemists’ input. “It’s really our ambition to automate as much as possible, [so] the chemists are just focusing on the much higher level, the difficult problems, the strategy,” says Adrian Schreyer, chief technology officer at the company. This means the biological targets and the molecules designed to bind them will all be influenced by the outputs of their AI platform.But there is still a human hand on the tiller. The algorithm “is fairly autonomous in terms of generating compounds, [but] the final selection is done by chemists,” Schreyer says. This is partly because the patent system demands a human name to an invention, but also because the selections that the chemists make from the AI-generated options can be fed back into the algorithm to fine-tune its decision-making protocol for the next time. “If you see twenty to thirty compounds and [humans] pick ten . . . by virtue of the decision making you can see what’s preferable, you can use that process itself to build a machine learning model.”Exscientia’s approach has generated considerable interest from the pharmaceutical industry, with Roche investing up to $67 million in a drug-discovery collaboration with the company. Another recent financing round has earned the company $26 million in investment from companies including Celgene Corporation and GT Healthcare Capital Partners.The limitations of artificial intelligenceDespite progress in using AI for drug development, it’s not time for humans to step out of the process just yet, says Barzilay. For now, she explains, AI in pharma is analogous to a smart kitchen: “You have a microwave, and you have a coffee machine, and you have this and that, but none of it actually cooks you the dinner. . . . You need to put it all together to make a dinner, even though all these things can help you to do it faster and better.” While Barzilay and colleagues are part of a pharma-funded research collaboration with MIT to bring AI into drug discovery, she points out that machine learning has not yet brought a molecule to market. “It just assists humans to do a faster and better job in various sub-tasks, but we still don’t have AI coming up with new drugs at this point,” she says.Artificial intelligence is also limited by the quality of the inputs—in particular, the quality of the data that it learns from, says Schreyer. “If the data is flawed, then the results are likely to be flawed as well, which can be a problem if you get data from third parties,” he says. Experimental data are not perfect measurements of the real world, and there are always assumptions and fitting involved. If the algorithm and its users do not sufficiently take those biases and weightings into account, then the outputs will also be biased.One tantalizing question is whether AI could suggest the structure of a new therapeutic molecule from scratch.Sometimes data can be lacking altogether, particularly for recently discovered molecules. At Cloud Pharmaceuticals, researchers are getting around this problem by using computational chemistry to design a range of molecules that could fit a particular biological target, then using that range as the data set that the machine learning algorithm can learn from to help design new candidate molecules.Another issue for some researchers is the so-called “black box” nature of the algorithms themselves: data goes in, answers come out, but the internal workings remain a mystery. Swamidass says that this presents a fundamental conflict for scientists. “What does it mean to be applying black-box methods in fields that are all about understanding what’s inside of a black box?” he says. “We don’t want to just have something that works in science, we want to understand the underlying processes there.”But Barzilay says that the relationships between inputs and outputs might often go beyond human comprehension. “When we’re talking about complex organic reactions with different solvents and different temperatures and other things, then it becomes really difficult even for the experienced human to predict what is the right outcome, so what does it mean [to] give an explanation?”There is unquestionably a lot of hype around the potential of AI in drug discovery—Swamidass likens this period to the internet boom of the late 1990s. But many, such as Schreyer, are excited about the possibilities that this new technology offers, particularly when it comes to finding novel therapeutics for difficult-to-treat diseases.“If you can improve . . . how efficiently you do drug discovery fivefold, tenfold, or even more,” he says, “then from an economic perspective . . . you’re able to take on more risky projects because the cost of failure is much lower.”Bianca Nogrady is a freelance science writer based in Sydney, Australia.Interested in reading more?Become a Member ofReceive full access to digital editions of The Scientist, as well as TS Digest, feature stories, more than 35 years of archives, and much more!Join for free todayAlready a member?Login Here",https://cdn.the-scientist.com/assets/articleNo/65787/aImg/31695/computing-a-cure.jpg,The Scientist Magazine,,,https://www.the-scientist.com/,,,,,,"Modified from © istock.com, the scientist staffAustralia’s government drug safety watchdog sounded the alarm about the oral antifungal agent terbinafine in 1996.

Developed with Microsoft Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, Teleopti’s WFM chatbot, Grant, is the next recruit for intraday automation and enhanced employee self-service
Teleopti today launched Grant, the workforce management (WFM) chatbot developed to help companies revolutionize their intraday automation with AI-optimized employee self-service. Teleopti’s bot assistant leverages Microsoft Azure Bot Service to deliver a more agile, efficient process for internal communication and customer service staffing. Driving intraday operations with AI technology allows companies to improve every aspect of their customer service organization from their business processes to how their employees work.
Meet Grant
Teleopti’s incorporation of chatbot technology into WFM processes offers the next step for many companies looking to evolve both their intraday operations and employee empowerment. Available to Teleopti Azure cloud customers, Grant is an organization’s own WFM concierge, handling all processes related to schedule requests. Grant analyzes current staffing alongside employees’ unique skills and schedules to provide chat notifications when voluntary time off is available.  If additional support is needed, Grant will soon be able to provide notifications when overtime hours are on offer. Infused with natural language processing, staff can chat with Grant and let him know if they wish to accept the schedule options. Grant then automatically submits the schedule request for them. 
“Employee engagement has always been at the core of our development focus, but it isn’t a static, one-size-fits-all matter, which is why we are constantly innovating around how to push the boundaries of WFM and employee-engagement functionality,” says Olle Düring, CEO at Teleopti. 
Recruiting Grant as a WFM assistant helps not just frontline employees to achieve a better work-life balance with more freedom in their schedule, but it also means management and the WFM team can achieve flexible intraday planning. Staffing can be adjusted to meet incoming demand without exhaustive manual monitoring, all while lowering HR costs. The organizations’ overall customer experience is also enhanced as Grant helps the company meet customers in the right place, at the right time, with skilled people who feel empowered in their working day.
Olle Düring continues, “New technological opportunities, such as chatbots, offer clear benefits for automating customer communication. With our 100% focus on WFM we’re taking these innovations into workforce management.  Developing WFM embedded with machine learning and bot technology helps our customers improve their planning and operations, as well as create more empowering self-service for their teams.” 

Built with Microsoft Cognitive Services 
Following workshops and bi-weekly check-in sessions with Microsoft’s AI Services team, Teleopti’s R&D team built Grant using Microsoft Cognitive Services. Azure Bot Framework was a natural fit with its acceleration of intelligent bot creation, ability to scale on demand and integration of Teleopti’s cloud WFM solution with Microsoft Azure. Microsoft’s LUIS Language Understanding has also been crucial as the machine-learning based service enables Teleopti to build natural language chat conversations between Grant and the employee.
“We’re excited to see Teleopti using Microsoft Azure to transform their business with AI,” said Eric Boyd, corporate vice president, Azure AI, Microsoft.  “By infusing their apps with Azure Cognitive Services, Teleopti has built an intelligent Workforce Management chatbot that can interact with employees in a natural way, helping drive better workforce management and stronger employee engagement.”

Grant’s Growth & Competence Development
Mattias Engblom, CTO at Teleopti concludes, “Like all new recruits, we are excited for Grant’s development and growth. The joy of AI is that Grant’s conversations will continue to become more complex as he learns from his chats with employees. Just like all our iterative development processes, we will also listen to the input from customers to develop the areas where they have the greatest need for Grant’s assistance.”

            Is it ethical to replace a worker with a robot?
    

            This was a question asked at a panel discussion at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference Tuesday. Machines have already begun replacing jobs, ranging from factory workers to baseball umpires to lawyers. 
    

            Most of the people on the panel said they believed it was ok. Pedro Domingos, head of machine learning research at investment firm the D. E. Shaw Group and professor at the University of Washington, explained that, as a result of artificial intelligence, there will be more demand for existing jobs, and new jobs will be created that are unimaginable today. This is similar to how we couldn’t imagine a web app developer decades ago, and now millions make a living doing that today, he said. John Kelly III, executive vice president of IBM, was similarly optimistic, adding, “Man and machine working together always beat or make a better decision than a man or a machine independently.”

            I am skeptical of these claims. Automation can contribute to the rise of precarious work, such as contractors and freelancers who lack full-time benefits. Artificial intelligence likely will not create entirely new fields of expertise or careers as computers did for computer scientists.

For example, an autonomous car that uses “level three technology” drives itself in most situations but hands control back to a human driver in emergency situations. This setup requires humans not to be lulled into distraction while the car is driving autonomously, as was the case in a fatal accident involving an Uber self-driving test car in Arizona.

            First, let humans and machines play to their moral strengths — algorithms are often good at achieving utilitarian outcomes, such as doing the most good for the most people. But humans are often good at enforcing moral rules, such as making sure not to discriminate based on race and gender. Plenty of algorithmic programs designed to do good, like Google Translate, are prone to racial or gender bias, which require humans to step in and correct course. 
    

            Second, let robots do the robotic work and let humans do the rest. For example, a study demonstrates how an artificial intelligence platform and human experts working together fare better at identifying cyberattacks than either humans or machines working alone. This is because the platform does the dull, rote work of sifting through tons of data, while the human experts sample the platform’s output, identifying anomalous cases and feeding that back to the platform, which then improves on detecting cyberattacks. 
    

            Last, divide up social work. Despite our tendency to dislike robots in social contexts, outsourcing some social interaction to robots can reduce burnout in jobs that require managing others’ emotions. For example, research shows that automated customer service systems can efficiently route customers to human operators, managing the frustrating parts of the call (such as user authentication) that can free up the human agents to handle the more substantive issues.
    

            Machines have already infiltrated every aspect of our lives, and we must learn to live with them. In considering the ethics of this novel arrangement, the most ethical thing we can do is continue to embrace and value humanity, reminding ourselves that as advanced as technology gets, it will always be learning from us rather than the other way around.

Legal regulation of AI weapons under international humanitarian law:  A Chinese perspective

May 2, 2019, Artificial Intelligence and Armed Conflict / Law and Conflict / The most read blog posts in 2019 / Weapons 9 mins read                        
Qiang Li  Associate Professor, Military Law Institute at China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL)Dan Xie  Distinguished Professor, Military Law Institute of China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL) 




 
Arguably, international humanitarian law (IHL) evolves with the development of emerging technologies. The history of IHL demonstrated that any adoption of new technologies presents challenges to this body of law. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the tendency has become even more apparent when humans attempt to achieve the military use of such technology. When it comes to weapons, a combination of weapons and AI technology has increasingly drawn attention from the international community.
Following the high-tech weapon systems such as cyber-attack software and armed drones, combat robots of various types have been developed and employed.[1] Potentially, artificial intelligence will not only significantly increase the efficiency and lethal effect of modern kinetic weapons, but also will partially restrict or even completely eliminate human interventions in all aspects of strategy design, battle organization and tactics implementation.
AI weapons—also known as autonomous weapon systems (AWS), which have been defined by the ICRC as weapons that can independently select and attack targets, i.e., with autonomy in the ‘critical functions’ of acquiring, tracking, selecting and attacking targets—have raised a series of issues both legally and ethically. It is debatable whether such weapons/weapon systems with the functions of learning, reasoning, decision-making and the ability to act independent of human intervention should be employed in future battlefields. In all circumstances, they must be employed in accordance with the principles and rules of IHL.
Legal review before employment
The First Additional Protocol to Geneva Conventions (AP I)—to which China is a party—provides that States must fulfil their obligations to determine whether the employment of a new weapon, means or method of warfare would be prohibited by IHL or any other relevant rules of international law in some or all circumstances in the study, development, acquisition or adoption of that weapon (Art 36 API). More specifically, the legality of new weapons must be assessed using the following criteria:

First, are the new weapons prohibited by specific international conventions, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention, Biological Weapons Convention or Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons?
Second, would such weapons cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering, or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment (Art 35 API)?
Third, will such weapons likely have the effects of indiscriminate attacks (Art 51 API)?
Lastly, will such weapons accord with the principles of humanity and dictates of public conscience—the Martens Clause (Art 1(2) API)?[2]

This means that AI weapons must be incorporated in the legal framework of IHL with no exceptions. The principles and rules of IHL should and shall be applied to AI weapons.
Precautions during employment
Humans will make mistakes. The same is true for machines, however ‘intelligent’ they are. Since AI weapons are designed, manufactured, programmed and employed by humans, the consequences and legal responsibilities arising from their illegal acts must be attributed to humans. Humans should not use the ‘error’ of AI systems as an excuse to dodge their own responsibilities. That would not be consistent with the spirit and value of the law. Accordingly, AI weapons, or weapon systems, should not be characterized as ‘combatants’ under IHL and consequently take on legal responsibility. In any circumstance, the wrongful targeting made by AI weapon systems is not a problem of the weapon itself. Therefore, when employing AI weapons systems, programmers and end users are under a legal obligation to take all feasible precautionary measures ensuring such employment in accordance with the fundamental rules of IHL (Art 57 API). 
Accountability after employment
If humans are responsible for the employment of AI weapons, who, of these humans, holds responsibility? Is it the designers, the manufacturers, the programmers or the operators (end users)? In the view of many Chinese researchers, the end users must take primary responsibilities for the wrongful targeting of AI weapons. Such an argument derives from the Article 35(1) of AP I which provides ‘in any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited’. In the case of full autonomy of AI weapon systems without any human control, those who decide to employ AI weapon systems—normally senior military commanders and civilian officials—bear individual criminal responsibility for any potential serious violations of IHL. Additionally, the States to which they belong incur State responsibility for such serious violations which could be attributable to them.
Moreover, the targeting of AI weapon systems is closely tied to their design and programming. The more autonomy they have, the higher the design and programming standards must be in order to meet the IHL requirements. For this purpose, the international community is encouraged to adopt a new convention specific to AI weapons, such as the Convention on Conventional Weapons and its Protocols, or the Convention against Anti-personnel Mines and Convention on Cluster Munitions. At the very least, under the framework of such a new convention, the design standards of AI weapons shall be formulated, States shall be responsible for the designing and programming of those weapons with high levels of autonomy, and those States that manufacture and transfer AI weapons in a manner inconsistent with relevant international law, including IHL and Arms Trade Treaty, shall incur responsibility. Furthermore, States should also provide legal advisors to the designers and programmers. In this regard, the existing IHL framework does not fully respond to such new challenges. For this reason, in addition to the development of IHL rules, States should also be responsible for developing their national laws and procedures, in particular transparency mechanisms. On this matter, those States advanced in AI technology should play an exemplary role. 
Ethical aspect
AI weapons—especially the lethal autonomous weapon systems—pose a significant challenge to human ethics. AI weapons do not have human feelings and there is a higher chance that their use will result in violations of IHL rules on methods and means. For example, they can hardly identify the willingness to fight of a human, or understand the historical, cultural, religious and humanistic values of a specific object. Consequently, they are not expected to respect principles of military necessity and proportionality. They even significantly impact universal human values of equality, liberty and justice. In other words, no matter how much they look like humans, they are still machines. It is almost impossible for them to really understand the meaning of the right to life. This is because machines can be well repaired and programmed repeatedly, but life is given to humans only once. From this perspective, even though it is still possible when employing of non-lethal AI weapons, highly lethal AI weapons must be totally prohibited on both international and national levels in view of their high-level autonomy. However, it should be acknowledged that this may not be persuasive reasoning, because it is essentially not a legal argument, but an ethical one. 
Concluding remarks
We cannot predict whether AI will completely replace human resources and so-called robotic wars will emerge. However, it must be observed that there exists a huge gap between nations in terms of AI technological capabilities. It is still an unreachable goal for most countries to procure and militarily use such capabilities. In other words, some States may have the potential to employ AI weapons on the battlefield, while others may not. In such cases, it will inevitably be required to assess the legality of AI weapons and their employment, and IHL will be resorted to. And as a result, the imbalance in military technologies will probably cause the divergency in the interpretation and application of existing IHL rules. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the applicability of IHL to AI weapon systems is beyond all doubt.

Like any other industry, the auto sector is leading in the usage of new age manufacturing technology which surely effects the existence of labor force..Away from this Machine Vs Human discussion, Japan is flipping the conventional debate. Instead of considering AI as a job killer, the country is embracing technology in order to save the industry job crisis for existing employees..Ran Poliakine, Co-founder of a new AI manufacturing consortium said, &quot;Japan has seen eight consecutive years of population decline, which is expected to continue as many of its inhabitants are aging out of the workforce. Researchers predict that by 2036 one in three people will be elderly. This paves the way for AI innovation by delegating easily automated jobs – that will soon be much harder to fill – to machines.&quot;.Japan has been a breeding ground for robotics and AI development. According to the National Institute of Population and Society Security Research, the population of 127 million people in Japan will decline up to 100 million marks by 2049, raising the issue of economic existential survival..A Honda Motor Corporation affiliation Musashi Seimitsu recently declared the shaping of Musashi AI consortium. The consortium will be in collaboration with an Israeli tech entrepreneur Poliakine and SixEye Interactive..The Musashi AI Consortium is aiming to blend best AI-technological minds, software engineering, mathematics, and physics to hail its vision for Industry 4.0. The vision presents a combo of human workforce along with advanced robotics and AI to gear up the inspection and materialistic handlings. According to KPMG, Industry 4.0 is expected to pitch a $4 trillion market by 2020..An entrepreneurial expert said, &quot;The Japanese government is embracing this vision adopting a new initiative called 'Society 5.0,' which adapts a new economic model and broader societal vision of fully incorporating the technological innovations of the fourth industrial revolution, including infrastructure, fintech, healthcare, logistics, and AI.  This will be a big highlight of the G20 Summit, which Japan is hosting for the first time later this year.&quot;.Additionally, Musashi AI is speeding up the process for demonstrating two new AI-centric prototypes –.•  An automatic inspection system based on artificial intelligence and cutting-edge optics.•  A fully self-driving automated forklift, which navigates on its own to perform functions that previously required human interaction..Well, in Japan at least the breakthrough artificial intelligence is being considered as good news for sure..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Albeit artificial intelligence is as yet a work in advancement, we have seen what it can do and the favorable circumstances that accompany the new innovation..While it's regularly mythologized in popular culture and treated like an extraordinarily destabilizing economic power, AI is a great deal like some other innovation. As an ever-increasing number of organizations have created AI applications, competition and adoption rates have expanded, driving down expenses and making AI accessible to a lot more extensive range of organizations. Small companies represent the greater part of net job creation and more than 40% of GDP in the United States. The engineers of AI solutions want their products to be accessible to the business visionaries who fuel this huge engine of economic movement..You can utilize AI to build customer retention, NPS, sales close rate and pre-qualify leads. It's difficult to know where AI will be in 10 years or two. In any case, it's as of now playing a major role in many business' day to day activities. It can play a major, advantageous job in your business too, currently and in the future too. Let's look at how AI can be used by businesses..Data collection and Analysis.At the point when small enterprises approach advanced statistical tools, they can study their clients and find new ones. Take the case of regression analysis, which enables you to make connections between a wide cluster of factors and decide how they're affecting your business. From figuring out what keeps clients returning to your business to helping you find new market niches; AI is a flexible statistical tool..Artificial intelligence has additionally made it possible for small ventures to gather a lot of data in any case. From sentiment analysis to ML algorithms that track customer preferences and habits, organizations like Facebook enable organizations of all sizes to utilize chatbots, which depend on ML, ground-breaking data gathering systems are presently accessible to organizations large and small..Business Processes.Artificial Intelligence can build the effectiveness of an organization by taking care of business procedures, for example, workflows and supply chains. Fundamentally, you need them to do the truly difficult work and thorough analysis, distinguish the territories that need improvement. Toward the end, assets are utilized better meaning a decrease in losses and cost of production..As indicated by Forbes, organizations that integrate artificial intelligence into their business procedure management can possibly drop the utilization of materials utilized in assembling by 4% and increase productivity by 20%..Emotional Analysis.Emotional AI, otherwise called affective computing, is a cycle of AI equipped for recognizing human feelings and reacting to those feelings likewise. And keeping in mind that it's not impeccable yet, the innovation is amazing. One examination from the University of Ohio asserts that AI is currently greater at distinguishing feelings than people are – a noteworthy accomplishment considering a huge number of long stretches of advancement for that sort of thing. It is believed these emotionally smart bots can change your business tasks and just as Annette Zimmermann said in 2018 that by 2022, our personal device will know more about your emotional condition than your own family..Marketing with AI.From wiping out the requirement for employees to do mechanical assignments, for example, data preparation to cutting edge data analysis which is also referred to as the top future AI application, AI is on a very significant stage evolving marketing..This is similarly as valid for small ventures for what it's worth for the biggest organizations on the planet. While small companies used to be restricted to whatever advertisements they could bear the cost of in nearby markets, they currently can contact a tremendous group of audience on the web. They can utilize AI-based advertising platforms that have been created by enormous organizations like Facebook and Google to target explicit buyers who are open to their message. They can gather and analyze buyer information from numerous channels. What's more, they can do the majority of this without a multitude of marketers..Customer Support.Today, a lot of entrepreneurs are as of now utilizing chatbots to answer client queries 24 hours per day seven days a week. Clients are constantly fretful and consequently require full focus paying little heed to the point they are in their buying journey. Utilizing artificial intelligence would save time for your employees with the goal for them to deal with significant issues that expect human to human communication abilities. Moreover, artificial intelligence would cater to global customers who are out of your time zones as opposed to hanging tight for customer care operators to report to work for them to answer a question..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The whole process takes about a minute for a single berry.It seems like heavy going for a robot that cost £700,000 to develop but, if all goes to plan, this is the future of fruit-picking.Automation threatens 1.5 million workers in Britain, says ONSRead moreEach robot will be able to pick more than 25,000 raspberries a day, outpacing human workers who manage about 15,000 in an eight-hour shift, according to Fieldwork Robotics, a spinout from the University of Plymouth.The robot has gone on trial in the UK, as the farming industry battles rising labour costs and Brexit-related shortages of seasonal workers.Numbers of seasonal workers from eastern Europe have diminished, partly due to Brexit fears but also because Romania and Poland’s surging economies have persuaded their own workers to remain in their home countries .The robot has been developed in partnership with Hall Hunter, one of Britain’s main berry growers which supplies Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Waitrose. Standing at 1.8 metres tall, the wheeled machine with its robotic arm has begun field trials in a greenhouse at a Hall Hunter farm near Chichester in West Sussex.Guided by sensors and 3D cameras, its gripper zooms in on ripe fruit using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence. When operating at full tilt, its developers say the robot’s gripper picks a raspberry in 10 seconds or less and drops it in a tray where the fruit gets sorted by maturity, before being moved into punnets, ready to be transported to supermarkets.The final robot version, expected to go into production next year, will have four grippers, all picking simultaneously.Separate field trials in China have shown the robot can pick tomatoes, and it has also been let loose on cauliflower.As robots don’t get tired, they can pick for 20 hours a day, but the biggest challenge has been getting them to adapt to different light conditions, says Rui Andres, portfolio manager at Frontier IP, one of the main backers of Fieldwork.Andres says UK farmers typically pay £1 to £2 for a kilogram of raspberries picked by human workers. Fieldwork intends to lease its robots to farmers for less.The robot is the brainchild of Dr Martin Stoelen, a lecturer in robotics at Plymouth University, who moved from aerospace engineering into robots and took inspiration from his grandparents’ farm in Norway. By tackling one of the most difficult soft fruits first, he hopes to be able to tweak the technology so the robot can be used to pick other berries, fruit and vegetables.Some growers have already expressed interest, under pressure from the rising minimum wage, with labour accounting for half of their costs. They have also been spurred into action by a decline in seasonal pickers coming from Bulgaria, Romania and Poland since the UK’s vote to leave the EU in June 2016. Berry and apple growers have been the hardest hit by the labour shortages, and farms have started poaching pickers from each other.Many EU workers are staying away because their earnings have been eroded by the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the referendum.Nicholas Marston, chairman of the British Summer Fruits (BSF) trade body, says fruit growers were 15%-30% short of seasonal pickers last summer. “It’s a struggle. There were definitely crop losses last year and the year before.”Q&AWhat is AI?ShowArtificial Intelligence has various definitions, but in general it means a program that uses data to build a model of some aspect of the world. This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Under a new UK government-sponsored two-year pilot scheme, 2,500 berry pickers will be coming from Ukraine and Moldova, but this will not be enough to plug gaps, Marston says.UK farms growing apples, berries and field crops need 70,000 seasonal workers a year. The berry industry alone employs 29,000, but BSF estimates it will need an extra 2,000 pickers by 2020, as people eat more berries. The National Farmers’ Union has recorded more than 6,000 unfilled vacancies on farms so far this year.The UK is not alone – with a population shift from rural areas to cities, other European countries, the US and China are all struggling to attract enough seasonal workers to harvest their crops, so robots could be the answer in the long run.Robots are also starting to be used for weeding and planting crops, and milking cows, as part of the long-term trend of automation in agriculture. The Small Robot Company, based near Salisbury, is trialling robots that look like spiders on wheels, called Tom, Dick and Harry. They seed, feed, weed and monitor field crops such as wheat in a gentler way than heavy farm machinery, reducing the need for water and pesticides.Robots promise to raise productivity, at a time when UK productivity growth is lagging behind other countries. Analysts attribute this lack of economic efficiency to a shift towards more low-skilled jobs since the financial crisis, a lack of business investment and a decade of austerity.If the rise of the robots materialises, it is expected to mainly affect low-skilled jobs. A new cohort of highly-skilled workers will be needed to maintain and debug the machines.But Marston cautions: “It will be 10 years before robots will work as effectively as people.”Explore more on these topicsRobotsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingFarmingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsMy sausage-like fingers are not sexy.

                            Artificial intelligence (AI) worldwide
                        
                                While there are many examples of technology changing the way people work, the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics have many people worried that their work will no longer be required at all. 

According to OECD estimates, more than 1 in 5 low-income jobs across its member countries are at high risk of automation. But it’s no longer just manual routine tasks that are affected by automation. Artificial intelligence is increasingly capable of performing “cognitive routine” tasks that are typical of the service sector. For example, artificial intelligence has recently surpassed humans at speech and image recognition, indicating that automation could also have an impact on relatively high-skilled occupations in the future. However, the share of high-income jobs at risk of automation is still significantly lower than it is for occupations that require fewer skills.

In its latest Economic Outlook, the OECD notes that automation won’t necessarily lead to lower labor demand though, as new tasks and jobs will appear. These jobs may require a different set of skills, however, which is why proper education and training are crucial to limit the adverse effects of automation on labor markets in the future.

In the near future, when you apply for a job or join a new team at work, a machine, rather than a human, may assess your personality traits to see if you are suitable.




Realising that people could manipulate conventional personality tests, a team of computing and psychology researchers from Macquarie, CSIRO and the University of Sydney decided to investigate ways to make personality detection more objective.Try faking this test: Associate Professor Shlomo Berkovsky says by using new technology, we can accurately assign personality traits.“If needed, people can easily change their answers and behaviour to be the kind of person that is expected of them,” says Associate Professor Shlomo Berkovsky of Macquarie’s Australian Institute of Health Innovation.So the team thought of a new approach. “Our main idea was to detect someone’s personality using objective methods that they couldn’t control or manipulate.”Berkovsky presented this new research earlier this month at CHI 2019, the premier international conference in human-computer interaction hosted by the Association of Computing Machinery, the peak global computing research body. The research also won the Best Paper Award of the conference – a true recognition of the originality and significance of the work.No cheating: specialist equipment delivers honest resultThe researchers decided to track people’s bodily responses, such as pupil dilation, brain activity and skin conductance (when you are excited and your skin momentarily exudes micro sweat beads) as they looked at evocative videos and images.To conduct the experiment and collect the data, they brought 21 people into their lab. They fitted them with special glasses that had two tiny built-in cameras to capture their pupil dilation and eye movements, a headset to record brain activity and two electrode clips on their fingers to detect their heartbeat and skin conductance.The AI methods would be cheaper, faster and more accurate than the current expert assessment tools.Then the researchers showed these people validated images and videos already backed up with earlier research that indicated they evoked emotions. Each person spent about 14 minutes watching videos and nine minutes looking at the images while their bodily responses were recorded.Once they’d collected the data, the researchers processed it and used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict 16 personality traits from three established, and widely used in psychology, personality assessment models.Quantity is keyThe predicted personality traits, to their surprise, were very accurate. “Just using the eye data, we had close to 86 per cent accuracy of the predictions. With the other sensory data added, the accuracy goes up to over 90 per cent,” Berkovsky says. “Basically, the more data and bodily responses you plug in, the more and more things are captured, so then the AI can predict the personality traits with higher and higher levels of accuracy.”Artificial intelligence will improve our health systemWhat needs to change to get more women in science top jobsSimilar predictive AI technologies could possibly be used in the future for recruitment or team-building purposes, he says. “AI could soon replace the existing tests to gather objective data about humans. The AI methods would be cheaper, faster and more accurate than the current expert assessment tools.”Looking to the futureAlready Berkovsky is using this AI predictive capability as the first stepping stone into wider research he is involved in at the Australian Institute of Health Innovation.“Because we’ve found these physiological responses capture a lot of information, we are trying to apply similar ideas to predict medical conditions,” he says. His team is trying to use AI to predict the development and progression of mental and neural disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as learning difficulties, such as dyslexia which is very hard to diagnose.“Just imagine, instead of putting a child through clinical tests with a specialist, they’d just have to use a normal mobile phone to capture their eyes and voice while the child read something to their parents. We can hopefully come up with an AI prediction, a probability of dyslexia, in a matter of minutes,” Berkovsky says. “The wider applications of this technology in health are endless.”Associate Professor Shlomo Berkovsky is based at the Australian Institute of Health Innovation.

One of the most spectacular facts of the last two centuries of economic history is the exponential growth in GDP per capita in most of the world. Figure 1 shows the rise (and the difference) in living standards for five countries since 1000 AD.





This economic progress, unprecedented in human history, would be impossible without major breakthroughs in technology. The economic historian Joel Mokyr has argued that the Enlightenment in Britain brought new ways to transfer scientific discoveries into practical tools for engineers and artisans. The steam engine, electricity, sanitation are examples of technological discoveries that propelled the engine of economic growth, increasing standards of living across the planet.
At the outset of the Industrial Revolution, the Luddite movement rose out of fear of labor displacement in the British textile sector. Famously, the Luddite protesters destroyed the very machines they were using at work, in order to preserve their role as active members of society. Their reasoning was that if automation could double, triple, or quadruple a worker's output, the economy would need half, a third, a quarter of the current workforce. The Luddite movement was eventually suppressed by military force in 1816, but history has proven them partly correct.
Humans do work shorter hours today than in the 19th century, as shown in Figure 3.

Many Silicon Valley executives like the Tesla CEO Elon Musk believe that we are on the verge of a new technological revolution that will see Artificial Intelligence (AI) automating a majority of tasks that are currently performed by humans. Just as horses were displaced by motor vehicles, truck drivers may soon be replaced by self-driving vehicles.






Factories producing components for personal computers and tablets are also becoming highly automated. The BBC reports (May 25, 2016) that FoxConn has replaced 60,000 of its workers with robots. A January 2016 Oxford University study claims that 47% of US jobs could be lost to automation, along with 69% of jobs in India, 77% in China, and 57% worldwide. Machine learning enables robots to make decisions based on a vast amount of data on (sometimes very difficult) decision-making by highly-skilled humans.
Should we then fear that the forthcoming AI Revolution will force humanity to completely rethink the current organization of our lives?
One of the most important economic thinkers of all time, John Maynard Keynes, wrote in his 1930 essay ""The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren"" that by the 21st century we could fulfill our needs and wants with a 15 hours workweek and devote the rest of our lives to non-monetary pursuits. Fast-forward to 2014, when the late physicist Stephen Hawking told the BBC that ""artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.""

Should we see AI as liberating or as a destructive force?
Economists have debated the effect of technology and automation on jobs for a long time. The first set of questions regards labor displacement and whether there is any future for work at all. The second set of questions has to do with how automation impacts income and wealth inequality. On the one hand, if the ownership of robots is concentrated in the hands of a few—let's call them the 1%—and a majority of jobs disappears for the 99%, it will exacerbate inequality, which is already on the rise (see Figure 4). On the other hand, technological change is also creating polarization in the labor market among the 99%. According to the MIT economist David Autor, between 1989 and 2007 job creation has occurred mostly in low-paying and high-paying jobs, while middle-class jobs were affected by job destruction on net.
It is true that automation displaces workers in some sectors, but workers reallocate to other sectors over time. Historical examples in advanced economies like the US are the transition from rural agriculture to urban manufacturing during the first half of the 20th century, and from manufacturing to services in more recent times.
The net effect on jobs does not seem to lend support to Hawking and Musk's gloomy predictions. This is even more true if one considers another beneficial effect of technological change: everyday objects like dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, washers, and dryers, reduced the burden of housekeeping and freed up time for women to seek employment. Indeed, the labor force participation rate was 67% in 2000, compared to 59% in 1948. The increases in labor productivity brought about by technological change spill over into higher wages for workers: in a 2015 report, Economic Policy Institute economists Josh Bivens and Larry Mishel have documented that the average hourly compensation for the typical American worker in 2014 grew by about 110% relative to 1948.

This is not to say that technological change has no costs for society. The transition from agriculture to manufacturing took time, and in the short run produced economic anxiety, unemployment, and poverty among former agricultural workers. The same applies to the transition to a service economy, although there are some troubling peculiarities about the latter process. The transition to manufacturing was associated with higher wages and employment protection through union membership. The transition to services not so much: low-skill service workers tend to be paid less than workers of similar skills in manufacturing, and service workers are in general not unionized: consequently, they do not take advantage of the benefits of collective bargaining in terms of wages.






Another cause of concern is that automation and technological change is characterized by increasing returns: doubling the scale of production enables production at more than twice the output at the initial scale. Increasing returns lower the cost of production as the scale of a firm expands, which leads to firm concentration toward few, large firms with lots of market power. And it is not by chance that the most visible hi-tech industries, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are all basically monopolies.
The decline of manufacturing employment and the increasing concentration of the US corporate sector are two reasons why average wages have not kept up with the increase in labor productivity over the last 40 years. An average 2015 worker is almost 2.4 times more productive than an average 1948 worker, but her wage is only 110% higher. Wages were growing on par with labor productivity up to the 1970s; starting in the 1980s, productivity has been growing at a much faster pace. The process of job polarization has fed into this pattern, determining rising employment in low-paying sectors and high-paying sectors, at the expense of good middle-class jobs.
Although it is possible that AI is completely different from the technological advances of the past, we should be skeptical that automation will mean the end of work. Jobs—or even specific tasks—will be displaced, but workers will relocate to different jobs or take up different tasks. For low- and medium-skill workers, it is likely that the relocation will occur in jobs of lower quality, meaning either lower pay, or fewer benefits, or a combination of both. Workers who possess skills that are complementary to new technologies, on the other hand, will benefit from the advent of automation by reaping most of the productivity increases in the form of higher wages. And the very few CEOs of successful tech companies will see their incomes skyrocket.
Hence, citizens and policymakers concerned with the rise of automation should focus on its effects on inequality. During the 1980s economists have embraced supply-side views that inequality is beneficial for growth, but recent academic research has shown that the opposite is true. The work by economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucman has suggested that high marginal tax rates on top incomes—that is, tax rates levied on every dollar earned above a certain, typically very high threshold—would go a long way in reducing inequality without distorting the individual incentives to work hard. Indeed, the US economy grew fastest between 1950 and 1970, when the top marginal tax rate was well above 70%. The corresponding tax revenues could be used to provide unemployment compensation or foster the provision of public goods such as education and training for workers to relocate when their jobs are automated.

Artificial Intelligence In The Workplace: How AI Is Transforming Your Employee Experience

Soon, even those of us who don’t happen to work for technology companies (although as every company moves towards becoming a tech company, that will be increasingly few of us) will find AI-enabled machines increasingly present as we go about our day-to-day activities.
From how we are recruited and on-boarded to how we go about on-the-job training, personal development and eventually passing on our skills and experience to those who follow in our footsteps, AI technology will play an increasingly prominent role.
PROMOTED
Here’s an overview of some of the recent advances made in businesses that are currently on the cutting-edge of the AI revolution, and are likely to be increasingly adopted by others seeking to capitalize on the arrival of smart machines.
Recruitment and onboarding
Before we even set foot in a new workplace, it could soon be a fact that AI-enabled machines have played their part in ensuring we’re the right person for the job.
AI pre-screening of candidates before inviting the most suitable in for interviews is an increasingly common practice at large companies which make thousands of hires each year, and sometimes attract millions of applicants.
Pymetricsprovides tools which use a series of ""games"" based on principles of neuroscience to assess candidates before they are asked in for an interview. It works by assessing cognitive and emotional features of the candidate, while specifically avoiding demographic biases based on their gender, socioeconomic status, or race. This is done by matching candidates' performance against that of existing employees who have succeeded in the roles that are being recruited for. If it finds that they may not be a particularly good fit for that role, it might recognize another role they would be suitable for and recommend they instead apply for that one.
Another company providing these services is Montage, which claims that 100 of the Fortune 500 companies have used their AI-driven interviewing tool. It enables businesses to carry out on-demand text interviewing, automated scheduling, and reduce the impact of unconscious biases on the recruitment process.  
When it comes to onboarding, AI-enabled chatbots are the current tool of choice, for helping new hires settle into their roles and get to grips with the various facets of the organizations they’ve joined.
Multinational consumer goods manufacturer Unilever uses a chatbot called Unabot, that employs natural language processing(NLP) to answer employees' questions in plain, human language. Advice is available on everything from where they can catch a shuttle bus to the office in the morning, to how to deal with HR and payroll issues.  
On-the-job training
Of course, learning doesn’t end once you’ve settled into your role, and AI technology will also play a part in ongoing training for most employees in the future.
It will also assist with the transfer of skills from one generation to the next – as employees move on to other companies or retire, it can help to ensure that they can leave behind the valuable experience they’ve gained for others to benefit from, as well as take it with them.
Engineering giant Honeywellhas developed tools which utilize augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) along with AI, to capture the experience of work and extract “lessons” from it which can be passed on to newer hires.
Employees wear AR headsets while carrying out their daily tasks. These capture a record of everything the engineer does, using image recognition technology, which can be played back, allowing trainees or new hires to experience the role through VR.
Information from the video imagery is also being used to build AR tools which provide real-time feedback while engineers carry out their job – alerting them to dangers or reminding them to carry out routine tasks when they are in a particular place or looking at a particular object.  
Augmented workforce
One of the reasons that the subject of AI in the workplace makes some people uncomfortable is because it is often thought of as something that will replace humans and lead to job losses.
However, when it comes to AI integration today, the keyword is very much ""augmentation"" – the idea that AI machines will help us do our jobs more efficiently, rather than replace us. A key idea is that they will take over the mundane aspects of our role, leaving us free to do what humans do best – tasks which require creativity and human-to-human interaction.  
Just as employees have become familiar with tools like email and messaging apps, tools such as those provided by PeopleDocor Betterworkswill play an increasingly large part in the day-to-day workplace experience.
These are tools which can monitor workflows and processes and make intelligent suggestions about how things could be done more effectively or efficiently. Often this is referred to as robotic process automation (RPA).
These tools will learn to carry out repetitive tasks such as arranging meetings or managing a diary. They will also recognize when employees are having difficulty or spending too long on particular problems, and be ready to step in to either assist or if the job is beyond something a bot is capable of doing itself, suggest where human help can be found.
Surveillance in the workplace
Of course, there’s a potential dark side to this encroachment of AI into the workplace that’s likely to leave some employees feeling distinctly uncomfortable.
According to a Gartner survey, more than 50% of companies with a turnover above $750 million use digital data-gathering tools to monitor employee activities and performance. This includes analyzing the content of emails to determine employee satisfaction and engagement levels. Some companies are known to be using tracking devices to monitor the frequency of bathroom breaks, as well as audio analytics to determine stress levels in voices when staff speak to each other in the office.
Technology even exists to enable employers to track their staff sleeping and exercise habits. Video game publisher Blizzard Activision recently unveiled plansto offer incentives to staff who let them track their health through Fitbit devices and other specialized apps. The idea is to use aggregated, anonymized data to identify areas where the health of the workforce as a whole can be improved. However, it’s clear to see that being monitored in this way might not sit particularly well with everyone.
Workplace analytics specialists Humanyzeuse staff email and instant messaging data, along with microphone-equipped name badges, to gather data on employee interactions. While some may consider this potentially intrusive, the company says that this can help to protect employees from bullying or sexual harassment in the workplace.
Workplace Robots
Physical robots capable of autonomous movement are becoming commonplace in manufacturing and warehousing installations, and are likely to be a feature of many other workplaces in the near future.
Mobility experts Segwayhave created a delivery robot which can navigate through workplace corridors to make deliveries directly to the desk. Meanwhile, security robots such as those being developed by Gamma 2could soon be a common site, ensuring commercial properties are safe from trespassers.
Racing for a space in the office car park could also become a thing of the past if solutions developed by providers such as ParkPlusbecome commonplace. Their robotic parking assistants may not match our traditional idea of how a robot should look, but consist of automated “shuttle units” capable of moving vehicles into parking bays which would be too small for humans to manually park in – meaning more vehicles can fit into a smaller space.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/bernardmarr/files/2019/05/Artificial-Intelligence-In-The-Workplace-How-AI-Is-Transforming-Your-Employee-Experience-1200x800.jpeg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', 'width': 542.79, 'height': 304.6}",Artificial Intelligence In The Workplace: How AI Is Transforming Your Employee Experience,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/05/29/artificial-intelligence-in-the-workplace-how-ai-is-transforming-your-employee-experience/,,,Enterprise & Cloud,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has previously taken a number of roles at not-for-profit organisations and has a memoir, For the Record, due out later this year.Cameron said he was “delighted” to take the job working on “transforming the future of customer service and interpersonal communications”.The advisory board features an array of high-profile figures including John Browne, former chief executive of BP and François Fillon, the former prime minister of France. Afiniti was set up by the US-Pakistani entrepreneur Zia Chishti and specialises in the use of AI in call centres.Cameron resigned as prime minister after the remain campaign lost the Brexit referendum. Since then he has become president of Alzheimer’s Research UK, chair of the National Citizen Service’s board of patrons and chair of the LSE-Oxford commission on state fragility.Cameron said on Friday: “The government I led took a wide range of steps to ensure the UK was successful in the new tech industries … As part of this work, I was excited to see the rapid development in artificial intelligence and the huge potential AI has to address some of the challenges that societies face today … I am therefore delighted to have been asked to chair Afiniti’s advisory board, helping support their work to transform the future of customer service and interpersonal communications.”Chishti, the chair and chief executive of Afiniti, said the company was “delighted” at Cameron’s appointment. “David’s deep personal commitment to this issue makes him perfectly placed to lead our advisory board and support Afiniti in our next stage of growth.”Cameron is also involved in a new UK-China investment fund, although this has so far failed to complete its first financial fundraising. His memoir is due to be published this autumn after the rights were sold to the publisher William Collins for £800,000 three years ago. The launch will be a year later than planned.Explore more on these topicsDavid CameronArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this contentMost viewedTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsMy sausage-like fingers are not sexy.

The AI laboratory, based in Accra, will be used to develop solutions to help improve healthcare, agriculture and education.Overcoming obstaclesGoogle's head of AI Accra Moustapha Cisse is from Senegal.After completing an undergraduate degree in maths and physics in Senegal, he taught himself AI and then went to study in Paris, before joining Facebook.There are very few AI researchers from Africa, and Mr Cisse has faced great obstacles in achieving his ambitions. ""Despite the support, many of us still have trouble making it to conferences. I have had papers accepted at meetings but been unable to attend because Western countries such as Australia denied me a visa, even though I was already settled and working professionally in Europe,"" he wrote in his blog. ""We need more efforts to overcome these barriers and to ensure that the benefits of AI arrive globally.""He has long been concerned that AI is a missed opportunity for improving African lives, and that the AI industry is missing out on talent from African nations, because they do not have access to the right education.Getty ImagesThere are concerns young people in Africa are unable to join the global IT industry as they do not have access to the education they needToday people often have to travel out of the continent in order to gain the IT skills they need, before returning to Africa to try to build new businesses. To solve this problem, Mr Cisse has long advocated for better AI education across the continent, and he wants African governments to see AI as a key priority and support efforts to use AI for the good of humanity. ""AI has a lot to offer to Africa and Africa has a lot to offer to AI as well,"" he told the BBC.""AI can help accelerate discoveries in various sciences, and it can help in areas where our human expertise is not enough.""Enhancing IT in AfricaOne key area Mr Cisse believes AI can be a big help in Africa is in improving healthcare by automating diagnosis of diseases. He also thinks that using AI to automate translations would make it much easier for African nations to communicate and do business, since there are 2,000 languages being spoken on a daily basis on the continent.But in order to advance AI developments, Africa needs a robust IT industry.In Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, the African Institute for Mathematical Scientists (AIMS) is running a one-year Masters degree programme in partnership with Facebook and Google to create the next generation of tech leaders.GoogleThe Google Africa AI research centre in Accra, GhanaThe degree is the first Masters programme of its kind on the continent.

Human gamers know just how hard it is to win a new spin on the classic computer game Quake: In a mazelike arena, they must work with other players to capture floating flags—all while dodging deadly gunfire. Now, for the first time, artificial intelligence (AI) has mastered teamwork in a complex first-person video game, coordinating its actions with both human and computer teammates to consistently beat opponents. ""The scale of the experiments is remarkable,"" says Michael Littman, an AI expert at Brown University. Getting AI agents to work together is incredibly tough, he says. Although AI can drive cars and easily defeat the world's greatest chess and Go players one on one, researchers have struggled to get it to master teamwork. The practice may seem intuitive to us, but predicting how others will behave—a crucial component of working on a team—adds a whole new level of complexity and uncertainty for AI to deal with.

In the new study, researchers got AI bots to teach each other to work as a team. Their classroom was a simplified version of 1999 first-person shooter, Quake III Arena. The game involves two teams that navigate around a 3D map to retrieve a flag from their opponent's base and return it to theirs. The team with the most captures after 5 minutes wins. Players also fire a laser to tag enemies, sending them back to their home base. To train the AI to work as a team, the scientists created 30 different bots and pitted them against each other in a series of matches on randomly generated maps. The bots trained using brain-inspired algorithms called neural networks, which learn from data by altering the strength of connections between artificial neurons. The only data the bots had to learn from was the first-person visual perspective of their character and game points, awarded for things like picking up flags or tagging opponents.      Initially the bots acted randomly. But when their actions scored points, the connections that led to the behavior were strengthened through a process called reinforcement learning. The training program also culled the bots that tended to lose and replaced them with mutated copies of top performers inspired by the way genetic variation and natural selection help animals evolve.Advertisement After 450,000 games, the researchers arrived at the best bot, which they named For The Win (FTW). They then tested it in various matches with a mirror FTW, an FTW bot missing a crucial learning element, the game's in-built bots, and humans. Teams of FTW bots consistently outperformed all other groups, though humans paired with FTW bots were able to beat them 5% of the time, they report today in Science. The FTW bots learned to play seamlessly with humans and machines, and they even developed classic cooperative strategies, says study co-leader Max Jaderberg, an AI researcher at Google-owned DeepMind in London. Those strategies included following teammates in order to outnumber opponents in later firefights and loitering near the enemy base when their teammate has the flag to immediately grab it when it reappears. In one test, the bots invented a completely novel strategy, exploiting a bug that let teammates give each other a speed boost by shooting them in the back. ""What was amazing during the development of this project was seeing the emergence of some of these high-level behaviors,"" Jaderberg says. ""These are things we can relate to as human players."" The approach is still a long way from working in the real world, Jaderberg adds. But the advance is good for more than computer games. If AI can learn to work in teams, it could make everything from self-driving cars that avoid crashes by coordinating with each other to robotic surgical assistants that help out doctors during procedures. Still, Littman warns against extrapolating too much from a relatively simple computer simulation. ""It could be that the details of this particular game require only a very narrow slice of what we think of as teamwork,"" he says. And that, he says, means there's no guarantee the same approach would teach AI to work as a team on other tasks.

While discussions over the safety of its development keep escalating, developers expand abilities and capacity of artificial intellect. Today Artificial Intelligence went far beyond science fiction idea. It became a necessity. Being widely used for processing and analyzing huge volumes of data, AI helps to handle the work that cannot be done manually anymore because of its significantly increased volumes and intensity.For instance, AI is applied in analytics to build predictions that can help people create strong strategies and look for more effective solutions. FinTech applies AI in investment platforms to do market research and predict where to invest funds for bigger profits. The traveling industry uses AI to deliver personalized suggestions or launch chatbots, plus enhance the overall user experience. These examples show that AI and ML are used process loads of data to offer better user experience, more personal and accurate one.How AI and ML Form Technologies of the FutureToday, with the expansion of volumes and complexity of data, AI and ML are used for its processing and analysis. To be fair, the human brain can analyze large amounts of data, but this ability is limited by the volume of data it can absorb at any moment. Artificial intelligence is free from this limitation. More accurate predictions and insights delivered by AI improve business efficiency, lower production cost and increase productivity. No wonder that many industries apply AI and ML to improve performance and propel the product development.According to Deloitte research, AI-fueled companies are the latest trend in the technological transformation aimed at improvement of productivity. That is also proved by their prediction that within the next 24 months the number of companies that will use AI in their products and processes to achieve greater efficiency and strategic goals will likely increase. To put it short, AI helps doing better work with fewer efforts.Given the listed advantages of AI usage, more and more companies are eager to use it. However, AI is a two-way street — being used for optimization of the analytic process it is not the easiest technology to develop. Due to huge volumes of data to be analyzed, the AI product has to be able to handle the high-loaded process effectively and does not take too much time for that. To make it work properly, the appropriate language has to be chosen for its development. The one that will not be too complex in terms of syntax, will be able to handle sophisticated processes and is easy to support.Python as the best programming language for AI and MLAs AI and ML are being applied across various channels and industries, big corporations invest in these fields, and the demand for experts in ML and AI grows accordingly. Jean Francois Puget, from IBM’s machine learning department, expressed his opinion that Python is the most popular language for AI and ML and based it on a trend search results on indeed.com.According to the graph from Francois Puget, Python is the major code language for AI and ML.We have conducted some research on Python’s strong sides and found out why you should opt in for Python when bringing your AI and ML projects to life.You May Also Like:Machine Learning and Data Analytics in the Travel IndustryOne of the most famous travellers of all times, Christopher Columbus, made only 4 journeys during all his life. One of…djangostars.com6 Examples of AI in Financial ServicesJust as many other technological advancements, Artificial Intelligence came to our lives from the pages of fairy tales…djangostars.com1. A great library ecosystemA great choice of libraries is one of the main reasons Python is the most popular programming language used for AI. A library is a module or a group of modules published by different sources like PyPi which include a pre-written piece of code that allows users to reach some functionality or perform different actions. Python libraries provide base level items so developers don’t have to code them from the very beginning every time.ML requires continuous data processing, and Python’s libraries let you access, handle and transform data. These are some of the most widespread libraries you can use for ML and AI:Scikit-learn for handling basic ML algorithms like clustering, linear and logistic regressions, regression, classification, and others.Pandas for high-level data structures and analysis. It allows merging and filtering of data, as well as gathering it from other external sources like Excel, for instance.Keras for deep learning. It allows fast calculations and prototyping, as it uses the GPU in addition to the CPU of the computer.TensorFlow for working with deep learning by setting up, training, and utilizing artificial neural networks with massive datasets.Matplotlib for creating 2D plots, histograms, charts, and other forms of visualization.NLTK for working with computational linguistics, natural language recognition, and processing.Scikit-image for image processing.PyBrain for neural networks, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.Caffe for deep learning that allows switching between the CPU and the GPU and processing 60+ mln images a day using a single NVIDIA K40 GPU.StatsModels for statistical algorithms and data exploration.In the PyPI repository, you can discover and compare more Python libraries.2. A low entry barrierWorking in the ML and AI industry means dealing with a bunch of data that you need to process in the most convenient and effective way. The low entry barrier allows more data scientists to quickly pick up Python and start using it for AI development without wasting too much effort into learning the language.Python programming language resembles the everyday English language, and that makes the process of learning easier. Its simple syntax allows you to comfortably work with complex systems, ensuring сlear relations between the system elements.For instance, this code is written in an attempt to find out if an input number is prime.Here’s the view of the code:test_number = 407 # our example is not a prime number# prime numbers are greater than 1if test_number > 1:# check for factorsnumber_list = range(2, test_number)for number in number_list:number_of_parts = test_number // numberprint(f""{test_number} is not a prime number"")print(f""{number} times {number_of_parts} is {test_number}"")breakelse:print(f""{test_number} is a prime number"")else:print(f""{test_number} is not a prime number"")And as you may see in the last row, the result of this code is that the test number is not a prime one. To put it bluntly, an English-speaking person could easily understand the meaning of the code, as it uses simple English words.In addition to this, there’s a lot of documentation available, and Python’s community is always there to help out and give advice.3. FlexibilityPython for machine learning is a great choice, as this language is very flexible:It offers an option to choose either to use OOPs or scripting.There’s also no need to recompile the source code, developers can implement any changes and quickly see the results.Programmers can combine Python and other languages to reach their goals.Moreover, flexibility allows developers to choose the programming styles which they are fully comfortable with or even combine these styles to solve different types of problems in the most efficient way.The imperative style consists of commands that describe how a computer should perform these commands. With this style, you define the sequence of computations which happen as a change of the program state.The functional style is also called declarative because it declares what operations should be performed. It doesn’t consider the program state, compared to the imperative style, it declares statements in the form of mathematical equations.The object-oriented style is based on two concepts: class and object, where similar objects form classes. This style is not fully supported by Python, as it can’t fully perform encapsulation, but developers can still use this style to a finite degree.The procedural style is the most common among beginners, as it proceeds tasks in a step-by-step format. It’s often used for sequencing, iteration, modularization, and selection.The flexibility factor decreases the possibility of errors, as programmers have a chance to take the situation under control and work in a comfortable environment.4. Platform independencePython is not only comfortable to use and easy to learn but also very versatile. What we mean is that Python for machine learning development can run on any platform including Windows, MacOS, Linux, Unix, and twenty-one others. To transfer the process from one platform to another, developers need to implement several small-scale changes and modify some lines of code to create an executable form of code for the chosen platform. Developers can use packages like PyInstaller to prepare their code for running on different platforms.Again, this saves time and money for tests on various platforms and makes the overall process more simple and convenient.5. ReadabilityPython is very easy to read so every Python developer can understand the code of their peers and change, copy or share it. There’s no confusion, errors or conflicting paradigms, and this leads to more a efficient exchange of algorithms, ideas, and tools between AI and ML professionals.There are also tools like IPython available, which is an interactive shell that provides extra features like testing, debugging, tab-completion, and others, and facilitates the work process.6. Good visualization optionsWe’ve already mentioned that Python offers a variety of libraries, and some of them are great visualization tools. However, for AI developers, it’s important to highlight that in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and machine learning, it’s vital to be able to represent data in a human-readable format.Libraries like Matplotlib allow data scientists to build charts, histograms, and plots for better data comprehension, effective presentation, and visualization. Different application programming interfaces also simplify the visualization process and make it easier to create clear reports.7. Community supportIt’s always very helpful when there’s strong community support built around the programming language. Python is an open-source language which means that there’s a bunch of resources open for programmers starting from beginners and ending with pros.A lot of Python documentation is available online as well as in Python communities and forums, where programmers and machine learning developers discuss errors, solve problems, and help each other out.Python programming language is absolutely free as is the variety of useful libraries and tools.8. Growing popularityAs a result of the advantages discussed above, Python is becoming more and more popular among data scientists. According to StackOverflow, the popularity of Python is predicted to grow until 2020, at least.This means it’s easier to search for developers and replace team players if required. Also, the cost of their work maybe not as high as when using a less popular programming language.Python use cases for AI and MLPython offers many features that are helpful for AI and ML in particular, and that makes it the best language for these purposes. No wonder that various industries use Python for predictions and other machine learning tasks.Let’s take a closer look at some examples in:Travel;Fintech;Transportation;Healthcare.TravelFor example, the travel industry giant Skyscanner used a Python unsupervised ML algorithm to predict the behavior of new airplane routes. They compared thousands of origins and destinations, evaluating each one of them with 30 different criteria to define the demand of passengers. Their results are displayed on a dashboard, where you can choose any origin city to see the groups of destinations numbered from 0 to 9 and their characteristics.Such an example of AI implementation in the traveling industry is extremely helpful for suggesting destinations to the users, assisting the creation of marketing budgets, as well as setting an initial price for new routes.FintechAI used in financial services helps to solve problems connected with risk management, fraud prevention, personalized banking, automation, and other tools which help to provide a high-quality financial service to the users. It’s predicted that AI in fintech could reduce operating costs by 22% by 2030, resulting in an impressive $1 trillion.Some successful examples of online banking software built on Python are Venmo, Affirm or Robinhood. These services not only allow users to make and control their payments and purchases but they also create a social network inside the software, so people can stay connected.When it comes to cryptocurrency, Python is used to build solutions like Anaconda to effectively analyze the market, make predictions and visualize data.TransportationUber developed an ML platform Michelangelo PyML using Python. They use it for online and offline predictions solving day-to-day tasks. The Michelangelo PyML is the extension of the initial Michelangelo product which was scalable but not flexible enough. Now, users can validate models with PyML and then replicate them in Michelangelo for full efficiency and scalability.HealthcareAI is reshaping the healthcare industry by helping to predict and scan diseases, detect injuries, and help people maintain good health even on a day-to-day basis with easy-to-use mobile applications.There are many great AI based projects in the industry. For example, Fathom is a natural language processing system which is made to analyze electronic health records, and their mission is “to automate medical coding.” Their leaders have come from companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook or the universities of Stanford and Harvard.AiCure is another startup focused on making sure that patients take the right medications at the right time. For that purpose, they use technologies like face recognition, pill recognition, and action recognition. The application is also able to analyze the patient’s state and understand if the treatment is working. They use IMA which is an interactive medical assistant that can gather clinically significant data which then can be analyzed by the software.Growing popularity leads to the growing demand for Python programmers inside the data science community, and it’s a wise choice to choose a language that’s in high demand, as, in the future, it will allow even more functionality.Python for machine learning: useful open source projectsThe open-source nature of Python allows any AI development company to share their achievements with the community. If you’ve made up your mind and decided to learn Python, or want to use this language for your AI projects, here’s a list of useful opensource projects for you to begin with:OpenCog FoundationOpenCog is “building better minds together” by putting effort into creating the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with human capacities. It was founded in 2011, and, now, it’s used at the SingularityNET project, as well as at the Hanson Robotics delivering intelligence to the Sofia and other robots.Institute for Artificial IntelligenceThe Institute of Artificial Intelligence is a part of the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of Bremen. It conducts research on AI and holds different workshops and events which help move the AI technologies forward, involving more young people into the sphere and educating them, while also supporting existing AI-powered projects and companies.ZulipIt’s the “world’s most productive team chat” that allows the processing of thousands of real-time messages a day. Fortune 500 companies and other large and open source projects use Zulip, which offers clear organization, asynchronous communication, and other great advantages that are useful for teams.MagentaMagenta is a Python library and a research project, the biggest goal of which is to make music and art using AI. It works on image, songs, drawings generation and lets artists explore new ways of creating.MailPileMailPile is an innovative email client that focuses on safe and private communication. It’s a project that tries to answer a question: “How can I protect my privacy online?” It’s fast, has no ads and comes with a powerful search function as well as privacy and encryption.Summing it upAI and ML are fast-growing and universal technologies that let scientists resolve real-life dilemmas and come up with clever solutions.

In the war between machines and mankind, the machines have gained the upper hand.
It’s bad enough that computers can now beat us at chess, Jeopardy, and Go. Artificial intelligence-driven algorithms are now tackling jobs once considered the exclusive province of living, breathing bipeds. That includes doctors, lawyers, teachers, and, yes, IT professionals.
McKinsey estimates that roughly half of all work activities could be automated using today’s technology, and that up to 30 percent of global workers could be displaced by 2030. The jobs of millions more will be changed forever by AI.

But automation will also create new roles and opportunities that did not exist before. Whether those new jobs will be sufficient to replace the ones made obsolete is an open question.

Are you at risk of being replaced by an algorithm? And if so, what can you do about it?
Here’s what you need to know about our glorious robotic future.











 
 
 
Take this job and code it
As in virtually every industry, the IT jobs that will be automated first involve repetitive and often manual work that doesn’t require a lot of human discretion, notes Keith Strier, global and America’s advisory leader for AI at consulting giant EY.
“If you’re a sysadmin, or tier one tech support, or even in cybersecurity but your primary job is to look for certain signals and indicators, your jobs are up for grabs,” he says.
According to researchers at Oxford University and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, database administrators have a 39 percent chance of having their jobs automated. If you’re an IT operations tech, that number rises to 78 percent.











 
 
 
Those numbers will also vary depending on where you live, says Dr. Hyejin Youn, assistant professor of management and organizations at Kellogg. The smaller the city, the more likely your job will be taken over by a machine.

“These job titles won’t become extinct,” explains Youn. “There will still be a need for humans in the occupation, but the tasks will change, and the number of people doing it will be much smaller.”
Because IT is continually asked to do more every year, usually without a huge boost in budget, Strier says IT departments are more likely to reassign employees to more advanced tasks and use automation to fill the gaps.











 
 
 
“It’s less about letting people go, and more about reduced hiring,” he says. “Doubling capacity without doubling headcount seems to be an increasingly popular way of looking at the savings automation creates.”
But what’s changing is the types of tasks that can automated, notes Forrest Brazeal, senior cloud architect for Trek10, a cloud consultancy. In a widely shared essay titled “The Creeping IT Apocalypse,” Brazeal wrote about the quiet decimation of low- and mid-level IT jobs brought about by the growth of cloud services and AI.
While the loss of jobs through automation has been a byproduct of technology advancement since the industrial revolution, Brazeal says this time is different.











 
 
 
“This is a sea change,” he says in a phone interview. “Entire disciplines will be going away. There will be much less call for Windows sysadmins, DBAs, and network engineers. That’s what a lot of people are missing, and it’s what I mean when I talk about the ‘creeping apocalypse.'”
Alexa, write me an application
One of the higher-level jobs that AI will soon take on is writing code. In fact, the quest to automate programming is already well underway.
In 2017, Google’s AutoML research project demonstrated that it could generate machine-learning software that’s sometimes more accurate than similar programs written by humans. It’s now available as a cloud-based service that allows developers with limited machine learning experience to train ML models.











 
 
 
Last year, computer scientists at Rice University unveiled BAYOU, an AI application that uses “Neural Sketch Learning” to generate code. After studying 100 million lines of Java on GitHub, the DARPA-funded tool is able to recognize high-level patterns in programs and recreate similar ones on demand. Enter a few keywords to tell BAYOU the kind of program you want to create, and it will spit out Java code to fit the bill.
AWS’s App Sync and Amplify “low-code/no-code” development automation services are another example of this, says Brazeal.
“The idea is to take most of the work out of creating a traditional back end, so you can spin it up and have it happen automatically with just a few lines of config,” he says.











 
 
 
Once that’s in place, he adds, you’ve eliminated an entire class of software developers. And the writing for many of the rest is clearly on the wall.
“We’re starting to see the beginning of ‘conversational programming’ — the ability to build services by saying, ‘Alexa, take these components and put them together to give me an application,'” he says. “We’re not there yet, but it’s something to keep an eye on.”
People first?
When executives talk about automation, they invariably say that relieving IT employees of boring and repetitive tasks frees them to take on more strategic roles and responsibilities. But when you ask what those new roles will look like, and how employees will make that transition, you tend to get a blank stare.











 
 
 
The fact is, few organizations have even thought about it, says Strier.
“The majority of these projects are being championed by a mid-level executive who’s been told to reduce overhead or improve customer service or some other goal,” he says. “They’ve not been empowered to worry about the future of their workforce. To them, that’s an HR issue. They truly believe automation will free up their workforce to do more important things, but no one does the work to figure out what that is.”
Strier says he has one client, a large telecommunications firm, that has thought through the implications of how automation will change what its employees do. That firm was forced to address these issues because it was heavily unionized.











 
 
 
“That enabled them to say to the unions, ‘Look, we’ve identified job classifications that will be more deeply impacted over the next three years. We can give notice to those employees and offer them an opportunity to think about retraining,'” he says. “That’s better than getting a letter on Monday saying, ‘We’re shutting down your department.'”
Implementing this kind of broad organizational change is not a trivial task, says Stanton Jones, director of research for ISG, a technology and research advisory firm.
“The vision many enterprises have is that they’re going to take that 30 percent of people’s tasks and repurpose them for something more important,” says Jones. “But doing that for hundreds or thousands of people is really hard work. I’m not saying it can’t be done — a small number of companies are really rethinking how their organizations can be run — but it requires they put people ahead of their cost savings and productivity goals. That’s pretty rare.”











 
 
 
Augmented, not replaced
It’s an article of faith that as jobs continue to be made obsolete by automation, new roles will emerge to replace them. And so it goes with AI, which will both dramatically change today’s jobs and create new ones that do not yet exist, notes Erik Brown, a senior director in West Monroe Partners’ technology practice.
“In a few years it will be hard to find a job that’s not augmented by AI,” he says. “Think about financial services and fraud detection, or risk exposure in investments. AI will be used by utility companies to predict how weather will impact energy demand, and by insurance companies to process claims. And there will be a lot of jobs in education, teaching people how to use their business knowledge to train algorithms.”
Likewise, Brown adds, network engineering jobs could evolve into roles that use AI to manage data centers more efficiently, as Google did with the DeepMind algorithms it developed to defeat a human champion at the Chinese game of Go.











 
 
 
One of the biggest sources of new jobs will be embedding AI into hardware such as robots or autonomous vehicles, says Strier.
“Integration of that software and hardware is very complex, and it won’t happen on its own,” he says. “So while you might have used AI to write some of the software, ultimately humans will need to do the integration, modeling, and testing of these complex hardware/software configurations.”
Newly emerging roles such as ITops data scientists, AIOps architects, and automation path designers will be created as a result of AI-driven automation, says Will Cappelli, CTO for EMEA at Moogsoft.











 
 
 
“The human side of IT will have to shift from observation to analysis, which is why professionals in these future positions will need skills involving mathematics and an end-to-end understanding of how modern IT systems behave,” he adds.
At the executive level, companies riding the AI wave are looking to hire data-savvy executives who combine business skills and analytics expertise, says Scott Snyder, a partner with Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search and consulting firm. 
“We place a lot of leadership positions like chief AI officer and chief data officer,” says Snyder. “We’re always looking for people with data-intensive backgrounds who can graft those skills with institutional or functional knowledge, such as HR, legal, or supply chain.”
Brave new jobs
AI is also likely to generate a raft of other jobs that are just barely visible on the horizon, says Amber Bouchard, director of talent acquisition for Maven Wave, a digital transformation consulting firm.











 
 
 
One of those roles could be “citizen data scientist,” she says. Such an employee would analyze data and extract insights, but without the need for an advanced degree in statistics — like a business analyst on steroids.
Another new role would be “neutral AI assurance expert,” a master coder who can detect potentially biased algorithms in complex machine-learning models. And once the impacts of AI start to become felt, companies may also want a chief ethics officer to oversee the moral implications of machine learning and AI in the workplace.
“Organizations will need a person who can partner with HR, senior management, and C-level executives to oversee the implementations of these new technologies,” Bouchard says. “Someone will have to erect virtual walls and help organizations navigate the waters of technological advancement.”
She adds that there will remain tens of millions of jobs that can’t be easily automated.
“There are many jobs that are susceptible to automation,” Bouchard says. “There are just as many jobs, especially within firms like ours, that require the judgment, social skills and hard-to-automate human capabilities that AI cannot take away.”
Robot wranglers
In the meantime, IT pros worried about being replaced by robots should think seriously about diversifying their skill sets and consider becoming full-stack engineers, says ISG’s Jones.
“People who can manage everything from the web server through middleware, the operating system, and even down to the virtual machine layer are in huge demand,” says Jones. “Organizations cannot find those people fast enough. But if you’re stuck on a single set of technologies, that’s going to be problematic.”
Jobs that consist of “undifferentiated heavy lifting” are always the first to go, adds Brazeal. The more generic the tasks you perform each day, the more likely you’ll be replaced by code. Developing expertise in areas that add bottom-line value to the company are the best ways to ensure job security.
And while you won’t need to become an AI expert, deep familiarity with the available AI solutions will become increasingly necessary.
“The skill sets the tech department will need to remain relevant won’t be building AI systems,” says Strier. “They’ll need to be experts on the different solutions in the field, the strategic use of this technology, and how to integrate third-party AI services into their operations.”
In other words, he adds, tech pros won’t necessarily need to know how to build a facial recognition algorithm, but they will need to know how to pick the right one for their company.
That’s something robots can’t do… yet.

Live00:0003:5903:59 Music made by machines? Inside the latest revolution in music03:59Cantor is not alone. Composers he has worked with are eager to use new technology as a tool for pushing their work into new areas. And it's not just in classical music. With several new musical programs emerging that encourage musicians to compose with AI, tech enthusiast and former American Idol contestant Taryn Southern released the first pop album to be co-written and co-produced with artificial intelligence.Turning patterns into musicAI is essentially a pattern-recognition system. Feed it enough data, and it will find patterns within that information that it can use to make decisions. In the case of the Schubert symphony, the decisions were about which musical notes should be placed where.And there are other examples of AI's creativity, from other disciplines.Artists like the Munich-based Mario Klingemann have used AI to recognize patterns across thousands of 14th to 17th century European oil portraits to create an ever-changing single work, highlighting a “greatest hits” medley of images. (The work sold at auction in March for more than $50,000.)Similarly, software from Open AI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company, can write a portion of a news story and then have AI write the rest. (The results are so convincing that Open AI, fearful of building a fake-news machine that any propaganda outlet or hostile nation could use to spread disinformation, released only a limited version of the software to the public.)RelatedTechnologyTechnologyAI can predict when someone will die with unsettling accuracyFor Cantor and Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that built the software used to complete the Schubert symphony, the question was which dataset to use to train the software. All of Western music? All classical music?In the end, Cantor and engineers from Huawei fed as much of Schubert’s catalog as they could find — roughly 2,000 pieces of piano music — into the software inside the company's new Mate 20 phone. The goal was to teach the AI to think like Schubert and to compose new passages, including what Cantor calls the “heart and soul of any piece of music”: the melody.
“I was impressed that a computer could generate musical ideas, so everything that it sent me back I found to be kind of incredible,"" Cantor says. ""It’s like having a collaborator that has an endless stream of ideas, that never gets tired, that never runs out of ideas, that never has a bad attitude and never needs to take a break.”Once the AI suggested a series of new melodies, Cantor used his professional expertise to choose one. Then he elaborated on the software's notes, adding instruments and harmonies to flesh out the AI's contribution into a full movement.Can algorithms replace composers?Economists, behavioral scientists and other experts have long argued that AI could one day automate entire industries, from delivery driving to dry cleaning. Critics of AI have concluded, however, that even the most sophisticated AI software can’t replace our most quintessentially human capacity: the ability to find inspiration in the world around us and use our innate creativity to make art.But even the most beautiful music is, ultimately, just code. Algorithms can be taught to write code, and when an algorithm has seen enough of the musical code it's being asked to emulate, it can compose music that sounds, well, human.Does this mean artificial intelligence can now take the place of a skilled composer? Cantor demurs, calling AI “just another tool in the toolbox” when he’s composing and saying he exploits all sorts of technology during the creative process. “The guitar is a piece of technology that you would collaborate with,"" he says. ""None of these things can make music on their own. When put in the hands of a capable human, they can really augment the human potential. And AI is not different.”But what happens when AI is used to create entire compositions?Southern, the Los Angeles-based pop artist, says the technology — which she says makes the process of composing more like shopping for a melody — is perfect for someone like her: a music lover who grew up writing code but who lacks formal training in either discipline.“Music was always a fun hobby for me, but I always felt like I didn’t actually have the skill set to make it as a musician,” Southern said. “But understanding the language of data and how music can translate into data made so much sense to me.”Pop artist and former American Idol contestant Taryn Southern sits down with NBC News Tech Correspondent Jacob Ward to chat about her album, co-produced and co-written with artificial intelligence.Chiara SottileFor her new album, ""I Am AI,"" Southern composed songs using the artificial intelligence platform Amper. But it's just one of several similar programs musicians can use to compose songs, including Google’s Magenta, Sony's Flow Machines and Jukedeck. Each of these programs makes it possible for a musician to pick the key of music, specific instruments, the beats per minute of the rhythm as well as the point where the music builds to a climax. Then the artificial intelligence offers up a range of options that the musician can choose from — picking one, combining several or altering their initial input for an alternative result.Difficult questionsThe creators of Amper, who imagined that it would be used to replace musicians typically hired to compose and record promotional music, fed it a variety of genres. Choose “documentary,” “futuristic” and “hopeful,” and up comes a spare, glitchy track with an upbeat bass line. Choose “trap bombastic,” and you can imagine the result rattling the windows of your car.RecommendedScience NewsScience NewsPerseid meteor shower, one of the most dramatic of the year, is underwaySpaceSpaceScientists have confirmed a cave on the moon that could be used to shelter future explorersThe music created by Amper and similar programs is essentially indistinguishable from what you can hear on any radio station, and it raises difficult questions. For example, if we use pattern-recognition software to create only music that is similar to what we’ve enjoyed in the past, will we wind up trapped in a feedback loop? How will musicians find new inspiration if they are only sampling what’s already been done? Will music lovers of future generations wind up listening only to variations on compositions from the past?Southern says that, for better or for worse, the need to produce nearly endless amounts of new work will drive the market for music-composition AI software. “There is a tremendous amount of pressure for any content creator to be constantly producing faster, better and stronger,” she says.And if the result sounds as good as anything composed by a human, is that necessarily a bad thing? “These tools will actually just fortify creativity,” she says. “And ultimately, it’s not really about, ‘Is the computer being creative?’ It’s about, ‘Does the person who’s listening to the music or looking at the art think it’s being creative?’”Want more stories about technology?Watch Mona Lisa come to life in startling 'deepfake' videosAI can predict when someone will die with unsettling accuracyScientists turn brain signals into speech with help from AISIGN UP FOR THE MACH NEWSLETTER AND FOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.",,Music made by machines?

But what they can output is often beyond the realms of our mindsSave this storySaveSave this storySaveArtificial intelligence is spreading through our lives. As it moves from new feeds to productivity tools, the boundary between what is human-made and machine-made is becoming almost invisible, resulting in vast shifts in how we perceive and interact with the world.AI has surprised us with how it can move, see and hear, but also, with what it can create. Once thought of as a solely human trait, creativity is now a debated topic. Can AI fully master the creative process? Or is a thought process constrained by what us humans define it as?In 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo system trounced the world’s reigning champion, Lee Sedol at Go – an ancient Chinese game – by using its creative intelligence to devise a winning strategy. Although AlphaGo has been described as years ahead of its time, AI is rapidly sweeping into our everyday lives and its advancement has begun to transform and aid creative processes, as well as challenge what we believe to be ‘creative thinking’.Trending NowMoistCr1TiKaL Answers The Web's Most Searched QuestionsIn one game against Sedol, the Google system's 37th move was one no human would think to make. ""It's not a human move. I've never seen a human play this move,"" one fellow Go champion said, before adding that it was ""beautiful"".Using its ability to learn human creativity from vast datasets and quickly produce solutions to tough problems, AI is creating a new landscape of creative opportunity. “As humans we are very good at making sophisticated decisions to select the best fit by taking into account convoluted considerations,” says Daghan Cam and Michail Desyllas, Founders of Ai Build, who use AI and robotic technologies for additive manufacturing. “However, we are not very good at producing large arrays of possible solutions to choose from. We lose our ability to take these decisions efficiently and consistently as the number of possible solutions increases.”AdvertisementAI is a solution to this issue and is enabling designers such as Cam and Desyllas to construct better designs by accelerating their thought processes and increasing their creative options. By using AI to automate the production process, Ai Build reduces material usage, labour and costs whilst creating complex designs that were once impossible to devise and build. In one instance it used concrete in irregular shaped molds to reduce the amount of material needed.Creative AI is being used as more than a workmanlike tool, however. It is also influencing the music industry, giving musicians the ability to better understand their creative process and even themselves. Beatboxer Reeps One, also known as Harry Yeff, is the first voice artist to perform a ‘battle’ with an AI opponent. Via a deep-learning programme, a machine was programmed to categorizes Yeff’s sounds, but also create its own music.After taking part in chess tournaments and using AI to improve his game, Yeff was initially fascinated with developing what he calls a ‘pet self’ – one which challenges you and leads you towards a new innovation. “I loved the idea of how an opponent can interrupt you and force you to become more,” Yeff explains. “AI is not an ‘other’ – a hijacked sci-fi representation; it's a tool, and it's something that we’re already engaging with every day.” AI can allow musicians such as Yeff to better understand and develop their creative abilities and, similar to Sedol’s competition with AlphaGo, raise their game.Most PopularCultureThe Real Reason Will Smith Broke Twitch’s Biggest Streaming RecordBy Adam BumasGearThe Top New Features Coming to Apple’s iOS 18 and iPadOS 18By Julian ChokkattuPoliticsJ.D.

As far back as 2015, people were confusing computer-generated music with classic pieces from the composer J.S. Bach.Similarly to Ai Build and Yeff, visual artist Anna Ridler is using AI as a tool to shape her creative strategy. In Ridler’s latest project ‘Tulips,’ she took photographs of flowers and produced an algorithm that created thousands of notional tulip varieties with unique characteristics. Although Ridler’s project illustrates the creative possibilities of AI used in visual art, Ridler says recommendation algorithms are changing the industry by influencing artists and curators to create work which society is more likely to engage with.“A lot of curation of art and design is now being driven by data and what people seem to like,” she says. “Netflix has probably had more of an impact on film making than any deep fake technology.” In an auction at the end of October 2018, an AI-generated portrait of a fictitious man sold for £341,000.In addition to giving creatives more options, insight into their work, and the awareness of audience engagement, AI is influencing creativity by being programmed to complete mundane tasks so that practitioners can focus on more creative ones. This is widely illustrated in the gaming industry, where AI helps automate game development tasks such as testing programs.Yet, AI used in creative practice today is self-controlled, meaning that it works within a controlled environment and is programmed to do what its creators tell it. “Creative people still want a lot of control over what AI is allowed to do,” says Mike Cook, an AI researcher at Queen Mary University of London and programmer of ‘Games by Angelina’ — an AI that builds its own games.“That's not a bad thing, and it's still letting AI enhance our work in incredible ways, but I think the next step – accepting AI into our work as a contributor – it will be a huge shift in the way people create.” In the future, Cook thinks that AI might take on a fully creative and personal role in playing and designing games. For example, in future versions of Minecraft, an AI might be programmed to have an active relationship with the player and help them achieve their goals. DeepMind has already proved it can play the infinitely complex StarCraft better than humans.Most PopularCultureThe Real Reason Will Smith Broke Twitch’s Biggest Streaming RecordBy Adam BumasGearThe Top New Features Coming to Apple’s iOS 18 and iPadOS 18By Julian ChokkattuPoliticsJ.D.

Once thought of as a solely human trait, creativity is now a debated topic. Can AI fully master the creative process? Or is a thought process constrained by what us humans define it as?
In 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo system trounced the world’s reigning champion, Lee Sedol at Go – an ancient Chinese game – by using its creative intelligence to devise a winning strategy. Although AlphaGo has been described as years ahead of its time, AI is rapidly sweeping into our everyday lives and its advancement has begun to transform and aid creative processes, as well as challenge what we believe to be ‘creative thinking’.
In one game against Sedol, the Google system's 37th move was one no human would think to make. ""It's not a human move. I've never seen a human play this move,"" one fellow Go champion said, before adding that it was ""beautiful"".
Using its ability to learn human creativity from vast datasets and quickly produce solutions to tough problems, AI is creating a new landscape of creative opportunity. “As humans we are very good at making sophisticated decisions to select the best fit by taking into account convoluted considerations,” says Daghan Cam and Michail Desyllas, Founders of Ai Build, who use AI and robotic technologies for additive manufacturing. “However, we are not very good at producing large arrays of possible solutions to choose from. We lose our ability to take these decisions efficiently and consistently as the number of possible solutions increases.”
AI is a solution to this issue and is enabling designers such as Cam and Desyllas to construct better designs by accelerating their thought processes and increasing their creative options. By using AI to automate the production process, Ai Build reduces material usage, labour and costs whilst creating complex designs that were once impossible to devise and build. In one instance it used concrete in irregular shaped molds to reduce the amount of material needed.
Creative AI is being used as more than a workmanlike tool, however. It is also influencing the music industry, giving musicians the ability to better understand their creative process and even themselves. Beatboxer Reeps One, also known as Harry Yeff, is the first voice artist to perform a ‘battle’ with an AI opponent. Via a deep-learning programme, a machine was programmed to categorizes Yeff’s sounds, but also create its own music.
After taking part in chess tournaments and using AI to improve his game, Yeff was initially fascinated with developing what he calls a ‘pet self’ – one which challenges you and leads you towards a new innovation. “I loved the idea of how an opponent can interrupt you and force you to become more,” Yeff explains. “AI is not an ‘other’ – a hijacked sci-fi representation; it's a tool, and it's something that we’re already engaging with every day.” AI can allow musicians such as Yeff to better understand and develop their creative abilities and, similar to Sedol’s competition with AlphaGo, raise their game.
“It blew my mind when they told me that in a ten minute clip of me performing, I technically made 140 fixed variations of kick drum and that's because of the subtle human changes, which are far beyond human observation.” Although AI has enabled Yeff to further unlock his creative potential, he stresses how science fiction has influenced people to view AI as a separate entity and the importance of artists in breaking down this stigma. “It’s a responsibility of artists like myself to go into these spaces with no agenda and try to raise awareness and engage with it to make sure that people are seeing how these things can be used,” Yeff explains.

When more than a year ago ‘deepfake’, algorithm-generated porn movies, which combined actor bodies with faces of famous actors or other celebrities, became big news, the technological process that made this possible was still not fully developed.  You still had to use existing moving images in the process, to come up with convincing ‘fakes.’
Now, news coming from Samsung A.I. labs located in Moscow, suggests that this process has grown leaps and bounds since then. According to a paper that institution published, they were able to convincingly turn Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa into a living person that moves, talks, etc. with just the use of a single still picture.
Samsung’s researchers performed the same process on the images of Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein. By a process that is called “puppeteering”, they ‘mapped’ the moving facial features of other people onto their images. As the researchers explained the process can be done with just one image but the effect and realism can be even better recreated with the use of more images.See alsoLatest Buzz·3 min readWestward Ho!

As British Telegraph points out, in this age of fake news the effect  that could have on political manipulation is immense, particularly since there was already an instance in which a convincing fake video was created when a speech by former US President Barack Obama was ‘mapped’ onto Russian President  Vladimir Putin, making it look like he was actually making that speech.

Information prepared by data labelers in Africa, the construction workers of the digital world, create an important part of Silicon Valley’s efforts in AI. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and Yahoo use Samasource, a U.S. firm that creates AI training data and information around images, by using some of the poorest tech laborers in Kenya. Since AI is nothing without human labeling, will tech companies continue to walk the fine line of off-shoring what is slated to be the most dynamic part of the global economy?

The Breakdown You Need to Know
Data labeling is a necessary part of machine learning and there's an obvious motivation for these companies to use workers in parts of the world where wages are rock bottom. Not to mention the market for AI data preparation was $500M in 2018 and is expected to hit $1.2B by the end of 2023, according to Cognilytica.
Samasource provides what it calls a living wage to Kenyan AI data labelers of around $13-$16 a day, and CultureBanx notes that the average worker in the country makes about $3 a day, but it’s still chump change for big tech companies. They would be hard pressed to find U.S. data labeling experts to do boring, repetitive, never ending work at that price point. Low wage jobs like these don’t just exist in Africa, they are also in Southeast Asia.
PROMOTED
Microsoft’s Mary Gary told Axios these workers play a significant role and that economists don't have a handle on how to price the market. “We've been pricing this labor as a durable good, but it's the collective intelligence that's the value proposition"" Gary said.

Farming Out Big Data
The main reason big tech companies farm out these jobs is because data preparation and engineering tasks represent over 80% of the time consumed in most AI and machine learning projects. Since time is money, they don’t want to pay people a lot of it for repetitive labeling.
Even Intel’s head of data science notes it’s common practice to outsource these positions, “A healthy company with proper data science leadership will already make a distinction between data scientists and data engineers or data labelers, and will often hire vendors to do data annotation work.”
Still wondering what data labeling is? When artificial intelligence works as intended many tech companies shout its praises, but beyond the looking glass is a large AI low-wage labor force building its foundation. They upload images and then identify just about everything from people, animals, buildings, cars, signs and even the sky. By doing this across millions of images, AI systems can begin to recognize these objects in the real world.
The human in the AI loop isn’t going away anytime soon for data labeling and AI quality control. It’s also going to be a while before the technology these African workers are helping to create will be used in communities where they live. Many of these laborers often live below the poverty line, and continue to fuel a new type of blue-collar industry around curating the data that powers AI.

On Tuesday, May 28, MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) hosted a special TEDx event featuring an all-female line-up of MIT scientists and researchers who discussed cutting-edge ideas in science and technology.
TEDxMIT speakers included roboticists, engineers, astronomers, and policy experts, including former White House chief technology officer Megan Smith ’86 SM ’88 and MIT Institute Professor Emerita Barbara Liskov, winner of the A.M. Turing Award, often considered the “Nobel Prize for computing.”
From Professor Nergis Mavalvala’s work on gravitational waves to Associate Provost Krystyn Van Vliet’s efforts to improve cell therapy, the afternoon was filled with energizing and historic success stories of women in STEM.
In an early talk, MIT Associate Professor Julie Shah touched on the much-discussed narrative of artificial intelligence and job displacement, and how that relates to her own work creating systems that she described as “being intentional about augmenting human capabilities.”She spoke about her efforts developing robots to help reduce the cognitive burden of overwhelmed workers, like the nurses on labor wards who have to make hundreds of split-second decisions for scheduling deliveries and C-sections.
“We can create a future where we don’t have robots who replace humans, but that help us accomplish what neither group can do alone,” said Shah.
CSAIL Director Daniela Rus, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science, spoke of how computer scientists can inspire the next generation of programmers by emphasizing the many possibilities that coding opens up.
“I like to say that those of us who know how to ... breathe life into things through programming have superpowers,” said Rus.
Throughout the day scientists showed off technologies that could fundamentally transform many industries, from Professor Dava Newman’s prototype Mars spacesuit to Associate Professor Vivienne Sze’s low-power processors for machine learning.
Judy Brewer, director of the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Accessibility Initiative, discussed the ways in which the web has made the world a more connected place for those with disabilities — and yet, how important it is for the people who design digital technologies to be better about making them accessible.
“When the web became available, I could go and travel anywhere,” Brewer said. “There’s a general history of excluding people with disabilities, and then we go and design tech that perpetuates that exclusion. In my vision of the future everything is accessible, including the digital world.”
Liskov captivated the audience with her tales of the early days of computer programming. She was asked to learn Fortran on her first day of work in 1961 — having never written a line of code before.
“I didn’t have any training,” she said. “But then again, nobody did.”
In 1971 Liskov joined MIT, where she created the programming language CLU, which established the notion of “abstract data types” and laid the groundwork for languages like Java and C#. Many coders now take so-called “object-oriented programming” (OOP) for granted: She wryly reflected on how, after she won the Turing Award, one internet commenter looked at her contributions to data abstraction and pointed out that “everybody knows that, anyway.”
“It was a statement to how much the world has changed,” she said with a smile. “When I was doing that work decades earlier, nobody knew anything about [OOP].”
Other researchers built off of Liskov’s remarks in discussing the birth of big data and machine learning. Professor Ronitt Rubinfeld spoke about how computer scientists’ work in sublinear time algorithms has allowed them to better make sense of large amounts of data, while Hamsa Balakrishnan spoke about the ways in which algorithms can help systems engineers make air travel more efficient.
The event’s overarching theme was highlighting examples of female role models in fields where they’ve often been overlooked. Paula Hammond, head of MIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering, touted the fact that more than half of undergraduates in her department this year were women. Rus urged the women in the audience, many of whom were MIT students, to think about what role they might want to play in continuing to advance science in the coming years.
“To paraphrase our hometown hero, President John F. Kennedy, we need to prepare [women] to see both what technology can do for them — and what they can do for technology,” Rus said.
Rus led the planning of the TEDxMIT event alongside MIT research affiliate John Werner and student directors Stephanie Fu and Rucha Kelkar, both first-years.

Call for independent watchdog to monitor NZ government use of artificial intelligence

New Zealand is a leader in government use of artificial intelligence (AI). It is part of a global network of countries that use predictive algorithms in government decision making, for anything from the optimal scheduling of public hospital beds to whether an offender should be released from prison, based on their likelihood of reoffending, or the efficient processing of simple insurance claims.
But the official use of AI algorithms in government has been in the spotlight in recent years. On the plus side, AI can enhance the accuracy, efficiency and fairness of day-to-day decision making. But concerns have also been expressed regarding transparency, meaningful human control, data protection and bias.
In a report released today, we recommend New Zealand establish a new independent regulator to monitor and address the risks associated with these digital technologies.
AI and transparency
There are three important issues regarding transparency.
One relates to the inspectability of algorithms. Some aspects of New Zealand government practice are reassuring. Unlike some countries that use commercial AI products, New Zealand has tended to build government AI tools in-house. This means that we know how the tools work.
But intelligibility is another issue. Knowing how an AI system works doesn’t guarantee the decisions it reaches will be understood by the people affected. The best performing AI systems are often extremely complex.




To make explanations intelligible, additional technology is required. A decision-making system can be supplemented with an “explanation system”. These are additional algorithms “bolted on” to the main algorithm we seek to understand. Their job is to construct simpler models of how the underlying algorithms work – simple enough to be understandable to people. We believe explanation systems will be increasingly important as AI technology advances.
A final type of transparency relates to public access to information about the AI systems used in government. The public should know what AI systems their government uses as well as how well they perform. Systems should be regularly evaluated and summary results made available to the public in a systematic format.


New Zealand’s law and transparency
Our report takes a detailed look at how well New Zealand law currently handles these transparency issues.
New Zealand doesn’t have laws specifically tailored towards algorithms, but some are relevant in this context. For instance, New Zealand’s Official Information Act (OIA) provides a right to reasons for decisions by official agencies, and this is likely to apply to algorithmic decisions just as much as human ones. This is in notable contrast to Australia, which doesn’t impose a general duty on public officials to provide reasons for their decisions.
But even the OIA would come up short where decisions are made or supported by opaque decision systems. That is why we recommend that predictive algorithms used by government, whether developed commercially or in-house, must feature in a public register, must be publicly inspectable, and (if necessary) must be supplemented with explanation systems.
Human control and data protection
Another issue relates to human control. Some of the concerns around algorithmic decision-making are best addressed by making sure there is a “human in the loop,” with a human having final sign off on any important decision. However, we don’t think this is likely to be an adequate solution in the most important cases.
A persistent theme of research in industrial psychology is that humans become overly trusting and uncritical of automated systems, especially when those systems are reliable most of the time. Just adding a human “in the loop” will not always produce better outcomes. Indeed in certain contexts, human collaboration will offer false reassurance, rendering AI-assisted decisions less accurate.
With respect to data protection, we flag the problem of “inferred data”. This is data inferred about people rather than supplied by them directly (just as when Amazon infers that you might like a certain book on the basis of books it knows you have purchased). Among other recommendations, our report calls for New Zealand to consider the legal status of inferred data, and whether it should be treated the same way as primary data.
Bias and discrimination
A final area of concern is bias. Computer systems might look unbiased, but if they are relying on “dirty data” from previous decisions, they could have the effect of “baking in” discriminatory assumptions and practices. New Zealand’s anti-discrimination laws are likely to apply to algorithmic decisions, but making sure discrimination doesn’t creep back in will require ongoing monitoring.
The report also notes that while “individual rights” — for example, against discrimination — are important, we can’t entirely rely on them to guard against all of these risks. For one thing, affected people will often be those with the least economic or political power. So while they may have the “right” not to be discriminated against, it will be cold comfort to them if they have no way of enforcing it.
There is also the danger that they won’t be able to see the whole picture, to know whether an algorithm’s decisions are affecting different sections of the community differently. To enable a broader discussion about bias, public evaluation of AI tools should arguably include results for specific sub-populations, as well as for the whole population.
A new independent body will be essential if New Zealand wants to harness the benefits of algorithmic tools while avoiding or minimising their risks to the public.

Tempted to cheat on a written exam? Artificial intelligence is 90% certain to nab you

Combining big data with artificial intelligence has allowed University of Copenhagen researchers to determine whether you wrote your assignment or whether a ghostwriter penned it for you—with nearly 90 percent accuracy.





Several studies have shown that cheating on assignments is widespread and becoming increasingly prevalent among high school students. At the University of Copenhagen's Department of Computer Science, efforts to detect cheating on assignments through writing analysis by way of artificial intelligence have been underway for a few years. Now, based on analyses of 130,000 written Danish assignments, scientists can, with nearly 90 percent accuracy, detect whether a student has written an assignment on their own or if a ghostwriter composed it.
Danish high schools currently use the Lectio platform to check if a student has handed in plagiarized work with passages copied directly from a previously submitted assignment. High schools have a harder time discovering if a student has enlisted someone else to write the assignment for them, something that happens to a more or less systematized degree via online services. The case of the SRP, a major written assignment in the final year of Danish high school, is particularly telling. Because the assignment counts for double, students have gone as far as tendering out their writing assignments on the Danish classified website, Den Blå Avis.
""The problem today is that if someone is hired to write an assignment, Lectio won't spot it. Our program identifies discrepancies in writing styles by comparing recently submitted writing against a student's previously submitted work. Among other variables, the program looks at: word length, sentence structure and how words are used. For instance, whether 'for example' is written as 'ex."" or 'e.g.,"""" explains Ph.D. student Stephan Lorenzen of the Department of Computer Science. He, along with the rest of the DIKU-DABAI research group, recently presented their findings at a major European AI conference.






Prior to setting the trap, an ethical debate
The program, Ghostwriter, is built around machine learning and neural networks—branches of artificial intelligence that are particularly useful for recognizing patterns in images and texts. MaCom, the company that provides Lectio to Danish high schools, has made a dataset of 130,000 written assignments from 10,000 high school students available to Ghostwriter project researchers at the Department of Computer Science. For now, it is still a research project.
Stephan Lorenzen doesn't think that it is unrealistic for the program to find its way into high schools in the not too distant future, as schools must constantly stay apace with technological developments to address authorship verification. ""I think that it is realistic to expect that high schools will begin using it at some point. But before they do, there needs to be an ethical discussion of how the technology ought to be applied. Any result delivered by the program should never stand on its own, but serve to support and substantiate a suspicion of cheating,"" believes Lorenzen.
Police and fake news
Ghostwriter's technological foundation can be applied elsewhere in society. For example, the program could be used in police work to supplement forged document analysis, a task carried out by forensic document examiners and others.
""It would be fun to collaborate with the police, who currently deploy forensic document examiners to look for qualitative similarities and differences between the texts they are comparing. We can look at large amounts of data and find patterns. I imagine that this combination would benefit police work,"" says Lorenzen, who emphasizes that ethical discussions are needed here as well.
The artificial intelligence used by researchers at the Department of Computer Science to detect cheating on assignments has a wide range of applications. It has already been used to analyze Twitter tweets to determine whether they were composed by actual users or penned by paid imposters or robots.
Facts:

The ghostwriter program uses what is known as a Siamese neural network to distinguish the writing styles of two texts. The network is trained on large amounts of data to learn from representations of writing styles, which are then compared.
When a student submits an assignment, the network compares it against their previous assignments. For each previous assignment, the network provides a percentage score for writing style similarity against the new assignment.
In the end, a weighted average of these scores is calculated using a calculation that also takes other factors, such as delivery time, into account. This final score is presented as a percentage and indicates the similarity between the new assignment and the student's writing style.
The research group behind the result is the Danish Center for Big Data Analytics-driven Innovation (DIKU-DABAI). The group is headed by Professor Stephen Alstrup.

Nicholas Thompson, editor in chief of WIRED, moderated the 90-minute conversation in the packed Memorial Auditorium, filled to its 1705-seat capacity.The purpose was to discuss how AI will affect our future.Harari, a history professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and two-time winner of the Polonsky Prize for Creativity and Originality, is the author of international best sellers “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind” and “Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow.”Li is a renowned AI researcher, engineer and computer science professor. One of the most prolific academics in Artificial Intelligence today, her work in deep learning and computer vision is used by companies and research groups around the world. She is most known for her role creating ImageNet, a 14- million-image hand-annotated data set used extensively in computer vision applications.They touched on some of the most important topics about AI and technology, including whether we can still believe in human agency; what democracy looks like in the age of AI; and whether AI will ultimately hack or enhance humanity.Rather than drive us to stagnant speaking points, Li and Harari challenged us to contemplate many important questions characterizing consequences of Artificial Intelligence technology on individuals, including freedom and choice, and the impact of AI on the legal, economic and political systems of our world.These four relevant questions attempt to help untangle the AI’s impact on the individual:Rethinking Free Will: If you can’t trust the customer, if you can’t trust the voter, if you can’t trust your feelings, who do you trust? — Yuval Noah HarariLove and the Limits of AI: Is love hackable? — Fei-Fei LiOutsourcing Self-Awareness to AI: What does it mean to live in a world in which you learn about something so important about yourself from an algorithm? — Yuval Noah HarariHumans at the Center of AI: Can we reframe the education, the research and the dialog of AI and technology in general in a human-centered way? — Fei-Fei LiLike many who saw it, I came away from the talk with a sense of urgency. These are poignant questions that AI practitioners, policymakers and the public should be thinking about. All are a consequential part of the AI debate.But we need to act quickly. “The engineers won’t wait. And even if the engineers are willing to wait, the investors behind the engineers won’t wait. So, it means that we don’t have a lot of time,” Harari warned.Agreed.Rethinking Free Will“If you can’t trust the customer, if you can’t trust the voter, if you can’t trust your feelings, who do you trust?” — Yuval Noah HarariThe discussion jumped into the deep, difficult topic of free will and agency, skipping superficialities completely.An argument questioning the validity of free will seems at first brush like an extraneous, theoretical endeavor — something quite outside the scope of the engineering discipline. Indeed, many of the challenges discussed circle back to topics debated by philosophers for millennia.Only this time, there’s an entirely new angle: technology has advanced to the point where many of our closely held beliefs are being challenged, as Harari notes, “not by philosophical ideas, but by practical technologies.”Harari has criticized the central notions of free will and individual agency for most of a decade.He’s not alone. Numerous neuropsychological experiments have been waging a new assault on free will, thanks to advancements in the technology available to measure neural activity.This has lead many top neuroscientists to doubt the freedom of our decision-making.“We are just processing information within a cartography of our mind that gives rise mechanistically to our behaviour. So the decisions that we think we are consciously deciding on and making, actually it’s all just an illusion that can be reduced to what our brain is telling us to do.” — Hannah Crichlow, prominent Princeton neuroscientist and author of The Science of FateBut while the science is still maturing, the consequences of our free will being manipulated — Harari called this “Hacking Humans” — pose a great risk within our society.An organization may endeavour “to create an algorithm that understands me better than I understand myself, and can therefore manipulate me, enhance me, or replace me.”It will be our challenge to decide not only what these manipulations, enhancements or replacements should be, but also who should be making the decisions about them in the first place.We might wonder how we want to make choices about the possibilities for human enhancement.“Who decides what is a good enhancement and what is a bad enhancement? So how do you decide what to enhance if, and this is a very deep ethical and philosophical question — again that philosophers have been debating for thousands of years — [we don’t have an answer to the question] ‘what is good?’ What are the good qualities we need to enhance?” Harari asked.It is natural for many of us to “fall back on the traditional humanist ideas” that prioritize personal choice and freedom. However, he cautioned: “None of this works when there is a technology to hack humans on a large scale.”If the very idea of human agency and free will is under debate it becomes very difficult to determine how to decide what technology should be allowed to do. This affects every area of our lives too — what we choose to do, what we might buy, where we might go, and how we might vote. It remains unclear who should be making decisions about technology’s scope at all.This ambiguity leaves us face to face with a significant issue, thanks to the co-development of technology in biotechnology (B), computing power (C) and data analytics (D). These three items, according to Harari, can already be used to Hack Humans (HH).For the math-minded among us he summarizes it as B * C * D = HH.With modern technology, Hacking Humans may become a very real possibility.“This is the moment to open the dialogue, to open the research in those issues,” Li added.If manipulation is present, how are the systems of government, commerce, and personal liberty still legitimate?Love and the Limits of AI“Is love hackable?” — Fei-Fei LiIf humans can be “hacked” and our behaviour and beliefs manipulated, what is the limit of this subtle control?We may accept that we can be manipulated in small endeavors — Who doesn’t have a sudden craving for a cinnamon bun when walking into a bakery where they have just been made? — but surely there must be limits to the ways in which our behaviour can be controlled.At this point, no one seems to know for sure what these limits of manipulation may be.However, the tactics of manipulation certainly are known. Criminals and con artists using them have been in equal measures venerated for their boldness and reviled for their predacity through the media, and their stories told in cinema, literature and television.Collectively, we disbelieve our own personal susceptibility to manipulation. Rather, we assume those who have been manipulated are the stupid few. “The easiest people to manipulate are the people who believe in free will, because they think they cannot be manipulated,” concluded Harari.Weaponizing love as a potential for manipulation is not only possible, but well-documented. This theme is consistent with the long history of romance scams; many of us have heard of the “long distance lover who needs a sudden influx of money for some minor emergency.” Romance scams are the most “successful” of all types costing Americans $143 million last year.Columbia Psychologist Maria Konnikova and author of The Confidence Game, reminds us that manipulation “is accomplished, first and foremost, through emotion.” This leaves us in a vulnerable state since “feeling, at least in the moment, takes over from thinking.”After all, the manipulation system — Artificial Intelligence or not — doesn’t have to experience love in return to manipulate the human capacity for connection and intimacy with another. “To manipulate love is not the same thing as to actually feel it,” Harari explained.Without diminishing the importance of human love, the biological and neurochemical component has been well-studied.Given the ever greater amount of information each of us is providing, the deeper understanding we are gaining about our own biology, combined with the lower costs to analyze large amounts of data, the possibility for even costlier scams of this type cannot be ignored. These scams play on the very real and very human emotions of loneliness, isolation, and desire for a connection to another.We are all susceptible to this kind of manipulation. “We want to believe in what they’re telling us,” Konnikova reminds us.Few have a definitive view on the limits of what might be possible with the advances in data science and technology. Li is optimistic. “I do want to make sure that we recognize that we’re very, very, very far from that. This technology is still very nascent.” However, the stakes are getting higher and higher, and if that is the case at present, how long will it remain so?As Li commented: “I think you really bring out the urgency and the importance and the scale of this potential crisis. But I think, in the face of that, we need to act.”Outsourcing Self-Awareness to AI“What does it mean to live in a world in which you learn about something so important about yourself from an algorithm?” — Yuval Noah HarariFor millennia humans have been outsourcing some of the things that our brains do. Writing allows us to keep precise records instead of relying on our memory. Navigation moved from mythology and star charts to maps and GPS.But with AI we have a radical opportunity: What if self-awareness is one of the things humans will outsource to technology?Harari recounted a personal story about his own journey of self-discovery, confessing that he was unaware that he was gay until he was in his twenties. This revelation prompted a thought-provoking moment that showed how much we all struggle to see our own blind spots. “I only realized that I was gay when I was 21. And I look back at the time and I was I don’t know 15, 17 and it should have been so obvious.”Harari continued: “Now in AI, even a very stupid AI today, will not miss it.”This opens up a very interesting new possibility: Might algorithms know things about us that we don’t yet know?In the history of AI, this has been a tempting thought for decades.“I’m putting my money on a bet that says we build robots for the same reasons we do other kinds of science and art, for the immense satisfaction of knowing something significant about ourselves that we didn’t know before, of having our suspicions and guesses about ourselves confirmed or laid waste — simply put, of seeing ourselves in a new way.” — Pamela McCorduck, celebrated AI historian and author of Machines Who ThinkEven today, using the data we provide, it may be possible to diagnose a myriad of different conditions, from depression to cancer, earlier and meaningfully impact our lives.Beyond our physical and mental health, it is provocative to wonder what else large-scale analysis might unlock as a result of the data we now provide. After all, there are facets of the human experience that are immutable despite culture, generation, and station.As the analysis methods become more advanced and the available data increases, what experiences might we learn that we share with our friends, our neighbors, folks who live across the globe whose life hardly resembles our own?Two challenges, however, remain.There is a danger in giving an algorithm, even a very smart one, the authority to give us information about ourselves. Especially so if it makes it difficult to question and validate.“Once you dress something up as an algorithm or as a bit of artificial intelligence it can take on this air of authority that makes it really hard to argue with.” — Hannah Fry, esteemed UCL Mathematician and author of Hello World.If an algorithm predicts that we have cancer, we can get tested, but if it tells us something much more ambiguous, say if we are popular (or not) we may be inclined to take it as true because we have no way to validate it. This in turn might lead us to make different decisions thanks to a misplaced trust in a potentially faulty algorithm.Fry notes that we might believe what algorithms are saying to such an extent that it overrules our personal judgment.She relates the story of a carload of tourists “who tried to drive through water to get to a destination they were really interested in visiting. They did not overrule the navigation and had to be rescued.”Who will be there to rescue us if our very self-perception has been forced askew?Furthermore, using data to connect with experiences of others and to ourselves is a separate issue to having algorithms know deeply personal things about us that may be shared with other actors instead of us.“What happens if the algorithm doesn’t share the information with you, but it shares the information with advertisers? Or with governments?” wondered Harari.Even now, our information on social media is used to serve us “relevant” ads, and we are only beginning to find out who is paying for us to see them.“This is a good example, because this is already happening,” said Harari.AI has been used to predict if we will quit our job or break up with our significant other. Both are deeply personal decisions that many of us would be reluctant to want personal friends, much less impersonal organizations, to know.Li is skeptical that an algorithm might be able to surpass our own introspection this way. “I’m not so sure!” she said, giving us hope that we may be able to thoughtfully tackle some of these challenges while there’s still time.“Any technology humanity has created starting with fire is a double-edged sword. So it can bring improvements to life, to work, and to society, but it can bring perils, and AI has these perils,” she reminded us.Humans at the Center of AI“Can we reframe the education, the research and the dialog of AI and technology in general in a human-centered way?” — Fei-Fei LiWith the discussion weaving through so many pertinent disciplines, Li offered us a deft, albeit open ended, proposal to begin to tackle the many issues we face: to reframe Artificial Intelligence in a human-centered way.Li has begun the change at Stanford University with a great aim, and one that provides a functional template for all organizations, regardless of size and of source.She has established the Stanford Human-Centered AI (HAI) Institute which will bring together individuals from many different areas for a new collaborative dialogue.The Institute has three tenets:To be deliberate about what we would like AI to be;To encourage multidisciplinary study; andTo focus on enhancement and augmentation of humanity.“We’re not necessarily going to find a solution today, but can we involve the humanists, the philosophers, the historians, the political scientists, the economists, the ethicists, the legal scholars, the neuroscientists, the psychologists, and many more other disciplines into the study and development of AI in the next chapter,” said Li about the Institute.This recommendation stems from the challenges researchers and practitioners face in gaining and keeping public trust, providing a positive user experience, and replacing the fearmongering in AI with well-thought-out policy recommendation.Defining clear goals within the Artificial Intelligence community is a major step towards a hub we can all rally around, and the crossover between various disciplines is gaining increasing traction.“This is precisely why this is the moment that we believe the new chapter of AI needs to be written by cross-pollinating efforts from humanists, social scientists, to business leaders, to civil society, to governments, to come at the same table to have that multilateral and cooperative conversation,” Li stressed.But we’ve come to a crossroads.Indeed, many of the ethical questions that we face today are the results of decisions that have been made by engineers: the ethos of “move fast and break things” has ultimately resulted in things really breaking.Working in tech can blind its creators from the effects of the technologies that they build. There are myriad unintentional outcomes: large online retailers crowding out small business and changing the composition of our cities, to name just one.How can we balance our desire for innovation with the risks that come with it? When companies succeed without the slowdown that comes with being deliberate and thoughtful about their AI offerings, should we take measures to curb their growth?Li is optimistic about the inclusion of ethics into the software discipline.“Human-centered AI needs to be written by the next generation of technologists who have taken classes like [Stanford Political Science Professor] Rob [Reich]’s class [Computers, Ethics and Public Policy], to think about the ethical implications, the human well-being.”However straightforward this goal might be, many in the AI community might wonder whether it might also be the most challenging.“We cannot possibly do this alone as technologists,” Li warned.How do we convince the heavily technical folks working in Artificial Intelligence, individuals who may not want to concern themselves with nebulous subjects like societal effects of their work, that they should care about these things? And further, should that be the expectation? Do we require an ethical dimension to every role throughout the industry?Li is not so sure.“Some of us shouldn’t even be doing this. It’s the ethicists, philosophers who should participate and work with us on these issues.”Although very few forward-looking people working in the industry would dismiss its importance, the paradigm shift it requires should not be minimized. There has historically been a great deal of disdain within the tech community for any non-technical or tech-adjacent subject. Will the AI community respect the importance of these new perspectives or will we roll our eyes at anyone who doesn’t understand backpropagation?Even Li quipped, when asked whether Harari’s work is on her syllabus, “Not on mine, sorry. I teach hardcore deep learning. His book doesn’t have equations.”The conversation was well-timed to ask important new questions about the ways in which Artificial Intelligence may affect us as individuals in the coming decades. To mitigate the potential of “Hacking Humans” without a good understanding of the limits of the possibility of manipulation, Harari urged us to focus on self-awareness:“It’s the oldest advice in all the books in philosophies is know yourself. We’ve heard it from Socrates, from Confucius, from Buddha: get to know yourself. But there is a difference, which is that now you have competition…You’re competing against these giant corporations and governments. If they get to know you better than you know yourself, the game is over.”But a collaboration is needed, as suggested by Li. This work is starting to take shape within numerous organizations around the world.The conversation between Harari and Li marks the beginning of a new type of work in AI.“We opened the dialog between the humanist and the technologist and I want to see more of that,” she said.So do I.About the Author:Briana Brownell is a data scientist turned tech entrepreneur, futurist and innovator.

What is the future of work in the investment industry? How do we, as providers of human capital prepare for the evolution of this profession? What does it mean for employers seeking to engage and motivate staff over the long term?
It is widely accepted that, like most other industries, the financial services industry is in a state of flux. Unlike other episodes of change in recent decades, the current context is often characterised as an “industrial revolution” creating continual disruption of a structural nature.
Prepare not predict
On that backdrop, the prudent approach is to prepare, not predict. Instead of making point-predictions about the future state of the industry, a handful of thematic narratives might be useful as navigational guide-posts.

For example, it is safe to assume that technology disruption (“fintech”) will challenge virtually every aspect of the existing service delivery model.
Secondly, changes in the delivery model will likely take place at an uneven pace across the geographies of developed and emerging markets.
Thirdly, interest rates are likely to remain lower for longer. The benchmark ten-year US treasury rate, which used to average close to six per cent before the global financial crisis, now struggles to sustain above three per cent.
And finally, there is a secular drive towards a more purposeful capitalism, requiring the investment profession to be demonstrably more client-centric and proficient about sustainability factors.

Who do we mean when we refer to the investment professional?
There are at least three categories of roles in the value-chain. There are “asset owners” who act as principal fiduciary investors of capital. Secondly, there are “asset managers” who are fiduciary investors as agents. Thirdly, there are specialist intermediaries such as investment bankers, traders and sell-side analysts who provide investment products and services. It helps to zoom out and think of almost every role at this level of generality as the specific bundle of tasks and boundaries between them will shift. Ultimately, everyone plays a part in either asset allocation or execution.
Increasingly competitive
Looking to the future, the first observation is that the job environment is getting competitive at an increasingly rapid pace. The pool of candidates for any job — many of them armed with credentials such as a CFA charter — is now truly global. CFA exam candidates have grown at an annual rate of 18 per cent over the past three years (faster in Asia-Pacific) with a current stock of candidates at over 300,000. At the same time, the required headcount for existing roles in existing firms will likely shrink as a result of technology.
In addition, there is a relentless downward pressure on fees. Consolidation by firms attempting to lower costs may negatively impact headcount. Fifty four per cent of respondents to a CFA survey last year cited “fee pressure” or “switching to lower-fee products” as the number one issue facing investment firms in the next five to ten years. As a result, individuals have to choose between competing in intensely contested “red oceans” or prepare for less contested “blue oceans”.
HI + AI: ‘human plus artificial’ intelligence 
These blue ocean roles are likely to straddle human plus artificial intelligence. In these “HI + AI” setups, human heuristics would benefit from the multiplier effect of data analytics. Within firms, investment and technology teams (that previously worked in silos) would collaborate to enhance performance.
In the early days of electronic foreign exchange dealing, online trading venues were seen as an alternative to the phone. Instead of calling her dealer, the asset manager could hit a button to execute her trade. The trade was still processed and risk-managed by a traditional (human) trader. In recent years, online trading venues have become an alternative to the trader. Once the asset manager hits the button to execute, the trade is processed largely by algorithms. The exact boundary between human and machine evolved gradually and through trial and error over almost a decade. Unfortunately, the current context of cost pressure and rapid technological progress will not allow the luxury of finding the right handover point at an organic pace. Today, the drive for organisational efficiency leaves less room for experimentation, and optionality to see how things pan out.
This will place the burden of adaptation disproportionately on the employee.
The growth of machine learning, AI methods and use of alternative data for portfolio construction will increasingly require ambidextrous skills – technical and traditional – to be deployed side by side. The question for the investment professional is not whether she can hand over tasks to robots but whether she can interact with robots through feedback loops. Traders of illiquid asset-classes will need to combine intuitive intervention with auto-pilot technology. The human elements of ethical orientation, communication, empathy, tacit knowledge etc. will remain relevant. However, the traditional bifurcation of “relationship roles” from “technical roles” will probably not survive.
A ‘Marina Bay Sands’-shaped skills profile
We cannot rely on any one skill for ever. Gone are the days when a person who started as a trader of precious metals could retire in the same role thirty years later. What is required is a T-shaped profile of skills where core expertise in one domain is supplemented by a breadth of knowledge over a wide range. Perhaps more than a T-shape, what is required is a “Marina Bay Sands” -shaped skills profile that rests on more than one core domain!

Skills acquisition will need to be approached in a similar manner to strategic asset allocation across a basket of skills with the ability to tactically adjust between them. The range and combination of possible skills is vast: from soft skills, design-thinking and systems-thinking to data interpretation, data visualisation, factor investing, portfolio risk optimisation, sustainability, governance issues and alternative investments.
Connectors, communicators and collaborators will command a premium. Those who are able to bridge traditional divides of offline versus online, quantitative versus relationship savvy, public versus private markets, profitability metrics versus sustainability and stewardship goals, will differentiate themselves.
T-shaped professionals will also enable firms to benefit from diversity. Diverse teams not only facilitate the uncovering of novel sources of value-creation, they also help thwart risk events lurking in potential blind-spots.
However, diversity can remain dormant and un-utilised if inclusion is not actively pursued through organisational design. It is the depth and range of abilities amongst professional staff that determine the extent to which diversity can translate into collective, firm-level intelligence. This calls for more T-shaped professionals who have the ability to forge connections, gain understanding and form perspective. They will also need to deal with complexity, ambiguity and incessant change without getting motion sickness.
From the employer’s perspective, it is important to deliberately foster a culture of collaboration. Teams of IT specialists and relationship managers may have different styles of work, terminology and rhythm. In the absence of deliberate processes that facilitate collaboration, including the tone at the top, firms can easily end up with coordination failures. This can be particularly challenging if the legacy culture relied on “star performers” and compensation plans incentivised lone wolfs. It is often seen that an accent on diversity – gender, ethnic and age diversity – can become a source of positive organisational culture overall.
A career flywheel
From an employee’s perspective, career management requires an explicit strategy for skills management. It is helpful to think of it as a “career flywheel”. Popularised by his book “Good to Great”, Jim Collins describes the flywheel effect as a process of incremental transition as opposed to a single defining action. That process resembles relentlessly pushing a giant heavy flywheel turn upon turn, building momentum towards points of breakthrough and beyond. The investment professional of the future will need to plan her career like the turns of a flywheel, with intentionality and additionality. Their explicit personal development plan will need to be agreed openly with the employer.
From an employer’s perspective, career growth must allow for horizontal moves across functions and locations, not just progression on a vertical ladder. This will not only help with employee engagement, it will also enrich the set of experiences that the employee can bring to bear on the inherently volatile nature of the job.
Finally, employee engagement and motivation will be sustained by non-monetary factors that include not just learning opportunities or flexible work practices but also a direct link to organisational purpose and impact on society. Purpose needs to be felt through the rump of the organisation – beyond just the CSR department – with consistency between words and action. Communication must feel authentic and not be laden with jargon.

In association withRoyal College of Art students will be taking part in the Grand Challenge, which sees students embark on a six week project to design products to enhance human performance with help from the design team at LogitechRichard Haughton, Royal College of ArtSian Bayley9 May 2019Design courses need to be broader to develop the skills to shape the products and experiences of the future, according to figures at the Royal College of Art and Logitech.Speaking ahead of the launch of the college’s Grand Challenge, which sees students embark on a six week project to design products to enhance human performance with help from the design team at Logitech, Professor Paul Anderson, Dean of the School of Design said: “I do believe that we need to develop some new courses which are asking some really difficult questions which are moving beyond the traditional disciplines. And these new disciplines may have different names, and are not just in one design domain.”Alastair Curtis, Logitech’s chief design officer and RCA graduate, added: “I think we’re at a tipping point as far as what is a designer today, and we’re at a tipping point of how we are educated to become designers. Historically it has always been about selecting your specialist skill from industrial design or fashion, and then you would learn that skill and you may broaden out. And now I think we’re beginning to flip the way that we think about creativity and developing creativity.Read more
AI and mental health - can our happiness at work be improved?
“We’re spending more time being super broad because there’s so much as far as the technology, the art, the ethics takes us, to create more balanced individuals first and then grow their specific capability.”Speaking about the future of product design, Curtis said: “We’re here to provoke the students of what is extending human capability now, or five, ten, fifteen years from now knowing that the influence of AI is going to change the way we think, we work and we design.“As a company we think how we can evolve our products and what they do to actually enhance people’s capability. It might sound super mundane, but even if you look at video collaboration equipment that we make today, where you come into the room, try and work out how to use the machine, waste 20 minutes, even if you can eliminate all those pain points, then you’ve improved the meeting capability.“All of these things will improve our capability within the office environment. It doesn’t always have to be about running 100 meters faster.“Even though I graduated a long time ago and there’s been hundreds of thousands of students who have come after me, fundamentally most designers, one of their higher goals is to improve the way we live.”However, Professor Anderson warned of the potential ethical dangers of development: “The whole world has changed and it’s changing more and more rapidly.“I think the students are now much more aware of the consequences of their actions, so their ability to actually understand a product not just as a design to produce, create and manufacture but what happens throughout its lifecycle.“There are a lot of big issues and questions around why we should do something, because we need to do things as we go forward in the future that have a better impact than what’s been going on over the last 50 years.“Just the invention of plastic, for example, has had a massive impact and I think we’re all feeling it, as human beings around the world as we’re starting to see the impact. What we’re putting into the air, the effects of climate change and all the rest of it, that’s where design in many ways is kind of responsible.“It’s taking up the mantra, and asking to really think about the choice of materials – we’ll still end up with products, and rightly so, but I think they’ll be better designed, more responsive to our needs and maybe they’ll be more adaptable.”MORE ABOUTfuture london skillsMost Read

The future impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) on society and the labour force have been studied and reported extensively. In a recent book, AI Superpowers, Kai-Fu Lee, former president of Google China, wrote that 40 to 50 per cent of current jobs will be technically and economically viable with AI and automation over the next 15 years. 
Artificial intelligence refers to computer systems that collect, interpret and learn from external data to achieve specific goals and tasks. Unlike natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, it is an artificial form of intelligence demonstrated by machines. This has raised questions about the ethics of AI decision-making and impacts of AI in the workplace.
With computing power increasing rapidly in recent decades, the capabilities of AI have also risen dramatically. Vincent Müller, a philosopher at Eindhoven University of Technology, and Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at Oxford University, conducted a survey in 2016 about AI’s future potential.
Respondents indicated a 50 per cent likelihood that the capabilities of AI will exceed human intelligence by 2040 to 2050. Other technology leaders have predicted this will occur much earlier. Since AI continually learns and improves, a new form of AI super-intelligence may emerge well beyond human intelligence. 
How are universities responding to this challenge? Do traditional subjects and competencies taught in university need to be re-examined in view of the coming disruption of AI in the job market? 
As the Dean of Engineering and Applied Science at Memorial University, I’m concerned about this disruption from the perspective of skills that students should be learning to successfully adapt to AI in the workplace.
‘Resilient competencies’
Recently I supervised a project conducted by two undergraduate research assistants, Joud Omary, a computer engineering student, and Deep Patel, an electrical engineering student, on the susceptibility of various graduate attributes to computerisation. They analysed the probabilities of various student competencies becoming automated in the next 10 to 20 years.
The most automation-resistant skills were determined based on a Brookfield Institute report which examined the probabilities of automation of work tasks over a range of occupations associated with university degrees. 
Repetitive skills like pattern recognition, information retrieval, optimization and planning are most vulnerable to automation. On the other hand, social and cognitive skills such as creativity, problem-solving, drawing conclusions about emotional states and social interactions are least vulnerable.
The most resilient competencies (those least likely to be displaced by AI) included critical thinking, teamwork, interpersonal skills, leadership and entrepreneurship.
Yuval Harari, a historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, described the rise of AI as a “cascade of ever-bigger disruptions” in higher education rather than a single event that settles into a new equilibrium. The unknown paths taken by AI will make it increasingly difficult to know what to teach students. 
Economist Carl Frey, and engineer Michael Osborne, both at the University of Oxford, reported the susceptibility of a range of professions to computerisation including those associated with traditional university degrees, e.g., accountants, auditors, geoscientists. Interestingly, even for engineers who are significant developers of AI technologies, there is a susceptibility of various disciplines of engineering to computerisation.
In such a context, “resilient competencies” are always relevant. Joseph Aoun, president of Northeastern University, and a linguist, argues in his book that what will matter most is experiential learning (co-op education), life-long learning and a curriculum focused on humanics (the study of human affairs). 
As AI technologies become more powerful and capable over a range of professions, it will become increasingly important for today’s students to be equipped with the right skills that add value beyond what AI can achieve. As AI displaces old jobs, it will also lead to new jobs.
‘Outcomes-based education’
Traditional learning outcomes in engineering programs have included a strong knowledge base, problem analysis, design and the use of engineering tools, among others. 
But engineers today have a growing diversity of demands in their professional lives. Non-technical skills are increasingly important to work effectively in a business environment. These include communication skills, project management, life-long learning and the interdisciplinary impact of engineering on society and the environment.

At Memorial University’s Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, one way that we have responded to this changing environment is by mapping the learning outcomes throughout the curriculum to ensure that all graduates of our co-op programs have a desired set of graduate attributes.  
For example, a traditional fluid mechanics course measured only the technical skills of the subject matter. Today, the course tracks a range of other learning outcomes such as communication skills through written reports and presentations. 
More broadly across the curriculum, it is determined where and how each graduate attribute is taught and evaluated for each course. The evaluation of each attribute is recorded, for example through a tutorial, exam question, or assignment. Appropriate rubrics are established for each attribute. Afterwards courses are evaluated and continuously improved to see how students are gaining the desired graduate attributes.
Engineering students are also required to take complementary studies courses in other disciplines, such as humanities, to raise their awareness of the role and impact of engineering on society and culture. 
Memorial’s Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences has strong links with the human literacy areas noted by Aoun. Across a range of disciplines – from philosophy to political science, sociology to geography – students work in teams, reflect on challenging ethical questions and engage in dialogue about important public concerns. 
Also, Memorial’s Faculty of Business Administration introduces students to AI and provides exposure to a range of key non-technical business skills. To successfully manage organizations in which work processes will be redefined by AI, graduates will more than ever need to know how to build strong relationships, work in teams and communicate effectively. 
A shift in higher education from what students are taught in the classroom to learning outcomes instead and graduate attributes will become increasingly important with the rise of AI. A shift to outcomes-based education will enable students to gain critical automation-resistant competencies to succeed and thrive in the future workforce alongside AI.

AstraZeneca announced a long-term collaboration deal with BenevolentAI, a UK-based company focused on combining computational medicine and advanced artificial intelligence. The two companies will focus on using AI and machine learning to discover and develop new drugs for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). “The vast amount of data available to research scientists is growing exponentially each year,” stated Mene Pangalo, AstraZeneca’s executive vice president and president BioPharmaceuticals R&D. “By combining AstraZeneca’s disease area expertise and large, diverse datasets with BenevolentAI’s leading AI and machine learning capabilities, we can unlock the potential of this wealth of data to improve our understanding of complex disease biology and identify new targets that could treat debilitating diseases.” No financial details were disclosed. BenevolentAI was founded in 2013. It has raised $202 million in funding since and has a research facility in Cambridge, UK. Earlier, the company inked an exclusive license deal in 2016 with Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceutical for several clinical-stage drug candidates. View-hotbeds.jpg This deal only marks one of the most recent AI team-ups announced in the biopharma industry. In early April, only a few weeks after Concerto HealthAI inked a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb, it signed a similar deal with Pfizer. The commonality was Concerto focuses on oncology-specific Real-World Data (RWD) and advanced AI for Real-World Evidence (RWE) generation, an area of increasing interest for biopharma companies. Concerto HealthAI will collaborate with Pfizer on Precision Oncology using Concerto’s eurekaHealth platform, artificial intelligence (AI) models and Real World Clinical Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and healthcare claims. They will use data from clinical medical practices that participate in the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s CancerLinQ initiative and others throughout the U.S. Concerto has an exclusive license to utilize data from CancerLinQ, which might explain why big pharma companies are so eager to work with Concerto. But Concerto’s data access isn’t solely with CancerLinQ, but has access to numerous other real-world sources. In March 2019, Oxford BioMedica announced it had inked a two-year research-and-development collaboration with Microsoft Research. The goal is to improve the yield and quality of next-generation gene therapy vectors—typically viruses—using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Oxford Biomedica will focus on its expertise in vector development and large-scale manufacturing. The team in Microsoft’s Station B initiative will use AI and machine learning to increase the yield and improve the purity of Oxford Biomedica’s lentiviral vectors while cutting costs. Station B will use the Microsoft Azure intelligent cloud platform to analyze large data sets created by Oxford Biomedical and develop in silico models and novel algorithms to advance cell and gene delivery technology. The partnership will run two years and may be extended by either group. In 2018, CancerLinQ teamed with Concerto HealthAI and Tempus to speed its joint research effort with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) to understand real-world use, tolerability, and effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Concerto HealthAI and Tempus started analyzing a de-identified data set that CancerLinQ gave to the FDA, which represented more than 10,000 patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors in both approved and unapproved indications. At the time, CancerLinQ’s chief executive officer, Cory Wiegert, stated, “These types of research efforts need to span across the cancer community because one organization cannot accomplish them alone. We are excited that Concerto HealthAI and Tempus are bringing their technical capacity and analytic expertise to this important effort in support of the FDA’s evaluation of these therapies outside of clinical trials.” That initiative is looking at patients who have received checkpoint inhibitors including Genentech’s Tecentriq (atezolizumab), EMD Serono and Pfizer’s Bavencio (avelumab), AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab), Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Yervoy (ipilimumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab), or Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab). Iframe Embed And Google, as one of the biggest corporations on Earth, is very interested in the use of AI and health care. “The fundamental underlying technologies of machine learning and artificial intelligence are applicable to all manner of tasks,” Greg Corrado, a neuroscientist at Google, told NPR. And that’s true, “whether those are tasks in your daily life, like getting directions or sorting through emailing, or the kinds of tasks that doctors, nurses, clinicians and patients face every day.” It's probably not altruism that has brought Google and other tech companies to look at the life sciences and health care. John Moore, an industry analyst at Chilmark Research, told NPR, “It’s pretty hard to ignore a market that represents about 20 percent of [U.S.] GDP. So whether it’s Google or it’s Microsoft or it’s IBM or it’s Apple, everyone is taking a look at what they can do in the health care space.” Other companies are focused on AI and healthcare or drug development as well. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a clinical-stage biotech that combines AI, experimental biology and automation to discover and develop drugs at scale. In January, Recursion announced progress in its collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical on identifying novel preclinical candidates for rare diseases. In 18 months, the partnership led to the evaluation of Takeda preclinical and clinical compounds in more than 60 unique indications.

TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty ImagesLast year, a painting called “Portrait of Edmond de Belamy” sold for $432,500 in New York City.
The catch? It was produced by artificial intelligence — one of the first of its kind to come up for auction. And it’s sparked a trend in the art world.
From The Atlantic’s Ian Bogost:
The best way to get away with something is to make it feel new and surprising. Using a computer is hardly enough anymore; today’s machines offer all kinds of ways to generate images that can be output, framed, displayed, and sold—from digital photography to artificial intelligence. Recently, the fashionable choice has become generative adversarial networks, or GANs, the technology that created “Portrait of Edmond de Belamy.” Like other machine-learning methods, GANs use a sample set—in this case, art, or at least images of it—to deduce patterns, and then they use that knowledge to create new pieces. A typical Renaissance portrait, for example, might be composed as a bust or three-quarter view of a subject. The computer may have no idea what a bust is, but if it sees enough of them, it might learn the pattern and try to replicate it in an image.
AI technology does a lot for us. It sorts emails, social media posts and dating app profiles. It queues albums upon request. It answers our questions online.
But what about art? Is AI art just “found art,” or is it something more? Can AI be creative? And if so, how might that redefine what it means to create something?

          Swarms of Drones, Piloted by Artificial Intelligence, May Soon Patrol Europe’s Borders        

            The EU is funding the development of AI-powered drones that would autonomously patrol Europe’s borders. The project's potential for military use can't be ignored.

Imagine you’re hiking through the woods near a border. Suddenly, you hear a mechanical buzzing, like a gigantic bee. Two quadcopters have spotted you and swoop in for a closer look. Antennae on both drones and on a nearby autonomous ground vehicle pick up the radio frequencies coming from the cell phone in your pocket. They send the signals to a central server, which triangulates your exact location and feeds it back to the drones. The robots close in.
Cameras and other sensors on the machines recognize you as human and try to ascertain your intentions. Are you a threat? Are you illegally crossing a border? Do you have a gun? Are you engaging in acts of terrorism or organized crime? The machines send video feeds to their human operator, a border guard in an office miles away, who checks the videos and decides that you are not a risk. The border guard pushes a button, and the robots disengage and continue on their patrol.
This is not science fiction. The European Union is financing a project to develop drones piloted by artificial intelligence and designed to autonomously patrol Europe’s borders. The drones will operate in swarms, coordinating and corroborating information among fleets of quadcopters, small fixed-wing airplanes, ground vehicles, submarines, and boats. Developers of the project, known as Roborder, say the robots will be able to identify humans and independently decide whether they represent a threat. If they determine that you may have committed a crime, they will notify border police.
President Donald Trump has used the specter of criminals crossing the southern border to stir nationalist political sentiment and energize his base. In Europe, two years after the height of the migration crisis that brought more than a million people to the continent, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, immigration remains a hot-button issue, even as the number of new arrivals has dropped. Political parties across the European Union are winning elections on anti-immigrant platforms and enacting increasingly restrictive border policies. Tech ethicists and privacy advocates worry that Roborder and projects like it outsource too much law enforcement work to nonhuman actors and could easily be weaponized against people in border areas.

Drone Wars




“The development of these systems is a dark step into morally dangerous territory,” said Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University in the U.K. and one of the founders of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, a nonprofit that advocates against the military use of robotics. Sharkey lists examples of weaponized drones currently on the market: flying robots equipped with Tasers, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and other weapons. He warns of the implications of combining that technology with AI-based decision-making and using it in politically-charged border zones. “It’s only a matter of time before a drone will be able to take action to stop people,” Sharkey told The Intercept.
Roborder’s developers also may be violating the terms of their funding, according to documents about the project obtained via European Union transparency regulations. The initiative is mostly financed by an €8 million EU research and innovation grant designed for projects that are exclusively nonmilitary, but Roborder’s developers acknowledge that parts of their proposed system involve military technology or could easily be converted for military use.
Much of the development of Roborder is classified, but The Intercept obtained internal reports related to ethical considerations and concerns about the program. That documentation was improperly redacted and inadvertently released in full.
In one of the reports, Roborder’s developers sought to address ethical criteria that are tied to their EU funding. Developers considered whether their work could be modified or enhanced to harm humans and what could happen if the technology or knowledge developed in the project “ended up in the wrong hands.” These ethical issues are raised, wrote the developers, when “research makes use of classified information, materials or techniques; dangerous or restricted materials[;] and if specific results of the research could present a danger to participants or to society as a whole.”
Roborder’s developers argued that these ethical concerns did not apply to their work, stating that their only goal was to develop and test the new technology, and that it would not be sold or transferred outside of the European Union during the life cycle of the project. But in interviews with The Intercept, project developers acknowledged that their technology could be repurposed and sold, even outside of Europe, after the European project cycle has finished, which is expected to happen next year.
Beyond the Roborder project, the ethics reports filed with the European Commission suggest a larger question: When it comes to new technology with the potential to be used against vulnerable people in places with few human rights protections, who decides what we should and should not develop?
Roborder won its funding grant in 2017 and has set out to develop a marketable prototype — “a swarm of robotics to support border monitoring” — by mid-2020. Its developers hope to build and equip a collection of air, sea, and land drones that can be combined and sent out on border patrol missions, scanning for “threats” autonomously based on information provided by human operators, said Stefanos Vrochidis, Roborder’s project manager.
The drones will employ optical, infrared, and thermal cameras; radar; and radio frequency sensors to determine threats along the border. Cell phone frequencies will be used to triangulate the location of people suspected of criminal activity, and cameras will identify humans, guns, vehicles, and other objects. “The main objective is to have as many sensors in the field as possible to assist patrol personnel,” said Kostas Ioannidis, Roborder’s technical manager.
The end product will be tested by border police in several European countries, including Portugal, Hungary, and Greece, but the project has also generated considerable interest in the private sector. “Eventually, we have companies that would certainly like to exploit this commercially,” Vrochidis told The Intercept. “They might exploit the whole outcome or part of the outcome, depending. They can exploit this in Europe but also outside of Europe.”
In their grant agreement, Roborder’s developers told the European Commission that they did not foresee any exports of their technology outside of the EU. In interviews, however, developers told The Intercept that the companies involved would be open to selling their technology beyond Europe. According to a spokesperson from the grant program funding Roborder, Horizon 2020, there is nothing Roborder’s EU backers can do to control where or how the technology they bankrolled is eventually used.
The documents obtained by The Intercept show Roborder responding to some ethical concerns about the project but not about the technology itself. In their grant application, Roborder’s developers conceded that their research “may be exploited by criminal organizations and individual criminals when planning to perpetrate acts of serious crime or terrorism” but wrote that the consortium of public and private companies developing the technology would work to keep their data safe. That group includes drone manufacturing companies, several national police departments, two national guards, a defense ministry, a port authority, a cyberdefense company, a company that specializes in developing equipment for electronic warfare, and another that provides “predictive analytics” for European police forces.
As for the technology’s possible modification for future clients, the answers were less clear. The developers would not comment on the potential for military sales after the project cycle ends. Developers added that their work is delayed because one of Roborder’s key consortium partners, Portuguese drone manufacturer Tekever, has left the project. Spokespeople for Roborder, Tekever, and Horizon 2020 would not explain the rationale for Tekever’s departure.



Horizon 2020 supports many security-oriented projects but maintains that “only research that has an exclusive focus on civil applications is eligible for funding.” The grant program previously funded a project that uses artificial intelligence to detect whether travelers are lying as they pass through automated border crossings.
Yet the documents obtained by The Intercept highlight inconsistent statements about Roborder’s potential military uses. According to one report, the project has no potential for “dual use,” or both military and civil deployment. Ten pages later, asked whether their work involved items that could be considered dual-use by European standards, Roborder’s developers wrote that it did.
Roborder hired a consultant, Reinhard Hutter, as an external ethics adviser to the project, according to another document from the Horizon 2020 program that was inadvertently released in full by the European Commission. In his report, Hutter wrote that “Roborder involves technology with military potential,” and that “the results of this project have the potential to be used back in the defense sector.” The technology involved, Hutter wrote, had “some dual-use potential but no dual-use activity on the project.” In other words, it could be used for military purposes but wouldn’t be used that way within the scope of Roborder.
Hutter declined to speak to The Intercept.
This blurring of lines between military and civilian development by the EU funding program might be deliberate. In a 2014 guidebook on European funding for dual-use projects, the European Commission notes that the regulation establishing Horizon 2020 mandates that all funded projects have “an exclusive focus” on civilian development, but the document also says that “substantial parts of the research funded is of relevance for defense and can lead to technologies that will be used by defense actors.”
The authors of a 2016 study commissioned by the security and defense sub-committee of the European Parliament went further, arguing that Horizon 2020’s clause on exclusive civilian development should be reinterpreted to include defense research. In order to compete with U.S. technological development, the study’s authors advocated for the creation of a European equivalent of DARPA, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, whose work contributed to the development of the internet, GPS, and other technologies. In a 2017 speech, French President Emmanuel Macron echoed that, calling for, “a European agency for disruptive innovation in the same vein as” DARPA.
The 2016 report does not represent the views of the European Parliament or its security and defense sub-committee, and was not used to develop any specific legislation, a spokesperson for the European Parliament said. A spokesperson for Horizon 2020 rejected the idea that there was any ambiguity in what kind of projects the European Union would fund.
“The European Commission does not fund research intended for military use,” she said.
The drones Roborder plans to deploy are common technology. What would be groundbreaking for the companies involved is a functional system that allows swarms of drones to operate autonomously and in unison to reliably identify targets. AI threat detection is often inaccurate, according to robotics researchers, so any system that could correctly and consistently identify people, cars, and weapons, among other things, would be a substantial and lucrative advancement.
Drone cameras will not use facial recognition technology within the scope of the project, explained Ioannidis, Roborder’s technical manager, nor will they be able to determine any human characteristics, such as height, weight, age, skin color, or perceived gender. “The system will only identify that ‘this object is human,’” he added, “nothing more.”
Still, Ioannidis admitted that adding facial recognition to the Roborder system later on would be “technologically possible.” What about weaponizing the Roborder system to act against humans? “No,” he said, firmly. “The robots don’t have any authority to take any action against anyone. It’s just monitoring and giving alerts.”
But Sharkey, the U.K. robotics professor, argues that there is a thin line between using robots to monitor a border and using them to enforce one. Weaponizing a drone is relatively easy, he said, citing the 2015 case of the Connecticut teenager who equipped a drone with a handgun and a flamethrower. Sharkey worries about the implications of developing autonomous systems to patrol borders, including how the system could be used by a country coping with a large influx of people.
“The question is, where is this going?” Sharkey asked. “The current project does not propose to weaponize them, but it would just be too tempting for countries if a tipping point were to happen with mass migration.”
Hannah Couchman, a researcher at the U.K. human rights organization Liberty, agrees. “There are deep human rights and civil liberty concerns with this technology,” she told The Intercept. “Once this tech is developed, it’s seen as a solution, as a response to austerity, and a way to do a job efficiently with a lower cost, all rolled out without proper consultation and legislative scrutiny.”
“It’s not just about mitigating the human rights risk,” Couchman said. “It’s about whether we should use the technology in the first place.”

Despite major advances in genetics and modern imaging, the diagnosis catches most breast cancer patients by surprise. For some, it comes too late. Later diagnosis means aggressive treatments, uncertain outcomes, and more medical expenses. As a result, identifying patients has been a central pillar of breast cancer research and effective early detection.
With that in mind, a team from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) has created a new deep-learning model that can predict from a mammogram if a patient is likely to develop breast cancer as much as five years in the future. Trained on mammograms and known outcomes from over 60,000 MGH patients, the model learned the subtle patterns in breast tissue that are precursors to malignant tumors.
MIT Professor Regina Barzilay, herself a breast cancer survivor, says that the hope is for systems like these to enable doctors to customize screening and prevention programs at the individual level, making late diagnosis a relic of the past.
Although mammography has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality, there is continued debate on how often to screen and when to start. While the American Cancer Society recommends annual screening starting at age 45, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends screening every two years starting at age 50.
“Rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach, we can personalize screening around a woman’s risk of developing cancer,” says Barzilay, senior author of a new paper about the project out today in Radiology. “For example, a doctor might recommend that one group of women get a mammogram every other year, while another higher-risk group might get supplemental MRI screening.” Barzilay is the Delta Electronics Professor at CSAIL and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT.
The team’s model was significantly better at predicting risk than existing approaches: It accurately placed 31 percent of all cancer patients in its highest-risk category, compared to only 18 percent for traditional models.
Harvard Professor Constance Lehman says that there’s previously been minimal support in the medical community for screening strategies that are risk-based rather than age-based.
“This is because before we did not have accurate risk assessment tools that worked for individual women,” says Lehman, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and division chief of breast imaging at MGH. “Our work is the first to show that it’s possible.”  
Barzilay and Lehman co-wrote the paper with lead author Adam Yala, a CSAIL PhD student. Other MIT co-authors include PhD student Tal Schuster and former master’s student Tally Portnoi.How it works 
Since the first breast-cancer risk model from 1989, development has largely been driven by human knowledge and intuition of what major risk factors might be, such as age, family history of breast and ovarian cancer, hormonal and reproductive factors, and breast density.
However, most of these markers are only weakly correlated with breast cancer. As a result, such models still aren’t very accurate at the individual level, and many organizations continue to feel risk-based screening programs are not possible, given those limitations.
Rather than manually identifying the patterns in a mammogram that drive future cancer, the MIT/MGH team trained a deep-learning model to deduce the patterns directly from the data. Using information from more than 90,000 mammograms, the model detected patterns too subtle for the human eye to detect.
“Since the 1960s radiologists have noticed that women have unique and widely variable patterns of breast tissue visible on the mammogram,” says Lehman. “These patterns can represent the influence of genetics, hormones, pregnancy, lactation, diet, weight loss, and weight gain. We can now leverage this detailed information to be more precise in our risk assessment at the individual level.”  Making cancer detection more equitable
The project also aims to make risk assessment more accurate for racial minorities, in particular. Many early models were developed on white populations, and were much less accurate for other races. The MIT/MGH model, meanwhile, is equally accurate for white and black women. This is especially important given that black women have been shown to be 42 percent more likely to die from breast cancer due to a wide range of factors that may include differences in detection and access to health care.
“It’s particularly striking that the model performs equally as well for white and black people, which has not been the case with prior tools,” says Allison Kurian, an associate professor of medicine and health research/policy at Stanford University School of Medicine. “If validated and made available for widespread use, this could really improve on our current strategies to estimate risk.”
Barzilay says their system could also one day enable doctors to use mammograms to see if patients are at a greater risk for other health problems, like cardiovascular disease or other cancers. The researchers are eager to apply the models to other diseases and ailments, and especially those with less effective risk models, like pancreatic cancer.
“Our goal is to make these advancements a part of the standard of care,” says Yala. “By predicting who will develop cancer in the future, we can hopefully save lives and catch cancer before symptoms ever arise.”

Who should benefit when workers develop a ""hack"" into how their job gets done?Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to Linkedin









The headlines tell a confusing story about the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on jobs. Pew Research Center asked 1,896 experts to comment on the impact of automation and AI on the future of jobs. Roughly half of these experts, 48%, envisioned a future where robots and digital agents will displace significant numbers of both blue and white-collar workers. The other 52% of experts expect technology to create more jobs than it displaces by 2025.  This is consistent with the estimate from Gartner that says by 2020 AI will create 2.3 million jobs in 2020, while eliminating 1.8 million jobs.

One area on which these experts agree is that automation will transform all jobs. In fact, McKinsey predicts roughly 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated. This means that most workers, from those working in a factory or warehouse, to customer call center operators, recruiting schedulers, and even CEOs, will be working alongside digital assistants. The nature of all jobs is changing as organizations leverage the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the workplace.
But I think the conversation has the wrong focus. We know AI and automation will transform the nature of the activities within jobs, but, as leaders, we need to ask a new question: what happens when either full time workers or gig workers self automate their jobs? Actually, this question was asked by a programmer on The Workplace Stack Exchange, one of the web’s most important forums for programmers with the post: ""Is it unethical for me to not tell my employer I’ve automated my job?”
PROMOTED
This question was viewed over 480,000 times and asks us to address an emerging issue in the workplace: if workers' self automate their jobs, who benefits and what is the impact on other jobs? While the threat of automation is playing itself out in the media, some workers have taken matters into their own hands and started to automate various aspects of their jobs from data entry to inventory management and database administration.
 Self automating jobs are gaining steam among programmers, but workers across other business functions are automating their jobs as well. They are experimenting with using Google Assistant to manage busywork and accessing a range of productivity bots to schedule meetings (X.ai or Clara) or to follow-up after meetings (Gridspace Sift or Geekbot). All of this is having broad implications for both the employee and the employer. HR, Business, and IT leaders need to ask themselves five questions as the wave of self-automation spreads beyond programmers to a myriad of job functions and industries:
1) What will be the impact of AI and automation at work?
Automation and the impact of AI on the workplace is happening now and it is not going away. In fact, McKinsey estimates that 15% of the global workforce or 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016–2030.  There are many factors that will impact the pace and scope of workforce automation, such as labor market dynamics and associated wages for certain jobs, as well as the technical feasibility of automation and the acceptance of automation by a company's culture. But one thing is certain: as machines complement human labor in the workplace, we will all be impacted and need to adjust the nature of our jobs. There are numerous blog posts and how-to articles with titles like “How I Automated My Job With Node JS,” or even books, a recent one titled, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, showing this to be a growing cottage industry.
2) What happens when key job families begin to self automate their jobs? 
Programmers are a job family ripe for self automation since they routinely use tools to automate various aspects of their job. These workers offer a glimpse of what it looks like when automation is started not by a top-down executive strategy but by the workers themselves. For HR, business, and IT leaders, the opportunity is to inculcate a learning mindset among workers so when (not if) self automation occurs, workers will be encouraged to learn new skills and tackle new challenges.
3)  Who should benefit when workers develop a ""hack"" into how their job gets done?
It seems to me both the employer and the employee should benefit from workers who find better ways to do their jobs. While many knowledge workers routinely sign employment contracts stipulating that any intellectual property developed on company time belongs to the employer, should this continue to be the norm as jobs are being automated by technology?  If a worker creates an efficiency ""hack"", why not reward this, communicate it company-wide, and identify ways the worker can use their new found time at work to develop additional skills?
4) How can job automation become less a top down mandate and more a bottom up movement?
Currently, the focus has been on when employers will pull the switch and automate jobs, but this does not consider the spread of self automation across various job functions, starting with programmers, but expanding to customer service center operators, recruiting coordinators and more. In fact, we must ask ourselves this: will self automation become a new skill set for workers?  How can we encourage workers to look for ways to automate parts of their jobs, and in the process, reclaim parts of their work day. We might even envision a time when self automating your job allows you to have a four-day work week. Workers already believe they can get their work done in less time. According to research conducted by our firm, Future Workplace, and Kronos, three in four full-time employees (78%) say they could do their job in under seven hours each day if they could work uninterrupted, while almost half (45%) think they could wrap things up in just five hours each day.
5) How do business leaders start a dialogue about self automating jobs?
""Here's what we don't want to happen,"" says Ryan Duguid, Chief Evangelist, Nintex. ""We don't want workers who self automate to keep this to themselves. We want to reward their agility and curiosity."" Often companies focus only on finding organizational productivity gains, but the time is now to recognize workers who discover personal productivity gains. HR, business and IT leaders need to start discussing how some workers have self automated parts of their jobs, increased their productivity and satisfaction at work, as well as developed new skills adding more value to their jobs. It's time we turn the conversation from employers using automation to displace jobs to workers using technology to find better ways to do their jobs!Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website. Jeanne MeisterFollowingFollowI'm a global HR consultant and Jeanne is a workplace visionary, advising clients to think differently about work, the worker, the workplace, and the... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/jeannemeister/files/2019/05/shutterstock_674389504_SQ.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', 'width': 542.79, 'height': 304.6}",The Future of Work: The Rise of Workers Who Self Automate Their Jobs,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/05/07/the-future-of-work-the-rise-of-workers-who-self-automate-their-jobs/,,,Leadership Strategy,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Leadership', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/leadership/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Leadership Strategy', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/leadership-strategy/'}]",,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) work?

Generative Adversarial Networks were first introduced in 2014 in a research paper. They have also been called  “the most interesting idea in the last ten years in Machine Learning” by Yann LeCun, Facebook’s AI research director.
To understand the concept of adversarial networks, we need to understand discriminative models, based on deep learning. The discriminative models take sample input data and process them to generate groupings to identify the data. On the contrary, generative networks can produce new features based on defined conditions.

Need for GANs
The discriminative networks can be error-prone due to small quantities of noise in the data. The results can be miscalculated and misleading. The primary reason behind this limitation is the way machine learning models are designed to learn. Most of them learn from the limited data, which may contain inaccurate, non-linear relationship between the input and output. 
Structure of GANs
A Generative Adversarial Network contains a “generator”(G) neural network and a “discriminator”(D) neural network. The generator produces dummy data samples to mislead the discriminator. The discriminator tries to determine the difference between the dummy and real data.

The above process takes place with the following steps:
Random variable generationTransformation of the random variable into a complex variable.Generation of output random variable containing probabilitiesthe final output of the generative network
Both the neural networks compete with each other during the formative period. The training steps are performed repeatedly by both the models and they gradually get improved after several cycles. 
The goal of the generative model is the maximization of the probability of the distributor being incorrect. The discriminator aims for minimization of the estimation of accuracy of the sample data.
To effectively train the GANs, consider the following points: 
While training the discriminator, the adversary should be constant, and while training the adversary, the discriminator should be constant.To avoid one network from dominating the another, both the models should have an equivalent skill threshold.
Benefits and drawbacks
The advantages of GANs involve:
Diminished need for direct data example inputs which can be replaced with gradients to the discriminator. Ability to generate sharp distributions which are superior to the Markov chains which need the blurry distribution to achieve the correct mix. 
The main drawback of the GANs is their tendency to take a lot of time for the training. It may take hours for a GAN to train, which in turn make them complex to form and use.

From the development of writing, to Gutenberg’s printing press – which advanced the spread of knowledge to the masses and ushered in the enlightenment and scientific revolution – to the first programmable digital computer Colossus, the cost of reproducing and communicating information, or data, has fallen again and again. At the same time, tools for processing and making sense of large quantities of data have developed exponentially – with artificial intelligence (<abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>) representing the latest leap. In the same way that Gutenberg’s press ushered in a new era of growth, data-driven technologies such as <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> will underpin our future prosperity.</p><p>There is no doubt that machine learning and <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is already improving peoples’ lives, from intelligent personal assistants that can prepare us for changes in the weather, to systems that protect our money from criminals, or devices that offer medical advice from the comfort of our own home. And this is only the start; the potential of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is undeniable. Our next challenge will be to harness this technology to transform how we diagnose diseases, manufacture goods and build our homes.</p><p>Using advanced algorithmic techniques such as ‘deep learning’, <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> has the potential to solve complex problems fast, and in so doing, free up time and raise productivity. But we also need to make sure <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> benefits everyone in the UK, which is why – in addition to this Sector Deal – the government is establishing a Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation to advise on the ethical use of data, including for <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>.</p><p>The huge global opportunity <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> presents is why the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-building-a-britain-fit-for-the-future"" class=""govuk-link"">Industrial Strategy white paper</a> identified <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and data as 1 of 4 Grand Challenges – in which the UK can lead the world for years to come.</p><p>The UK is well placed to do this. We are already home to some of the biggest names in the business such as Deepmind, Swiftkey and Babylon.</p><p>And it’s not just the established players – Kwiziq, Cleo and Mindtrace are examples of UK <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> startups leading the way in areas as diverse as education, personal finance and autonomous vehicles. Major established companies in the tech sector, but also increasingly beyond, are using <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> to tune up their operations and services.</p><p>To realise all the social and economic benefits, we will need a strong partnership between business, academia and government. This sector deal establishes the beginning of that partnership. It responds to the recommendations of the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Review, <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/growing-the-artificial-intelligence-industry-in-the-uk"" class=""govuk-link"">‘Growing the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Industry in the UK’</a>, led by Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti, which articulated how the government and industry can work together on skills, infrastructure and implement a longterm strategy for <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> in the UK.</p><p>We need to be strategic and focused: recognising the increasing convergence of technologies and focusing on the areas where we can compete globally.</p><p>While robotics, a complementary technology to <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, was outside the scope of the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Review, recommendations on the robotics industry have been made in the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://connect.innovateuk.org/documents/2903012/16074728/RAS%20UK%20Strategy?version=1.0"" class=""govuk-link"">Robotics Review RAS 2020</a>, and in <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/made-smarter-review"" class=""govuk-link"">‘Made Smarter’</a>, a review on digitising the manufacturing industry. Moving forwards, identifying and making the most of these synergies will be crucial for success.</p><p>A revolution in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> technology is already emerging. If we act now, we can lead it from the front. But if we ‘wait and see’ other countries will seize the advantage. Together, we can make the UK a global leader in this technology that will change all our lives.</p><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/people/greg-clark"" class=""govuk-link"">Rt Hon Greg Clark MP</a> <br>Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</p><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/people/matthew-hancock"" class=""govuk-link"">Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP</a> <br>Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport</p><p><a rel=""external"" href=""http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/wh/"" class=""govuk-link"">Professor Dame Wendy Hall</a> <br>Regius Professor of Computer Science, the University of Southampton</p><p><a rel=""external"" href=""https://research.fb.com/people/pesenti-jerome/"" class=""govuk-link"">Jérôme Pesenti</a> <br>Vice President of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, Facebook</p>'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Industrial Strategy at a glance', 'url': 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/artificial-intelligence-sector-deal/ai-sector-deal#industrial-strategy-at-a-glance', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'url': 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/artificial-intelligence-sector-deal/ai-sector-deal#industrial-strategy-at-a-glance', 'text': '<p>We will create an economy that boosts productivity and earning power throughout the UK.</p><h3 id=""foundations-of-productivity"">\n<span class=""number"">5 foundations </span> of productivity</h3><p>The Industrial Strategy is built on 5 foundations:</p><ul>\n  <li>Ideas - the world’s most innovative economy</li>\n  <li>People - good jobs and greater earning power for all</li>\n  <li>Infrastructure - a major upgrade to the UK’s infrastructure</li>\n  <li>Business environment - the best place to start and grow a business</li>\n  <li>Places - prosperous communities across the UK</li>\n</ul><h3 id=""grand-challenges"">Grand Challenges</h3><p>We will set <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-the-grand-challenges/industrial-strategy-the-grand-challenges"" class=""govuk-link"">Grand Challenges</a> to put the United Kingdom at the forefront of the industries of the future:</p><ul>\n  <li>\n<abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and Data Economy - We will put the UK at the forefront of the artificial intelligence and data revolution</li>\n  <li>Future of Mobility - We will become a world leader in the way people, goods and services move</li>\n  <li>Clean Growth - We will maximise the advantages for UK industry from the global shift to clean growth</li>\n  <li>Ageing Society - We will harness the power of innovation to help meet the needs of an ageing society</li>\n</ul><h3 id=""key-policies"">Key policies</h3><p>Key policies include:</p><h4 id=""ideas"">Ideas</h4><ul>\n  <li>Raise total research and development (<abbr title=""research and development"">R&amp;D</abbr>) investment to 2.4% of <abbr title=""gross domestic product"">GDP</abbr> by 2027</li>\n  <li>Increase the rate of <abbr title=""research and development"">R&amp;D</abbr> tax credit to 12%</li>\n  <li>Invest £725 million in new Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund programmes to capture the value of innovation</li>\n</ul><h4 id=""people"">People</h4><ul>\n  <li>Establish a technical education system that rivals the best in the world to stand alongside our world-class higher education system</li>\n  <li>Invest an additional £406 million in maths, digital and technical education, helping to address the shortage of science, technology, engineering and maths (<abbr title=""science, technology, engineering and maths"">STEM</abbr>) skills</li>\n  <li>Create a new National Retraining Scheme that supports people to re-skill, beginning with a £64 million investment for digital and construction training</li>\n</ul><h4 id=""infrastructure"">Infrastructure</h4><ul>\n  <li>Increase the National Productivity Investment Fund to £31 billion, supporting investments in transport, housing and digital infrastructure</li>\n  <li>Support electric vehicles through £400 million charging infrastructure investment and an extra £100 million to \nextend the plug-in car grant</li>\n  <li>Boost our digital infrastructure with over £1 billion of public investment, including £176 million for 5G and £200 million for local areas to encourage roll out of full-fibre networks</li>\n</ul><h4 id=""business-environment"">Business environment</h4><ul>\n  <li>Launch and roll out Sector Deals – partnerships between government and industry aiming to increase sector productivity.

Their review, published in October 2017, engaged widely with businesses, academia, investors and other stakeholders on ways to boost the UK’s emerging <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> sector at home and across the world. It sets out proposals to improve the institutions that support <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> in the United Kingdom, to build a skilled workforce, and to stimulate access to data – collectively the lifeblood of any <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> business.</p><p>This Sector Deal reinforces the 5 foundations of the Industrial Strategy:</p><ul>\n  <li>ideas</li>\n  <li>people</li>\n  <li>infrastructure</li>\n  <li>business environment</li>\n  <li>places</li>\n</ul><p>It also draws on the government’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">Digital Strategy</a>, which focuses on reinforcing our strengths in telecoms, data and enterprise. A key ambition of the industrial strategy is for the UK to be the world’s most innovative economy – this Sector Deal aims to attract and retain both domestic and global <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> talent; deliver major upgrades to our digital and data infrastructure; ensure that the UK is the best place to start and grow an <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> business; and contribute to communities’ prosperity by spreading the benefits of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> across the country.</p><h3 id=""people-1"">People</h3><p>The Industrial Strategy has people at its core: it is focused on creating good jobs and greater earning power for all people in the UK. To do this, we must equip citizens for jobs shaped by next generation technology. Growing the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> industry in the UK outlined the fast-growing demand for expertise to develop and apply <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> technologies, and proposed ways to increase the supply of skills at different levels. Building on these recommendations and the commitments in the Industrial Strategy and Digital Strategy to grow science, technology, engineering and maths (<abbr title=""science, technology, engineering and maths"">STEM</abbr>) and digital skills training, this Sector Deal sets out how the government, universities and industry will work together to greatly improve the supply of skills. It also sets out how we will attract the best, and most diverse, global <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> talent to the UK.</p><h3 id=""infrastructure-1"">Infrastructure</h3><p>Ensuring the UK has the right digital infrastructure – both physical and, crucially, data infrastructure – is critical to meeting our ambition of leading the world in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>. That is why, as part of our Industrial Strategy, we are investing over £1 billion to create a country with world class digital capabilities: from 5G mobile networks to full-fibre broadband. Equally important is the availability of data, which is required on a vast scale to train machine learning systems. The government and public bodies are already leading the way in making public datasets open and available. But there remain significant challenges to sharing private sector datasets. Through this Sector Deal, we will tackle both the practical and cultural barriers to sharing both publicly and privately held data. As part of this we will explore data sharing frameworks such as Data Trusts – mechanisms where parties have defined rights and responsibilities with respect to shared data – in order to protect sensitive data, facilitate access to data, and ensure accountability. This will allow and ensure fair and equitable data sharing between organisations in the private sector, and between the private and public sectors.</p><h3 id=""ideas-1"">Ideas</h3><p>The government set out a vision in the Industrial Strategy to make the UK the world’s most innovative economy. To achieve this, we are committing to work with the private sector to boost research and development (<abbr title=""research and development"">R&amp;D</abbr>) spending to 2.4% by 2027, and 3% over the longer term. This begins with a £725 million investment through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund competition, designed to capture the value of innovation by commercialising a great idea in the lab to a successful business. For example, one early commitment is our £210 million Challenge on research into the early diagnosis of chronic illness – including a substantial investment in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> diagnostics techniques<sup id=""fnref:2"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:2"" class=""govuk-link"" rel=""footnote"">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. The use of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is central to this work, which includes programmes applying <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> to raise output in sectors of the economy that have struggled with productivity, from reducing crop disease in the agriculture sector, to delivering services digitally in the public sector. We are seeing industry respond to our commitment to <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> innovation with investments in <abbr title=""research and development"">R&amp;D</abbr> in the UK, such as those from major players like Beyond Limits and Element <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>.</p><h3 id=""business-environment-1"">Business Environment</h3><p>Our intention is to be the best place to start and grow a business in the world. With a new business starting up every 75 seconds in the UK, and a massive increase in the finance available to knowledge-intensive and innovative firms – such as those developing <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> – through the British Business Bank, we are in a strong starting position.</p><p>As at September 2017, over £350 million<sup id=""fnref:3"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:3"" class=""govuk-link"" rel=""footnote"">[footnote 3]</a></sup> has been invested in 243 technology companies through the British Business Bank’s venture capital programmes.</p><p><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is emerging in its own right as a nascent industry with the potential to raise the productivity of diverse sectors and create entirely new jobs. To maximise this potential, this deal will establish a new <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Council to bring together respected leaders in the field from across academia and industry; a new delivery body within the government – the Office for Artificial Intelligence – to support it; and a new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation. The deal will also increase promotion of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> businesses globally and take steps to attract <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> entrepreneurs to the UK. A recent report by Oxford Insights ranked the UK top for government readiness to implement <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, and these measures will allow us to capitalise on the UK’s worldclass <abbr title=""research and development"">R&amp;D</abbr> and tech entrepreneur base<sup id=""fnref:4"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:4"" class=""govuk-link"" rel=""footnote"">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id=""places-1"">Places</h3><p>The Industrial Strategy set out the goal of helping communities prosper throughout the UK. Growing the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> industry in the UK outlined the thriving <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> ecosystem that already exists. London is the European capital of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, while significant clusters exist in places such as Edinburgh, Belfast, Bristol and Cambridge. As important as the growth of these clusters of expertise is, our ambition is for <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> to be adopted by businesses across the country.

We announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget £84 million of new funding to deliver a comprehensive 4 year programme to improve computing education and drive up participation in computer science, including upskilling up to 8,000 computer science teachers, to ensure there is a suitably qualified GCSE teacher in every school. The government has also supported the creation of Ada, the National College of Digital Skills, which will train up to 5,000 students over the next 7 years for a wide range of digital careers. At a higher level, industry will be investing to fund a Masters degree programme with an integrated internship, targeting an initial cohort of 200 students per year. The government will be funding 450 new PhD places, and establishing a prestigious Turing Fellowship to support an initial cohort of 10 <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Fellows, to keep the best and brightest <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> researchers in the UK.

It enables all kinds of services we use everyday from maps on our smartphones, to social media and payment processes. Without access to good quality data from a range of sources (whether privately or publicly held), <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> technologies cannot deliver on their promise of better, more efficient and seamless services.</p><p>Open data published by organisations across a range of sectors have enabled other businesses to innovate and build new services, which in turn can make significant contributions to the economy. Transport apps such as CityMapper, for example, make journeys more efficient and have led to the creation of ‘pop-up’ bus routes for commonly made journeys that were previously unserved.</p><p>Similarly, open environmental data has been used to create flood risk and water quality apps. To test the autonomous vehicles of the future we will need good quality 3D topographic data on road conditions and roadside obstacles.</p><p>The government is committed to opening up more data in a way that makes it reusable and easily accessible. A good example is geospatial data. The Geospatial Commission announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget will provide strategic oversight to the various public bodies who hold geospatial data, seeking to maximise the growth of the digital economy and consolidate the UK’s position as the best place to start and grow a digital business. To further boost the digital economy, the government is working with the Ordnance Survey (<abbr title=""Ordnance Survey"">OS</abbr>) and the new Commission to establish how to open up freely the <abbr title=""Ordnance Survey"">OS</abbr> MasterMap data to UK-based small businesses in particular.

Organisations looking to access or share data can often face a range of barriers, from trust and cultural concerns to practical and legal obstacles. To address these issues, we are working with industry to pioneer mechanisms for data sharing such as Data Trusts. These frameworks will ensure that all parties involved have defined rights and responsibilities towards the data and individuals’ personal data, and other sensitive data, is protected. For example, the vision for Data Trusts is that they will allow 2 or more parties in any sector to partner in data sharing agreements, shape the agreements according to their needs and enable multiple organisations to work together to solve a common problem.</p><p>In addition to Data Trusts, we will explore how to improve data sharing generally, through sharing frameworks and consideration of data portability.</p><h3 id=""deliver-a-strong-digital-infrastructure-across-the-uk"">Deliver a strong digital infrastructure across the UK</h3><p>The government will work with the telecommunications industry to extend coverage of superfast broadband across the UK, achieving a baseline speed of 24 Megabits per second (<abbr title=""Megabits per second"">Mbps</abbr>).

Ford believes “freedom of movement drives human progress.” While it is now a global company, Ford started out more than 100 years ago in Dearborn, Michigan. The company revolutionized manufacturing by introducing the moving assembly line and made car ownership possible for everyday folks and not just the wealthy. Today, the company focuses on technology first and uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in many ways from connected car solutions to the development of autonomous vehicles.








The Amazing Ways The Ford Motor Company Uses Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning

AI in the Manufacturing Process & Operations
The Ford research lab has conducted research on computational intelligence for more than 20 years. About 15 years ago the company introduced an innovative misfire detection system—one of the first large-scale industrial applications of neural networks. Ford uses artificial intelligence to automate quality assurance as well; AI can detect wrinkles in car seats. In addition, neural networks help support Ford’s supply chain through inventory and resource management.
Ford also uses AI technology to understand the inventory data for used cars with an artificial intelligence platform called CarStory. Now dealerships can learn details about the condition of vehicles, owner history and see how pricing is in the marketplace. The reports from CarStory use analytics to determine what makes each previously owned car unique.

Smart Technology for Cars on the Road
The 2019 Ford Edge model will have artificial intelligence as part of its all-wheel-drive system. By using dozens of high-tech sensors, the system can determine quicker than a human brain if all-wheel drive is needed. It's able to shift between two- and four-wheel drive automatically. Machine learning techniques added to vehicles help provide the new features, personalization and product improvement consumers desire. Many of the AI applications interact directly with the drivers to monitor acceleration or braking, help improve fuel efficiency and the driver's preferences for seat position, climate control, and infotainment.

In China, Ford launched SYNC infotainment system that relies on Baidu’s artificial intelligence. Ford is working very closely with Baidu to give Chinese consumers (the largest emerging auto market) what they demand in connectivity. It features an intelligent voice assistant, access to video streaming, easier info exchange between the in-vehicle system and FordPass as well as the ability to pay for services. All of Ford’s products in China will be connected by the end of 2019.
Ford Motorsports Moves to Pole Position Thanks to AI
Another way Ford takes advantage of artificial intelligence is on the racecourse. Ford Motorsports uses simulation technology (NVIDIA DGX-1 artificial intelligence supercomputer) to understand the performance of a race car before it ever hits the track. The insights inform the race strategy and have produced incredible results—given Ford 300x performance improvements.
Investments in AI
With an investment of more than $1 billion in Argo AI, Ford has backed up its commitment to technology with funding. Although Argo AI is an independent company and its innovations will help other car manufacturers as well, Ford uses Argo AI technology in its vehicles. In addition, the partnership is exploring how driverless cars and trucks could transform the transportation and delivery industries. Currently, Walmart uses Argo AI-powered Ford vans for some home deliveries. Argo AI was founded in 2016, but thanks to Ford's investment the company has been able to quickly develop its self-driving car technology. Argo's systems use technologies such as lane-keeping systems and adaptive cruise control as well as a variety of sensors including LIDAR, radar, infrared to improve the way the self-driving vehicles ""see"" the world around them and respond to the environment.
Ford has also invested in several centers of excellence to focus on machine learning and AI. These centers are where engineers determine the AI tools and methodology that should be dispersed throughout the company and to further advance AI applications. The company also has partnerships with several high-tech companies and start-ups around the world plus a Research & Innovation Center in Palo Alto.
Autonomous Vehicles
Ford expects to launch its self-driving car fleet in 2021, but they will be “geo-fenced,” Ford CEO Jim Hackett confirmed. Currently, the company is testing its autonomous vehicles on the streets of Detroit, Miami, and Washington, D.C.
With all of this technological development coming from car manufacturers, CES, one of the world’s biggest tech shows, has become one of the biggest auto shows. The pace of AI innovation is brisk. Companies such as Ford that are proactive with investments, research, and product development will be the ones that enable their continued success.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/bernardmarr/files/2019/05/The-Amazing-Ways-The-Ford-Motor-Company-Uses-Artificial-Intelligence-And-Machine-Learning-1-1200x796.jpeg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', 'width': 542.79, 'height': 304.6}",The Amazing Ways The Ford Motor Company Uses Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/05/17/the-amazing-ways-the-ford-motor-company-uses-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/,,,Enterprise & Cloud,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has figured in many works of fiction as well as documentaries because what they do fascinates people. The representations have not always been favorable, but most people agree they have spearheaded many advances in science and technology in law enforcement. It seems that either that has not been the case when it comes to artificial intelligence or the FBI is keeping their AI projects mostly under wraps. If they have fallen behind on that front, it’s perhaps understandable. As a federal agency overseeing domestic crime and investigations as well as foreign threats within its borders, it has to answer to a whole slew of oversight committees for everything it does, such as using facial recognition software. The FBI cannot simply use technology as a commercial company such as Facebook would. Nevertheless, AI at the FBI has been gathering steam in some areas of law enforcement. In fact, senators from both parties collaborated on a bill, the AI in Government Act of 2018, that would look more closely into the potential of AI technology for government use. If it passes, it could pave the way for developing AI at the FBI. At around the same time, the FBI secured funding that would enable them to secure AI talent for their field offices, primarily for data management, but possibly for other areas as well. Current AI applications that could benefit the FBI include: Facial recognition Fingerprint identification DNA matching Cybersecurity Insider threat identification Business process management We discuss each in detail below, starting with facial recognition. Facial Recognition Facial recognition software is taking off in the commercial sector, and some of the biggest companies in banking and finance are reaping the rewards. Many people have heard about the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), perhaps from watching true crime television shows. The FBI, through its Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), developed it over many years, and it has been a great boon in criminal investigation. However, with big data comes great responsibility, so the FBI turned to AI to develop the Next Generation Identification (NGI) technology. One of its capabilities is comparing images to identify those associated with criminal activities using the Interstate Photo System database. Below is a short 1.5-minute video showing how the NIG-IPS system works:  The FBI use of facial recognition software has had its successes, but some people are not convinced they should use it due to civil liberty issues. The FBI is also looking into commercially available software for video surveillance, particularly Rekognition by Amazon. While this is still exploratory, this move has come in for its share of criticism from numerous advocacy groups. Fingerprint Identification The FBI has been using IAFIS primarily to match fingerprints from a known ten print database, and the NGI has expanded that capability. The new system, known as the Advanced Fingerprint Information Technology (AFIT), also looks at latent palm prints. This 10-minute video shows how law enforcement in Texas was able to use AFIT to solve an actual case in Texas from time mark 2:51 to 3:24.  However, the FBI has frequently encountered cases of obliterated or otherwise changed fingerprints that prevented identification. To circumvent that, the agency has put out requests for information about AI technology that might be able to make a match despite these intentional or unintentional alterations. Other capabilities of NGI include: Repository for Individuals of Special Concern (RISC) – this is an early program for identifying wanted and other dangerous individuals using a fingerprint database; designed to provide law enforcement personnel with on-scene and instant access via a mobile device Friction Ridge Investigative File – contains all relevant images and events associated with an individual to improve latent search accuracy, including tenprint, RISC, supplemental fingerprints, and palm prints under the National Palm Print System (NPPS) Rap Back service – regularly monitors and reports on the activities of people under government investigation or supervision, or holding a position of trust such as daycare workers and schoolteachers to authorized organizations to avoid having to repeat background checks Cold Case/Unknown Deceased – enables latent examiners and law enforcement investigators to use the NGI database and search algorithms to identify unknown deceased people in cold cases, such as this1995 case Iris Pilot – launched in late 2013 to assess its effectiveness, the idea is to use the human iris as biometric identification in correctional facilities, border security, supervised release programs, onsite mobile identification, and investigations involving video evidence; the difficulty is in capturing and compressing the image within acceptable limits DNA Matching Genomics revolutionized many things, including criminal investigation, by establishing the idea of DNA profiling. Just like fingerprints, no two DNA profiles are the same. However, it was much more difficult to guard against leaving DNA behind in a crime scene than it was to leave fingerprints behind. Hair, semen, blood, and sweat could contain enough biological material to generate a DNA profile, especially with more advanced technology. The FBI saw the value of DNA profiles early on in criminal investigation, and eventually built a database called Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). Before there were machine learning algorithms, law enforcement would send trace evidence to special labs to process it, and then submit the DNA profile to the FBI to make a match. The whole process was a slow one, taking days or weeks, depending on the backlog of the forensics lab, and the difficulty of finding a match. Labs capable of generating DNA profiles were few, and the backlog of cases could be as much as five years in some areas. Additionally, DNA profiles contain a complex set of data, and CODIS has almost 14 million profiles as of February 2019, so it takes time for standard computer programs to wade through all the data to identify one profile, if it is there. In many cases, the long wait could be justice delayed, justice denied. A new machine could change all that. Law enforcement has been using fully automated and portable Rapid DNA machines to speed up the process of generating DNA profiles from cheek swabs, cutting it down to just 90 minutes instead of days or weeks. With machine learning software, police could take specimens, generate a profile, and make a match within two hours provided they had access to CODIS. That is precisely what the FBI means to do by authority of the Rapid DNA Act of 2017. Among other things, this allows the agency to establish a network of these machines to gain access to CODIS. Here is a 1-minute video showing how the Rapid DNA machine works.  Different Rapid DNA machines came under assessment by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2018.  Resultsshowed that while the machines are capable of running on its own, a modified analysis with some human intervention yielded results with higher accuracy. Cybersecurity The FBI is the repository of much data spread out over many field offices, so like any big organization, cybersecurity is a major issue. A recent hack by a researcher for a security company revealed just how easy it was to access terabytes of data from the FBI files. The breach allowed access to a multitude of confidential files, from agent interviews to banking transactions. This is ironic, as the FBI has an entire division dedicated to investigating cybercrime, from ransomware to identity theft. The FBI started contracting cybersecurity company ECS to manage its network security using AI. AI is particularly indicated when it comes to cybersecurity, primarily because of the rapid evolution of malware. Deep Instinct CTO and co-founder Eli David claimed in an Emerj interview “the conservative estimate is about one million new malwares every single day and it is probably much more than that.” Security software has to be able to keep up with changing parameters, and that is the core of AI. The $38 million deal would involve six years of ECS will be using machine learning to enable teams of security experts to go through the FBI’s networks to detect weak spots, scan for potential problem areas, and set up staff to assess and manage the security needs of the different networks continuously. ECS would specifically manage the Cybersecurity Red and Blue Team (REBL) and Enterprise Compliance and Continuous Monitoring Support programs. Insider Threat Identification Threats from without are bad, but so are threats from within, and maybe much more so. The FBI has been subject to numerous instances of insider threats since the 1980s, a period former Naval Criminal Investigative Service Chief Psychologist and Deloitte Managing DirectorMichael Gelles calls the “Decade of the Spy.” He described the method of dealing with insider threats as “reactive.” Gelles further stated: With the advent of technology and the movement of information, if you will, and the infusion of a new generation into the workforce, information is perceived, managed and shared in a very different way than it was in a world of bricks and mortar — where things now are just instantaneous. The FBI addressed this need for a more proactive approach to insider threats by launching two programs using data analytics to deal with the problem. One is Javelin, which keeps tabs on internal misconduct, security violations, and internal espionage. The other one is the Insider Threat Analysis Platform (InTAP), which combs through large volumes of data to find patterns that indicate suspicious activities and potential threats to the organization. Both these programs are underway, but the FBI is still actively trying to recruit AI talent to handle the big data side of them. The problem is competing for the right talent with private companies that can pay more and provide better benefits. Business Process Management The FBI is a large organization of multiple field offices across the globe with a staff of more than 51,000 people working around the clock. The old ways of managing the business side of things are bound to fall short with the increasing demands o the times. To reboot its operational efficiency, the FBI has awarded a contract to software company Pega Systems. Pega would help the FBI streamline operations and cut costs with the use of two of its customizable business solutions: Pega Government Platform and Pega Robotic Process Automation. The platform would be used to develop scalable and flexible apps to meet business process needs. The automation component is to free human staff from repetitive tasks through automation. According to Pegasystem’s Global Government Business Line Leader Doug Averill: By overhauling their enterprise business processes with Pega, the FBI can improve the experience for employees so they can spend more time on critical missions that help keep US citizens safe. The FBI has a long and interesting history, over which it has evolved quite extensively in terms of technological capabilities. AI provides an excellent opportunity for the bureau to maximize the potential of the available data in its various repositories and databases.   Header Image Credit: FBI.gov Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at Citibank - Current InitiativesBanks and other financial institutions can be tight-lipped about how they implement AI technologies within… Artificial Intelligence at UBS - Current Applications and InitiativesUBS is a Swiss multinational investment banking and financial services company ranked 30th on S&P… Artificial Intelligence at Barclays - Current InitiativesBarclays is a UK bank ranked 20th on S&P Global’s list of the top 100 banks.… Artificial Intelligence at JPMorgan - Current InitiativesAccording to Fortune, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the U.S. and controls over… Artificial Intelligence in the Chinese Military - Current InitiativesThe Chinese military, or People's Liberation Army, is focusing heavily on artificial intelligence.

 How Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Will Affect the Future of PR





		Posted on May 20, 2019 by  










This blog posts appears as part of a new series by the IPR Street Team. The IPR Street Team focuses on new and emerging topics that will affect the future of the PR industry. 
Public relations, as well as other branches of communications, has seen a rise in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field. AI is fairly new and is still quite a controversial topic, but advancements in the technology may persuade public relations practitioners to use it more frequently in their own practices.
Artificial intelligence has its origins in 1956, when Dartmouth College students began inventing the new field of science (Cristianini). Over the years, artificial intelligence has developed its way into daily life, including traffic predictions, speech translations, and much more. There are two types of artificial intelligence: weak artificial intelligence and strong artificial intelligence. Weak artificial intelligence is also known as narrow artificial intelligence and is used for specific or familiar functions. Strong artificial intelligence is also known as artificial general intelligence and has the ability to improve itself because it can find solutions, making it able to perform unfamiliar and familiar tasks (Singh). Public relations commonly uses automation in its work. Automation is, according to the article, “The process of control systems and technologies by which the system can work automatically; hence it reduces the human work.”
In “AI’s PR Problem,” author Jerry Kaplan describes how artificial intelligence has a bad reputation and connotation among consumers, mostly due to its intimidating and futuristic-sounding name. He further explains that machines have been taking over skilled work for centuries, but they do not want better jobs and/or higher employment, as many people are scared into believing. He gives the example of how jacquard looms replaced needle-workers (but not tailors). He also explains how computers replaced mathematicians/computers, but it now allows them to focus on tasks that require broader skills. Basically, newer technology will always replace the older methods of completing tasks, but not all hope for the industry and its workers are lost. They must simply adapt their procedures in order to stay productive and relevant.
Sam Frizell, author of “At Your Service,” a Time article, also described a current use for artificial intelligence that is used in the current day. This particular piece of artificial technology, SmartThings, is similar to Siri and Alexa, other forms of home installations of artificial intelligence by Apple and Amazon, respectively. This device connects, monitors and controls other devices, right from your phone. SmartThings goes the extra mile by connecting to other forms of technology, such as a moisture detector, and alerts you when something goes wrong. It only requires a smartphone and a $200 starter kit, which includes sensors and the hub they sync with in order to complete commands. Creator Alex Hawkinson said that more creative uses of the device “makes you start to see the world … as programmable.” Some more functions that could help communicators in the workplace include automatically starting programs as the workday begins to simply even brewing coffee while practitioners complete their work.
In terms of communications, Melanie Peters describes Microsoft’s most popular newsroom artificial intelligence, a Chinese chatbot called Xiaoice, in the article “Making Sense of Social Media Requires Brains and Robots.” As one of the newest innovations in journalism, Xiaoice is helping to tackle fake news posted online. “She” can complete tasks such as completing weather reports, working as a news anchor and writing her own columns. According to the article, “Print journalists can’t compete with news which is put out almost instantly on social media and the web. For example, 400 million tweets flow through Twitter a day. It is a constant challenge for traditional media. However, much of the news on social media was fake.” Artificial intelligence helps communicators by weeding out fake news and any information posted by the “water army,” a group of ghostwriters paid to post information online. Although Xiaocie is popular, she is imperfect and steers clear of sensitive and controversial topics. Still, Xiaocie is a great tool for journalists and is just the beginning of artificial intelligence in the newsroom.
One use for artificial intelligence in public relations is that AI will be able to send direct, relevant messages to specific audiences. Real-time big data offers practitioners the information they need to provide current content that consumers want to see. It is already being used by servers like Facebook, which use it to filter advertisements and in chatbots, and the Associated Press, which uses it for writing full earnings reports. According to the article How Advancements in Artificial Intelligence Will Impact Public Relations, “Savvy PR professionals will understand that big data and AI can provide their readership with amazing, data-rich research on a myriad of topics. Companies should not fear big data and AI, they should instead embrace the trend and experiment with new stories that match big data analysis and messages to the audience.” Meaning that artificial intelligence is a tool for public relations practitioners, not a threat. Using artificial intelligence in the public relations industry will mean faster, optimized results that will in turn allow practitioners to meet their goals faster than ever.
When applied to public relations, artificial intelligence is able to process data and statistics much faster than any public relations practitioner would. Artificial intelligence has already been introduced to public relations throughout the use of automated social media platforms and paid media and marketing analytics, thanks to digital advertising and programmatic buying. According to the article How Will Artificial Intelligence Affect PR?, “Although artificial intelligence offers benefits to PR, with the potential of removing some of the more timely processes, creative thinking and messaging are aspects that would fundamentally need human input.” Meaning that while artificial intelligence will be able to make public relations more efficient while dealing with numbers, it ultimately cannot replace human creativity, which is essential to public relations.
Some companies, such as The Washington Post and the Associated Press, have already begun to use AI. Both companies use AI to write full earnings reports. The Associated Press is also working to generate AI-written articles for minor league baseball games (Whitaker). Shift Communications also uses AI for natural language processing, sentiment analysis and more (Chen).
Artificial intelligence is an ever-developing tool that can aid communicators in many of their day-to-day tasks, allowing them to put more time and energy into more creativity-based duties. Practitioners should stay open-minded about the introduction of artificial intelligence in their practice because it has many benefits for efficiency and productivity. Like Kaplan said, “Yes, we should be careful about how we deploy AI…Instead, we should accept these remarkable inventions for what they really are—potent tools that promise a more prosperous and comfortable future.

Artificial intelligence was just as good, and sometimes better, than doctors in diagnosing lung tumors in CT scans, a new study indicates.Credit...Voisin/Science SourceBy Denise GradyMay 20, 2019Leer en españolComputers were as good or better than doctors at detecting tiny lung cancers on CT scans, in a study by researchers from Google and several medical centers. The technology is a work in progress, not ready for widespread use, but the new report, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, offers a glimpse of the future of artificial intelligence in medicine.One of the most promising areas is recognizing patterns and interpreting images — the same skills that humans use to read microscope slides, X-rays, M.R.I.s and other medical scans.By feeding huge amounts of data from medical imaging into systems called artificial neural networks, researchers can train computers to recognize patterns linked to a specific condition, like pneumonia, cancer or a wrist fracture that would be hard for a person to see. The system follows an algorithm, or set of instructions, and learns as it goes. The more data it receives, the better it becomes at interpretation.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe process, known as deep learning, is already being used in many applications, like enabling computers to understand speech and identify objects so that a self-driving car will recognize a stop sign and distinguish a pedestrian from a telephone pole. In medicine, Google has already created systems to help pathologists read microscope slides to diagnose cancer, and to help ophthalmologists detect eye disease in people with diabetes.“We have some of the biggest computers in the world,” said Dr. Daniel Tse, a project manager at Google and an author of the journal article. “We started wanting to push the boundaries of basic science to find interesting and cool applications to work on.”In the new study, the researchers applied artificial intelligence to CT scans used to screen people for lung cancer, which caused 160,000 deaths in the United States last year, and 1.7 million worldwide. The scans are recommended for people at high risk because of a long history of smoking. Studies have found that screening can reduce the risk of dying from lung cancer. In addition to finding definite cancers, the scans can also identify spots that might later become cancer, so that radiologists can sort patients into risk groups and decide whether they need biopsies or more frequent follow-up scans to keep track of the suspect regions.But the test has pitfalls: It can miss tumors, or mistake benign spots for malignancies and push patients into invasive, risky procedures like lung biopsies or surgery. And radiologists looking at the same scan may have different opinions about it.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe researchers thought computers might do better. They created a neural network, with multiple layers of processing, and trained it by giving it many CT scans from patients whose diagnoses were known: Some had lung cancer, some did not and some had nodules that later turned cancerous.Then, they began to test its diagnostic skill.“The whole experimentation process is like a student in school,” Dr. Tse said. “We’re using a large data set for training, giving it lessons and pop quizzes so it can begin to learn for itself what is cancer, and what will or will not be cancer in the future. We gave it a final exam on data it’s never seen after we spent a lot of time training, and the result we saw on final exam — it got an A.”Tested against 6,716 cases with known diagnoses, the system was 94 percent accurate. Pitted against six expert radiologists, when no prior scan was available, the deep learning model beat the doctors: It had fewer false positives and false negatives. When an earlier scan was available, the system and the doctors were neck and neck.The ability to process vast amounts of data may make it possible for artificial intelligence to recognize subtle patterns that humans simply cannot see.“It may start out as something we can’t see, but that may open up new lines of inquiry,” said Dr. Mozziyar Etemadi, a research assistant professor of anesthesiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and an author of the study.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif., who has written extensively about artificial intelligence in medicine, said, “I’m pretty confident that what they’ve found is going to be useful, but it’s got to be proven.” Dr. Topol was not involved in the study.Given the high rate of false positives and false negatives on the lung scans as currently performed, he said, “Lung CT for smokers, it’s so bad that it’s hard to make it worse.”Asked if artificial intelligence would put radiologists out of business, Dr. Topol said, “Gosh, no!”The idea is to help doctors, not replace them.“It will make their lives easier,” he said. “Across the board, there’s a 30 percent rate of false negatives, things missed. It shouldn’t be hard to bring that number down.”There are potential hazards, though. A radiologist who misreads a scan may harm one patient, but a flawed A.I. system in widespread use could injure many, Dr. Topol warned. Before they are unleashed on the public, he said, the systems should be studied rigorously, with the results published in peer-reviewed journals, and tested in the real world to make sure they work as well there as they did in the lab.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAnd even if they pass those tests, they still have to be monitored to detect hacking or software glitches, he said.Shravya Shetty, a software engineer at Google and an author of the study, said, “How do you present the results in a way that builds trust with radiologists?” The answer, she said, will be to “show them what’s under the hood.”Another issue is: If an A.I. system is approved by the F.D.A., and then, as expected, keeps changing with experience and the processing of more data, will its maker need to apply for approval again? If so, how often?The lung-screening neural network is not ready for the clinic yet.“We are collaborating with institutions around the world to get a sense of how the technology can be implemented into clinical practice in a productive way,” Dr. Tse said. “We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves.”Denise Grady has been a science reporter for The Times since 1998.

Jump-Starting America: How Breakthrough Science Can Revive Economic Growth and the American Dream


 


By: Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson
Description (Amazon): “The American economy glitters on the outside, but the reality is quite different. Job opportunities and economic growth are increasingly concentrated in a few crowded coastal enclaves. Corporations and investors are disproportionately developing technologies that benefit the wealthiest Americans in the most prosperous areas – and destroying middle class jobs elsewhere. To turn this tide, we must look to a brilliant and all-but-forgotten American success story and embark on a plan that will create the industries of the future – and the jobs that go with them. Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson tell the story of this first American growth engine and provide the blueprint for a second.”

IT Savvy: What Top Executives Must Know to Go from Pain to Gain


 


By: Peter Weill and Jeanne W. Ross
Description (Amazon): “Digitization of business interactions and processes is advancing full bore. But in many organizations, returns from IT investments are flatlining, even as technology spending has skyrocketed. These challenges call for new levels of IT savvy: the ability of all managers-IT or non-IT-to transform their company’s technology assets into operational efficiencies that boost margins. Companies with IT-savvy managers are 20 percent more profitable than their competitors. In IT Savvy, Peter Weill and Jeanne Ross – two of the world’s foremost authorities on using IT in business – explain how non-IT executives can acquire this savvy. Concise and practical, the book describes the practices, competencies, and leadership skills non-IT managers need to succeed in the digital economy.”
Ross will review her upcoming new book, “Designed for Digital,” highlighting five building blocks companies will need for a successful transformation at the MIT Sloan CIO Symposium. 
The Technology Fallacy: How People Are the Real Key to Digital Transformation (Management on the Cutting Edge)


 


By: Gerald C. Kane, Anh Nguyen Phillips, Jonathan R. Copulsky, and Garth R. Andrus
Description (Amazon): “Digital technologies are disrupting organizations of every size and shape, leaving managers scrambling to find a technology fix that will help their organizations compete. This book offers managers and business leaders a guide for surviving digital disruptions – but it is not a book about technology. It is about the organizational changes required to harness the power of technology. The authors argue that digital disruption is primarily about people and that effective digital transformation involves changes to organizational dynamics and how work gets done. The best way to respond to digital disruption is by changing the company culture to be more agile, risk tolerant, and experimental.”
Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future


 


By: Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson
Description (Amazon): “We live in strange times. A machine plays the strategy game Go better than any human; upstarts like Apple and Google destroy industry stalwarts such as Nokia; ideas from the crowd are repeatedly more innovative than corporate research labs. MIT’s Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson know what it takes to master this digital-powered shift: we must rethink the integration of minds and machines, of products and platforms, and of the core and the crowd. In all three cases, the balance now favors the second element of the pair, with massive implications for how we run our companies and live our lives.”
McAfee will give an advance look at his upcoming new book “More From Less” during his closing keynote at the MIT Sloan CIO Symposium. 
Real Business of IT: How CIOs Create and Communicate Value


 


By: Richard Hunter and George Westerman
Description (Amazon): “If you’re a general manager or CFO, do you feel you’re spending too much on IT or wishing you could get better returns from your IT investments? If so, it’s time to examine what’s behind this IT-as-cost mind-set. Richard Hunter and George Westerman reveal that the cost mind-set stems from IT leaders’ inability to communicate about the business value they create-so CIOs get stuck discussing budgets rather than their contributions to the organization. The authors explain how IT leaders can combat this mind-set by first using information technology to generate three forms of value important to leaders throughout the organization.”
Platform Revolution: How Networked Markets Are Transforming the Economy - and How to Make Them Work for You


 


By: Geoffrey G. Parker, Marshall W. Van Alstyne, and Sangeet Paul Choudary

      Highlights
  
As a partner in the Generation AI initiative, the Human Rights Center at UC Berkeley School of Law spent the Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 semesters researching how artificial intelligence technologies are being used in ways that impact children at home, at school, and at play. After reviewing and identifying the disparate child rights that might be disproportionately impacted, both positively and negatively, by its use, the team drafted a memo exploring the potential impacts AI is having and may have on children. This document summarizes the memo, providing a series of case studies to illustrate the various ways that artificial intelligence-based technologies are beginning to positively and negatively impact children’s rights, and spotlighting critical questions that researchers, corporations, governments, educators and parents should be asking now in order to better promote children’s rights and protect children from negative consequences. We hope that this memo will help a range of stakeholders better understand and begin to lay a framework for addressing the potential impact of artificial intelligence on today’s children and on future generations.

The authoring team of this memorandum are Mélina Cardinal-Bradette, Diana Chavez-Varela, Samapika Dash, Olivia Koshy, Pearlé Nwaezeigwe, Malhar Patel, Elif Sert, and Andrea Trewinnard, who conducted their research and writing under the supervision of Alexa Koenig of the UC Berkeley Human Rights Center.
The authors thank all of members of the Child Rights Working Group for their advice and input, and especially thank Jennie Bernstein for her careful edits and patient guidance throughout the process of researching and drafting this memo.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  The fashion industry has grown at 5.5 percent annually in the past decade, according to the McKinsey Global Fashion Index, and in 2016 was estimated to be worth $2.4 trillion. It has been hounded by challenges, the same report said. Sales growth slowed to at most three percent by the the end of 2016. The report also said that apparel companies have been innovating internally to reshape the industry, such as shortening the fashion cycle Email marketing tools for clothing retailers offer personalized messaging, targeting distinct segments such as regular shoppers or inactive shoppers, as well as those that abandon carts.  Away from the fashion front, robotics have entered the retailers’ factories and warehouses to boost productivity and efficiency. This article will highlight how applications are using AI for the strategies of: Marketing and Purchase Recommendations Market Intelligence and Trend Prediction Robotics in Clothing Production The below applications for retail fashion use a variety of AI technologies — from computer vision to robotics. All still require inputs from the individual shoppers or enterprise operators, whether it is providing personal data, email address, uploading images. Marketing and Purchase Recommendations Affinity One standalone recommendation engine is Affinity, a mobile app that uses machine learning and human user input regarding personal style, fit, body shape and even event attire appropriateness to suggest a variety of looks. To start, users take a survey that asks them to rate fashion items by tapping a heart or an X symbol. The company claims this process teaches the algorithms about the user’s personal style preferences and sends this data to the app’s fashion search and recommendation tool.  Once the user has signed up, she will receive weekly recommendations of curated items that match her style and preferences. Affinity follows an affiliate program business model where users click an item on the Affinity site or app, which brings them directly to the retailer’s site. When a customer makes a purchase, this provides Affinity with a cut of the retailer’s profit. On the IOS mobile app or the website, the company presents a variety of products from athletic wear, shoes, dresses, jeans, bags, jewelry and eyewear. Among the brands available are Stella McCartney, Neiman Marcus, J Crew, Louboutin, Barneys New York and Jimmy Choo. At the moment, the app is not available on Android phones. CEO Abigail Holtz said in an interview:  “We use technology for things like big computations and analyses — uncovering preferences, ranking and scoring algorithms, etc. The biggest issue [with computer vision and machine learning] is quality/accuracy, though it is also the case that building even moderately good models to categorize all our attributes would likely take years and require constant turning and re-training. Over time, we will utilize more and more computer vision and machine learning to replace manual human processes, but we will always prioritize solving problems well above full automation.” Prior to founding Affinity, Holtz was a product manager at Google from 2010. It is not clear however, who is responsible for AI advancements in the company or if Holtz managed AI related projects. From our research, we could not find any case studies relating to this company’s work with retailers. Finery Finery is a wardrobe management application that asks users for their email address and permission to access email receipts of fashion purchases. It then claims to be able to determine what apparel are already in the user’s wardrobe. Using this data, the company claims that its algorithms can suggest looks using the user’s existing pieces, and clothing recommendations that could match the user’s current style. According to the company, the application’s Wishlist feature recommends identifies aspects of a wardrobe that have not been purchased and can recommend items that could complete the user’s wardrobe. The 3-minute video review of the application shows how the user can add items to the Wardrobe and Wishlist. Clicking on a product image gives the user details about the item. The application or site also features some stylists from whom the user might find tips.   Within the company, Oscar Mejia leads the machine learning development. He has a Master of Science degree in computer software engineering from Harvard University. From the site, it is not clear which brands and retailers are clients of Finery. We could find no case studies on this product. Hook Hook is a search engine marketed to consumers which, the company claims, can keep track of global fashion trends, collect customer data points and find similar looking items from multiple retailers.  Developed by Intelligence Node, the application claims to use deep learning algorithms to give retailers the benefit of collecting and analyzing customer data points — specific keywords, online navigation patterns, price points on their shopping cart, actual purchases, and their “likes,” among others — to determine what users are searching for.  In addition, the application is reported to be able to track exact and close matches to their product, potentially giving retailers the opportunity to differentiate themselves, the company claims. According to the website, the application carries items from more than 5,000 brands such as Gap, JC Penny, H&M, Old Navy, TopShop and Nike. On the consumer side, using the mobile app or online website enables them to compare prices, find similar products, receive alerts about sales, and keep track of fashion trends from hundreds of brands. To start, users can upload an image of an outfit they want to search and purchase. The application’s algorithms accesses the online catalogs it carries and comes up with curated recommendations, as shown in the short video below. The video also compares Hook with another recommendation engine called Tailor.   Yasen G. Dimitrov is the Chief Analytics and Chief Data Officer at Intelligence Node for four years. Within the company, he leads the the data science team, responsible for operationalizing the analytics using machine learning. From our research, we could not find any case studies about Hook’s work with any retailers. We also could not find case studies about this specific product on Intelligence Node’s website. Vue.ai Vue.ai, an eCommerce platform developed by Mad Street Den, claims that its AI-driven email marketing solution called VueMail offers email personalization in real time to keep customers engaged after they leave the Vue eCommerce site.  Similarly to the other applications, Vue’s site claims to allow a user to make a preference profile, while also shopping around for different products. When the user abandons a cart, the machine learning algorithm takes note of product details and sends a personalized email which recommends similar products with similar colors, patterns, cuts and styles.  The company claims the algorithms also have the capability to distinguish regular shoppers and sends personalized emails with outfit recommendations. The algorithms choose the recommendations based on products previously purchased by the shopper. Another type of personalized email contains product promotions, aimed at increasing the chances of shoppers’ continued loyalty. According to the website, these emails are sent to inactive customers, and showcase curated recommendations and offers based on their purchase history. The 2-minute video below shows the Vue.ai eCommerce website and explains how machine learning, deep learning and computer vision technologies work together to personalize the content for each site visitor.   According to the video, first-time users are initially shown popular brands or product categories on the homepage. The algorithms take note of the user’s behaviour such as browsing through product categories, including cameras, or brands, like Samsung. The more time a shopper spends on the site, the more data is gathered about their behaviour, which trains the AI technologies better.  In case study, Vue.ai claims that an eCommerce marketplace achieved a 5- to 15-percent increase in revenue after sending VueMail personalized emails to its customers. Another unnamed US apparel eCommerce retailer saw 46-percent increase in click-to-open rate and double the industry average revenue after implementing VueMail. The clients are unnamed, so we advise readers to take the results with some reservation. On top of personalized email, Vue.ai by Mad Street Den also claims to offer solutions for AI-powered catalog tagging, styling and searching and is targeted at catalog managers, merchandisers, and product managers. One solution called VueTag is used to curate items in online catalogs with attributes such as category, gender, color, pattern, dress length, sleeve length and neckline.  To start using VueTag, the user first uploads the images and product descriptions to the application. The application’s computer vision algorithms have been trained to extract visual attributes of the products such as category, gender, color, pattern, sleeve length, necklines, silhouette. They can also tag the image based on textual information. Once the tags have been extracted, the program sends the tags to members of the Vue team for quality assurance. If they find that an image has been inaccurately tagged, it is sent back into the system for retraining. Finally, the tagged images are delivered to the online catalog.  Zilingo is an eCommerce marketplace that brings together fashion brands from Southeast Asia. The company used a suite of Vue.ai applications when it was setting up the website. To help its merchants streamline curation of product descriptions and images, the company says that it used VueTag. This helps the company’s thousands of sellers, who each put up 5,000 to 10,000 products per month.  The client claims that the application has made the process simple for its sellers as it eliminates the need for a human army to type product details manually. The client added that this makes curation not only faster but also more accurate. “Shoppable videos and auto-tagging have made our lives significantly better,” said Zilingo’s CEO Ankiti Bose. The company lists Levis, Macy’s, Diesel and Cosabella as among its clients. Costa Colbert, Chief Science Officer at Mad Street Den, has Master of Science degrees in electrical engineering and computer science; as well as biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University. He also holds a Doctor of Medicine in neuroscience from the University of Virginia.  Market Intelligence and Trend Prediction Stylumia Stylumia is a market intelligence application which the company claims can attempt to predict fashion trends with the help of deep learning and AI technologies. According to the company website, the application is able to take unstructured computer vision, natural language processing, behavior data and converts it to fashion insights. This application is targeted at clothing and apparel manufacturers, brands, retailers or fashion and lifestyle influencers who could potentially use the insights to make informed decisions and insights about future fashion trend.  To use the application or website, a retail client can log in and search colors, products or styles. The company claims that its the application can then collect photos a retailer’s eCommerce sites, text descriptions on social media and customer behavior data to show the client a dashboard of data and visualized graphs centering around a product or style they’ve searched. The company claims it can also use these analytics to offer a future outlook graph visualizations and suggestions of whether a certain fashion trend will be successful. An example of a use case for this application would be at a fashion show. In a blog post on the Stylumia website, the company describes how the application can extract data from major fashion events where 40 designers could present a total of 24,000 outfits for one season.  Stylumia’s blog noted that the application also has the capability to capture images of clothing using a computer vision-enabled lens. While the fashion show is ongoing, the application’s algorithms will start grouping images of similar clothing items by color and shape: animal print dresses, deconstructed kimonos and coats, black-and-red themed clothes, and other similar trends at the event.  According to the company, this data can then be analyzed by fashion show organizers and designers who need to discover the trends and make predictions for the coming season. Another use case described by Founder and CEO Ganesh Subramanian is for text-based keyword search by designers or clothing manufacturer. The user can describe the style they are looking for, for instance “yellow and purple striped shirt.” The application’s natural language processing algorithms will crawl through the web to find images of the item.  The company claims that the machine learning application can recognize trends on social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest, and can be trained for colors and silhouettes. It will also search for the correct items even though the keywords are spelled incorrectly. The application’s computer vision technology can distinguish the right color of items, having been trained in in the exact attributes and color values of the RGB (red, green, blue) system. Subramanian also claims that the algorithms can crawl through videos, determine the color of garments through optic mapping using deep learning neural network, and extract a color histogram of the garments in the video. In a case study, an unnamed client wanted to design a T-shirt collection at the beginning of 2017, using designs launched in past two months by local and international brands as inspiration. The client specified the top 10 percent best-selling designs and Stylumia returned with designs ranked according to popularity. The designs included camouflage print, contrast-colored pockets, round neck raglan and horizontal stripes. The designer then combined these trends, and received approval from the business team to produce a certain quantity after seeing the rankings provided by the application. The case study claims that the shirts sold out within three weeks at five marketplaces by the end of the season. The company claims that has 40 clients including Aeropostale, Myntra, Wrogn, Fastrack, W, Biba, Global Desi and Puma. At present, none of the company’s executives have deep AI expertise. Abhishek Thakur, Chief Data Scientist at boost.ai, serves as AI advisor to Stylumia. He holds a Master’s degree in computer science from the University of Bonn. Robotics in Clothing Production Grabit Grabit claims its robot called Stackit is an automation system that uses robotics, machine learning, computer vision and algorithms to automate shoe production. The company says that the robot’s machine learning algorithms are capable of layering items 20 times faster than humans.  Its hands are fitted with an electroadhesive gripper that produces static electricity that can handle materials such as leather; meshes and composite fibers; and other materials thinner than one milimeter. It can also handle boxes that weigh up to 50 kg. Stackit is designed to work with factory employees. The computer vision algorithms determine how the materials should be stacked, and lights up portions of a connected glass table where the factory employee should set products down. The robot’s electroadhesive platform picks up the materials, while computer vision-equipped cameras monitor the progress. The machine can also move over to a partially finished shoe shoe and drop it into a heat press.  The short video below demonstrates how Stackit can handle various types of materials from metal to fabric, glass and printed circuit boards, among others. The robot’s gripper uses electroadhesion technology, which is adhesion of two surfaces when they are subjected to static electricity.  The company has raised $25 million in funding, with Nike among its investors. The company has no official case study, but a news report claims that assembling a pair of Nike shoes involves stacking up to 40 pieces of material to create the shoe upper, a process that takes a human worker up to 20 minutes to arrange. Using Stackit, the report claims this process will take 20 times faster, at a rate of 50 seconds per shoe upper or 300 to 600 pairs of Nike uppers in eight hours, machine learning. At this pace, the report claims that Nike will receive its return on investment in two years. Aside from shoes, the company website claims that the robot can also be applied in manufacturing processes of apparel, automotive and aerospace. A Nike press release reports that Grabit’s current customers include some Fortune 500 companies in industries such as warehouse automation, parcel handling, consumer products, and textiles. Current investors include Formation 8, Draper Nexus, Danhua Capital, Nike, Samsung, Brother Industries, ABB, Shanghai Electric, Flex, NTT Docomo and the Esquel Group Harsha Prahlad, is the Co-Founder and Chief Technology and Products Officer at Grabit. He previously led the Advanced Components Group at SRI International and invented Artificial Muscle, Inc., acquired by Bayer Material Science. He received his Ph.D. and M.S. in aerospace engineering from the University of Maryland, and his B.S. in mechanical engineering from National Institute of Technology in Trichy, India. SewBots SewBots by SoftWear Automation is a computer vision-powered robot that sews footwear, t-shirts, pillows, bath mats, automotive mats and towels, according to the company. The company website explains that the robots are designed to stabilize and sew cloth and other materials by “mapping” the surface of the material as it sews. Sewbot’s computer vision algorithms detect distortions in the fabric and adjusts it robotically. The computer vision also guides the robot in cutting, sewing a seam, adding a sleeve, and inspecting the quality of items across a 70-foot long t-shirt production line. The sewing process move the needle rather than the fabric moving through a stationary sewing machine. The robot’s machine vision system is capable of tracking exact needle placement to within half a millimeter of accuracy, the company claims. Its image processing algorithm-driven camera can capture more than 1,000 frames per second to view each thread, the CEO added. The Atlanta-based machine vision and robotics startup spun out of Georgia Tech after seven years of research and development working on projects with DARPA and the Walmart Foundation. CEO Palaniswamy Rajan describes the robot’s sewing process like that of a human seamstress,  “The first thing they do is use their eyes, and based on their eyes, they do micro and macro manipulations of the fabric with their fingers and hands and elbows and feet. So a robot replicates all of those functions.”  The video below has former CEO KP Reddy explains how the robot sew a buttonhole using computer vision cameras at the top and bottom of the fabric:  At the moment, Sewbots are limited to mass-producing simple pieces that require limited sewing skill such hemming and binding. According to the website, the machines are able to produce one T-shirt in 22 seconds. The footwear upper workline can produce one sewn upper in 26 seconds. One client is Tianyuan Garments Company, of Suzhou, China, which mass produces shirts for Adidas worldwide. The company also counts among its clients Avery Dennison: A company which offers pressure-sensitive, functional materials; branding; weaving and labelling solutions for the retail apparel market. CTO Barrett Clark oversaw the development and deployment of Sewbot. He obtained his Master’s degree in mechanical engineering from the Ohio State University. Concluding Thoughts From our research, we are seeing that many marquis fashion retailers have given payments, such as a cut of purchase, in order to have their products featured and sold on eCommerce sites with recommendation engines. This seems to be the case when looking into applications like Hook and Finery. Through other research, we have also seen that many retailers have brought third-party built recommendation engines exclusively to their own websites. We are also seeing a growth in robotic design and design trend prediction applications, which may correlate with how marquis companies like Amazon and Facebook are both experimenting with AI technology to design clothes.While IBM has also partnered with Tommy Hilfiger and the Fashion Institute of Technology, Google presented its line of clothing via Project Muze.  However, it may take a while for design work to leave the human hands and passed to robots, according to the MIT Technology Review, as humans still have the stronger edge when it comes to innovation. With robotic applications noted on this list, we’ve similarly seen that the robots detect and manage simple needed tasks, while still requiring humans to handle complex design strategies.   Header image credit: Pixabay Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at UBS - Current Applications and InitiativesUBS is a Swiss multinational investment banking and financial services company ranked 30th on S&P… Stock Brokerage Firms and Artificial Intelligence - Current ApplicationsThis article aims to explore the current state of artificial intelligence applications in stock brokerage… Artificial Intelligence for Credit Card Companies - Current ApplicationsCredit card companies could make use of AI applications across multiple business areas.

He previously worked for Frost & Sullivan and Infiniti Research. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Businesses today around the world have some portion of their operations being automated, which concurrently has meant that a lot of data about these processes is being collected (from sensors or internal company data etc). A combination of AI, big data analytics, and data science techniques seem to be a growing trend in many industry sectors, with predictive analytics being one of the most well-known. According to a definition from SAS, predictive analytics uses statistical analysis and machine learning to predict the probability of a certain event occurring in the future for a set of historical data points. Businesses today seem to have a multitude of product offerings to choose from predictive analytics vendors in every industry, which can help businesses leverage their historical data store by discovering complex correlations in the data, identifying unknown patterns, and forecasting. This is hardly surprising considering the fact that predictive analytics can help businesses answer questions such as “Are customers likely to buy my product?” Or even “Which marketing strategies might be most successful?”   We highlight some use cases from the following industry segments with the aim of painting a possibility space for what predictive analytics can really do for business: Finance Healthcare Heavy Industry Transportation Consumer Goods Below are five brief use cases for predictive analytics applications across five industry sectors. Each provides a fraction of a glimpse as to how AI technologies are being used today and which are being created and piloted as potential predictive analytics standards in these industries. Applications of Predictive Analytics in Different Industries Finance Rapidminer Boston-based Rapidminer was founded in 2007 and builds software platforms for data science teams within enterprises that can assist in data cleaning/preparation, ML, and predictive analytics for finance. The 102-employee company provides predictive analytics services such as churn prevention, demand forecasting, and fraud detection, and they recently worked alongside PayPal. They claim that their predictive analytics software might help businesses with: Predicting the impacts of customer engagement for a particular direct marketing promotion in a retail environment using historical promotional engagement data such as customer information, their location, their responses to a promotional campaign or how actively they have been engaging with websites or apps Identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions for banks by monitoring of customer transactions and flagging transactions which deviate from a standard customer behavior, identified for each customer of the bank from data such as transaction history and the geographical locations of those transactions RapidMiner claims that they can help businesses achieve the above results by leveraging the client’s historical enterprise data. For example, In predicting the impacts of customer engagement for a retail firm, RapidMiner would first have to work with the retailers marketing team to gather all historical promotional and transactional data, including any marketing flyers, in-shop promotions, and purchase histories for a particular product.  The data is then cleaned in order to mold it into a structure that can be plugged into the machine learning algorithms. Those algorithms then perform statistical operations such as regression, classification, and frequent item-set mining aimed at identifying patterns in the historical data. These patterns can allow for determining the effect of perhaps promoting hamburger buns over hot dog buns for a particular week. The system then derives actionable insights by working with a retailer’s marketing and IT teams in order to suggest the potential best practices for new promotional campaigns. The marketing team can then create a dashboard based on these and other insights that provides them metrics and analytics related to decisions such as choosing which products to market in the coming week or to whom they should market based on past history. RapidMiner claims their software can learn more such patterns over time, improving the accuracy of its predictions.  Below is a 3-minute video from Rapidminer giving a brief demonstration of how their predictive analytics software can help businesses:  PayPal collaborated with Rapidminer to gauge the intentions of top customers and monitor their complaints. According to a case study from Rapidminer, Han-Sheong Lai, Director of Operational Excellence and Customer Advocacy, and Jiri Medlen, Senior Text Analytics Specialist at PayPal, wanted to gain a better understanding of what drives product experience improvement. They needed to analyze customer feedback in order to do this successfully.  The challenge for PayPal lay in the sheer number of customer comments they had to analyze. Rapidminer worked along with AI and data science engineers at PayPal to develop a system that could perform sentiment analysis for customer comments in over 150,000 text-based forms in several different languages including 50,000 tweets and facebook posts.  The RapidMiner platform was first used to extract the list of the most frequently mentioned words in every customer complaint from the dataset shared by PayPal. RapidMiner then worked alongside a team of software engineers from PayPal to identify the top two password and PayPal login access-related issues from the list, along with actionable insights on possible resolutions to the issues.  According to the case study, Paypal learned the login issues seemed to spike during November and December (holiday season) when users were more actively making purchases and instances of forgotten passwords were high.  RapidMiner claims they were then able to work with PayPal engineers to design fixes for the login issues. 2 or 3 weeks after integrating RapidMiner into their system, PayPal customers succeeding in recovering their passwords 50% more often than before the integration. After 2 to 3 months working with the software, PayPal was reportedly able to classify customers as “top promoters” and “top detractors”. This enabled them to arrive at the top complaint areas (customer login issues). Founder and President of RapidMiner Ingo Mierswa earned a PhD in Data Mining from the Technical University of Dortmund. For a deeper understanding of the possibilities for AI in finance, read our comprehensive overview of the sector. Healthcare Health Catalyst Health Catalyst in Salt Lake City was founded in 2008 and has around 565 employees today. The company claims to provide predictive analytics services specifically for the healthcare domain through their offerings Catalyst.ai and Healthcare.ai. The company claims they have been involved in several successful collaborations with hospitals and other healthcare companies in projects such as: Preventing hospital-acquired infections by predicting the likelihood of patients susceptible to central-line associated bloodstream infections Using machine learning to predict the likelihood that patients will develop a chronic disease Assessing the risk of a patient not showing up for a scheduled appointment using predictive models For example, a hospital might use the Health Catalyst software to predict which of it’s patients is most likely to develop a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) so that healthcare professionals can act much faster in such cases.  The hospitals historical Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data, along with Health Catalyst’s internal data warehouse records on historical CLABSI cases, can be utilized to gain insights on patterns that might lead to a higher likelihood of infection. A team from Health Catalyst might work alongside hospital staff to gather patient data and, using machine learning algorithms, coax out a CLABSI risk prediction model that is built into a dashboard. The nursing staff might use the dashboard to identify gaps in patient care that might lead to an infection for each patient. The 2-minute video below from Health Catalyst gives an overview of some of the applications for their predictive analytics software:   Health Catalyst Analytics reportedly assisted Texas Children’s Hospital in predicting the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes,  to allow care team members to intervene in time before patients suffered a severe episode. According to the case study, Health Catalyst used data from a risk index for children with poor glycemic control who were recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes to predict the risk of a DKA episode for each patient. This allowed caregivers to monitor high-risk patients more closely. Health Catalyst claims their software lead to an eventual 30.9% relative reduction in recurrent DKA admissions per fiscal year, although how much of this was solely due to the analytics and how much might have been due to other healthcare measures taken by patients was unclear at the time of writing. Health Catalyst claims to have worked in projects with customers such as Orlando Health in Florida, Piedmont Hospital in Georgia, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), Virginia Piper Cancer Institute among others.  Aaron Neiderhiser the Senior Director of Product and Data Scientist at Health Catalyst has earned an MA in Economics from the University of Colorado Denver and previously served as a Statistical Analyst with Colorado Department of Healthcare Policy and Financing.

Heavy Industry Rockwell Automation Rockwell Automation, one of the largest automation players today, offers the Pavilion8 MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL (MPC), which the company claims can analyze historical operational data from industrial manufacturing sectors, such as oil and gas or food and beverage, and predict future values for that operational data.  When compared with desired predefined targets for that data, Rockwell Automation claims their software can help these manufacturers automatically schedule the most optimized points in time to supervise a specific project.  For example, in their offering tailored to the oil and gas industry, Rockwell Automation claims their MPC software can help in maximizing the efficiency and stability of the natural gas liquid (NGL) fractionation process. The challenge in NGL fractionation lies in optimizing the composition of the various components in order to achieve specific quality.  An oil and gas company might use the Pavillion8 MPC software to help its maintenance engineers stay ahead of maintenance issues and improve the process efficiency in the plants. A team from Rockwell would first work with domain experts and IT personnel from the oil and gas firm to gather historical data from any existing sensors in the refineries.  The software has a browser-based user interface which can be used by the oil and gas company’s maintenance managers to monitor key plant variables, such as capacity utilization, and predict the most optimal composition control parameters for the process in terms of end-product stability and process efficiency.  Most industrial plants with any kind of automation in their processes have numerous sensors which collect data about pressures, temperatures, levels of vibration in machines, and so on. The MPC uses this historical data and real-time data from these sensors to find anomalies in plant variables by comparing them to data patterns during normal operating conditions. The software then prompts the maintenance managers with reports on the anomalies along with a possible recommendation on what might have caused the issue and suggest replacement parts when required.  The 3-minute video from Rockwell Automation goes into more detail about their Pavilion8 MPC offering, specifically tailored for improving NFL fractionation efficiency:  Rockwell claims that their software can help oil and gas companies engaged in NGL fractionation to separate the NGL liquids into component streams of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane, pentane, and heavier chemicals in the following ways:  Increasing process stability and reducing variation in quality of the end product  Increasing the yield of NGL components by an avg. of 1 – 3%  Reducing the reboil energy consumption by an avg. of 5 – 10%  Increasing production capacity by an avg. of 3 – 5%  However, we could find no robust case studies or projects with marquee oil and gas companies on Rockwell’s website for their Pavilion8 MPC software, although Rockwell is one of the largest automation products and services providers in the world. We were also unable to find the data science professionals involved in the development of the MPC software in Rockwell.  Consumer Goods Presidion (Formerly SPSS Ireland) Set up as a regional office for SPSS in Ireland, Dublin-based Presidion now offers predictive analytics software for the retail industry in applications such as improving customer engagement, optimization pricing, inventory management and fraud detection to name a few. Presidion’s Customer Analytics Solutions offering seems to be aimed at helping enterprises target the right audience and identify customer issues by uncovering patterns of buying behavior from historical data. For example, Presidion claims to have worked with Belgium’s second largest insurance provider, Corona Direct, to improve long-term customer profitability. The case study describes the following: To improve profitability, Corona Direct needed their customer acquisition campaigns to be effective enough for the first-year revenues generated from new insurance policies to cover the cost of the acquisition campaign. Corona Direct input historical customer acquisition data, such as that from promotional campaigns, into Presidion’s IBM SPSS software. Presidion claims their software helped Corona Direct’s marketers to efficiently create, optimize, and execute their outbound marketing campaigns by churning out a predictive analytics dashboard.   The dashboard helped the marketing team at Corona identify customer groups that were more likely to respond to a particular campaign and to predict the most balanced growth targets for optimal profit margins.  Presidion claims that Corona was able to reduce campaign costs and improve long-term customer profitability and eventually the cost of the implementation was covered by new insurance policies taken out within six months after the integration.  Presidion also claims to have worked with O’Brien’s Sandwich Bar in Ireland to assist with customer satisfaction, product development, and product marketing. O’Brien’s needed a way to track their customer feedback (which was being done through comment cards) more efficiently and to digitize the process. This led them to adopting Presidion’s predictive analytics platform. The system was set up so that information from the comment cards was directly entered into Presidion’s SPSS-IBM Statistics and SPSS-IBM Text Analysis for Surveys. Presidion claims this change aided O’Brien’s in leveraging predictive analytics to ensure a fast turnaround time in identifying and resolving customer issues. The way they claim to have done this is described below: Each of their stores received a monthly report on their performance detailing the top issues that customers faced during that month. The information received from the comment cards was also used to inform the development of new products and campaigns. Presidion claims to have worked in projects with companies such as Daimler, HONDA, and banks like Bancolombia and Rabobank, among others. However, we could not find any evidence of previous AI-related experience in Presidion’s leadership team.  Transportation Dataiku Dataiku is headquartered in New York and offers Dataiku DSS (Data Science Studio), which the company claims can be used effectively in many applications for air freight, sea freight, road freight, and passenger transport. According to Dataiku, their DSS software can aid in some of the following applications: Predictive Maintenance: Using vehicle sensor data (for cars or trucks), DSS can potentially help customers develop a predictive analytics solution, which can take this raw data and cleanse, format, and model it to predict which components might fail or not perform as required.  Dynamic Pricing: Using Dataiku DSS predictive analytics, transportation businesses might be able to optimize the end-product costs based on real-time changes in operating factors such as fuel costs, security-related delays in shipments, and external factors, such as weather.  Dataiku’s software might help supply chain managers for a truck-based transportation company reduce the downtime that results when trucks break down. Dataiku’s DSS is used to create a data pipeline of both historical and ongoing maintenance data and the data from the electronic control unit (ECU) inside the trucks.  The software then parses the data automatically using machine learning techniques to identify patterns which lead to the failure of a particular part on the truck, such as when a defective or poor quality spare part is installed in the truth and leads to an engine failure during a delivery in rough terrain. DSS then provides insights that transportation maintenance managers can use to proactively order the right kind of spare parts for a particular issue in case of a failure. For example, Dataiku worked alongside French company Chronopost, a member of the La Poste group, which provides express delivery services. Chronopost’s differentiation strategy revolved around ensuring the delivery of all parcels before 1 PM the next day, and with increasing scale, especially during holidays or festivals. The company needed a way to ensure that their delivery promise was met even during peak hours. According to the case study, Chronopost used historical internal delivery data and retrieval data (such as shipping data for each geography) to create a predictive model that continuously optimizes production costs and delivery times.  Chronopost claims they were able to ensure delivery of all parcels, even during peak post-traffic, after integrating Dataiku’s predictive analytics software. However, the study did not go into further detail. The 14-minute video below from Dataiku explains how to use Dataiku’s DSS software:  Louis-Philippe Kronek the VP of Data Science at Dataiku earned a PhD in Operations Research from the Grenoble Institute of Technology, and the company claims to have worked in projects with companies such as Kuka, FOX Networks group, GE, Unilever, BNP Paribas among others.

Concluding Thoughts Near-Term Impact Predictive analytics is being applied to many existing and new use cases across industries, especially in the healthcare, marketing, and finance domains. In the manufacturing sector, predictive analytics also seems to be leading more industries to adopt predictive maintenance best practices. Takeaways for Business Leaders Predictive analytics requires the use of historical data which has to be cleaned and parsed before any analytics algorithms can be used to analyze the data.  Predictive analytics also requires a great deal of domain expertise for the end results to be within reasonable accuracy levels and this would involve enterprise employees working alongside AI vendors or consultants. A typical collaboration for an AI predictive analytics project might last around 2-3 months. Prediction results would incrementally become more accurate over time after the integration is complete.   Header image credit: metering.com Related Posts Predictive Analytics in Insurance - An Overview of Current ApplicationsThe insurance industry is making use of various artificial intelligence applications to solve business problems,… Predictive Analytics in Pharma - Current ApplicationsIt may feel as though AI applications like machine vision and natural language processing hold… Predictive Analytics in the Military - Current ApplicationsThe military has always been at the forefront of advanced technology.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Episode summary: Unlike the field of self-driving cars, the fields of construction, mining, agriculture, and other classes of “heavy industry” involve a huge variety of equipment and use-cases that go beyond traveling from A to B. The heavy industry leaders of today are no farther behind automakers in their understanding that AI and automation will be essential for the future of their companies. In this episode, guest Dr. Sam Kherat discusses the applications of AI in heavy industry, including: What type of capabilities and functions are automate-able, and at what level. He also shines a light on how AI might affect the future of the industry within the next 2-3 years, and in what ways we can expect large equipment to become more autonomous.  We’d like to thank RE-WORK for introducing us to Dr. Kherat at their autonomous vehicles conference in San Francisco.

Big Idea: Autonomous equipment in heavy industry may be widely adopted well before most consumer vehicles are self-driving. Emerj founder Dan Faggella interviewing Dr. Sam Kherat at the RE•WORK Autonomous Vehicles Conference The key application for AI in heavy industry is related to how vehicles can perceive their surroundings and each other. For the time being vehicle automation within heavy industry is limited to the use of GPS and a fusion of sensors such as RADAR and LiDAR. Full automation is only currently in place for heavy vehicles that have to make repetitive maneuvers, such as hauling ore. However, in the future this is set to change and it may happen sooner in the heavy industry space than in the arena of autonomous personal vehicles, for a number of reasons: First, while there is an erie strangeness to sitting in a compact car that drives itself down the highway, there is absolutely nothing strange or unusual about automating heavy machinery work. Manufacturing, mining, and agriculture have always eagerly automated tasks whenever possible, and there is little resistance to doing so now with the advent of AI. We’ve covered a number of applications of machine learning in robotics in previous articles, it’s worth noting that as industrial robots gain dexterity, their heavy equipment counterparts are likely to gain autonomy. Second, the operation of heavy equipment requires specific, valuable skills (the operation of a crane or of an industrial earth-moving vehicle is not something taught in a weekend seminar). Some of these skills are hard to come by, and expensive. Corporations eager to get more work done at less cost are benefitted financially by automation – much more so that an individual person would be financially benefitted by having an autonomous car of their own. Third, while the self-driving car field may be seen to have a safety “barrier” preventing adoption, the heavy industry world could be seen to have a safety “imperative.” Commercial vehicles on the highway must constantly handle interactions with other cars, pedestrians, crossing guards, signs, lights and more. For the most part, heavy equipment operates on private property (such as mines, construction sites, factories) that doesn’t require the same number of dangerous and unpredictable interactions. Similarly, heavy industry work such as mining is inherently dangerous, and autonomous systems would likely save lives. These advances are bound to have a knock-effect in many industries including mining where automation will increase speed and safety, the factory where it will make moving products more efficient and in warehousing to facilitate storing and locating inventory. Bringing Insight to Action: In order for us to see more rapid advances with AI in the heavy industry changes may need to be made in the way companies conduct their research and development. While currently, independent companies are using the same hardware and repeating the same tests, the development of a centralized data bank could save everyone time and money. It would mean that companies can dip into the consortium of information and use it to create algorithms to suit their individual applications (Dr. Kherat goes into detail on such a common data bank in the full interview audio, embedded above). There will be much more creative freedom for autonomous developments in heavy industry as compared to commercial self-driving cars. Businesses involved in manufacturing, construction, agriculture, or other heavy industries may be benefitted by looking at the autonomous innovations of industry leaders in their sector – and better understanding how equipment autonomy (and it’s resulting efficiencies) may impact their operations and finances. Interview Highlights from “AI in Heavy Industry” with Dr. Sam Kherat: The following is a condensed version of the full audio interview, which is available in the above links on Emerj’s SoundCloud and iTunes. (4.28) What are the aspects of machine learning and AI in heavy industry that are starting to drive business value? Sam Kherat: In the heavy industry business…we have mobility, that’s the power train, the chassis, what drives the machine. The second component is the controls, which play a huge role in the stability of the machine, and making it go from point A to point B in a safe manner. The third component is tools. You have to have some way to quickly interchange your tools to continue doing the job. The fourth component is really behind in terms of development, and that it perception. That’s the ability of a machine to sense its surroundings…such as infrastructure.  That’s what created this need to have some autonomous operations for the military because you want to be able to sense the distance and to sense when you have an intrusion coming in front of you and to be able to adequately swerve that. We’ve seen tremendous improvements in sensing technologies, whether it’s light-based like LiDAR also some improvements in RADAR systems. These systems complement each other…fusing has become a trend to enable a better sensing of the surroundings (for readers with a keen interest with sensor technology may want to listen to our machine vision interview with Cortica CEO Igal Raichelgauz). (11.04) With an excavator or in a factory setting with some fork lift truck action…where do we see perception beginning to emerge meaningfully? Sam Kherat: The industry is evolving so fast it’s amazing that just about a decade ago when you had a job, for example a construction site…where a foreman guides a machine operator, whether it’s a grader or a tractor, with some stakes that they dump on the ground so that the operator can see where to grade. Currently we have an automated system using GPS where the antennae are on eh blade itself and the whole thing is automated. (12.18) So the machine can drive itself over there, know where it’s inserting the scoop and can pick the stuff up and know where to put it. Is this what’s happening? Sam Kherat: Based up on a plan. Say you have a plan from somebody who wants to build a golf course…so the blade knows exactly where and how deep it needs to go to start pushing the dirt…The motion of the vehicle is controlled by the operator, but the operator has no control over its blade…Now with the future technologies that are being implemented we’ll see more automation. The machine is going to be able to perform all these tasks on its own and that is going to happen before we have autonomous vehicles. (13.33) Yes, because we don’t have as many crashing into each other..? You own your own construction site; you own your mine, so you can do what you want. Plus the social acceptance, When you really ask kids what they want to be when they grow up, how many tell you I want to be a miner, I want to be a construction worker? They would really rather do something else. It’s really not something that is appealing to a lot of high school students. So we want to take advantage of some of the skills that kids are growing up with, for example playing video games…give them a remote control and then the machine is away and they will do a good job. (14.48) So we’re talking about in the future of AI in heavy industry and agriculture, because I’m sure that agriculture is big in heavy industry as well, to the best of my knowledge there are probably tractors that can drive perfect back and forth harvesting of a certain grain by itself, no people in it based on GPS. You’re talking about excavators doing something similar. The level of the blade and the adjustment of how earth is being moved is being done by a computer and sensors and a person is just controlling movement. Eventually the movement will be automated. And I’ve heard of dump trucks that have GPS and at the push of a button they can just perfectly align with where they have to be. Is this true? Sam Kherat: Yes but it’s not just GPS, there has to be some sensing device on the machine itself because GPS gives you your location but you need some coordination. You mentioned the loading, so when you have a loader, putting whatever it is you need to put on a dump truck…then you have this coordination between the machines so they don’t bump into each other. (16.19) I’d like to talk about these other kinds of sensors as well. Sam Kherat: We’re really still at the infancy stage. We do have warning systems, just like you would have advanced cruise control on a car that slows down. We have an ability to tell the operator, “listen, you’re getting too close.” But there is no action. It’s not completely automated. The automation happens on the hauling systems where the truck goes from point A to point B. But it’s coming very quickly. The industry is actually an early adopter of these technologies… The haulage system now is completely autonomous, in the mine. Those big trucks hauling ore are completely autonomous, so they brake, they accelerate; they do the whole thing by themselves. Future work includes coordination with our machinery. (21.42) When perception really kicks in….where will that really hit the ground running? I think the issue is very similar to the on-road applications where perception is a stage of a threshold where we have a particular development that is being done by each company. And that is something that needs to be addressed, in order for us to have a better perception system. When you look at the perception systems we have, you can actually number the suppliers in that space because they are not really very many, so most of the companies, whether it’s on-road or off-road, use the exact same hardware. When any company is looking at using a particular sensor…they go through certain tests because they have to really make sure it does what it does. The problem, I see, is that everybody is doing exactly the same tests, so we’re really doing some redundant stuff just because we have this competitive mode. So now we spend a lot of money doing the exact same thing, plus we need to have the data that we have recorded and put that in the algorithm to make it work in the applications we’re using. So why don’t we think about having a center where everybody has a common understanding of what a piece of hardware can do for the entire industry?
